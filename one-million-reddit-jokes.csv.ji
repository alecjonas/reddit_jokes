Another officer asked, “Who will be the enemy?”

The general replied, “All indications point to China.”

Everyone in the audience was shocked. A third officer remarked, “General, we are a nation of only 150 million, compared to the 1.5 billion Chinese. Can we win at all, or even survive?”

The general answered, “Just think about this for a moment.  In modern warfare, it is not the number of soldiers that matters, but the quality of an army’s capabilities. For example, in the Middle East, there have been a few recent wars where 5 million Jews fought against 150 million Arabs, and Israel was always victorious.”

The big day finally came, and he was parachuted to the outskirts of Moscow at night. He emerged by daybreak, and hopped onto a bus going to the city center.

""Comrade. How much for a ticket to Red square?"", he asked the conductor in authentic Russian.

""5 Rubles, Comrade American"", came the reply.

Keats was stunned. Perhaps the conductor was just being a smart-ass. He hopped off the bus and asked a passerby for directions to the closest bar.

""It's just around the block, Comrade American.""

Keats' doubts grew immensely. Not knowing what to do, he went inside the bar and ordered a glass of Vodka.

""Want some Borscht to go with it, Comrade American?"", the bartender asked.

He was really good at his job and was constantly praised for the great work he produced. 

However after a month or so, John found that a number of his work was being duplicated and mailed to almost all of his customers. Worse of all, instead of a proper note commenting on the color pigment properties, these duplicated products were accompanied with rather bad puns and jokes. One repeating joke which irritated him the most was: 'What do you call a country with only pink cars? A pink car-nation.'

Upset, he went to his manager to complain about the problem. After listening to John, his manager said, ""Oh boy, looks like I need to talk to the manager of the 'Red Pigment' department again. This is not the first time that it has happened. Those Red-editors in that department love to copy and repost other people's original work as their own.""

Jack is not normally a drinker, but the drinks didn't taste like alcohol at all. He didn't even remember how he got home from the party. As bad as he was feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong.

Jack had to force himself to open his eyes and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table. And, next to them, a single red rose! Jack sits up and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. He looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotlessly clean. So is the rest of the house. He takes the aspirins, cringes when he sees a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror. Then he notices a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in Lipstick:

""Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to get groceries to make you your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling! Love, Jillian""

He stumbles to the kitchen and sure enough, there is hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper. His son is also at the table, eating. Jack asks, ""Son... What happened last night?""

""Well, you came home after 3 A.M., drunk and out of your mind. You fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door.

Confused, he asked his son, ""So, why is everything in such perfect order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??""

His son replies, ""Oh THAT! Mom dragged you to the bedroom, and when she tried to take your pants off, you screamed, ""Leave me alone, I'm married!!""

Pulling into Austin, they saw a beautiful girl about to jump off Pennybaker bridge. Mad-Dog, their leader, gave the hand signal to pull up. Mad-dog, a big burly man with skin like leather, a handle bar mustache, and a bad attitude decides to go out and check on the gal. He calmly gets off his Harley, walks through a group of onlookers, past the State Trooper who was trying to talk her down off the railing from his patrol car’s PA system. He speaks calmly as he slowly approaches her. ""Hey Baby.....whatcha doin' up there on that railin'?""

She says tearfully, ""I'm going to drown myself- end it right NOW!!""

While he didn't want to appear ""sensitive"" in front of such a large audience, Mad-Dog also didn't want to miss this opportunity to be a hero either. So, he thought for a minute and came up with a plan. “Listen sweetheart- I’d hate to have you jump never having been kissed the way a woman should be kissed. How about, before you jump, you give ol’ Mad-Dog here your best last kiss?"" 

Now Mad-Dog never expected she would do such a thing- he was just hoping he could get close enough to pull her back over the railing. But, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that. It was a long, deep, lingering
kiss followed immediately by another even better one. The kisses became more passionate and frantic. Soon they were pawing at each other’s backsides, pulling each other’s hair and shoving their tongues down each other’s throats.

After they breathlessly finished, Mad-Dog realizes that there is thunderous applause and cheers from his riding buddies and the onlookers. He even was getting the thumbs up signal from the Trooper!

“Wow! That was the best kiss Ol’ Mad-Dog has have ever had, baby girl ! That's a real talent you're wasting. Hell- I think I’m love with you!  Why are you committing suicide with that sort of passion in you?""

Two deaf people get married and during the first week of marriage, they find that they are unable to communicate in the bedroom with the lights out since they can't see each other signing, or read lips. 

After several nights of fumbling around and many misunderstandings, the wife figures out a solution. She writes a note to her husband: 'Honey, Why don't we agree on some simple signals? For instance, at night, if you want to have sex with me, reach over and squeeze my left breast one time. If you don't want to have sex, reach over and squeeze my right breast two times. 

The husband thinks this is a great idea. He writes back to his wife That if she wants to have sex with him, reach over and pull on his penis one time. If she doesn't want to have sex, pull on his penis two hundred and fifty times.

He was an adonis; handsome, tall, muscular, tanned and packing a throbbing 12 inch long baby arm between his legs. He was the best at what he did and he always had dozens of clients wanting to use his services. 

One day he's contacted by an old lady, and by old I mean decrepit. A lady who looked more dead than alive. Wrinkle filled body, loose breasts, white hair, shivering limbs, you name it. The old lady asked the Gigolo for a rough fuck, a hair pulling, ass slapping, pelvis shattering fuck. At first the Gigolo declined, he was truly worried that his big penis would end breaking her frail body and he didn't wanted to kill her by accident. The old lady laughed at that and started offering more and more money, until she reached the fifty thousand dollar's mark and at that point the gigolo simply couldn't refuse it, he had fucked worse by less after all.

So, the time comes, the two are naked and ready. The gigolo slaps a lot of lube just in case and starts pushing in. Her interior is extremely tight and rough and having sex is extremely painful, for him. After an hour of insufferable sex where he could only get the tip inside he ends rejecting her offer and saying that it's impossible, to which she replies by quadruplicating the offer. With a sigh the gigolo accepts to meet her the next day to try again.

The following times the same happens. No matter how much lube he uses or how hard he pushes he can't have anything but the tip inside and her pussy is so rough that he even ends with the tip of his mushroom completely lacerated and covered in small bleeding wounds.

Tired of such unpleasant experiences he gives her an ultimatum. ""Lady, I won't do this anymore, no matter how much you pay me.""

So the old hag smiles at him and replies. ""I have a feeling that the next time will be the good one, will you try one last time for a million dollars?""

And again, with a sigh he accepts.

The final day comes and the old lady is wearing her sexiest lingerie and eagerly waiting for him. Surprisingly enough it all goes well and his cock manages to enter completely inside of her with no friction at all, sliding as if she were the wettest woman in the world. Wanting to truly earn that million dollars he fucks her as she wished and spent a couple of hours drilling her snatch as roughest as he could.

After her fourth orgasm the old lady asked him to stop and she fell on the bed, barely alive but completely happy. The gigolo also lied on the bed to catch his breath and finally asked her.

""How is that the other times I couldn't even start and now it all went so well?""

""Oh dearie, the other days it was all crust but now, its all pus!""

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it.
She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ""No, this is my first time.""
So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.
""Just a minute."" she said, and walked to the door, and locked it.
Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ""Do these excite you?"" she asked.
Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was shake my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on.
As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her knickers and sat down at a desk. ""Well, come on,"" she said, ""we don't have much time.""
So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOW. I was done within a few minutes.
She looked at me with a bit of a frown, ""Did you put that condom on?"" she asked.
I said, ""I sure did."" and held up my thumb to show her. She passed out.",First time with a condom...,13

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it was noted there was a lack of paint on the bird's beaks and claws suggesting that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.

The RCMP then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. 

They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike""",Dead crows on the highway,69

A member of the crew said they were practicing for their trip to the moon. The old man got really excited and asked if he could send a message to the moon with the astronauts.

Recognizing a promotional opportunity for the spin\-doctors, the NASA folks found a tape recorder.

After the old man recorded his message, they asked the son to translate. He refused. So the NASA reps brought the tape to the reservation, where the rest of the tribe listened and laughed, but refused to translate the elder's message to the moon.

Finally, NASA called in an official government translator. He reported that the moon message said: ""Watch out for these guys; they've come to steal your land.""","When NASA was preparing for the Apollo project,",313

I had a friend in college, my freshman roommate, who was always talking about his family. His name was Robert Gooding, and he must’ve had a family tree that started from Adam and Eve. Every single day he would drone on and on about some cousin or uncle or some such. He would always burst into the room saying things like, “Hey Mike! You’ll never guess Uncle Nate and Aunt Ridley are doing in Taiwan for the orphans this week!” I remember him talking about how Dimitri, his mother’s grandfather’s nephew’s son, which is apparently what second cousin once removed means, had resolved a tense hostage situation in Iran. And how cool Auntie Pauline (actually a distant cousin) was for working on top secret stuff with the CIA. I always tried to be patient with him and at least pretended to listen and nod at his stories. They never seemed to be about the same people. Sometimes he’d mention something that was actually funny or interesting too so it wasn’t always bad.

Good old rambling Robert. He picked up that nickname within a couple weeks of starting school--I don’t think he liked it much. He didn’t make many friends because he could never stop talking about his own family. Sometimes I think that I was the only one he could talk to who wouldn’t start running after five minutes. I’m not going to lie though. Back then I endeavored to be out of the room most of the day to avoid his ramblings. However no matter how late I came back, he was always up and ready to tell me something new about his family’s latest adventures.

There was this one time that was different though. On a day close to the end of our first semester together, he suddenly stopped his rambling and stared at me with a really serious expression. The abrupt lack of background noise startled me from the article I was reading while humoring him, and when I saw his face I thought he must have been angry with me for ignoring him. “You know Michael,” he started as I prepared my apology, “I really appreciate that you listen to my stories every day. I know it must be boring and annoying for you, but you listen anyway and I appreciate that. So I want to promise you something. Us Goodings, we don’t forget stuff like this. We take care of our friends. Just you wait, one day me and the whole family will find a way to thank you.” I shuddered at the thought of having to attend a graduation party with his entire family and hear about all their adventures first hand, but at that moment I realized that Robert was actually a pretty good guy.

Our year together came to an end, and the next year I was assigned a different roommate. Rambling Robert still sent me emails to keep me up to date with all his family happenings for a while, but even those stopped when he decided to transfer out to some college in Washington. I completed my degree in criminal psychology and went on to work as a detective for the DEA for a while. I had a great time there busting drug dealers and cleaning up the streets of my hometown, and my mom was so proud to have a real Officer Doe in the family. I was about 45 years old when they promoted me and had me relocated near the Mexican border to work on the drug traffic coming from the cartels. It was there that I finally met one of Robert’s infamous family members, Randall Gooding. He was my new supervisor, and when I showed up on the first day he greeted me like an old friend. He told me that he recognized my name and background from the stories Robert had told him, and he personally requested that I be sent down. I was surprised that Robert even talked about me, we had only known each other for a year, but it was nice to reminisce about the Goodings again. Randall was just as talkative as Robert was, and we hit it off almost immediately. It felt like I was in college again. His nickname around the office was Rambling Randy, which had me chuckling for at least a day. Robert, it turns out, was doing just fine. He was a doctor now somewhere in Texas, and I was happy that my old friend was able to make such a good life for himself.

Work was good for a few years until the cartel activity started to pick up dramatically. Nobody was sure why but we were suddenly inundated with arrests and busts and all kinds of paper work. Even Randy wasn’t as talkative around this time. It was all supposed to come to a head today. Today we were going to do a massive takedown on a processing plant operating just inside the border. Our undercover agent had uncovered it while posing for a different case so Randy and I took the lead while the rest of the office continued monitoring the other operation. We enlisted the FBI and local SWAT teams for help and I thought everything was going to go smoothly until I got kidnapped right out of the parking lot on my way out of the office last night.

From the time they ripped the rucksack bag off of my head till the first rays of daylight, they questioned me. They were careful. All of them had clown masks on, the hard plastic kind that never quite fit the face right. All of them were wearing gloves and carrying weapons--some had guns, some had various wicked modifications of baseball bats and crowbars. The night was rough. They wanted to know how we found out about them, who we were working with, when the operation was going to go down, and a whole host of other questions. I was patient and waited. I gave them no information and suffered a few broken ribs and some teeth for it. While they were questioning me, I took in my surroundings. I knew from the floor plans I had studied for the bust that I was in the processing plant, specifically in one of the raised offices at the end of the building. I could see the entire plant from the large window on the wall in front of me. I guessed that they did not know about our plans yet, so I contented myself to sit tight and wait for the bust to happen at 10AM.

However, it was around 6AM when I heard the sirens blaring in the distance. Maybe they stepped up the schedule when they found out I was kidnapped, I thought. My captors were awake in an instant and took up the preplanned positions we had predicted. One of the guys carrying what looked like an M16 came cursing into the office where I was being held. After cracking me in the face with the butt of the gun, I felt more than heard him raise the muzzle level with the back of my head. Soon I heard an unfamiliar voice yell over a megaphone giving the normal spiel about being surrounded and to give up. Of course they refused to give up and began to use me as a bargaining chip. Randy’s voice came over the megaphone just before the first officer continued the negotiation, “Mikey! Just wait Mikey! Hang tight and don’t do anything stupid.”

The standoff lasted for hours. If it weren’t for the gun pressed on the nape of my neck, I would have probably passed out from boredom. Eventually things got real quiet. My guard started getting antsy and walked out--probably to check for new orders with his superiors. As soon as he left the room, a hundred glass windows shattered breaking the silence and raining shards of glass down on the main factory floor. White smoke obscured the first floor as tear gas flooded the facility. Shouting and gunfire followed as my captors opened fire. Amid the confusion and smoke I couldn’t tell who was winning. I did hear Randy’s voice at one point yelling orders like, “Dimitri, take the stairs and give Pauline some cover.” None of the officers who were supposed to be with us today were named Dimitri or Pauline. The din began to wither after only a few minutes and unseen officers began yelling, “Clear!” As the smoke dissipated, I expected to see the body armor and face masks of the SWAT teams who were supposed to be part of today’s operation. Instead I saw lots of men and a few women I had never seen before in various uniforms. Some were in army uniforms others were in suits, and there were even a few in civilian clothes. God, did they call the Army and CIA in on this? When Randy saw me, he came running up with one of the suited men who was carrying a bag.

“Mike! Thank God you’re still alive. I’m sorry we made you wait so long, but we had to wait for all the flights to make it before we could move.”

“What? What flights? Randy, what are you talking about?”

“We found out you were kidnapped at about midnight. The team that we were going to use wasn’t trained for hostage situations so I had to improvise. I made some calls around and got as many as I could to come down here. Good thing Nate here happened to have hostage experience. Nobody asked any questions after I brought your name up, we all know you thanks to Robert here.” He motioned at the suited man who was leaning in to assess me.

I frowned at the man and suddenly realized that his bag contained medical supplies. “Robert?” I choked the question out in disbelief. He just gave me a small smile while he continued his work. “You mean to tell me that all of these guys… They’re all your family?”

Robert looked up from where he was examining my jaw with a wry smile, “I told you we don’t forget Mike. All the Goodings come to Doe’s who wait. ”","My name's Mike Doe, and this is my story.",19

Recognising that this situation was quite dangerous and feeling sorry for the poor woman, Emily pulled over and offered her a lift.

The Apache woman nodded silently in appreciation and climbed into the car.

Naturally Emily tried to engage her in conversation but initially the Apache woman remained silent and she seemed a bit nervous.

However as they progressed along the highway towards Phoenix the woman eventually started to relax a little and then she started to look around.

The old woman was looking closely at everything in the car, apparently studying every detail. Then she noticed a pale blue gift bag on the rear seat behind Emily.

“What’s in the bag?” she asked Emily, almost whispering.

“Oh,” Emily responded warmly, “it’s a bottle of Whiskey that I got for my husband.”

The Apache woman remained silent momentarily and then speaking with the quiet wisdom of someone who’s been around the block a few times, she smiled and said, “Good trade.”

The horse stands there, staring blankly at the bartender. 

Everyone starts to feel a little awkward. 

The horse's handler comes in and leads it out, but not before it's knocked over a couple of glasses and soiled itself. 

Needless to say, the bar is closed for the rest of the day. 

Jesus walks up to the bar, but it's closed for hygiene reasons and he goes next door to a hotel. 

He hands the receptionist a couple of nails and says ""Can you put me up for the night?"" 

The receptionist takes a moment to understand, not speaking Aramaic, but is able to explain in mime that nails are *not* legal tender. 

After Jesus leaves disgruntledly, a duck that has been kind of harrassing the receptionist for the last few days by asking for grapes waddles in. 

The duck asks if the receptionist has any nails, and the receptionist finally snaps. 

Deciding to walk out on the most ludicrous workday of his life, receptionist goes to the bar, and is infuriated to find it closed. He jimmies open a window, not caring who sees. 

But his two old friends across the street, a priest and a rabbi, DO see. They decide they should do something to calm this agitated man down, and follow him into the bar. 

The bartender, having spent all day cleaning up after the horse, sees the receptionist, the priest and the rabbi come into the bar, and stops scrubbing shit long enough to ask

Anakin: No.

Palpatine: I thought not. It’s not a story movie critics would tell you. It’s an Internet legend. Darth Walker, known by his internet persona, The Nostalgia Critic, was a movie critic initially active on Youtube. He was so powerful and so wise that he created a site of his own, where him and many other art critics could post their reviews... He made such powerfull movie reviews, that he was even able to provoke angry responses and fake accusations of copyright infringments from the directors of the movies that he criticized.

Anakin: He could actually provoke angry responses from movie directors?

Palpatine: Movie criticism is a pathway to many abilities many consider to be unnatural.

Anakin: What happened to him?

Palpatine: He became so powerfull…that the only thing that he feared was loosing his power, which eventually he did. After many accusations of mistreatment and lack of professionalism against him, many of his former allies abandoned him and his site eventually died out. Ironic. He criticized Tommy Wiseau for being a bad and incapable movie director, but he couldn´t grasp that he was an even worst person than Wiseau himself.

He sits in his car at the side of the highway, mumbling to himself angrily about his demotion, until he finally snaps. He turns on his lights and pulls over the first car that passes him. Slamming his door behind him, he marches up to the car and pounds on the window.  

The driver of the car rolls down the window. “What seems to be the problem, officer?”.  

“Get out!” the police officer yells, “And keep your hands up behind your head!”.  

Quite taken aback by the officer’s aggression, the man gets out of his car as the police officer draws a circle with his finger in the dust on the floor. “Stand inside that circle, and don’t move until I tell you to!”  

The man continues to comply and stands in the circle. The police officer stomps up to the man’s car, and pulls off the wing mirror. He smashes it onto the floor and stamps it into the ground. He turns to look at the man, who is staring patiently back at him. Letting out a sigh of anger, the police officer takes his car keys and drags them along all the car doors, leaving scratches all over the car. He turns back to look at the man, who’s now trying to suppress a smile. The police officer grits his teeth as he pulls out his baton, and proceeds to smash in all the car’s windows and dent every part of the body. The man is giggling quietly now, and the police officer is seething with fury. He turns back to the car, lights a match, opens the fuel tank and drops it in. The car bursts into flames with a boom as shards of metal fly everywhere, and a mushroom cloud of black smoke and ash rises from the charred wreckage of the car. The officer turns his piercing stare back to the man, who immediately bursts into hysterical laughter.  

“What the hell is wrong with you?! I just completely destroyed your car!” The police officer bellows.  

The man replies between bouts of laughter, “I stepped out of the circle when you weren’t looking!”

But most of all, he wouldn't survive without his precious rum to drink. He started rummaging through the debris at the bottom of the lifeboat looking for rum. 

He picked up one bottle, and rubbed the dirt off the label to read it. Suddenly, a magnificent genie emerged from the bottle. ""Oh, my savior,"" the genie said, ""You have rescued me from centuries of bondage. In return, I will grant you any one wish \-\- whatever your heart desires.""

The pirate, somewhat impulsively, blurted out ""I wish the WHOLE SEA was rum instead of water!""  With a wave of his hand, the genie turned the entire sea, all the way to the horizon and beyond, into rum. The genie then nodded his head and disappeared.

The parrot looked around, then turned to the pirate and said ""Way to go, genius. Now we have to pee in the boat.""","The Pirate, the Parrot and the Genie",14

He addresses the boy and asks ""young man, what do you have in your wagon this morning?"".

The boy replies ""it's chicken wire sir.""

Man ""well what are you going to do with it?""

Boy ""I'm gonna catch some chickens.""

Man ""that's not how you catch chickens.""

The boy smiles and continues on his way.

Later that afternoon he sees the boy coming back with a number of chickens tangled up in the chicken wire.

 The next morning he sees the boy again with many rolls of duck/duct tape in his wagon.

The man quips ""let me guess sonny. You're gonna catch some ducks?""

The boy answers back ""yes sir."".

Again that afternoon the man sees the kid returning home with a number of ducks wrapped up haphazardly in duct tape stacked into his wagon. 
He shakes his head in bewilderment. 

 On the third day he sees the young man with his wagon in tow, but this time there are a bunch of tree branches in it. 

""What are you taking with you today?"" the old man asks. 

The boy retorts ""I got me some pussywillow trimmings."" 

The old man immediately hollers to the lad
 ""well hold on one minute. Let me get my hat and coat, I'm going with you!""...

She dropped her shopping bags, drew her handgun, and proceeded to scream at them at the top of her voice, ""I have a gun and I know how to use it! Get out of the car, you scumbags!""

The four men didn't wait for a second invitation but got out and ran like mad. The woman, somewhat shaken, proceeded to load her shopping bags in the back of the car and get into the driver's seat. She was so shaken that she could not get her key into the ignition. She tried and tried, to no avail.

And then it dawned on her why. A few minutes later, she found her own car parked four or five spaces further down. She loaded her bags into her car and drove to the police station.

The sergeant, to whom she told the story, nearly tore himself in two with laughter and pointed to the other end of the counter, where four pale males were reporting a carjacking by a mad elderly woman described as white, less than five feet tall, glasses, curly white hair, and carrying a large handgun.

No charges were filed.

When he comes back the little girl looks up at him and asks ""Did you powder your nose?""

Her husband Paul comes and knocks on the door. 

Peter goes under the bed. 

Paul enters the bedroom. 

Feeling uneasy, the wife excuses herself  to go to market to buy food items. 

Paul takes advantage of the wife's absence to call Peter’s wife. 

Peter’s wife quickly arrives and they make love. 

Suddenly Paul’s wife who had excused herself  to go to the market turned back halfway forgetting the list of food items at home and knocks  on the door.

Since the priest had originally come from a small town, the Bishop decided to make himself available in case the new priest needed any assistance. 

During his first week, the new priest was scheduled to host confession, so the members of the church could come and confess their sins. 

During the priest's first confession, a young girl approached him and explained that she was distraught because she had been cheating on her boyfriend with somebody she met on the internet. The new priest had never given absolution for this before, and rushed to find the bishop to seek advice on what penance to give the young lady. After finding the bishop in the sacristy and explaining the situation, the bishop advised the new priest to have the girl say 10 Hail Mary's and 1 Our Father in order to absolve her sins. 

A few confessions later, the priest found himself in another unknown situation. A man came in saying that he had hit his wife for burning dinner, but admitted it was only because he was so stressed because of work. Again, the priest found himself without response as he never dealt with situations like this in his prior small town church, so he rushed to find the Bishop. The Bishop told the priest to have the man say 20 Hail Mary's and 5 Our Father's to repent for his sin.

Feeling more confident, the new priest continued confessions for a few hours. But once again, found himself in the same situation. A woman came to confession and told the priest that she had been giving oral sex to a man to whom she was not married. Again, the new priest rushed to find the Bishop, but instead he came across an Altar Boy in the sacristy.

The salesman, hesitant to make such a momentous decision, asks if he can tour both places to assist him with his choice. St. Peter says sure and calls up a cloud for him to ride through heaven. He floats around and sees streets of gold and people playing harps and hears voices singing. Definitely a nice place, but definitely boring. 

He returns and St. Peter points to a very long escalator which the salesman rides down. At the bottom of the escalator is a white sand beach, beautiful people playing volleyball, his favorite rock music and cater waiters everywhere providing food and drinks. As far as the eye could see, it was paradise. 

The salesman returns to St. Peter and states that while heaven was a very nice, serene place, hell was definitely the happening place where he wanted to be. St. Peter gives him a key card to the express elevator and wishes him the best.

The elevator zooms to the bottom floor and the doors open to a blast of heat and the stench of sulfur. As he steps out, a beast leaps from behind a rock and begins chewing his leg. Barely able to crawl, the salesman looks up to see the devil himself and asks, “Where are the beaches and the beautiful people?”

The devil chuckles and says, ""Really? You didn’t realize that was just a demo?""",A software salesman died and was greeted by St. Peter at the gate to heaven.,11

I get that their sub is based around making memes of the empire and how everything is great and stuff, but it is kind of unhealthy for the community to look at the empire in this ""ridiculous"" fashion. The empire is stupid and here is why:

First, their views on race are completely wrong. You think that the empire cares for anybody not influential enough to sustain their own fascism? No! They wouldn't care if the children are starving to death and don't have clothes in the awful winter. They, of course, do this by framing these people, and those who rebel, with the awful characteristics they themselves posses, like racism and megalomania. Of course the poor and the sick are getting blamed constantly for the world's problems, hurr durr just go to work. What you people are creating is a simulation of a fascist  dystopia, and it is not funny.

Yes, it might be great to be a part of the 0.001&amp;#37; who actually live nice in some of the empire's fuck\-off province, but, you know what, even those people are just pawns serving for a greater power, having cities on cliffs and a whole bunch of fancy foods in their large houses doesn't make them any better. If they dare as much as to move a finger, they'd be dead by dawn. These are the same types of people who would go against their own just to sustain their little power they have. Of course, when the people rebel, they are being made fun off and the empire comes full fucking force trying to overpower them with numbers and economy \(and still fails miserably\).

The empire's so bad, that even the emperor's most fucking trusted person for handling the problems has empathy for the people he is killing. He basically believes in the same religion and admires the rebels, who, by the way, are ten times mightier with the blade than anything your stupid ""empire"" can dispatch to stop them, no matter that their ""spells"" and ""magic"" or whatever their stupid faction has seems so good and unique.

And of course the Empire uses a fucking weak point in the current economy as an excuse to start murdering hundreds and thousands of innocents, what else if not that? Just like Nazi Germany, they start shit in a an already on\-going crisis and maintain their power like some fucking movie dictator. How can someone joke about this? That is pathetic, it's like these assholes are completely blind to everything happening to real people, working a day\-to\-day job and how this affects them. Not to mention other races, who are also discriminated if they are not a part of whatever agenda the empire is pushing that era.

But, the emperor is the icing of the cake. You think he is some bad dude? Oh yeah, you think he is so fucking cool, don't you? He is a fucking wimp. Anybody in his position could have did what he did, it is no wonder he got murdered on his ship. You know what, it was too fucking good, watching him die. Some fucking random dude whose whole clan has been destroyed and is completely about to die out if some miracle kid doesn't save them, randomly decides to arrange the killing of the emperor, and it works like a charm. Everybody could have been the emperor, and they would have been fucking better, not assigning such an emotionally attached person to lead the banners in such an important situation. But not this dumb ass. You still think he is this cool, mysterious guy, but he is not, he is fucking retarded, he could have ran away a thousand times from his ship if he wasn't so arrogant and oblivious. And do you know what the worst part about it is? His decisions are completely influenced by the Thalmor.","Okay, I got removed for insulting the empire on /r/empiredidnothing wrong for this, but please hear me out...",0

Favourite amongst his subjects was the court painter of whom he was very proud. Everybody agreed this wizzened old man pianted the greatest pictures in the whole kingdom and the king would spend hours each day gazing at them in wonder. However, one day a dirty and dishevelled stranger presented himself at the court claiming that in fact he was the greatest painter in the land. The indignant king decreed a competition would be held between the two artists, confident it would teach the vagabond an embarrassing lesson.

Within a month they were both to produce a masterpiece that would out do the other. After thirty days of working feverishly day and night, both artists were ready. They placed their paintings, each hidden by a cloth, on easels in the great hall of the castle. As a large crowd gathered, the king ordered the cloth be pulled first from the court artist’s easel.

Everyone gasped as before them was revealed a wonderful oil painting of a table set with a feast. At its centre was an ornate bowl full of exotic fruits glistening moistly in the dawn light. As the crowd gazed admiringly, a sparrow perched high up on the rafters of the hall swooped down and hungrily tried to snatch one of the grapes from the painted bowl only to hit the canvas and fall down dead with shock at the feet of the king. ’Aha!’ exclaimed the king. ’My artist has produced a painting so wonderful it has fooled nature herself, surely you must agree that he is the greatest painter who ever lived!’ But the vagabond said nothing and stared solemnly at his feet. ’Now, pull the blanket from your painting and let us see what you have for us,’ cried the king. But the tramp remained motionless and said nothing.

Growing impatient, the king stepped forward and reached out to grab the blanket only to freeze in horror at the last moment. ’You see,’ said the tramp quietly, ’there is no blanket covering the painting. This is actually just a painting of a cloth covering a painting. And whereas your famous artist is content to fool nature, I’ve made the king of the whole country look like a clueless little twat.”","Once upon a time, there was a king who ruled a great and glorious nation.",22

They find the farmer tending to his crops and tell him only one thing: “take us to your leader”. The farmer is bewildered by the strange beings, and fearing for his life, runs back to his home to call the police. 

Within several hours, the national guard has arrived on the farm, as well as the President. “Take us to your leader,” the aliens say once again, this time to the leader of the country. Being a strong catholic, and also feeling under-equipped to deal with alien negotiations, the President offers to bring the aliens to see the Pope. 

Another few hours later, Air Force One lands in the Vatican, the Pope steps out to greet the visitors. “Take us to your leader.” The Pope considers his options carefully, knowing that what he does next could determine the fate of humanity. But he takes trust in his faith and brings the aliens into his private chapel to see his leader, Jesus Christ. The President, everyone in the Vatican, and the eyes of the world wait intently as they watch the doors shut behind the Pope and the aliens. Two tense minutes pass before a large mothership materializes in the sky above. The two aliens are hastily beamed up and, as quickly as it arrived, the mothership zooms off into the heavens. 

The Pope re-emerges from the chapel soon after, where he is confronted by the President. 

“What did you say?” the President asks. “Did you tell them that they could try going to heaven to find Jesus?” 

“No,” said the pope. “I told them what I tell everybody, but they looked frightened and called their mothership for an immediate extraction.” 

The President, in disbelief that the Pope could singlehandedly fend off against a possible alien invasion, pushes the Pope harder, asking “What did you specifically tell them?” 

“Well as I said, I told them what I tell everyone - that they don’t need to go find Jesus, for he already lives inside them”.",One day a small alien scouting ship lands on a farm....,3
