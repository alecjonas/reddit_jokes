A bunny is running through the jungle when he sees a giraffe making a marijuana cigar.
The bunny stops and says to the giraffe:
""Yo, Giraffe, do not smoke that sticky icky. You better run with me, you'll see how healthy it is"".
The giraffe thinks about it, throws the joint and follow the bunny.
The two are running through the forest and find an elephant about to inhale a line of cocaine.
The bunny approaches the elephant and says:
""Elephant, dude, stop inhaling that snowy stuff and come and run with us, you'll see how good it feels"".
The elephant thinks about it, throws his mirror with the coke and decides to follow them.
The three of them are running when they suddenly find a lion about to inject a dose of heroin.
The bunny says to him:
""Lion, bro, leave the syringe and come running with us, you'll see how good it is"".
The lion approaches the rabbit and gives it a big blow.
The other animals, scandalized, ask the lion:
""What the fuck it's wrong with you? Why did you do that? The bunny only wants to help us!!!""
And the lion answers:
""This rabbit motherfucker always wants to make me run like a fucking idiot every single time he smokes crystal meth and shit! Fuck that!""

So the spy hunter goes to Ireland and stops in a bar in one of the small towns. He says to the bartender, “Maybe you can help me. I’m looking for a guy named Murphy. ” 

The bartender replies, “You’re going to have to be more specific because, around here, there are lots of guys named Murphy. There’s Murphy the Baker, who runs the pastry shop on the next block. There’s Murphy the Banker, who’s president of our local savings bank. There’s Murphy the Blacksmith, who works at the stables. And, as a matter of fact, my name is Murphy, too. ” 

Hearing this, the spy hunter figures he might as well try the code words on the bartender, so he says, “The weather forecast calls for mist in the morning. ” 

The bartender replies, “Oh, you’re looking for Murphy the Spy. He lives right down the street.""",The Irish Spy,13

""So, you're a politician..."" ""Well, yes, is that a problem?"" ""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician. ""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears... And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!"" ""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..."" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?"" ""No sir!"" says the man. ""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"". ""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician. ""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

""Ah"", says Satan. ""You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...""",A politician dies...,175

So the female fly goes up to the male fly and asks, ""Hey, how do you get out of this jar?""

The male fly says, "" I can tell you but you have to fuck me first.""
And flies....they aren't very smart. So they do it and the male fly tells the female fly, ""You start from the bottom of the jar and fly as fast you can to the top of the jar and Boom, you'll pop right out.""

So the female fly does just that. Flies from the bottom of the jar to the top of the jar as fast as she can. SPLAT. Dies.

Three scientists are exploring the African jungle when they are captured by a tribe. The leader of the tribe approaches them and begins to speak...

“You have two options...booga booga or death” he said.

The first scientist speaks up and says “What’s booga booga?”

The leader replies “We bend you over that rock and the entire tribe has their way with you...now make your choice!”

The first scientist had a family that he was determined to get home to...so he chose booga booga. The entire tribe did their business with him and sent him on his way.

The leader looked at the second scientist and told him it was his turn to choose.

The second scientist watched the whole thing and was kind of turned on by it all, so he figured it might not be too bad! He said “I’ll take booga booga!”

Again, the tribe had their fun with the second scientist and sent him on his way.

Before the leader could even inquire of the third scientist, he shouted “Ill take death!!”

The entire tribe gasped and the leader looked stunned. “Are you sure...?” The leader asked

“Ain’t nobody fucking me in the ass, give me death” the third scientist replied.

“Very well” the leader replied...”if that is what you want.” The leader through his arms up and shouted “DEATH BY BOOGA BOOGA!!”",Booga Booga,4

Johnny wanted to capitalize on the upcoming prom to ask out Sally, so Johnny waited in line for two tickets to prom. Johnny tried to arrive early, but the line was extremely long. He waited, and eventually purchased two tickets to prom.


Johnny wished to impress Sally with an invitation as his date to prom, so he decides on a chocolate cake proposing the question to go to prom with him.


Johnny went to the local bakery. Unfortunately, the bakery was extremely busy, but Johnny was determined. He waited 3 hours after school in the line at the bakery to get his cake.


After Johnny finally had the cake, Johnny left to go talk with Sally's parents while Sally was out, to ask if he could surprise her with the cake. While Sally was out of her house with her friends for a few hours, Johnny ended up being stuck in a long line of traffic on the way to meet Sally's parents due to an accident.

Fortunately, Johnny beat Sally to her house, and Sally's parents loved the cake, so they had time to wait for her return to pop the question. Sally comes home and happily accepts his offer to go to prom as his date!


So, Johnny and his girl Sally are going to prom that Saturday. But, before they can go, Johnny needs to make sure they have a perfect night.

So, Friday comes, and Johnny goes out to get his tuxedo. When he gets to the tux rental store, there's this ridiculously long line. But he needs the tux, so Johnny waits. And he waits, and waits until finally, he has his tux.

Next, he needs a limo. So he goes to the limousine rental shop and finds that there's an even longer line there. But he needs the limo, so he waits. And he waits, and waits, and waits, until finally, he has the limo ordered.

Johnny realizes he needs some new shoes that match with his rented tux, so he stops by a shoe store to get himself some nice shoes. When he goes to pay, he sees the longest line yet. But he needs the shoes, so he waits. And he waits, and waits, and waits, and waits, and waits, until finally, he's got his new shoes.

Saturday, Johnny's ready to pick up his girl. He drives over to her house, picks her up, and they head to prom. At the dance, they're having a great time, dancing and hanging out with friends. Soon, though, Sally gets thirsty, and asks Johnny for a drink. Being the good guy he is, Johnny obliges.

So Johnny walks over to the punch table, and happily grabs her a drink with no wait.",Prom Night Date,26

The poor storyteller couldn't defy his master's wish, so he began to tell him a story: ""Once upon a time, there lived a rich man. He owned a pretty big farm, which was enough to satisfy the hunger of 13 entire cities. One day, an envious merchant freed the rich man's livestock, ruining the farm. Nobody witnessed the crime and the rich man had to restock everything by himself. He went to the closest marketplace with 300 gold doubloon and for each one he was given 3 sheeps and 2 sacks of various seeds. On his way to home, the man had to cross a river. Unfortunately for him, the only man able to help him was quite old and weak. He had a little boat which was quite cozy and could only carry one thing/person at a time...""
""What happens after?""  Asked the prince.
""Nothing... we should wait for the old man to carry everything to the other side. It'll take him the whole night if my calculations are right.""



From that day on, the story teller was never seen again. Many theorize it's from his lack of creativity. The only thing we know is that his wish came true and was able to rest that faithful night.",The story-teller was tired...,1

So, while everyone inside works to find a solution, St. Peter is given explicit instructions: only let people in who have had a bad day on the day they died. 

Late in the day, a middle-aged man walks up to the Pearly Gates and asks to be let into Heaven. St. Peter asks him how his day went. 

“Oh, it was horrible,” the man replied. “I came home from work and walked up to my apartment on the 27th floor of my building. When I walked into my bedroom, my wife was laying there, no clothes on, and asked how work went. I knew there was something fishy going on , so I checked everywhere in my apartment to find the fucker who slept with my wife, but couldn’t find him. 

“Finally, I stepped onto the balcony and saw the son of a bitch hanging from the railing. I grabbed him, threw him off, and watched him fall all the way down to the ground! But, miraculously, he survived the fall. So, I pick up my refrigerator and heave it over the balcony. It lands on him and, hopefully, kills him. The strain of picking up the fridge gave me a heart attack though, and I died on the way to the hospital.”

St. Peter is standing slack-jawed at the man in front of him and eventually says, “Head right on in sir, you deserve it!”

A little while later, a young man approaches the Pearly Gates and asks to be let in. St. Peter asks him how his day went. 

“It was awful,” the young man says. “I was working out on the treadmill in my apartment. I keep it on my balcony so I can get fresh air when I work out, especially with it being on the 28th floor and all. Out of nowhere, the treadmill goes haywire and speeds up, throwing me off of my balcony. Luckily, I managed to grab the railing of the balcony below me and hung on for dear life!

“A few minutes later, this old guy comes onto the balcony and throws me off for no reason! I fall all the way down, but somehow I survive. But, as I’m trying to get up, the asshole throws a refrigerator off his balcony and it lands on me!”

St. Peter attempts to hide his chuckling as he lets the young man into Heaven. 

A few minutes later, another middle-aged man approaches the Pearly Gates and asks for admittance. St. Peter asks him how his day went. 

The man says, “Picture this: I’m naked, and in a refrigerator...”","One day, Heaven is full...",2

A bear on the side of the river sees the fish and thinks all that fly has to do is drop 6 inches to get a drink of water so the fish can get the fly and the bear can get the fish

A hunter in the woods sees the bear and thinks all that fly has to do is drop 6 inches to get water so the fish can get the fly, the bear can get the fish, and the hunter can get the bear

A mouse in the hunters pocket sees all this and thinks to himself all that fly has to do is drop 6 inches to the fish can get the fly, the bear gets the fish, the hunter gets the bear, and the mouse can get the piece of cheese on the ground when the hunter crouches to shoot the bear

A cat in the bushes sees the mouse and thinks all that fly has to do is drop 6 inches so the fish can get the fly, the bear gets the fish, the hunter gets the bear, the mouse gets the cheese, and the cat can get the mouse


So the fly gets the water, the fish gets the fly, the bear gets the fish, the hunter gets the bear, the mouse gets the cheese, but when the cat goes for the mouse it misses and falls into the water. Now what’s the moral of this story you might ask?

And never get a taste of Scotch and rye.

Without the aid of gin and rum.

The cat in milk and water soaks,
And then in 12 short years it croaks.

The modest, sober, bone-dry hen,
Lays eggs for others, then dies at 10.

All animals are strictly dry,
They sinless live and swiftly die.

But sinful, ginful, rum-soaked men,
Survive for three score years and ten,

And some of them, though very few,
Stay pickled till they’re 92!

They are deeply in love, but have scarcely done more than hold hands, and only with each other. As they walk along the downtown streets of their city, admiring wedding dresses and cakes at various shops, and making notes about what they like, the conversation slowly takes a serious turn.

The man says, ""Look, there is something I need to share with you. I have never shared this with anyone, but I have heard that penis size is important to women.""

""I'm confused,"" says the young woman.

""I'm hung like a baby,"" the man replies.

The woman thinks for a moment, then replies, ""Well, as you know, I am a virgin and have nothing to compare it to, so I don't think it matters. I love you, and I am looking forward to a happy life with you.""

Feeling relieved, the man begins walking again, and the woman follows but looks concerned. 

Finally, after a long pause, she says, ""I, too, should share something with you. I know from my friends that men love large breasts on a woman, and I must tell you that I am afraid you will be disappointed. I wear a padded bra, I am basically flat as a board, and I am very nervous that you will not like me so much when you see me naked.""

The man thinks for a moment, then replies, ""My dear, you know I have nothing to compare your chest to, in the nude, and I love you, so I am not concerned. Let's be married and have a happy life.""

Both relieved, they continue planning the wedding, and shortly thereafter they do get married.

On the wedding night, both are understandably nervous, being as inexperienced as they are. They kiss, and slowly begin remove each other’s clothing.

As the young woman’s shirt, and then her bra, come off, sure enough – not even an A cup. But, this man loves his new wife, and continues with enthusiasm.

Soon, the woman slowly works the man’s pants off, and slowly slides down his underwear. Immediately after seeing his penis, in a very anticipatory state, she faints.

In a panic, the young man elevates her legs and ensures she is breathing as she is clearly in shock. Soon enough, she comes to, and he is relieved.

He promptly asks if she is ok, to which she replies, “I thought you said you were hung like a baby?”

He had a large pond in the back. It was properly shaped for swimming, so he fixed it up nice with picnic tables, horseshoe courts, and some apple and peach trees.

One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond, as he hadn't been there for a while, and look it over. He grabbed a five-gallon bucket to bring back some fruit. As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee. As he came closer, he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond.

He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end. One of the women shouted to him, 'we're not coming out until you leave!'

The old man frowned, 'I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or make you get out of the pond naked.'

Holding the bucket up he said, 'I'm here to feed the alligator...'

post,7mz345,2qh72,jokes,false,1514602656,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7mz345/texas_chili_cook_off/,self.jokes,,"Recently I was honoured to be selected as an outstanding famous celebrity in Texas, to be a judge at a Chili cook-off, because no one else wanted to do it. Also the original person called in sick at the last moment, and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me that I could have free beer during the tasting. So I accepted.

Here are the scorecards from the event:

CHILI # 1: MIKE'S MANIC MONSTER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A little to heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.

JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavour. Very mild.

FRANK: Holy Shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway with this stuff. I needed two beers to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. Those Texans are crazy.

CHILI # 2: ARTHUR'S AFTERBURNER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Smokey, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.

JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavour. Needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave of two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich manoeuvre. They had to walkie-talkie in three extra beers when they saw the look on my face.

CHILI # 3: FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.

JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili. A bit salty. Good use of red peppers.

FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced.

CHILI # 4: BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC

JUDGE ONE: Black Bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.

JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods. Not much of a chili.

FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating.

CHILI # 5: LINDA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.

JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.

FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no linger focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly from a pitcher onto it. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Freakin' Rednecks! ! !

CHILI # 6: VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.

JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions and garlic.

FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulphuric flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!

CHILI # 7: SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum. Tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge # 3.

FRANK: You could put a #)$^@#*&amp;! Grenade in my mouth, pull the #)$^@#*&amp;! pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my X*$(@#^&amp;$ mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit, to match my X*$(@#^&amp;$ shirt. At least the during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the four inch hole in my stomach.

CHILI # 8: HELEN'S MOUNT SAINT CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending. This is a nice blend chili, safe for all; not too bold, but spicy enough to declare its existence.

JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good balanced chili, neither mild now hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge # 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank.

FRANK: - - - - - Mama?- - - (Editor's Note: Judge # 3 was unable to report).

So the priest, caught off guard announces ""okay everyone, choir, umm turn to hymn 75."" Again the piccolo player turns to the priest and goes ""aww priest, hymn 75 thats a real bitch to play too, its just as tough as the last one."" So the priest scratches his chin and thinks for a moment before again announcing, ""alright everyone turn to hymn 46, choir ready."" And again the piccolo player turns the priest ""aww priest, that hymn 46, thats a tough one to play as well, i dont think i can do that one."" So the priest begins to think, when all of the sudden someone in the crowd yells out "" that piccolo player is a mother fucker!"" The priest almost falls out of the pedestal in shock, instantly he retorts ""you cant call my piccolo player a mother fucker, i demand the man who called my piccolo player a mother fucker stand up!"" The audience is silent, the priest yells again ""okay, how about the man next to the man who called my piccolo player a mother fucker stand up!"" Again silence, the priest yells again ""okay, how about the man next to the man next to the man who called my piccolo player a mother fucker stand up!"" A third time silence from the crowd, when finally in the very back a man stands and announces, ""im not the man next to the man next to the man of the man who called your piccolo player a mother fucker, but all i wanna know is who called that mother fucker a piccolo player.""",The organist at a local church dies (long joke),4

Hi, Fred, this is Richard, next door. I’ve got a confession to make. I’ve been riddled with guilt for a few months, and I have been trying to get up the courage to tell you face-to-face. 

At least I’m telling you in this text and I can’t live with myself a minute longer without you knowing about this. The truth is that when you’re not around I’ve been sharing your wife, day and night. 

In fact, probably much more than you. I haven’t been getting it at home recently and I know that that’s no excuse. The temptation was just too great. I can’t live with the guilt and hope you’ll accept my sincere apology and forgive me. Please suggest a fee for usage and I’ll pay you. 

Regards, Richard

I was so angered and betrayed, that I grabbed my gun, went next door, and shot Richard...killing him.

I went back home, and poured myself a stiff drink and sat down on the sofa. 

Just then, I looked at my phone, and discovered a second text message from Richard.

Second text message:

Hi, Fred. Richard here again. Sorry about the typo on my last text. I expect you figured it out and noticed that the damned Auto-Correct had changed “wi-fi” to “wife.” Technology, huh? It’ll be the death of us all. Regards, Richard",I got a text from my next-door neighbor today.,992

One morning, the father walks outside to find their cow dead. 

""There is nothing that could help get us out of poverty now,"" says the dad as he shoots himself.

The mom walks outside and sees the dad and the cow on the ground.

""I can't live without my husband,"" she says as she shoots herself with her husband's gun.

The daughter walks outside and sees her mother, father and cow dead.

""I can't live any longer without my family,"" she says as she jumps into the river and kills herself.

The oldest son, 23 years old, walks outside looking for the family and sees them all dead.

""Is there anyway to bring them back,"" he yells at the sky.

Poof! A female leprechaun appears.

""I will bring your whole family back to life, even the cow,"" she says, ""if you can fuck me 5 times in a row. If not I get to kill you.""

The boy fucks her 3 times in a row and he dies.

The middle son, 19 years old, comes out and sees the leprechaun. She gives him the same offer as his brother.

""I will bring your whole family back to life, even the cow,"" she says, ""if you can fuck me 5 times in a row. If not I get to kill you.""

The son agrees to do it but can only do it 4 times. He dies.

The youngest son, 15 years old, comes out and is given the same offer.

""I will bring your whole family back to life, even the cow,"" she says, ""if you can fuck me 5 times in a row. If not I get to kill you.""

The son says, ""What if I fuck you 10 times in a row?""

The leprechaun thinks. She says, ""I will bring back your family and give you my pot of gold.

The son says, ""What if I fuck you 20 times in a row?""

She thinks again and says, ""I will bring back your family, give you my pot of gold and give you a mansion.""

The son thinks and says, ""What if I fuck you 30 times in a row?"" 

She thinks and says, ""I will bring back your family and make you the richest man in Ireland.""

The son says, ""Wait, how do I know you will survive it?""

""What do you mean?"" says the leprechaun.

""The cow didn't.""

So historians and scientists have long been stumped by Boston’s 1919 Great Molasses Flood.

Ethan Trex at Mental Floss reports that on January 15, 1919, a massive molasses holding tank in Boston’s north end owned by the Purity Distilling Company, which used the treacle to produce alcohol, ripped open. A 2.3-million-gallon, 26-million-pound wave of the sticky stuff rolled down Commercial Street as fast as 35 miles per hour. It smashed houses and buildings and knocked a firehouse off its foundation. In the end, the sticky tsunami killed 21 people and severely injured 150. By one estimate, Trex reports, it caused $100 million in damage in today’s dollars.

Though an anarchist terrorist attack was first blamed for the calamity, investigators soon pointed at the holding tank’s shoddy construction. But the question has remained, why did the molasses explode as a wave and not just slowly drip out of the tank? A group of students at Harvard investigated the event and presented their conclusions at recent meeting of the American Physical Society.

“I’m originally from Arkansas, where we have an old expression: ’Slow as molasses in January,”​ Nicole Sharp, aerospace engineer and science communicator who led the group, tells William Kole at the Associated Press. “Oddly enough, that’s exactly what we’re dealing with here, except that this molasses wasn’t slow.”


Sharp and her team researched historical accounts of the incident as well as National Weather Service data to understand weather conditions in Boston that day. They then performed experiments in a walk-in refrigerator with corn syrup, which has a similar consistency to molasses, to understand how it flows at different temperatures and to model the molasses incident.

According to Erin McCann at The New York Times, the Distillery received a shipment of molasses from Puerto Rico two days before the rupture. The researchers believe that the massive amount of molasses did not have time to completely cool down from its trip from the Caribbean and was likely seven to nine degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the chilly Boston air.

When the tank gave way, the warm molasses spilled out in a huge wave, but it cooled very quickly as it hit the cold air, causing it to become thick and sticky. If it had burst during the summer, the researchers say, the molasses would have likely flowed farther and been much thinner. It would have been a mess, but probably not a similarly fatal disaster.

After the initially 35 mile-per-hour tsunami, which has been reported to be between 15 and 40 feet high, the molasses cooled and slowly crept around the neighborhood. Sharp explains to Carol Off for CBC radio:

It seems like that would be the point where it’s not as dangerous any more. It’s not crashing through buildings after that first minute. It’s just kind of oozing instead. But it turns out that, because it was cold and because the molasses was cooling, that, if anything, that made the molasses more dangerous. Now people who have been knocked down by that initial wave who may have been pinned in wreckage are trapped in places where they have to try to keep this molasses away from their mouth and nose so they can breathe while people are trying to come and get them. That extra cold makes the molasses easily four or more times as viscous as before and that makes it much harder to fight.

It’s not the first time researchers have looked into the Great Molasses Flood. Last year, an engineer who researched the construction of the holding tank concluded that it was 50 percent too thin to hold 2.3 million gallons of molasses, reports Peter Schworm at The Boston Globe. Though Purity Distilling was found liable for the accident after a three-year trial, and poor construction was to blame, until this study nobody knew exactly why the tank burst.

Stephen Puleo, author of Dark Tide: The Great Boston Molasses Flood of 1919 tells Schworm that the tank was a problem from the beginning and was never properly inspected. The company actually changed the color of the tank from blue to brown-red to cover its leaks.",Yay! This sub-reddit is sweet!,0

“You have all lived very pious lives and are welcome into heaven! All you have to do is wash away your sins with this holy water.”

The first nun walks up and says “I once looked at a man’s penis.” So she washes out her eyes with the holy water and walks through the gates.

The second nun walks up and says “I once touched a man’s penis.” So she washes her hands in the holy water and walks through the gates.

All of a sudden the fourth nun cuts in front of the third nun. Saint Peter looks at her and says “There is plenty of holy water. There is no need to cut in line.”
The nun that cut replied “Yeah but if I’m going to have to gargle this water I want to do it before Beth sticks her ass in it!” ",Four nuns,113

post,7mrfgx,2qh72,jokes,false,1514514958,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7mrfgx/the_italian_magician/,self.jokes,,"There was once a magician in a little village in the Italian countryside. He had the uncanny ability to make anybody speaking to him have absolutely no recollection of a certain letter in the English alphabet. The wisest men from around the world would come to guess the letter of which he was thinking, but alas, they would never ever be able to guess it. 

Now, as you can imagine, this magician became very rich off of his skill. He became so rich, in fact, that he would throw the most illustrious parties at his villa every time he defeated another guesser. This habit of his earned him the nickname 'The Party'. Eventually that was all anybody called him.

Being in Rome, the Pope heard about The Party's challenge, and he became determined to beat it. So he prayed to the Lord, ""Please, Heavenly Father, grant me the lucidity to read this magician's mind. I will give all the earnings of my win to the poor."" God, seeing a great opportunity, granted the Pope this power.

The Pope went to The Party's villa, and The Party jumped on the opportunity to perform his trick on this holy man. He gathered crowds and journalists from every corner of the globe, then asked the pope his question, ""What letter am I thinking of?"" 

""O,"" the Pope responded with confidence. The Party was dumfounded. ""How did you guess my letter?! I'm so ashamed, I will never perform my magic ever again!""

The next day, from East to West across the world newspapers fronted the headline: Pope 'O' shuts The Party down!",The Italian Magician,0

Ride her for an hour and that should stretch it."" 


An hour later the man returns and they measure again. It is 8 inches. ""Go back to the barn again"" the
