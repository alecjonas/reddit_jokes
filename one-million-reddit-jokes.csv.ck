He was a young man then and they all knew that he would likely be long dead by the time they reached their destination. They said their tearful goodbyes and drifted off to sleep.

In the years he spent alone on the ship, he became adept at building small robots to help him complete his tasks. He formed relationships with the little bots, but he found he missed the companionship of real humans. He would take small stints in the cryogenic chambers in order to prolong his life, so as to complete his mission of getting his friends and family to their new home. He didn't want to wake anyone to take over his duties and suffer the loneliness of space travel. But a long life with no one real to talk to is lacking.

With his knowledge of robotics, he took it upon himself to build an artificial human. Something that looked real. Something that felt real. Something that would make the unbearable loneliness go away.

He didn’t feel right copying the likeness of any members of the sleeping crew, so he modeled the robot on himself. By the time he was done, there “he” was, a perfect replica of Jacques himself. He named the robot Jacques 2.0, because who else was there to get confused? And as he grew older, it would be easier to remember his own name, he figured.

Well, years passed as they are wont to do. He grew old and frail on the journey, but Jacques 2.0 remained young and spry, helping his creator to complete the tasks the old man’s bones could no longer handle.

As the old man lay dying, he asked his robotic companion to do him a favor. He wanted his remains to be scattered among the stars, the asteroids, and the comets they passed. He did not want to be buried on a planet he would never see, but instead live on in the vastness of space that had become his home. So when the day finally came, Jacques 2.0 sent his creator’s ashes out of the airlock and into the universe.

But the journey was not over. Jacques 2.0 carried on his creator’s duties for years and helped the crew arrive on their new home. As the ship grew close to the planet, the crew began to wake up. One by one they woke from their long sleep and travelled to the observation deck to see their new home. When they arrived, though, they found themselves in complete shock. There was Jacques, as lively and youthful as ever, waiting for them.

“How can this be?” They asked. “Surely, you would at the very least be an old, old man by now. It has been so long since we left Earth.”

Jacques 2.0 raised his hands slightly in a calming gesture and said, “Do not worry. I am here to send you a message of love and care from Jacques. I was created to help him complete his mission. I may look like him, but in truth, I am not him. For you see,” and with this he gestured towards the stars and space above their heads, “the real Jacques is in the comets.”",The caretaker of a generation ship was on his death bed,165

post,dbdnov,2qh72,jokes,false,1569859106,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dbdnov/the_broken_grandfather_clock/,self.jokes,,"A man once owned a beautiful grandfather clock (well, he probably still does, but let's put that aside for now). Now, when I saw the grandfather clock was beautiful, I mean absolutely gorgeous. The clock stood nearly 6 feet tall, made from the most splendid mahogany wood, accompanied by intricate hand carved detailing. It was the kind of clock that makes one think ""wow, what a fine clock that is.""

But besides its incredible beauty, the grandfather clock was extremely valuable to the man for the heritage it represented. The clock had been in his family for generations, even surviving the trip from Germany in 1939 when his great grandparents fled the Nazis. So, you could imagine the man's utter dismay when the clock stopped working.

Well, it stopped half working I should say. The clock would continue to tik, but it would not tok.

The man's first thought was to contact his father. His father had owned the clock before him, and was a carpenter by trade, so the father was rather good with his hands. The father, distraught by the news that the family grandfather clock had stopped working, came over right away and began looking at the clock to figure out the issue.

""Well, here's your problem,"" the father said. ""The clock can tik, but it won't tok.""

""I know that, pa."" The man said irritably. ""Can you fix it?""

Unfortunately, the father could not. But the pair wouldn't give up there. The two contacted a local clock shop, who happened to employ a man who specialized in grandfather clocks. The father and son thought this would be perfect, and asked the shop to send the repairman over right away.

The repairman came over to the man's house and immediately set up examining the broken grandfather clock. He hmmed and hummed to himself for a while as he tinkered inside the clock. 

""I believe the problem is that the clock can tik, but it cannot tok."" The repairman said.

""We already know that!"" The man and father said in unison. ""Can you fix it?""

The repairman removed his hat rubbed the sweat from his brow. ""I'm afraid this clock is beyond me. It's an advanced design from Germany, only the original designer and builder would have the skills to fix this.""

The situation seemed hopeless. How were they to track down a man in Germany who had been building clocks since before the second world war? It was an impossible task, but the father and the son set out researching the clock and its origins.

After nearly a week, a breakthrough was made. As it turns out, the shop that had built the grandfather clock was still in business, owned by the man who had originally created their grandfather clock! They asked the German clocksmith if he would be willing to travel to take a look at their beloved clock.

""I would be honored to fix your clock,"" the German said. ""It is not every day you get to see one of your original creations!""

So the German flew out to see the father and son and their old grandfather clock. The German arrived at their house, and upon seeing the grandfather clock his face lit up like he was 20 years younger.

""Oh my, she is beautiful!"" He exclaimed. ""You have certainly taken very good care of her. But, what seems to be the problem?""

""The clock can tik, but it cannot tok.""

""Well now,"" the German said, turning towards the clock. ""We have ways of making you tok.""",The Broken Grandfather Clock,70

Jake thought for a moment, and answered;
""Well, I'll probably become and economist, make hundreds of millions of dollars, get myself the perfect whore, give her a couple mills, buy her apartments from Paris and NYC. I'll get her a Ferrari, and anything else she might want, and just fuck her non-stop, all the time.""

The teacher was completely abashed because she didn't expect this kind of answer. She didn't know whether to scold Jake or what she should do, so she decided to simply move on. ""Well, what about you then, Kate?""

No one would come out unless it was for emergencies. As the policeman rounded a corner, his headlights briefly passed over a vacant lot. Herbert quickly noticed something odd, and reversed his car so his headlights pointed in the direction of the weird figure he might have seen.

Sure enough, there was a blanketed person hunched over in the snow about 30 feet from the car. Feeling no danger, Herbert put on his heavy winter jacket and stepped out to get a closer look, bringing a flashlight to see better in the dead of night.

As he approached the person, it became clear that it was an old man covered in the thick clothes and a beanie. ""Poor man,"" the policeman thought,""he must be suffering from one of those brain diseases older folks get."" Within ten feet, Herbert recognized the man as Old Man Millard. This was to almost no surprise, for Old Man Millard was accustomed to spells of wandering aimlessly. He didn't notice Herbert walking towards him.

Years ago, Millard had been full of life and was one of the kindest people in the town. He was almost like a father to Herbert. The years, however, were not kind to Old Man Millard, and he had grown somewhat senile.

""Old Man Millard?"" Herbert asked.

The aged man slowly looked up and gave a welcoming smile. ""Oh, hi, Robert.""

Herbert chuckled at the innocent mistake. A chilling gust of wind blew past, reminding him of the situation.

""Are you alright?""

""Dandy. I've been hugging this thing to keep me warm. My daughter gave it to me."" said Millard. He opened his jacket to reveal a large, battery-powered heating pad that he had been clinging to that was also wrapped around something.

""Whatcha got there?""

""Well, you see, I was walkin' down the street when I saw this picket fence post on the ground. I reckon it came off during the last blizzard. It got me thinkin', this fence piece must feel lonely, on account o' it being away from his loving Ma and Pa fence post. So i decided to take it under my wing. I picked it up and it was freezin', poor thang. I wrapped 'em up in my heatin' pad and me and my new friend Jack the fence post have been settin' here waitin' for him to reach a warm temperatu-""

Suddenly, Millard began to sob, first softly, then uncontrollably. ""I have been puttin' my hand on 'em ever so of'n and he's not gettin' any better. You see, this here, heatin' pad goes only goes up very slowly through the settings.""

Entertained but feeling remorse for his friend, Herbert tried to comfort the sad man. He noticed a meter on the pad with readings that said ""Warm, Slightly Warmer, Mildly Warm, Moderately Warm, and Hot."" The heating pad was already between ""Slightly Warm"" and ""Mildly Warm""

""He won't heat up fast enough. I don't think Jack the fence post will live to feel the highest and most satisfying settin'. He's far too ill to be with us much longer."" Millard cried some more.

Herbert replied:

&amp;#x200B;

It's addressed to ""Dad"".

He picked it up, tore it open and read the note:

""Dear Dad, it is with great regret and sorrow that I write to you.

I had to run away with my new girlfriend because I didn't want to argue with you and Mom.

Margaret-Ann and I discovered true passion. She's so cute.

I know you guys don't approve of her because there are so many rings through her lips, nose and other places,

And she's five years older than me.

But it's not just about passion, Dad. She is also pregnant.

Margaret-Ann says we will be very happy.

She has a caravan standing somewhere in a forest and there is a whole heap of firewood for the winter.

We just want lots of kids.

Margaret-Ann also taught me that marijuana is not bad.

We are going to grow some of it in the woods ourselves and sell to others in the community.

Then with that money we can buy other, more expensive drugs like COKE.

Meanwhile, we hope and pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Margaret-Ann gets healthy. She deserves it !!!!!!!!

Don't worry, Dad.

At least I am already fifteen and can look after myself.

Relax, and enjoy the grandchildren still to come.

&amp;#x200B;

With love

Your son, Jason

&amp;#x200B;

PS !!! Dad, none of this is true!!!! I'm at Nick's.

I just wanted to remind you, Dad, that there are much worse things in life 

than a bad report card.

Call when it's safe to come home !!!!! """,Coulda been worse.,8

The zoo has fallen on hard times financially, so they decided to rent some of their animals outside the usual visitation hours. Usually its the small, cuddly ones, but this man asks for one of the elephants. 

""An elephant?"" The zoo director asks. 

""Yes, the biggest one you have, please"", the man says, quite certain. 

""I mean, we can do that"", the director muses, ""But it won't be cheap. Thats 5.000$ per day of rental alone and an additonal 4.000$ for transportation. And you'll need to feed the elephant on your own bill, too."" 

""That will not be a problem"", the man says. ""I'll just need him for a day, so here's 10.000$ for your troubles."" 

With that settled, the elephant gets transported to the mans address. 

""Very good. Put him in the bedroom on the second floor"", the man orders. The personel tries to get the elephant into the house, but he just doesn't fit through the door. Without hesitation, the man calls a construction company and rents a crane to get the elephant up, through the dismantled window and then re-seal the window at horrifingly high cost. 

""You know what, it is none of my business"", the zoo director asks at this point, ""but I must know: What is this for?"" 

""Well, you see"", the man explains, ""My wifes brother is living with us and he's a horrible know-it-all. Every quiz show we watch, he blurts out the answers before we can even take a guess.

They all know there is only one other place to go, so they wait.  After some time Saint Peter descends with white wings and a tablet in hand and says, ""I am sorry, I have some regrettable news.  There is not room for 3 mansions today, so, if you will all agree you may all have one hut.  If any of you disagrees you may all compete for a single mansion and whoever does not win will spend an eternity in hell."" 2 of the men's faces went blank with mouths gaping as they had no idea what to say, one of them started to smile and ready to agree just as the other man piped up loudly, ""I have never lived in a hut and I'm not about to start now.  Let's compete!"". Quickly, the man who was soon to agree gathers himself to argue for splitting the property, but it was too late. Saint Peter responds, ""I said you must all agree, one of you has disagreed so you must all compete"".

Saint Peter then turns a page and words appear on the tablet magically.  ""The one who will enter the mansion is the one with the strangest and most unlikely death.  You will each tell me your story of surmise and the 2 most modest deaths will enter the hellfire whilst the one who wins will be rich forever"".

The loud man who vouched to compete speaks first: "" I've got this, without a doubt"".  The man straightens himself as if to give a lecture. ""Well, I am a hard-working man with a gorgeous wife, I live in a penthouse on the 25th floor of the fanciest building in my city.  Unfortunately, I give myself to my job often more than I should and have assumed for some time my wife has been having an affair.  I had it all planned.  On Thursday I was given the day off so on Thursday I would pretend to go to work.  Wait a couple of hours, then just in the house and catch her in the act.  I couldn't wait.  Thursday came and everything went as planned.  She kissed me goodbye, I pretended to leave, I waited 2 hours and I busted in the door like a mad man and walked straight to the bedroom and there she was, shocked and red in the face gasping for a breath like she had been running a marathon.  But, no man.  I questioned her, I yelled at her, I threw things, I grabbed her around her neck and threatened her, but she wouldn't say a thing.  Then it hit me, I'm on the 25th floor, there is only one way in and he couldn't have passed me to leave.  So, I started searching. I looked under the bed, in the closet, behind the couch, around then plants, I looked everywhere I could think.  Just when I was ready to apologize I glanced out on the sunlit balcony and just barely... Just barely... There they were.  8 fingers.  So without a word I head out there and start screaming at him and I'm so angry i can't even pronounce half my words.  And can you believe it, this asshole starts laughing at me.  So, I start pulling his fingers off one by one.  And he keeps putting them back and now I can see the fear in his eyes.  But, I don't care, I'm angry, so  I start screaming louder at him and I start stomping on his fingers.  And I mean in Stomping on his fingers, I'm really really stomping on them, they're turning red and purple and bruised and bloody.... But he won't let go.  I'm still angry so I go and grab my hammer and I start pounding on his finger and I'm pounding them hard.  I'm going to work like I want nothing left of these fingers.  His fingers hardly look like fingers anymore, I mean he's crying and he's looking at me for help and I'm sorry I'm not the one to help this guy at this point.  It's past that.  I turn the hammer around and I pry each and every one of those fingers off the deck and this guy falls.  All 25 floors.  I thought to his death, but can you believe he landed in a bush?  I wasn't even mad anymore but I knew he would tell the authorities what I did and I had to make sure he wouldn't talk... So, I'm pushing my refrigerator and I'm pushing my refrigerator and I get it to the edge and I'm exhausted.  I bend down and push up just barely enough to get it over and it drops down and bullseye.  The bloods had to have flown up 5 floors.  Seeing all this I stop and look back at my wife who's face is white as snow and tears soaking the bed sheets she has pulled over her naked body.  In that moment, I started regretting my actions, I have never done anything like this, and started hyperventilating and I noticed my left arm tingling.  I fell to the ground and not long after i arrived here.""

Before Saint Peter could respond he just had to chime in further, ""I am obviously the winner.""

Saint Peter responds, "" Wow!  If anyone wants to back out now, feel free. Otherwise, feel free to compete. ""

The 2nd man chimes in, "" A strange death?  Well, that was adventurous, but, what is strange about having a heart attack after killing someone?  I have a real 'strange' death for you.  I was in my apartment, doing chores, folding clothes and washing dishes and making breakfast when suddenly I stepped out on my patio to catch my breath when a large bird came out of nowhere from my left side and bolted straight at my head.  I juked to dodge it's oncoming assault and slipped over the rail.  I was lucky to grab onto a neighbor's ledge and was hanging for some time when I heard screaming and crashing of things and accusations and glass breaking.  Then I heard the patio open.  I tried to ask for help but the resident was enraged and wouldn't listen to a word.  He started trying to pull my fingers off the ledge instead of helping me up.  But, i held on.  Next, he started stomping on my fingers, and stomping on my fingers.  It hurt like hell but it was either to choose to take the pain or die.  So I held on. And he kept stomping and screaming and stomping and spitting.  And I held on to save my life.  Amd he leaves.  I catch my breath, but I'm crying from the pain.  I can barely hold anymore and I think my fingers are broken.  Just then he comes back with the hammer and I just went blank.  And he started hammering my fingers and hammering my fingers and just smashing away at them.  The pain turned into numbness and I was sure I would fall.  I think he might have hammered right through some of them.  But somehow I managed to still be stuck to the ledge even though I I had given up.  And would you believe it, the maniac turned around the hammer and pryed each finger off until I fell.  I must have fallen 20 stories.  I just gave myself to the Lord and closed my eyes.  I was waiting to see his face when I realized I was still in my body.  So, I open my eyes to call out to him and getting larger from a distance I see it.  It was a.. oh yes, a refrigerator.  I did not know at the time that the first man was involved, but it's clear that I am the winner and that God is truly just.  He has given me a sign and the fact that he is the killer should be the icing on the cake.  What do you say Saint Peter?  Is my name written on your tablet now? ""

Saint Peter l, without looking down just replies, "" There is but one competitor left, we shall see.""

The 3rd man quickly responds, ""I've been hanging this gorgeous woman for a while now, but I had no idea she was married.  One day, the elevator chimes and she tells me it's her husband and I have to hide.  I'm looking left, I'm looking right. Under the bed didn't look clever, can't conceal myself behind the plant.  I go out on the patio but there is some idiot out there screaming and panicking and causing attention, and I can hear the door clanking open for the elevator, so I jumped in the refrigerator because it looked like it was my size, and that's the last thing I remember.

It's long. 

A man walks into a pub, orders himself a pint, and sits at a small table in the corner by himself. He enjoys his beer for five minutes when suddenly another man comes bursting through the doors of the bar. He frantically scans the room with his eyes and locks gazes with the man by himself in the corner. He points at him and shouts,

""You there, sir! I don't have enough time to explain why, but you must move from there or you will die!""

""Right,"" exclaims the man, ""and by the time I do that Donald J. Trump himself is gonna come through that door too and you two are gonna have lunch right here! I'm not moving."" The other gentleman runs up to him, yanks him up out of the seat by his shirt collar and says,

""I'm sorry sir, but you need to move now!"" He throws him across the bar room floor and takes a dive out of the corner right behind him. No sooner do they both hit the floor a three quarter ton truck comes crashing through the wall of the bar, destroying the small table, the chair next to it, and that whole corner. Surely the man would have died. The saved man looks at this gentleman and gasps,

""How did you know that was going to happen?""

""To be honest I'm clairvoyant; In other words I am blessed with glimpses of the future,"" explains the other man, ""I was walking past this establishment just now when I was struck with a vision of that exact same truck coming through that exact same wall. Naturally I rushed in to try and save anyone in danger, and here we are."" The saved man in disbelief opens his mouth to say more, but finds himself unable to speak.

""I can understand your disbelief,"" concurs the Clairvoyant, ""and to prove to you I am no hoax-""
He closes his eyes, pauses, opens them and calmly states, ""There is no driver to that vehicle."" The emergency services show up, sort things out and release a statement that there were no casualties and there was, in fact, no driver inside the vehicle. The saved man confronts the clairvoyant afterwards and aks him 

""How did you obtain this ability?""

""It is true I was not born with this gift, it can be taught. I warn you however if you seek to learn; The process is strange and you must follow my instructions exactly as I tell you to.""

""Well hey, you did save my life, so I think I owe it to ya.""

""Excellent!"" the Clairvoyant quietly exclaims, ""Meet me in the restroom in fifteen minutes. We will begin your training right there."" So the saved man waits fifteen minutes and then walks into the restroom. He is greeted by the Clairvoyant who says coldly, ""Alright, exactly as I say remember? I need you to stand there, arms at your side, and to close your eyes."" So the saved man closed his eyes and relaxes himself with arms at his sides. He feels the clairvoyant take his wallet, his watch, car keys and strips him naked. He hears a flush as his clothes are flushed down the toilet, and he hears a click. The man flings his eyes open to see the clairvoyant standing there pointing a gun at his head. 

""Alright just what the fuck is going on here?"" He exasperates.

""Well to be honest I'm flying by the seat of my pants here,"" huff's the clairvoyant half confused himself. ""When I forgot to set the hand brake in my truck I never expected it to play out this far!""",The Saved Man and the Clairvoyant,5

On his way back he slips and falls and dies so the priest tries to look for someone else. He finds another guy for the job and he does very well but suffers the same fait as the first guy.

As the priest was ready to give up, a man with no arms came and offered to ring the bell. The priest is surprised but let's him try. So the guy climbs up the stairs and starts slamming his face against the bell before coming back down. Unfortunately he falls all the way down and ends up dying too. At this point a crowd came rushing in and began asking the priest who this guy was.

The priest said:
""I don't know but his face rings a bell""

""Which one of your took my horse? I'm going to have one more drink, and if it isn't back by then, I'm going to have to do what I did in Texas, and I DIDNT LIKE what I had to do in Texas.""

And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.

For example… One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed.

Well, the passion started to heat up, but then she said ""I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.""

I said ""WHAT??!! What was that?!""

So she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...""You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.""

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, ""Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?""

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.

Let me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, ""That's fine, honey.""

She appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, ""I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.""

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No honey, I don't feel like it.""

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, ""WHAT?""

I then said ""Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.

You're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.""

And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?""

Apparently, no sex tonight either!",NO SEX TONIGHT!,897

post,datvvv,2qh72,jokes,false,1569755953,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/datvvv/your_duck_is_dead/,self.jokes,,"A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.

After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.""

The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?""

""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet..

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested.. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.""

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said “I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""

The vet turned to his computer, hit a few keys and produced a bill which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1,500!"" she cried,""$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan it's now $1,500.""",Your duck is dead.,250

No one is forced to read the stickied comment explaining it and most people read the joke before looking at the comments section. There are so many people including myself who say “IDGI” or “OOTL” in the comments, and when we do not understand a joke it takes longer than it should to get an explanation because they might not be upvoted very high to see an explanation.

Jokes are awesome, and in social settings explaining the joke can ruin it, but on a text-sub like r/jokes I think stickying an explanation (like r/betereveryloop where the OP submits the reason for posting the gif and the automod stickies it to the top of the comments) from OP would be a nice touch to r/jokes for all my people who don’t get them.",[Serious] We should have joke explanations stickied in the comments.,3

He got a few bites and after shooting a few small acts, his work really took off, developing a reputation for the way he seemed to disappear from the scene and capture what felt like private moments with the band members, which fans absolutely loved. He had an interesting technique of using props to conceal himself while staying absolutely still, making it easier for his subjects to see him as simply part of the scenery.

Before long, clients started coming to him knowing his films were great for publicity, and one day got a call from the manager of one of his favorite jam bands.

""We want you to cover the next Phish tour,"" said the manager. The filmmaker was overjoyed and immediately started thinking about how to capture the moment. The first stop of the tour was at a makeshift outdoor arena far from town, so as was his custom, he waited backstage for the band and introduced himself and his props. ""Since we're in a black tent right now, I'm wearing black canvas so I blend in. Just try to forget I'm here.""

Though the band was amused, the man was too nervous to be around his idols and kept fidgeting. Reviewing his footage the next day, he saw they kept noticing him and breaking the flow of conversation. He discarded the footage in disgust, resolving to try again.

&amp;#x200B;

The second stop of the tour was at a large commercial venue with luxurious backstage accommodations, expensive mirrors and upholstery. He again waited for the band, this time upping his commitment to his props: ""since this place is decorated like a hotel, I've set up a couch where I'll be sitting and covering myself in pillows so I blend in. Just try to forget I'm here.""

The band said no problem, but unfortunately just like before, he was too nervous, shifting and twitching so much that pillows kept falling everywhere. He excused himself early and returned to his work room, frustrated, knowing his footage was ruined again. The band's manager heard what had happened and called him demanding to know what was going on. When he explained that he was too starstruck for his technique to work, the manager was furious.

""We've already paid you half your contract up front on reputation, and you can't produce any footage of Phish at all? I'll take you to court!""

The filmmaker tried to explain but the manager was enraged. Finally, the man pleaded ""Just give me one more chance, my technique is solid, the atmosphere is just so different than I'm used to in my work. One more night before you decide. Please?""

Finally, the manager relented, and hung up after telling him he had one day to provide a sample of usable footage.

Still, the manager was incredulous. ""But it's not just the technique, they look so relaxed, like there's no one else in the room at all. Wasn't it hard to get them to let their guard down?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Not at all!"" said the filmmaker. ""It was easy, like shooting Phish in a barrel.""",A man was studying to be a filmmaker...,4

However, the 3rd soldier, being quite hungry had already eaten his. Not wishing to break solidarity he hastily painted a hand grenade bright red and tossed it out along with the other two soldiers' banana and apple.

The plane landed safely and the soldiers each went their separate ways. 

The first soldier came across an old man kneeling in prayer, throat singing ""oh bananna, ooooh banana"" over and over. The soldier tapped the old man who lifted his head from the ground, revealing the smashed, sticky fruit. Gooey chunks slid down the sun dried wrinkles of his face. ""I asked the lord for a sign"" the old man beamed. ""God sent a bananna from the heavens. Ooooh banana, banana"". He continued. Knowing the truth of it, and not wishing to argue, the soldier gave a small bow and proceeded home.

The second soldier came across a young man, laying spread eagle across his route home. Being all to familiar with death he bent low to investigate and found it to be his own little brother, now a grown man. The soldier wept bitterly for hours, and when he noticed the smashed bits of apple in his brother's bloody scalp, he put the puzzle together, wept some more and proceeded home. 

The third soldier came across an old lady laughing uncontrolably. Occasionally she would pause, look around at the rubble and debri surrounding her and then continue laughing in hysterical fits. ""Good day madam"" the soldier said. Now that he was stepping closer he noticed dust painted across her face and unnaturally disheveled hair, ""Are you allright?"" He continued. ""No!"" She was able to get out the one word before falling backwards and landing on her large behind like a toddler. She pounded her fists in the dirt, tears streaming down her raucous face as she was unable to quell the laughter. ""I..."" she tried in between the fits. ""Take a deep breath"", the soldier urged. She did. And in between the laughter he heard her say, ""I farted and my house blew up!""",3 soldiers flying home are asked to each discard an item before landing to lessen the planes weight...,0

It honestly put such a strain on our relationship. The only thing that seemed to turn her off, as much as tongues turned her on, is alcohol. She can't stand the sight or smell of it. So naturally I started drinking when I'd come home from work. Beer, whiskey, brandy, anything that would put the taste and smell of alcohol on my mouth. 

Of course this habit put an even bigger strain on the relationship, me being drunk most of the time now. So we went to counseling to sort things out. The counselor told us to try and limit our vices. I'd stop drinking as a hobby, and she'd try and focus on more than just my tongue.

Finally, they went to the fair, and Walter said to Ethel, ""Ethel, you know I'm 87 years old now. If I don't ride that helicopter this year, I may never get another chance."" Once again Ethel replied, ""Walter, you know that helicopter is 50 dollars and 50 dollars is 50 dollars.""

He stands up, jumps out of the boat, walks across the water, grabs a soda out of the truck, walks back across the water and into the boat. The Pentecostal pastor is stunned and a bit overwhelmed when the Catholic priest gets up and says, ""That sounds great, I think I'll go get one too."" Then he gets up, walks across the water, gets a drink, then walks back across the water into the boat. Not wanting to be outdone the Pentecostal pastor gets us and boldly declares, ""I'm thirsty too, I'm going to go get me a drink too!"" He stands up, takes a breath, says a silent prayer and steps out onto the water. SPLASH! He sank like a rock, got himself back up and into the boat then prayed fervently to heaven, ""Lord God hear me, grant me this special anointing, allow me to not be ashamed in front of these other men!"" He put one foot up on the edge of the boat and lept over the side only to sink to the bottom again. He managed to get himself back into the boat and this time he started singing, shouting, and praying in tongues before he lept over the side, again to no avail. As he was pulling himself up this third time he overheard the Baptist ask the Priest, ""How many times are we going to let him do this before we tell him where the rocks are?""",A new pentecostal pastor moved into town...,1

post,dah7pn,2qh72,jokes,false,1569683464,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dah7pn/bud_the_cowboy/,self.jokes,,"A cowboy named Bud was overseeing his herd in a remote mountainous pasture in Montana when suddenly a brand-new 2019 AUDI advanced towards him out of a cloud of dust. The driver, a young man named Cliff in a Brioni® suit, Gucci® shoes, RayBan® sunglasses and YSL® tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?""


  Bud looks at the man, who obviously knows more than the cowboy, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, why not?"" 


  The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell® notebook computer, connects it to his Apple iPhone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.  

  The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop® and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany


  Within seconds, he receives an email on his Apple iPad® that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL® database through an ODBC connected Excel® spreadsheet with email on his Galaxy S5® and, after a few minutes, receives a response.  

Finally, he prints out a full-color,15 page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet® printer, turns to the cowboy and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves."" 


  ""That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,"" says Bud.  He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car. Then Bud says to the young man, ""Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?""  
   

The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ""Okay, why not?"" 


""You're a Congressman for the U.S.Government,"" says Bud.  
 
""Wow! That's correct,"" says the yuppie, “but how did you guess that?"" 


  ""No guessing required."" answered the cowboy.  ""You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know  how working people make a living –you know nothing about cows, for that matter. This is a herd of sheep.”

Whatever joy i had only seemed to dwindle over time, as my hokey pokey induced stupors reduced an eternal bond to several years of a loveless marriage. 




And believe me, I tried so hard to make things work, but whenever I’d come down, it was always the same old song and dance. We’d have horrible fights til the break of dawn, often confining me to a comfortless hell masquerading a common family couch. I hated that couch, not because it’s lack of comfort, or the strange concoction of pungency that emanates from its many conspicuous stains... But because I knew that couch could support a family when I couldn’t. 




It wasn’t long after that realization that she took the kids, the house, everything. All I could even think about was getting more hokey in my system. Before I knew it, I began trading favors behind an Arby’s for it, a pokey for a pokey as they’d say. The pay wasn’t good, but it got me my fix. It wasn’t long after that i graduated to harder things. 



But life isn’t all about doing lines of Congo. That was, until the day my - lets just call him an employer - was shot dead over some stolen Macarena. And so? Here I am. You probably thought this was a story about my triumph. That I could turn myself around? No, you wind up in a ditch without a dollar to your name, and that’s what it’s all about.",I used to be addicted to the Hokey Pokey..,2
