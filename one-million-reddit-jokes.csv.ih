“Number seventeen,” the father said, looking quite smug. 
The other two chuckled, and one of them mumbled “Good one, good one...” and then muttered “But I still think number forty-three is better.”
The other two now laughed wholeheartedly, and the third friend exclaimed “It is, it is... but I think you’re both forgetting ninety-seven.” 
All three now laughed so hard that the boy’s father almost lost his balance on the bench they were sitting on, all the while the boy sat beside them, totally confused as to what was happening.

“Sorry,” he said, “what are you laughing about?” His dad explained: “Y’know, one day we just got tired of telling each other jokes we’ve all heard before, so we started numbering them. We just tell each other the number of the joke, and the other two recall the joke.” 

Now the boy understood. As self-confident as he was, he proudly stated “Number 127.” 
Instantly after saying that, the three men began _roaring_ with laughter. One of them even fell off the bench and started to roll around on the boat floor, completely hysterical.

As proud as he was, the boy couldn’t avoid being curious as to what his hilarious joke could be. He tried asking his father, who had to calm himself down before answering.

The only available seat is next to a nun. 
I HATE nuns, he thinks. It’s the only available seat, so he begrudgingly sits down next to her. 
After a few minutes, she runs her head ever so slightly and he can see her face. 
She’s the most beautiful woman he’s ever seen. 
He can’t control himself and he accidentally blurts out, “I HAVE TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU!”

“Well, I never!” The nun says, shaking her head and signaling the driver to stop the bus. 

She storms off and he follows up to the front of the bus and watches as the bus pulls away, leaving the nun standing at the gates to a cemetery. 

“That nun was the sexiest thing I’ve ever seen!” The man says to the bus driver. “I have to have sex with her!”

“Here’s what you do,” the bus driver says, in his gruff New York accent. “I know for a fact, that Nun goes to this cemetery every night after dark. If you come back at night dressed up as God, you can trick her into having sex with you!”

The guy thinks about it— solid plan. 

He comes back to the cemetery after dark dressed as God. 

He walks up behind the praying nun and says in a booming voice, “IT’S ME, GOD! I’VE COME TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU!”

“Oh lord!” The nun says, pointing to her vaginal area. “This is sacred. You can have my butt.”

“ALRIGHT THEN!” He days again in his booming God voice. 

Then, they have amazing butt sex in the cemetery. As soon as the guy finishes, he whips off his disguise and says, “HAHA! It’s ME, the guy from the bus!”

The nun turns and whips off her disguise and says, “HAHA! It’s ME, the bus driver!”",A guy gets on a bus... [long],192

Tonight, I thought my husband was acting weird.  We had made plans to meet at a nice restaurant for dinner. I was shopping with my friends all day long, so I thought he was upset at the fact that I was a bit late but he made no comment on it. 

Conversation wasn't flowing, so I suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we could talk.

He agreed, but he didn't say much. 
  
I asked him what was wrong; He said, ""Nothing."" 

I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. 

He said he wasn't upset, that it had nothing to do with me, and not to worry about it. 

On the way home, I told him that I loved him. 

He smiled slightly, and kept driving.  I can't explain his behavior. 
I don't know why he didn't say, “I love you, too.” 

When we got home, I felt as if I had lost him completely, as if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore.
He just sat there quietly, and watched TV.  He continued to seem distant and absent. 

Finally, with silence all around us, I decided to go to bed.  About 15 minutes later, he came to bed.

We were up all night doing cocaine and now my friend can't stop running in circles."" ""Not to worry gentlemen, I have just the thing for you"", the doctor replies.

The doctor reaches into a drawer and retrieves a bag of blue powder. ""Run on over here and snort some of this blue powder, it should slow you down."" So, the black guy runs over and snorts the powder off the table. His friend realizes that he's no longer running, and has slowed to a jog.

""Doc, it's working! Give him some more and make him walk."" Sure enough the doctor lays some more powder onto the table, the black guy snorts it and slows down to a walk. 

""Alright Doc give him a big old blast, and make him go to sleep."" The doctor lays out a huge pile of this powder, and when the black guy snorts it, he immediately lays down and goes to sleep. 

""Doctor you're a miracle worker, but I have to ask what's the blue powder?""

The only issue was that he had a harelip, so he was hard to understand. One day, he sees a man walking up the street selling laundry detergent door to door, and approaches him. The man says in a cracking voice, ""excuse me sir, are you hiring?"" The salesman replies, ""I don't think you're cut out for the job."" The man persists and finally, the salesman hands him a couple of jugs and says, ""Fine. Go to these next three houses and try to sell these jugs of Blue Dream Laundry Detergent. Do you know our jingle?""

""No,"" the man replies, voice still cracking.

""Well, it goes like this;

'Blue Dream can make all your clothes clean!

Washy washy washy,

Rinsy rinsy rinsy,

Put it to your nose, *sniff*

Smells like a rose!'

Got it, kid?""

""I think so,"" the man replies, and heads to his first door. He knocks and an older man opens the door. The man begins his pitch and has the door slammed in his face. He goes back to the salesman in defeat. ""I can't do it,"" he says shamefully. 

""No no, it's easier to find the houses where the men are at work and the woman is home. Try that one, I see lights on but no car."" He gestures to a house a little ways down. ""See if anyone's home.""

He goes to knock on the door and is met with a gorgeous woman in nothing but underwear and a bathrobe over it all. 

""H- hi ma'am,"" he begins shakily. ""I'm here with Blue Dream Laundry Detergent. May I offer a demonstration?""

She smiles in pity and invites him in. He finds two buckets, fills them with warm water from the sink and adds some detergent to one so it has plenty of bubbles. He approaches the woman now seated on the couch, and says, ""may I have an article that needs washing?"" 

She gets a look of panic on her face and says, ""all of my laundry is caught up except for what I've got on!"" Her expression changes and she adds, ""hold on a second, I'll be back."" She goes to another room and removes her bra for the man to wash. 

""Thank you ma'am.""

He dips it in the soapy water and begins:

""Blue Dream can make all your clothes clean!

Washy washy washy,

Rinsy rinsy rinsy,

Put it to your nose, *sniff*

Smells like a rose!""

The woman smells for herself and is impressed. ""May I see it again?"" She asks. 

""Of course, I just need another article."" She goes to the other room and removes her panties for him to wash, and he begins.

""Blue Dream can make all your clothes clean!

The chicken runs to the farmer, but the farmer can't be found. So he drives the farmer's Mercedes back to the hole and ties some rope around the bumper. He then throws the other end of the rope to his friend and drives forward saving the horse from sinking.

A few days later, the chicken and horse are playing in the meadow again, and the chicken falls into a mud hole. The chicken tells the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. The horse says: ""I think I can get you out.""  
So he stretches over the width of the hole and says: ""Grab hold of my 'thing' and pull yourself up.""  
The chicken does this and is pulled to safety.

Two criminally insane robotics engineers, Frank and Ned, are working on their mad personal robotics projects in their jointly rented workshop. Though both are criminally insane geniuses, neither can afford to rent a warehouse of their own, so they pitch in together and share one where they can both work on their evil projects of doom and destruction. This is not ideal, as Frank and Ned actually quite dislike each other, but the mutual benefit in undeniable. Subterranean secret lairs aren’t as affordable as they used to be, you know. One evening, just a few days before rent is due, Frank breaks the usual silence and pipes up with a tone of thick arrogance in his voice:

“ah! Finished with the latest in a long line of successful projects. This one only took two days and scrap material I had sitting around, yet I know for certain, without any doubt in the world, it will work beautifully on the first go! My own genius sometimes amazes even myself.”

Ned, annoyed with his co-renter’s arrogance and off-put by his sudden unwanted chattiness, replies: “and how can you, good sir, be so sure it will work without having given it a few test runs?”

“Oh, I’m sure.” Frank responds with a grin and smug chuckle.

Ned, overcome with annoyance for his unbearable co-renter, pushes on: “Alright buddy, no project ever goes perfectly on the first try. We’re both experienced enough mad engineers to know that...At least, I thought we had both attained that wisdom. So without even knowing what your silly new machine does, I’ll bet next month’s rent it doesn't work on the first go."" 

This was not the first time Frank and Ned have bet a month or two of rent in the heat of a moment of anger. Though neither could afford the subterranean secret lair long-term on their own, both had a few month’s survival cash on reserve, just in case the other got themselves killed during project, so they could afford to throw some cash around a little from time to time.

Frank accepts Ned’s bet enthusiastically and without hesitation. He hastily flips a switch, and the machine starts up. Whirring. Hissing. Gears and bobs move and throb. A large hammer-like device at the top of the menacing, looming structure is cranked up and tensioned, higher and higher, visibly building with destructive potential, looking as though it is about to smash the very machine that moves it! Crank. Click. Klank-kluh-crank. The tension builds and chord tighten as the machine’s maiden use seems to be building to a violent climax. Ned wonders what this destructive looking contraptions exact function is. Most immediately, Ned wonders if he’s safe in such close proximity to it. Frank has been known to make some rather explosive builds in the past, after all. 

Frank notices Ned’s worried look, and cheerfully yells over the noise of the beastly machine: “Worry not, my good sir! We are probably safe!” 
 The cranking continues, and the machine appears as if it is about to smash itself to smithereens! At the last jarring, intense moment of stress and cranking of gears...Nothing. The machine lets out a decompressing hiss and appears to have stopped dead in its tracks. A few gears and bolts fall, a sticky, green oil leaks onto the cement of the warehouse floors. The hammer never strikes. The machine is dead. 

Ned exclaims triumphantly: “Haha! Your silly little project broke! You failed! Next months rent is on you, buddy! That’s what you get for putting so much faith in an untested project that took you only two days to build, you silly fool.” With victory in hand, curiosity inevitably consumes Ned’s scientific mind. “What was this failed joke of a contraption suppose to do, anyhow?” 

Frank, patiently listening to Ned revel in his assumed victory, responds calmly: “True, things did not go exactly to plan. But actually, friend, I believe you owe me next month’s rent, because my self-destruction machine seems to have broken itself just fine.""",The Machine,3

David was nervous about Lorraine’s possible reaction to his story and kept quiet until he finally got the nervous to tell her.  David told Lorraine they had to break up and Lorraine was shocked and stepped to the side of the sidewalk to glare at him. But in doing so, Lorraine lost her footing and fell off the path and rolled into the river! 

David looked as Lorraine fell into the river and he thought for a second... should I jump in? With a shoulder shrug he said

So as according to the condition Frog asked,“Speak your three wishes. But there is a condition. Whatever wish you tell, your Husband would get 10 times more than you”

The woman agreed. And told her first wish,“Make me the most beautiful lady of the world.”

Frog warned, “This will make your Husbandthe most handsome Man in the world. Do you still want it?”

Woman told, “Yes. Because when I am the most beautiful, he would only see me.”

Frog, “Okay. Your wish is completed. Next one.”

Woman, after becoming most beautiful lady,“Okay now make me the richest Lady.”

Frog, “Think about it again.”

A black hearse was followed by a second black hearse about 50 feet behind the first one. Behind the second hearse was a solitary Italian man walking a dog on a leash. Behind him, a short distance back, were about 200 men walking in single file.

The Jewish man couldn't stand the curiosity. He respectfully approached the Italian man walking the dog and said: ""I am so sorry for your loss, and this may be a bad time to disturb you, but I've never seen an Italian funeral like this. Whose funeral, is it?""

""My wife's.""

''What happened to her?""

""She yelled at me and my dog attacked and killed her.""

He inquired further, ""But who is in the second hearse?""

“My mother-in-law. She came to help my wife and the dog turned on her and killed her also.""

It was a very poignant and touching moment of Jewish and Italian brotherhood. Silence passed between the two men.

The Jewish man then asked ""Can I borrow the dog?""

He picked it up and opened it. Inside was a small, black seed. There was a note: If you crack me open, there's a surprise inside!

The man thought to himself, that's an interesting seed. He resolved to crack it open and find out what was inside.

When he got home, he used a knife and tried to slice the seed open. He gently slid it across first, then he used more force, until finally he tried stabbing the knife through. The seed held while the knife bent. Next, the man tried using a hammer and smashing the seed. He tapped the seed at first, then he smashed it, and finally he raised the hammer above his head and brought it down with all his might. Anything else would have been pulverized. The seed held. The man fumed. *I will break open this seed if it's the last thing I do!*

The man brought the seed to a scientist and told her that the seed would not break no matter what he did. The scientist conducted basic experiments on the seed. She found nothing that allowed the seed to withstand great force. She laughed at the man, taking him to her lab where she would attempt to break it.

The scientist first used tools and force, as the man had initially done. She used a knife, then a hammer, then a press made out of steel plates. At the end, there was a indent in the steel where the seed was pressed, and the seed was still there. The scientist tapped her chin. 'This was a remarkable seed', she thought. 

The scientist moved the seed under a high heat laser. The seed was soon covered in the smoke that erupted. The scientist first put it under low heat, then medium heat, then high heat. As the smoke cleared, the seed was still there, almost defiantly. 

The man made it his life's dream to solve the mystery. He brought the seed to many experts around the world. They all could not make the seed crack. After the many attempts and failures, the man turned to the idea of a key word. He studied the seed.

*Were there any indentations? Would secret words appear? What is unusual about this seed?*

He looked at the seed under UV light. He prodded and tapped every part of the seed, hoping that some secret mechanism would trigger and he would finally be at peace. There weren't.

This dream consumed the man until he was old, when he had a loving wife, many children and grandchildren, a house, and of course, he still had the seed.

Even as he lay on his deathbed, his mind was occupied with finally cracking the seed. He spoke with a trembling, weak voice, telling his son to get his seed. The family shot looks at each other but they respected his wishes while he was on his deathbed. The son got the seed and gave it to his father. 

The man stroked the seed lovingly, the object that had stolen so many years of his life. He thought of one last keyword.

He breathed, ""Open Sesame.""

And it did.

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Dave was bragging to his boss one day.,94

Just then, he heard the mechanic honk the horn and start backing the car out of the garage and into a spot. The Eskimo quickly wolfed down the last two donuts and paid his check. With donut glaze all over his face, on his nose, his neck, and his chest, he walked across the street and towards the mechanic. He asked, ""So how's my car?""

Little Johnny's teacher asks the class to go home and think of a story to be concluded with the moral of that story. 
The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story.
Little Suzy raises her hand. 
""My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. 
Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.""
When the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, ""Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.""
Little Lucy went next. 
""My dad owns a farm too. 
Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. 
Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched."";
Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.
Lucy replied, ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch.""
Next up was little Johnny. 
""My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. 
He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. 
On the way down, he drank the case of beer. 
Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. 
He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! 
So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. 
Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""
The teacher looked a little shocked. 
After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.
""Well,"" Johnny replied, ""Don't fuck with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.""",One day at the end of class.....,53

He settled disputes fairly, and ruled with grace and compassion. And he lived a humble life. No palaces for this king; he lived in a straw hut just like the rest of his subjects, and shared out the tribes resources so that no-one went hungry.  

He was, unsurprisingly, loved by his tribe, and with the twentieth anniversary of his coronation coming up, they decided to honour him with a magnificent throne, so that even if his hut was small and plain, he would sit on a throne befitting his great stature. 

So, without him knowing, they set about making the throne. They got the finest carpenter in the land to build an intricate frame, covered in beautiful carvings. Next, came the blacksmith. He wrought beautiful inlays of silver and copper, a furrier selected the finest pelts for the seats, and the jeweller set in an array of stones, the likes of which you could barely imagine. The throne was truly a masterpiece.  

Now, obviously, they couldn't have the king see his present, so after it was done, they hid it in a hut in the edge of the village until the day of the celebtation.  Eventually, the big day arrived. Calves were slaughtered, and a mighty feast was prepared. The whole village was beautifully decorated, and the people were having a wonderful time. 

As the end of the feast approached, some men were dispatched to the hut to retrieve the king's gift. But, as they opened the door to the hut, they spotted a scene of devastation. The throne was ruined! The wood was rotten and full of termites, the beautiful fur was covered in mould. All the stones had fallen from their mountings, and the metals were all tarnished. All their beautiful work was wasted. 

And the moral of the story?  

People who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.",The king,6

They rent a cabin on a lake out in the middle of nowhere.

The first day, Jesus takes a wine glass, fills it with water and turns it into wine! Moses is suitably impressed.

The second day, they go out on the lake and catch two fish, and Jesus multiplies them so they'll have plenty. Moses is, again, impressed.

The third day, Jesus decides to walk across the lake. He walks out, but pretty soon the water is up to his knees and he heads back.

""Why can't I walk on water, Moses?"" he asked.

""I have no idea. Let's take a break and try again tomorrow.""

The next day, Jesus wades out, and again he sinks. ""I just can't understand it!"" he cried.

""I still can't figure it out,"" said Moses. ""We'll give it one more try tomorrow.""

The next day, Jesus walked out into the lake again. ""Why can't I walk on water anymore?""

Moses thinks for a moment, then asks, ""Well...did you have the holes in your feet last time?""",So Jesus decides to come back to earth...,1093

post,96of19,2qh72,jokes,false,1534071556,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/96of19/there_was_once_a_priest_who_went_to_see_the_world/,self.jokes,,"After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.

Many years passed by like that.

At the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.

With his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:

- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked:

- Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.

A week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:

- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked:

- Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:

- Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.

- Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:

- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:

- Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.

- Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:

- Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.

- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!

- There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:

- But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:

- Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?

- All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.

The priest was good, and never told anyone.",There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath.,26

The woman says “Yes actually I’d like two scoops, one strawberry and one vanilla.”

“Alright, anything else?” Says the man

“Yes, could you put some chocolate sauce on top if we have any? And you should write this down so you don’t forget.”

“Don’t worry hun.” Says the man. “I won’t forget, anything else?”

“Well if we have some fresh strawberries could you cut some up and put them on top? And at this point I really think you should write this down like the doctor said” says the woman

The man sighs and says “Two scoops, one strawberry, one vanilla, chocolate sauce on top and fresh strawberries if available. Don’t worry hun I think I can handle it.”
