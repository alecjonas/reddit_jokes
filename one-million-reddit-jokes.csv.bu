post,dxsoki,2qh72,jokes,false,1574025211,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dxsoki/two_boys_in_egypt_free_a_crocodile/,self.jokes,,"In a small village in Egypt lived two orphan boys, Set and Amenhotep. They always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.

One day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher’s snare. The two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.

Once freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! “Thank you, young men” said the fairy, “Your hearts are truly selfless, and I will grant each of you one wish. What are your names?”

“This is my friend Set, and you can call me ‘Ep’”, said Amenhotep.

“Very well, Ep” said the fairy “What is the desire of your heart?”

“I wish I was the strongest man in the world!” Amenhotep wished. 

“Very well”, said the fairy, “but you must always use your strength to help others.” Smoke gathered around Amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared Ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles. 

The fairy turned to Set “And what is your wish, Set?”
Set responded “I never want to be poor again! I wish for money!”

“Very well,” said the fairy. Smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. “Greetings, sirs! My name is Elmon, and I am here to serve!”

“Elmon is an expert in all things money,” said the fairy, “He will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.”

Amenhotep and Set were inseparable. True to his word, Amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. Set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now massive Amenhotep earned him the nickname “Imp”. With Elmon’s financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and Elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.  

Years passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. Amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, Josep. 

Ep and Set’s business expanded globally. 15 years passed and Amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. Set built a campus in Cairo for the headquarters of their business, and directed global efforts. Over the years, Set lost touch with the people he was helping, and became more focused on business expansion and money of the business. 

As all fathers do, Amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. He sent Josep to the the HQ in Cairo to learn business from Set. Once there, Josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of Elmon, the elf.

Josep spent months at HQ learning how to run the business. While there, Set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. Instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. He sent Josep with the proposal to Elmon to determine the financial logistics.

Upon reading the proposal and its ill-nature’s effect on Set’s fellow man, Elmon keeled over and died, instantly.

Josep was shocked, and ran to alert Set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. In a rage, he accused Josep of killing Elmon, and sent the teenager to jail.

Amenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to Cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.

Without the financial and legal savvy of Elmon, Set’s case was a mess. Amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. “Come, Imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. Let’s use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.”

Set refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame Josep for Elmon’s murder.

The case was brought before the court, but Set’s claims were weak and unsupported. The judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.

The bad news is that it will require removing your testicles.

You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.    

The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.'

The second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

The third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

The first guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him anymore.

The second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

The third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going.

The first guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.""

The second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

The third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says: ""Guys, I think I fucked up.""",Three guys are walking through the woods when they find a lamp.,48

She decided to leave him and raise the baby on her own, rather than have it turn out like its father, and so she moved far away and settled in for 9 months. She went to the doctor and asked him how she could make her baby nicer, and he told her to sit down for an hour a day and teach her stomach manners, to prep him or her before the baby is even born.

So every day for the next 9 months, the woman would sit quietly and tell her belly ""Be nice to other people, always put others first, and always say please, and thank-you.""

She never missed a day in 9 months, and the due date came and went, no baby!

The woman continued to wait for her newborn, and continued to teach her belly manners and politeness every day, but as days, weeks, months and years passed, the baby never came!

Finally, 65 years later when the woman finally passed away in her sleep, the doctors performed an autopsy on her body.

They cut open her belly and found 2 little old men with big long white beards, continually saying to each other:

They proceeded to the stockyard and inquired about a mule. The stockman explained they had many mules to rent, but for one dollar there was only one mule available.


""I guess we don't have much choice,"" said Otis and handed over the dollar. Hiram took the mule to lead it back to the farm.

As they left, the stockman told them: ""This mule works hard and well enough, but goes cross eyed from time to time. So if you take this here pipe and shove the pipe up its butt and blow real hard whenever it's eyes get crossed, they'll straighten right out and he'll see straight to plow again.""

Later on they got to plowing and things went well. Hiram drove the mule and Otis followed along planting seed, nice straight lines for several hours. But as predicted, the mule's eyes went crossed and started weaving making crooked rows.

""Otis, hand me that pipe!"" And Hiram shoved the pipe up the mule's butt and blew. Sure enough, the mule's eyes uncrossed and went back to plowing straight.

A while later, it happened again. So Hiram shoved that pipe up the mule's butt and blew.  But nothing seemed to happen.

""You're doing it wrong,"" said Otis. ""Shut up,"" said Hiram, ""I know what I'm doing cause I've done this before!"" So he took a big deep breath and blew again with all his might. The eyes slowly uncrossed and the mule finally went back to plowing straight. 

Our fellas were getting to the short rows  when it happened a third time. Hiram proceeded to shove the pipe up the mule's butt and blew til he was blue in the face, but nothing happened, that mule kept plowing crooked and weaving all over.

Otis elbowed Hiram outta the way, ""Now let me show you how it's done.""

""I doubt you can do better, but be my guest,"" gesturing toward the pipe.

Otis grabbed the pipe, pulled it out of the mule's butt, reversed ends,  jammed it back in, and proceeded to blow.

""Ugh, Otis! Don't you know that end where you're blowing was just up that mule's butt?!""

""Well Hiram, I ain't gonna put my mouth on the end you just had your mouth on!""",Two Hillbilly Farmers,1

The trail to Oregon was very tough and the relationship between the brothers was already stressed at best.

Phillip, being the older brother, was constantly very critical of his younger sibling. He called him all manner of condescending names and profanities. The wagon wheel broke, it was stupid Terrance’s fault. When the wagon flooded trying to Ford a river, Phillip accused Terrance, the idiot, of hitting a rock. Anytime they stopped at a fort or rest area, Phillip would find any group of other travelers and lament at how ridiculously dumb his brother was.

Finally, at one particularly grueling portion of the trail, the brothers chose to stop to hunt. The both grabbed rifles and stood in the middle of the field. Phillip watched his brother take aim at the buffalo and miss completely and he laid into his brother calling him all manner of horrible names. Something in Terrance snapped and he turned the rifle on his brother and shot him dead.

Phillip was buried next to the road that the two brothers had traveled for so many miles. A small headstone was left as the only marker.

“Here lies Phillip. He died of dissing Terry.”",It was the mid-1820’s when Phillip and his brother Terrance decided that they wanted to better their lives.,6

to increase their ever-growing business.

 

In response, the local Baptist Church started a campaign to block the
business from expanding -- with morning, afternoon, and evening prayer
sessions at their church.

 

Work on Diamond D's progressed right up until the week before the grand
re-opening when lightning struck the whorehouse and burned it to the
ground!

 

After the brothel burned to the ground by the lightning strike, the
church folks were rather smug in their outlook, bragging about ""the power
of prayer.""

 

But late last week 'Big Jugs' Jill Diamond, the owner/madam, sued the
church, the preacher and the entire congregation on the grounds that the
church ... ""was ultimately responsible for the demise of her building and
her business -- either through direct or indirect divine actions or
means.""

 

In its reply to the court, the church vehemently and vociferously denied
any and all responsibility or any connection to the building's demise.

 

The crusty old judge read through the plaintiff's complaint and the
defendant's reply, and at the opening hearing he commented, ""I don't know
how the hell I'm going to decide this case, but it appears from the
paperwork, that we now have a whorehouse owner who staunchly believes in
the power of prayer, and an entire church congregation that thinks it's
all bullshit.""",The Power of Prayer,8

The fisherman said, ""Your Majesty, you should return to the palace! In just a short time I expect a huge rain storm.""

The king replied: ""I hold the palace meteorologist in high regard. He is an educated and experienced professional. Besides, I pay him very high wages. He gave me a very different forecast. I trust him.""

So the king continued on his way.

However, in a short time a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King and Queen were totally soaked. Furious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to fire the meteorologist.

Then he summoned the fisherman and offered him the prestigious position of royal forecaster.

The fisherman said, ""Your Majesty, I do not know anything about forecasting. I obtain my information from my donkey. If I see my donkey's ears drooping, it means with certainty that it will rain.""

So the king hired the donkey.

As a result, Satan's received the smallest buns.

The next day, Jesus asked them to take two stones up the mountain again. Satan, this time round, took two large stones up the mountain. On top of the mountain, Jesus say, “throw the stones in your hands. The further you throw them, the bigger the buns will be.""
As a result, Satan threw the nearest and again received the smallest buns.

On the third day, Jesus asked them to take the stones up the mountain again. Satan thought: ""The big stone is for the transformation, the small stone is for throwing. It will be safe to take a big stone and a small stone.”

So Satan took a large and small stone up the mountain.

On top of the mountain, Jesus said, ""you all have worked hard with me by traveling to the top of the mountain three times. In order to thank you, I have turned the two stones in your hands into your two testicles.”

In order to make it seamless, I asked my best mate Joe to pass me the ring when I gave him a signal; to add to the element of surprise. 

I also asked Joe to be my best man. To be honest, I'd known other frends for longer, but I randomly met Joe one day. I can't remember how; he came from somewhere or other. 

So, one night, in a restaurant, I was eating dinner with my girlfriend. Just as we got to desert, I signalled Joe to come over. But he was too hasty, and tripped himself up; he fell into one of the tables, and the glass shattered, puncturing his eye. 

We decided to postpone the wedding until Joe was better, so he didn't miss out. We regularly went to visit him in the hospital; they'd given him a cotton patch that he needed to keep on his eye. He was happy to see us all the time; but eventually I had to set him less and less due to my work obligations.
I'd noticed my soon-to-be wife visited him a lot. Getting curious, I snuck in one day to see what they got up to. 

But instead of finding those two, I found a note on the table. It turned out that my girlfriend had decided to run away with Joe; and they didn't tell me where. 

So, if it hadn't been for cotton-eyed Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did he come from, where did he go? Where did he come from, cotton-eyed Joe?","I proposed to my girlfriend, and my best friend was there.",20

To celebrate their team's victory, they decided to go to the nearest bar and have some beers. After drinking the first couple of beers, John saw that one of his friends from middle school was at the bar and walked over to his table to chat about the old days.

Now left alone, Kyle wasn't sure what to do. However, he saw a really beautiful girl sit alone by the bar. He had never much of a ladies' man, but he tried his luck anyway. He sat down next to her and asked her if she would like something to drink.

""Yes, a beer, please,"" she said.

""Okay,"" said Kyle. ""Bartender, can I have two Kyles - oops, I mean beers - for me and this Kyle - oops, I mean chick?""

""Sure,"" said the bartender and served them two beers.

Kyle found out the girl was also excited about the local team winning the football match, and they chatted for a long time and got along really well.

""Hey, John,"" he said. ""That chick said this bar was getting boring, and she asked if I want to go to her place and drink a cup of coffee. What does that mean?"".

""Congrats, Kyle!"" John said jovially. ""That means you're getting laid tonight!"".

Kyle was excited about the prospect of finally losing his virginity. He had to show his excitement by yelling ""KYYYYLE!!!!"" and taking his shirt off. He didn't know much about sex, but he knew that you had to be naked to do it, so he also started to take his pants off.

""Those two,"" their family would say. ""Those two are always trying to prove who's best."" But they loved each other, in their own odd way, and their family knew it.

When the brothers were in their late 30s, tragedy struck.

Both Mom and Dad died in a freak home explosion, leaving the Moore family bricklaying business to the two brothers.
Both brothers, distraught over the passing of their parents, and ever so competitive, wanted full ownership of the company, as they didn't think the other could handle the huge responsibility of running a business.

Of course, the only solution was a competition. 

Each brother decided to build a brick wall for the next 8 hours. The person with the most bricks in their wall would win the competition, and therefore ownership of the business.

When 8 hours were over, the brothers invited the whole town to see who had laid the most bricks. A lucky resident was
chosen by each brother to count the bricks. The winner was obvious.

Recently, we learned that a star called S5-HVS1 from the constellation Grus was ejected from the galactic core 5 million years ago by the blackhole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A\*.

That star has been measured as traveling 3.7 million mph which is roughly .5% of the speed of light.

To put it in context, 3.7 million mph is roughly 5.5 million feet per second, and the earth is 41 million feet (8k miles) in diameter.

So if S5-HVS1 were to zoom by the earth, it would only take it less than 8 seconds to zip by the earth.

Professor, ""Hmmmm, alright. So what's the question?""

Student, ""What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal?""

The professor wracks his famous brain, but just can't crack the answer. Finally he gives up and changes the student's failing mark into an ""A"" as agreed, and the student goes away, very pleased.

The professor continues to wrack his brain over the question all afternoon, but still can't get the answer. So finally he calls in a group of his brightest students and tells them he has a really, really tough question to answer, ""What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? ""

To the professor's surprise (and embarrassment), all the students immediately raise their hands.

""All right,"" says the professor and asks his favorite student to answer.

""It's quite easy, sir"" says the student ""You see, you are 75 years old and married to a 30 year old woman, which is legal, but not logical. Your wife has a 22 year old lover, which is logical, but not legal.

Being a good friend, the banker asked Bob if the rumor was true. Bob assured him that it was. The banker then asked Bob the age of his new bride to be.  

Bob proudly said, 'She'll be twenty-one in November.'

Now the banker, being the wise man that he was, could see that the sexual appetite of a young woman could not be satisfied by an eighty-year- old man. Wanting his old friend's remaining years to be happy the banker tactfully suggested that Bob should consider getting a hired hand to help him out on the ranch, knowing nature would take its own course. Bob thought this was a good idea and said he would look for one that afternoon.

About four months later, the banker ran into Bob in town again. ""How's the new wife?"" asked the banker. 

Bob proudly said, ""Good!  She's pregnant."" 

The banker, happy that his sage advice had worked out, continued, ""And how's the hired hand?"" 

Bob smiled broadly and replied, ""Oh, She's pregnant too.""","Mark, The banker, saw his old Nebraska friend Bob, an eighty-year old rancher, in town...",86

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner and even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

 

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

 

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

 

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold.

 

The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""Jeffery Epstein did not kill himself.",It's true,6

Frustrated, she decided to put up a notice in search of one special partner. She specify three criteria. Any man who want her, must met all of the criteria. 

However, her criteria seems ridiculous since there’s no one responding to her notice. She wait and wait and wait in her house until suddenly, a loud banging was heard on her door. 

Nervously, she approached and opened the door. She was shocked seeing outside her house, a man, without any arm nor leg was waiting outside.

“I saw your notice,” said the man calmly. 

“Well yes. Urm, so you must have read the criteria as well right? Urm, how do you suppose to meet that criteria?” Ask the woman while scanning the ~~dis~~figure.

“The man must never, ever hit me. You see ma’am, I have no arms, so it’s impossible for me to hit you.”

“Okay, go on,” replied the woman after brief pause. 

“The man must never run away and left me. So, as you can see also, I have no legs, so I can never run away from you.”

The woman nodded while remain silent. What’s the man said is true. But her mind now is on her last list of criteria. She was expecting someone with a great physical but kind hearted when she came up with the list. She’s wondering how in the hell this man can fulfill her third desire. “The man must be very good in bed.”

“Did you hear the loud banging I made just now?” Asked the man, still very calm. 

“Oh yes. Absolutely.” Replied her while replaying the sound in her head. She can’t figure out why the man is asking about that knocking sound. 

“Well you see ma’am, I have no arms or legs. What do you think I knock on your door with?”",Three marriage criteria,7

And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense."" So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper.

Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father having sex with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, ""Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now."" The father says, ""Good, son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.""

So an older gentleman received a phone call by the IRS, being notified about large sums of money going in and out of his account. He was told to be at the office first thing Monday morning. He thought to himself “Well if this is what I think it is, I better lawyer up.”

Sure enough he got a lawyer and was there Monday morning. The guy from the IRS went through the details and asked if the gentleman was aware of the transactions. Here’s the conversation. 
Gentleman: “Yeah I do a little gambling here and there.” 
IRS: “With this big of an amount of money?”
Gentleman: “Sure. Here I’ll make you a bet. I bet you $5,000 that I can bite my own eye.”

With that being said, the guy from the IRS took the bet knowing he couldn’t do it. The gentleman then pulled out his glass eye, and bit it.

Gentleman: “Now don’t worry, I’m gonna give you a chance to make your money back, and even a little more. I’ll bet you $10,000 that I can bite my other eye.”

The guy from the IRS saw no seeing eye dog, and saw no stick for the blind, so he knew for sure this was a sure win.

IRS: “You’ve got yourself a deal”

The gentleman then takes his dentures out and bites his other eye.

Gentleman: “Now now don’t be upset. I’m gonna give you a chance to make your money back, and even a little more. I’ll bet you $20,000 that from the other side of your desk, I can go to the bathroom and make all of my urine end up in your trash can, not a drop anywhere else.”

The IRS guy knew for sure that he couldn’t do that. So he took this bet knowing he’d made $20,000.

IRS: “You’re on old man! There’s no chance in hell you can do that!”

The gentleman then proceeds to urinate all over the IRS guys desk. As he jumps up and down in joy because he won the bet.

IRS: “You lose! You owe me $20,000!!!”

While celebrating, the IRS guy couldn’t help but notice gentleman’s lawyer, who was sitting there shaking his head in shame.

IRS: “What’s your problem?”

Lawyer: “He bet me $100,000 on the way here that he could piss all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.”",The Old Man with the IRS,25
