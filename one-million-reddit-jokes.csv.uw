She spends $20,000 and feels pretty good about the results as she now looks so much younger and sexier. On her way home, she stops at a news-stand to buy a newspaper. Before leaving, she says to the salesgirl, “I hope you don’t mind me asking, but how old do you think I am?”

“About 22,” is the reply.
Hot blonde
“Nope! I’m exactly 40,” the woman replies with a big smile.
A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.
The girl replies, “I’d guess about 21.”
The woman says happily, “Nope, I’m 40. I guess I look so much younger, right? Hehe.”
Now she’s feeling really good about herself. While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.
He replies, “Lady, I’m 68 and my eyesight is not so good. Although, when I was young, there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra. Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are. You want to let me try?”
They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the best of her. She finally blurts out, “What the hell, go ahead.”
The old man immediately slips both his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and gentlely. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently rubs each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other too!
After a few more minutes of this, she says, “Okay, okay…How old am I?”
He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, “Madam, you are 40.”
Stunned and amazed, the woman says, “That was incredible, how could you tell?”
The old man says, “Promise you won’t get mad?”
“I promise I won’t.” she says.
“I was behind you in line at McDonald’s.” ",Today's Recommendation,6

Joe was a religious man, he was the CEO of a multi-million dollar company, and he had a very nice house.  One day, as he was heading to work, he heard a voice boom down from the heavens.

""JOE,"" the voice proclaimed.

""God?  Is that you?"" Joe asked, dumbfounded.

""YES, JOE, IT'S ME, GOD.  LISTEN, I NEED YOU TO SELL YOUR BUSINESS.""

""Oh yes, of course, God!""  Joe said, ecstatic that God was speaking to him.  Then, he did just as God asked, and sold his business for $500,000,000.

""What now, God?""

""YOU MUST SELL YOUR HOUSE, AND ALL OF YOUR WORLDLY POSSESSIONS"" God thundered.  And of course, Joe obliged, selling his house and all his possessions for another $1,500,000.

""Okay, God,"" Joe said.  ""I sold my home and livelihood.  Now what must I do?""

""TAKE ALL OF YOUR MONEY TO VEGAS.  THEN, GO TO CAESAR'S PALACE.""

So, Joe did as God asked, buying a ticket to Las Vegas.  After landing, he went to Caesar's Palace.  Inside, he asked: ""What now, God?""

""THE CASINO.  YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY BLACKJACK.""

Joe was hesitant, but he obliged.  He took all of the money he had from his savings and from selling his home and business and went to the blackjack table.

""BET IT ALL ON ONE HAND.""

Joe did as he was told, betting all of the money on the first hand.  Cards dealt, Joe looked at his hand.  A 5 and a 2, totaling 7.

""TAKE THE HIT.""

A King.  17.

""TAKE THE HIT.""

Nervously, Joe looked at the dealer's face-up card.  A Queen.  Begrudgingly, he took the hit without complaint.

A three.  20.

""TAKE THE HIT.""

""God, are you sure?  I mean, I have twenty, I should be...""

""TAKE THE HIT, JOE.""

After a moment of silent reflection and prayer, Joe asked for the hit.

The wife got a terrible headache and told her husband to go to the party alone. He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed and there was no need for his good time to be spoiled by not going.
So he took his costume and away he went.

The wife, after sleeping soundly for about an hour, woke without pain and as it was still early decided go to the party. As her husband didn't know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him.

So she joined the party and soon spotted her husband in his costume, cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice ""chick"" he could and copping a little feel here and a little kiss there.
His wife went up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he left his new partner high and dry and devoted his time to her. She let him go as far as he wished, naturally, since he was her husband.
After more drinks he finally whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had passionate intercourse in the back seat. Just before unmasking at midnight she slipped away, went home, put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make up for his outrageous behavior.
She was sitting up reading when he came in, so she asked what kind of time he had. ""Oh, the same old thing. You know I never have a good time when you're not there.""
Then she asked, ""Did you dance much?""
He replied, ""I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance. When I got there, I met Pete, Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went into the spare room and played poker all evening.""
""You must have looked really silly wearing that costume playing poker all night!"" she said with unashamed sarcasm.

It stopped a few feet away and then waved again.  Bounding up the hill, once again the little bunny waved.

A mentally retarded kid decides that he wants to join the war effort too so he heads down to the Marines recruiting station. They just laugh at him and tell him to go try one of the other branches. He heads over to the air force, they tell him it's not going to happen but maybe he'll have better luck with the navy. He tries them and gets told that they are desperate but not THAT desperate, he should go try his luck with the Army.  So he heads over to the army recruiters and sure enough, they sign him right up.

The kid starts his training and when the time comes to be assigned their riffles he is the last one in line. By time he gets to the front they are all out of guns. The guy handing out the guns hands the kid a broom instead. The retarded kid asks him what he is suppose to do with a broom and the army guy tells him, ""Well son, this is a magic broom. When you see the Germans comin, just point your broom at them and say 'banga banga banga' and they'll all fall over dead."" So the kid takes his broom and leaves. The next day they are handing out bayonet's and again, the kid is the last one in line. When he gets to the front they give him a piece of string. Again the kid asks what he is suppose to do with a piece of string. The army guy ties it to his broom and tells him. ""Well, if the Germans get too close, just move your broom back and forth and say 'slishidy slash, slishidy slash' and they'll fall over dead. 

Time passes and the kid finally finds himself on the front line facing the German army. He points his broom at them and starts saying 'banga banga banga' and sure enough, the Germans start falling over dead. A little while later and the Germans are still advancing, now they are right on top of the American forces. The kid starts swinging his broom from side to side saying 'slishidy slash, slishidy slash' and again the Germans start falling over dead. A little more time passes and the kid sees the biggest German he has ever seen coming over the hill. He points his broom at him and says 'banga banga banga' but nothing happens, the German keeps coming right at him. The kid starts swinging his broom back and forth and saying 'slishidy slash, slishidy slash' but again nothing happens. The German keeps coming, runs right into the kid, knocks him over. As the kid is being smashed into the mud he looks up and the last thing he hears is the German saying ""Tankady tankady tankady"".

The interviewer pulls out a gun and hands it to one of the men saying, ""We have your wife tied up in that room, we need to test your loyalty, so you have to take this gun and kill her.""

The man explains that they are newly weds and he loves his wife dearly so he wont do it. The man is asked to leave and the same task is given to the second man.  The second man replies similarly in that he and his wife had been married 10 years and he would never kill her. So with the first 2 out they turn to the 3rd man and repeat the requested task.

""We have your wife tied up in the back and we need you to take this gun and kill her. This is how we test loyalty.""

So with a deep breath the man agrees to do it. Saying he has been  having troubles with his marriage and this job is important to him. So they gave him the gun and he walked into the room with his wife.

Listening intently the interviewers lean against the door  they hear **Click..Click..WHACK..CRACK..BANG...BOOM**

They run into the room to see what happened and ask the man whats going on.

He being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed, and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went.

The wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain, and as it was still early, she decided to go to the party. In as much as her husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him.

She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice chick he could, and copping a little feel here and a little kiss there. His wife sidled up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived

She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and messed around.

Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away and went home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behavior.

She was sitting up reading when he came in and asked what kind of a time he had. He said, ""Oh, the same old thing. You know I never have a good time when you're not there.""

Then she asked, ""Did you dance much?""

He replied, ""I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance. When I got there, I met Pete, Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker all evening. But I'll tell you... the guy I loaned my costume to sure had a real good time!""

The Mohel went to the most skilled tailor in the city and brought his trunk full of skin. 


""I want something special that will remind me of the toil I put into my career."" He told the tailor. 



""I'll see what I can do."" replied the shocked tailor.

""Here you are!"" said the proud tailor, as he handed the Mohel a wallet. 



The Mohel took the small item and examined it. 


""It appears that this wallet was indeed made of the skin I left you, but I'm a little surprised. I brought an entire trunk of skin and this is all you made?""


The tailor smiled.

""Why don't you have a guess?"" replies Linda.

Linda's over the moon. ""Well actually, I'm 40 today. But thank you ever so much, you've made my day!"" she says, and, smiling, she heads over to the boutique on the corner to buy herself a new dress for the party. 
The woman in the store also notices her badge, and asks her the same question - ""How old are you today?"" - to which Linda gives the same answer - ""Why don't you have a guess?""

Linda, fishing for another compliment, says to the butcher ""Why don't you have a guess?""

Linda, thinking he means to give her arms and hands a bit of a squeeze, is completely shocked when the butcher gives her tits a good hard squeeze, and is utterly lost for words when he lifts up her skirt and grasps her pussy firmly in his hand. Outraged, Linda pulls his hand away, and just as she's about to storm out of the shop the butcher says to her ""You're 40"". Linda stops dead, amazed.

 She took out ads in newspapers around the world seeking a male virgin who was 55 years old. She finally narrowed her choice to an Australian computer programmer. 

 After a thorough background check, she was satisfied that he had indeed never been with a woman and they were married. On their wedding night, she went into the bathroom to change into her nightie. When she came back out, she found that her new husband had taken the bed and everything in the room and stacked it in one corner of the room. Thinking this was rather kinky, she said to her husband, ""I thought you had never been with a woman.""

Joe had suffered from really bad headaches for the last 20 years.

He eventually decides to go and see a Doctor.
 
The Doctor said, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches.
The bad news is that it will require castration.
You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.    

The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.' 

Joe was shocked and depressed.He wondered if he had anything to live for.  

He had no choice but to go under the knife. The surgery cost him $15,000.

When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.   

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. 

He saw a Men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new Suit.' 

He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new Suit.' 

The elderly Tailor eyed him briefly and said, 'Let's see... size 44 long.

Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?' 

'Been in the business 60 years!' the tailor said. 

Joe tried on the suit it fit perfectly. 

As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, 'How about a new shirt?' 

Joe thought for a moment and then said, 'Sure.' 

The salesman eyed Joe and said, 'Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.' 

Joe was surprised, 'That's right, how did you know?' 

'Been in the business 60 years.' 

Joe tried  the shirt and it fit perfectly. 

Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new Underwear?' 

Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure..' 

The salesman said, 'Let's see..... size 36. 

Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! I got you! I've worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old..' 

The salesman shook his head, 'You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 would press your Testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a Headache.'",Headache and testicles,1102

Satan quickly introduces himself. ""Welcome to Hell. I can't say i was expecting you, so i guess St. Peter made a mistake when he put you on the Hell list. I'll have one of my demons phone him right away. In the mean time, well, there isn't much, but if you want to amuse yourself, i can help you with that.""

The engineer thinks for a moment, and then says, ""You know, it is extremely hot down here. I'd love to build a large AC unit. Do you have the materials?""

Satan says, ""Well, yes, we have all manners of metals due to our location under the Earth's crust. Have at it.""

The engineer, after 3 days of heavy work, finishes his Hell-wide AC and turns it on. After 3 hours, the temperature has finally reached a more desirable 78 degrees, and Hell is much less hellish. Satan is highly impressed. ""Nice work, i didn't think this was even possible! Sorry to say, though, St. Peter refuses to admit he messed up. Since you made this AC happen, I'll let you do whatever you want.""

The engineer thinks, and says, ""You now it's also really dark and dim with just the lava flows. Have the materials for a lighting system?"" Satan says, ""Of course! God sent some heavenly light once but i never could figure out how it worked. Here's the instructions.""

2 days later, the heavenly light had been configured to brightly light Hell. Productivity was way up and now Hell was not so bad anymore. Satan tells the engineer,  ""I like you, bud! Tell you what, you can live like a king. Got a room in my castle for you. Everything you could ever want is there.""

At this point, several angels had reviewed the engineer's life and informed God of St. Peter's mistake. God hastily adds the engineer to the Heaven list. He calls Satan and asks for the engineer. 

Satan says, ""No way, man! Hell has never been so nice before him. We have lighting, cooling, and now he's tinkering with machines that haven't worked since your son went to Earth! I'm keeping him.""

God immediately responds, ""He is a good man, though! He belongs in Heaven. It is only right! If you will not return him, I'll have to take you to court.""

I'm writing you this letter to tell you that I'm leaving you for good. I've been a good woman to you for seven years and I have nothing to show for it. These last two weeks have been hell. Your boss called to tell me that you had quit your job today and that was the last straw.

Last week, you came home and didn't notice that I had gotten my hair and nails done, cooked your favorite meal and even wore a brand new negligee. You came home and ate in two minutes, and went straight to sleep after watching the game. You don't tell me you love me anymore, you don't touch me or anything. Either you're cheating or you don't love me anymore, whatever the case is. I'm gone.

P.S. If you're trying to find me, don't. Your BROTHER and I are moving away to West Virginia togetherl

Have a great lifel &gt; Your EX-Wife

***************************************

Dear Ex-Wife

Nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter. It's true that you and I have been married for seven years, although a good woman is a far cry from what you've been. I watch sports so much to try to drown out your constant nagging. Too bad that doesn't work. I did notice when you cut off all of your hair last week, the first thing that came to mind was ""You look just like a man!"" My mother raised me to not say anything if you can't say anything nice.

When you cooked my favorite meal, you must have gotten me confused with MY BROTHER, because I stopped eating pork seven years ago. I went to sleep on you when you had on that new negligee because the price tag was still on it. I prayed that it was a coincidence that my brother had just borrowed fifty dollars from me that morning and your negligee was $49.99.

After all of this, I still loved you and felt that we could work it out. So when I discovered that I had hit the lotto for ten million dollars, I quit my job and bought us two tickets to Jamaica.

But when I got home you were gone. Everything happens for a reason I guess.

I hope you have the fulfilling life you always wanted. My lawyer said with your letter that you wrote, you won't get a dime from me. So take care.

P.S. I don't know if I ever told you this but Carl, my brother was born Carla. I hope that's not a problem.

post,3qg9p2,2qh72,jokes,false,1445970279,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3qg9p2/my_old_teammate_ron/,self.jokes,,"So when I was in high school we had a standout basketball player (Ron) who was destined to be in the NBA in his life. As a sophomore, he was 6'7"" 230, super athletic and was a star in any sport he played, but he loved basketball the most. One night he was out celebrating after a win and his buddy was driving drunk and wrecked. Ron wasn't wearing his seat belt and was thrown from the vehicle. He suffered a lot of serious injuries, but what was devastating was that they had to amputate his arms as they had nearly ripped off from rolling on the pavement. The whole community was so devastated because everyone had such high hopes for him and his future. 
Ron was a determined kid though and he vowed to play basketball again. 

After almost a year of PT and countless hours in his driveway with his dad practicing, he learned how to headbutt the ball into the basket, and utilize his long legs and strong torso to play defense. Needless to say, we all kinda chuckled (not in a mean way, we're not savages) when he said he was going to try out for the team again. His determined look told us he wasn't kidding, so we went to his tryout to see how he'd do. We were shocked to see the agility he had, and his precise ""header shots"" as he called them. He actually beat me 1 on 1 later that day in a pick up game. I wasn't a standout, but I could generally hold my own against similar competition. He had these really small stubs that he used to dribble and I have no clue how he pulled the rest off. 

Anyways, we were playing in our final game of the year, if we won we'd go to states to compete and everyone was nervous. Ron was simply amazing that game. He put up over 30 points and had 12 assists but towards the end of the game we were only up by 1 point. There were only 7 seconds left on the clock and the opposing team was in-bounding the ball. Somehow the guy I was guarding ran around a screen and I tripped giving him a wide open lane to the basket. I felt sick. The ball immediately went to him and as he drove to the hoop we all see Ron flying across the court. As he pulls his arm up to lay the ball in, Ron dropkicks this kid right into the padding behind the hoop. It was one of the dirtiest plays I've ever seen. The kid goes flailing, the ball bounces awkwardly off the rim and his the ground and the time expires. The whole gymnasium was silent waiting to hear the ref's whistle and see the free throws that would surely tie or end the game, but only the subtle chatter of the refs could be heard followed by a quick whistle to signal the end of the game. 

That's when he lost it. The other coach was vehemently screaming at the top of his lungs, flailing his arms, kicking chairs, making a mess, but the ref just looked at him and shook his head and uttered the phrase I'll always remember. The one that sealed our victory, ""Sorry coach, No arm, no foul"".

 While standing in line to check out, the guy in front of me, probably in his early thirties, asked, 
 ""Are you a Vietnam Vet?"" ""No,"" I replied. ""Then why are you wearing that cap?"" 
 ""Because I couldn't find the one from the War of 1812."" [I thought this was a snappy retort.] 
 ""The War of 1812, huh?"" the 'Wal-Martian' queried, ""When was that?"" 
 God forgive me, but I couldn't pass up such an opportunity. 
 ""1936,"" I answered, as straight-faced as possible. 
 He pondered my response for a moment, and then asked, 
 ""Why do they call it the War of 1812 if it was in 1936?"" 
 ""It was a Black Operation. No one is supposed to know about it."" 
 (This was beginning to be way too much fun!) ""DUDE! Really?"" he exclaimed. 
 ""How did you get to do something that COOL?"" 
 I glanced furtively around me for effect, leaned toward the guy, and in a low voice, said. ""I'm not sure. I was the only Caucasian on the mission."" ""Dude!!"" he was really getting excited about what he was hearing! 
 ""That is seriously awesome! But, didn't you... kind of stand out?"" 
 ""Not really. The other guys were all wearing white camouflage."" 
 The moron nodded knowingly. 
 ""Listen, man,"" I said in a very serious tone, ""You can't tell anyone about this. It's still 'top secret' and I shouldn't have said anything."" 
 ""Yeah?"" he gave me that, 'don't threaten me' look. 
 With a really hard look I said, ""You have a family, don't you? We wouldn't want anything to happen to them, would we?"" The guy gulped, left his basket where it was and fled through the door. 
 By this time, the lady behind me was about to have a heart attack, she was laughing so hard. 
 After checking out and going to the parking lot, I saw Dimwit leaning in a car window talking to a young woman. Upon catching sight of me, he started pointing excitedly in my direction.

Second, Pedro, wished to be rich. So he also jumped off the cliff and landed on gold bars and money.

Lastly, Pablo, stood right in front of the cliff's edge being ready to make a wish, but suddenly, he slipped. ""Oh shit!"" He shouted and fell of the cliff. And he landed on a car's windshield like it came from a giant eagle's asshole.

He responded ""Actually grandma, all I need is money, and a lot of it.  College is expensive.""  The grandma sighed and walked away.

Before the kid left however, the grandma came up to him and gave him a Bible and told him ""I hope it helps you through college."" The kid replied ""Thanks, this is exactly what I wanted""

A few months passed by and the kid was in college, having a good time, when he got a call from his grandma.  His grandma asked him how he was doing, what college was like, etc. and the kid replied ""Its great, but I'd love some more of what we talked about before.

She replied, ""Have you been reading your Bible however?""

The kid replied, ""Of course! I'm on chapter 4!""

The grandma sighed, and said goodbye.

A few more months passed by, and the kid was doing great in college, but money was starting to get tight.  He called his grandma in a panic and asked her, ""Grandma, I really need money, college is great, and I want to graduate, but to do that I need more money.""

The Grandma once again asked, ""Have you been reading your Bible?""

The son responded ""Yes, its great, I wish it was longer!""

Again, the grandma sighed, and said goodbye.

Finally, the time for graduation rolled around, but even though the kid had all As, he had to drop out since he had no more money left.  He was in tears, and saw that his grandma was calling.  He picked up and said hello.

""I heard you're dropping out of school, why is that?""

""Well, I don't know grandma, maybe its because I don't have any money because you won't give any to me!""

The grandma, exhausted, asked ""Have you read your Bible yet?""

The kid, in frustration, hung up the phone.  As he cried, he began packing up his room, and the final thing he put away was the Bible.  For the first time at college, he actually opened the Bible, and inside, in a hole cut out in the book was an envelope.  He opened the envelope and inside was a handwritten note from his grandma.  It read:

""Yes sir, I speak Spanish.""

The sheriff and his posse roughly move the bandit to her, and the Sheriff asks her to ask the bandit where he hid the money.

""No sé nada,"" he replies.

The sheriff puts a gun to the bandit's head and angrily says to the old lady: ""Tell him that if he doesn't tell us where the money is right now, I'll blow his brains out.""

The old lady dutifully translates in a quiet, measured tone.

Upon receiving the translation, the bandit becomes very animated.

""¡Ya me acuerdo! Tienen que caminar tres millas hasta ese gran arbol: allí está el dinero.""

The sheriff leans forward to the old lady. ""Yeah? Well?""

The old lady replies solemnly: ""He says he wants to die like a man.""
