I do physical labor.

I work at great depths.

I plunge headfirst into everything I do.

I do not get weekends or public holidays off.

I work in a damp environment.

I work in a dark workplace that has poor ventilation.

I work in high temperatures.

My work exposes me to contagious diseases.

Sincerely,

P. Niss

**The Response:**

Dear Penis:

After assessing your request, and considering the arguments you have raised, the administration rejects your request for the following reasons:

You do not work 8 hours straight.

You fall asleep after brief work periods.

You do not always follow the orders of the management team.

 You do not stay in your designated area and are often seen visiting other locations.

You do not take initiative - you need to be pressured and stimulated in order to start working.

You leave the workplace rather messy at the end of your shift.

 You don't always observe necessary safety regulations, such as wearing the correct protective clothing.

You will retire well before you are 65.

You are unable to work double shifts.

You sometimes leave your designated work area before you have completed assigned task.

And if that were not all, you have been seen constantly entering and exiting the workplace carrying two suspicious-looking bags.

The next morning the man saw the pig at his front door, who then said ""You're so mean. That was really far. Why don't you say you don't hate me already? You heartless monster."" The man was shocked, and he took this miraculous appearance as a sign that the pig was important.

The man kept the pig for 2 years, until it began to annoy him once more. He went to NASA and begged them to have the pig sent away. After consideration, the plan was approved: the pig was to be sent aboard Apollo 11 and left on the Moon.

The footage remained normal, although when the pig was left on the Moon, NASA cut to a blank view of the Moon and looped the image, believing the public would never know the pig was there.

It was now 1977. The man was beginning to age. Suddenly, a meteor crashed down onto his porch. It broke open, and out came a pig. The pig stated, ""You're so mean. That was really far. Why don't you say you don't hate me already? You heartless monster."" The man had had enough of the pig, and decided to send it on the ultimate mission. He knew Voyager 1 would leave the solar system, so he decided to petition NASA to strap the pig onto the spacecraft.

It was done, and NASA sent the pig on the spacecraft.

He waited years and years. His joints began to ache. His memory began to falter. He required a cane every so often.

The man was 93 in 2012, as the spacecraft had gotten rid of the pig forever.

The man passed in 2024, and his dying brain was inserted into a machine to analyze his memories, and his neurons. His brain was recreated completely.

The robotic brain was inserted into a robotic body, outfitted with a camera and microphone, so he could hear his surroundings just as well as when he was alive.

Days passed. Years passed. Decades passed.

In 2100, as the world finally broke free from the 21st century, the robot saw a UFO in the city. He looked eagerly as the UFO dropped off an object: the Voyager 1 spacecraft. It had been battered by micrometeorites, but still in mint condition. Attached to it, was a rope, but no sign of the pig.

The robot smiled, as he knew the pig was no more.

Millennia passed. The Earth fell into another ice age, that passed as quickly as it began. Chernobyl, now a fusion reactor, was now safe for children to play in.

The solar system was colonized, and mankind extended its reach to the rest of the galaxy.

8 million. He had explored a lot of places, but had not reached the neighboring galaxy, M31, yet. One day, he was working as an automated chef in the restaurant aboard the first starship to go to M31, the Andromeda Galaxy. 

Suddenly, an object fell into the engines. It burned. Then, the engine stopped. Then it exploded. Everyone was in chaos. As he began to inspect the wreckage, he saw the object. It was a badly burnt, but still recognizable, pig. Suddenly, as if recognizing him as a foe, the pig shouted loudly...

""You're so mean. That was really far. Why don't you say you don't hate me already? You heartless monster!""

His wife rolls over and says, 'What in the world was that?' The old man replied, 'its fart football.'

A few minutes later his wife lets one go and says, 'Touchdown, tie score...'

After about five minutes the old man lets another one go and says, 'Aha. I'm ahead 14 to 7.'

Not to be outdone the wife rips out another one and says, 'Touchdown, tie score.'

Five seconds go by and she lets out a little squeaker and says, 'Field goal, I lead 17 to 14.' Now the pressure is on for the old man.

He refuses to get beaten by a woman, so he strains real hard.

Since defeat is totally unacceptable, he gives it everything he's got, and accidentally poops in the bed.

The wife says, 'What the hell was that?'

He loved them but unfortunately they had always had very embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction on him.  Then one day he met a girl and fell in love.  When it became apparent that they would marry he thought to himself, ""She is such a sweet and gentle woman; she would never go for this carrying on.""  So he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans.

  Some months later, his car broke down on the way home from work.  Since he lived in the country, he called his wife an told her that he would be late because he had to walk home.  On his way, he passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than he could stand.  Since he still had miles to walk, he figured that he would walk off any ill effects by the time he reached home. So, he stopped at the diner and before he knew it, he had consumed 3 large orders of baked beans.  All the way home he had gas.  And upon arriving home, he felt reasonably sure he could control it.  His wife seemed excited to see him and exclaimed delightedly, ""Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight.""  She then blindfolded him and led him to his chair at the table.  She seated herself and just as she was about to remove the blindfold from her husband, the phone rang.  She made
him promise not to touch the blindfold until she returned.  She then went to answer the phone.

The baked beans he had consumed were still affecting him. So, while his wife was out of the room he seized the opportunity to ease the problem.  It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a pulpwood mill.  He took his napkin and fanned the air around him vigorously. Keeping his ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, he went on like this for another ten minutes.
When the phone farewells signaled the end of his freedom, he fanned the air a few more times with his napkin, placed it on his lap, and folded his hands upon it, smiling contentedly to himself.  He was the picture of innocence when his wife returned.  Apologizing for having taken so long, she asked him if he peeked, and he assured her that he had not.  At this point, she removed the blindfold, and he was surprised.

There were 12 dinner guests seated around the table to wish him a week-early  Happy Birthday!","Once upon a time, there was a man who had a maddening passion for baked beans",37

If I were you, I'd dress up as Jesus and hide and wait at the graveyard tonight. While she prays, come up to her from behind, tap her on the shoulder and tell her that you're Jesus and what you want. If you're lucky she might believe you.“ The drunkard thanks the driver and leaves at another station.

That very same night the drunkard does as told and hides. The nun actually shows up at around midnight. While she knees down to pray, he approaches her, taps her shoulder and immeadiately starts talking: 
“My dearest child of god, I see you have been good and prayed for the dead. It is me, Christ himself and I have come here on a godly mission to find another woman worthy to bear the child of god. You have been seen as worthy, will you accept this sacred mission?“
The nun, who had not lifted her head answered:
“My lord who am I to defy the holy will? Do as you intend to, but please do it so I won't need to look into your face, for I am not worthy.“
The dressed up drunkard agrees and so they do it  on a graveyard in the midst of night.

Shortly after he finished he deceided to get back at the nun for slapping him by revealing who he really is. He tears off his costume and yells: 
“ You foolish nun, you thought I was jesus, but it was me, the man from the bus!“ The nun starts cracking up and laughing.

One day, the monk brought his three disciples to a bath house. Instead of the usual bath robes, the disciples were given a rice paper robe. 

Shortly after, the prostitutes came over and started flirting with the disciples. The first disciple was quickly aroused and 'rip', the rice paper was torn by his erection. The first disciple realised that he had failed the test, and left quickly with his head hung down in shame.

Upon seeing this, the second disciple was determined to pass the test and started to recite his mantras. However, as soon as the prostitutes came over and started touching him, his rice paper robe broke too. 

The third disciple however looked confident. When the prostitute came over, they tried everything -stroking him and flirting with him-but nothing worked, the third disciple could not be aroused. He had astrong self control. 
Seeing this, the monk appointed the third disciple as his successor. 

After a few drinks, the monk and the third disciple were ready to return to the monastery. The monk took off his bath robe to change back into his garments.

 At this moment, the ripping sound was heard.

Soon the audience with the princess began...

The first one, the most athletic, took the advice literally - he looked down below his waist, lowered his pants in front of the princess and presented what he has to offer.

The second one, the most greedy, took the advice metaphorically - he looked down below his feet, grabbed a handful of soil, and told the princess that they can merge the land they live on and make a bigger profit.

The third one, the most lazy, just looked down into the comments section and told her the highest upvoted joke. The princess appreciated his sense of humour, got married and they lived happily ever after.

The bartender, noticing that the little man is a bit worse for the wear, pours him a double of Southern Comfort. The man swills down the drink and says, ""Gimme another one."" 

The bartender pours the drink but says, ""Now, before I give you this, why don't you let off a little steam and tell me why you're so upset?"" 

The man begins his tale. ""Well, I was sitting in the bar next-door, when this gorgeous blonde slinks in and actually sits beside me. I thought, 'Wow, this has never happened before.' You know, it was kind of a fantasy come true. Well, a couple of minutes later, I feel this hand moving around in my lap and the blonde leans over, licks my ear, and asks if I'm interested. I couldn't believe this was happening. I managed to nod my head yes, so she grabs my hand and starts walking out of the bar. So, of course, I went with her. This was just too good to be true."" 

He continues, ""She took me down the street to a nice hotel and up to her room. As soon as she shut the door, she slipped out of her dress. That was all she was wearing! I tell you, it didn't take me much longer to get out of my clothes. But as soon as I jumped into the bed, I heard some keys jingling and someone starts fumbling with the door."" 

The blonde says, 'Oh, my god, it's my boyfriend. He must have lost his wrestling match tonight. He's gonna be real mad. Quick, hide!' 

I opened the closet, but I figured that was probably the first place he would look, so I didn't hide there. Then I looked under the bed, but I figured that he's bound to look there, too. By now, I could hear the key in the lock. I noticed the window was open, so I climbed out and was hanging there by my fingers, praying that the guy wouldn't see me..."" 

The bartender says, ""Well, I can see how you might be a bit frustrated at this point."" 

""Well, yeah, but I hear the guy finally get the door open, and he yells, 'Who you been sleeping with now, witch?' 

The girl says, 'Nobody, honey, now come to bed and calm down.' 

Well, the guy starts tearing up the room. I hear him tear the door off the closet and throw it across the room. I'm thinking, 'Boy, I'm glad I didn't hide in there.' Then I hear him lift up the bed and throw it across the room. Good thing I didn't hide under there either. Then I heard him say, 'What's that over there by the window?' 

I think, 'Oh God, I'm dead meat now.' 

But by now the blonde is trying real hard to distract him and convince him to stop looking. Well, I hear the guy go into the bathroom, and I hear water running for a long time. I figure maybe he's gonna take a bath or something, when all of a sudden, the jerk pours a pitcher of scalding hot water out of the window right on top of my head. I mean, look at this, I got second degree burns all over my scalp and shoulders!"" 

The bartender says, ""Oh man, that would have pissed me off for sure."" 

""No, that didn't really bother me. Next, the guy starts slamming the window shut over and over on my hands. I mean, look at my fingers. They're a bloody mess. I can hardly hold this glass."" 

The bartender looks at the guy's hands and says, ""Yeah, buddy, I can understand why you are so upset."" 

""No, that wasn't what really pissed me off.""

Every year, my grandparents invite the entire family over to their place for their annual Labor Day barbecue.
Very rarely, my cousin Samuel decides to come along, and usually only if he's that desperate for a free meal.
Everyone in my family talks mad shit about Samuel, because he used to be a hardcore drug addict, but he tries his hardest to quit and hes really a nice guy so I've never thought poorly of him.
Remember this, as itll come into play later in the story.

Grandpa starts up the grill, and soon enough my dad and all of his brothers are gathered around talking about football or some nonsense.
Out of the blue, Samuel walks into the back yard, and suddenly the entire crowd falls deathly silent.
""Nope,"" my uncle Robert blurts out, ""we are not fucking doing this again this year.""
Near him is a croquet mallet left behind by another of my cousins, and Robert picks it up like hes going to start swinging it.
Aunt Wendy, Samuel's mom, screams bloody fucking murder, but doesn't lift a finger to help her poor son, who flees back to the front yard as fast as he can.

Grandpa and the rest of his sons follow Robert as he chases Samuel down, but not one of them tells him to cut it out.
I blow my top, however, and full-on sprint to put myself between my uncle and my cousin.
Very forcefully, I take the shovel from Robert's hand and throw it over the fence into his neighbor's lawn.
Every one of my family members looks at me like I've just defaced the Holy Grail, but that doesn't stop me from exploding.

""You ought to be fucking ashamed of yourself!
Over and over you keep punishing Samuel for his past mistakes, but you never give him a chance to show you how hes changed!""
Ultimately, my uncle returned to the party with the rest of my family, his tail between his legs, but not before making it very clear that I was never allowed to his home again.

Upset about what transpired, Samuel tried to apologize to me for ruining my relationship with Uncle Robert. 
""Please"", I replied with a laugh, ""I'm the first letter of every sentence in this story!""",TIFU by causing a massive fight at our families Labor Day BBQ,10

I am well. Hope you're are too. Tell me big brothers Doug and Phil that the Army is better than workin’ on the farm - tell them to get in quick smart before the jobs are all gone! I wuz a bit slow in settling down at first, because ya don’t hafta get outta bed until 6am. But I like sleeping in now, cuz all ya gotta do before brekky is make ya bed and shine ya boots and clean ya uniform. No cows to milk, no calves to feed, no feed to stack - nothin’!! Ya haz gotta shower though, but its not so bad, coz there’s lotsa hot water and even a light to see what ya doing!

At brekky ya get cereal, fruit and eggs but there’s no kangaroo steaks or possum stew like wot Mum makes. You don’t get fed again until noon and by that time all the city boys are dead because we’ve been on a ’route march’ - geez its only just like walking to the windmill in the back paddock!!

This one will kill me brothers Doug and Phil with laughter. I keep getting medals for shootin’ - dunno why. The bullseye is as big as a possum’s bum and it don’t move and it’s not firing back at ya like the Johnsons did when our big scrubber bull got into their prize cows before the Ekka last year! All ya gotta do is make yourself comfortable and hit the target! You don’t even load your own cartridges, they comes in little boxes, and ya don’t have to steady yourself against the rollbar of the roo shooting truck when you reload!

Sometimes ya gotta wrestle with the city boys and I gotta be real careful coz they break easy - it’s not like fighting with Doug and Phil and Jack and Boori and Steve and Muzza all at once like we do at home after the muster.

Turns out I’m not a bad boxer either and it looks like I’m the best the platoon’s got, and I’ve only been beaten by this one bloke from the Engineers - he’s 6 foot 5 and 15 stone and three pick handles across the shoulders and as ya know I’m only 5 foot 7 and eight stone wringin’ wet, but I fought him till the other blokes carried me off to the boozer.

I can’t complain about the Army - tell the boys to get in quick before word gets around how good it is.

It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes.""

The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 300 billion.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. The first guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

The second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

The third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

The first guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him anymore.

The second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

The third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going.

The first guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.""

The pastor didn't believe the man when told he could do the job, but decided to humor him, saying ""If you can ring the bell, the job is yours.""

Excitedly, the man climbed the stairs to the top of the belfry. As the pastor watched, the man took several steps back then ran head first towards the bell, creating the clearest, purist tone the pastor had ever heard.

""Bravo,"" the pastor said, ""the job is yours!"" And so the man dutifully fulfilled his job, day in and day out, announcing the time, church, weddings, funerals, everything.

However, one day there was a powerful storm. Despite this, the man kept to his job and climbed the belfry. He took several steps back, started to run towards the bell, but the wind caught the it, tilting it just enough that the man ran underneath it, off the belfry, and fell to his death.

The town mourned his death and, though no family ever showed, held a funeral for him. Out of respect, the town decided to wait several weeks before looking to hire a new bell toller.

After mourning, an ad was placed. A man walked into the pastor's office and inquired about the position. The pastor looked up, and much to his surprise, there stood the armless man.

""How can you be alive?! You fell three stories!""

""No, pastor, that was my twin brother you hired. He kept in touch with me via mail and had nothing but wonderful things to say about you and the townspeople. When I didn't hear anything from him in several weeks, I wrote him, thinking his message got lost. When I still hadn't heard from him, I came here, and learned of his death along the way. I didn't leave much behind me, so if you would, I'd love to apply for the job.""

After the pastor had collected himself, he obliged, with everything repeating as it had: the man ran head first towards the bell, earning the job, working hard, and falling to his death.

A small crowd gathered around the man's corpse when somebody yelled ""Does anybody know this man?""

Another person replied ""No, but his face sure rings a bell.""",There once was a man with no arms. [Long],17

He was lying on the floor for some reason and had a raging headache and a big bump on his forehead. That probably meant he was getting screamed at, when he got downstairs.

He tried to go to the kitchen, without making to much noise, but on the way he found that he broke a vase. Oh no, that meant more screaming.

But the smelh of fresh coffee, bacon and eggs in the air seemed of of place. Something was seriously wrong. This was not what he expected.

When he entered the kitchen his wife smiled happily at him and told him to sit down. He looked at his son who was already sitting at the table and eating his breakfast, and whispered to him: ""What happened, how much did I screw up?""

His son smiled at him and told him: ""You were shouting in the street, when you came home. But that wasn't enough so you puked over moms roses. Then you were not able to open the front door, so mom had to pick you up. On the way to the bedroom you broke her favourite vase.""

Karl got paler and paler with everything his son told him, he was sure this was his last supper. Why didn't he leave the pup earlier.

His son saw him getting paler, and continued. ""Mom tried to undress you. But when she tried to unzip your pants, you stood up told here 'Excuse me miss, I am happily married. I have to leave.' and tried to leave the bedroom and crashed into the door frame.""

post,cyuq6q,2qh72,jokes,false,1567456944,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cyuq6q/richards_daughter_was_getting_married/,self.jokes,,"She was his princess so he wanted to make her day everything she'd dreamed of. A gorgeous wedding chapel, a gourmet chef for the catering, and  dozens of bottles of the finest champagne to be served in authentic Italian crystal. Except for the fact that Richard was an elementary school teacher and such extravagance was well beyond his means.

He tried going to the banks, but every bank in town turned him down because of his bad credit.

He sold his old comic books and baseball cards but his small collection didn't net him much.

His friends at work scraped together what they could, but even that wasn't enough.

His daughter told him that it didn't matter, that a simple wedding was enough for her; he knew, but he still wanted to spoil his little girl one last time.

One day, he was perusing want ads for a second job and saw a man in a fine suit walking by. A fat envelope dropped out of the man's newspaper and hit the ground. When the man didn't turn around to retrieve it, Richard jogged over and picked it up. He caught up to the man in the suit and tapped him on the shoulder.

The man turned around and speared Richard with a glare.

""Whaddya want?""

""Y-you dropped something."" Richard proffered the envelope to the suited man who snatched it away, opened it, and began counting dozens of hundred dollar bills.

""You didn't take anything. You didn't even open it!"" He seemed incredulous.

""It's not my business to. Have a nice day."" Richard turned to leave but the suited man grabbed his elbow.

""I can't just let you go. If I'd have lost this dough I'd be a dead man. I always repay favors. If you ever need a favor, come here and ask for Paulo."" He slipped a business card into Richard's pocket and strode away.

Later that night Richard decided to take the man up on his offer. The address was a ritzy Italian restaurant he'd never been to. He wore his best suit and rehearsed what he'd ask for if the man was serious about helping.

He walked in the door and felt immediately out of place. At the tables were all sorts of business owners, politicians, and even Hollywood actors. The host took one look at Richard's cheap suit and looked as if he were about to shoo him away.  

Richard cleared his throat and said, ""I'm here to see Paulo.""

The host blinked and gestured for Richard to follow him.

Richard followed the host down a long hallway with increasingly sparse lighting. The noise of the restaurant faded as they walked deeper and deeper into the building. They soon came to an ornamented door and the host knocked a pattern of quick taps. A slot opened up at head height to reveal the face of the man Richard had met earlier. The man nodded to the host, who walked back the way they came.

The man, whom Richard assumed was Paulo, opened the door and beckoned him inside. The door shut behind him and the room was pitch black. Richard felt panic welling up before Paulo opened a door on the other side of the room.

Light flooded through and revealed a well-dressed Italian man behind a rich mahogany desk. He was stroking a white Persian cat while a phonograph played soft opera music.

""I understand you have done a great service for my son Paulo,"" the seated man said, ""and I would be remiss if I didn't return the favor on his behalf. Do you have any questions before we get down to business?""

The  parrot calmly stepped out onto Bill's extended arm and said, ""I am truly  sorry that I might have offended you with my language and action and I  humbly ask your forgiveness. I will now, from this day forth,endeavor to  correct my behavior so that such an ill-perceived outburst never again occurs.""

The Pastor was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the race again and it won again. 

&amp;nbsp;

The local paper headline the next day read: 
    
**PASTOR'S ASS OUT FRONT** 

&amp;nbsp;

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the Pastor not to enter the donkey in another race.

&amp;nbsp;
 
Again, the next day the local paper headline read: 
    
**BISHOP SCRATCHES PASTOR'S ASS** 

&amp;nbsp;

This was too much for the Bishop so he ordered the Pastor to get rid of the donkey. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thinking that it may be for the best, the Pastor decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent.

&amp;nbsp;
 
The local paper, hearing of the news, posted the following headline the next day: 
    
**NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN** 

&amp;nbsp;

As a result, the Bishop fainted. When he recovered he informed the Nun that she would have to get rid of the donkey so she sold it to a farm for $10. 

&amp;nbsp;

The next day the paper read: 
    
**NUN SELLS ASS FOR $10** 
    
&amp;nbsp;

This was too much for the Bishop so he ordered the Nun to buy back the donkey and lead it to the plains where it could run wild.

The next day the headlines read:

Larry was doing well in Heaven and one day St. Peter came up to him and said, ""Larry, you know you are the nicest clam we ever had up here. Everyone likes you, but you seem to be a bit depressed. Tell me what is bothering you, maybe I can help.""

Larry said, ""Well, don't get me wrong Pete, I like it up here and everything, but I really miss my good friend Sam Clam. We used to do everything together and I really miss him a lot.""

St. Peter looked at Larry with pity and said to him, ""I'll tell you what, I can arrange it so that you can go down to Hell tomorrow and visit Sam all day. How would that sound?""

This made Larry very happy and he got up bright and early the next morning and grabbed his wings, his harp and his halo and got in the elevator to Hell. 

When the doors opened he was met by Sam. 

They hugged each other and off they went!

You see, in Hell, Sam owned a disco. 

They spent the day there together and had a great time.

He opens the door and looks around, and looks down, and staring up at him is a snail. This being a new home and not wanting pests, the man picks up the snail and throws it as fair as he can. He wipes his hands and goes back to painting 

His wife gets home later with some groceries and he finishes painting. They have a lovely dinner and retire to bedroom to watch a movie and have a glass of wine. Soon they are having sex. They wake up the next day happy and in love.

A few weeks later the man’s wife finds out she’s pregnant. She shares the news with the man and they are overjoyed.

Time passes and her belly grows from a small bump to a much larger bump and before long she’s in labour.

The couple bring home their healthy baby girl and name her Sophie.

Sophie grows like a weed, she takes her first steps, says her first words, and becomes a rambunctious two year old.

The couple decides that Sophie should have a sibling and so they get to work and a year later Sophie has a baby brother named Benjamin.

Benjamin grows just as weed-like as Sophie. He takes his first steps, he says his first words, and when Sophie turns five, Benjamin is a few weeks from his second birthday.

Sophie starts school and Benjamin spends time in day care so that their mother can go back to work as an obstetrician. The man works less now that his wife is back to work and they have time to spend with their children.

Benjamin starts school and Sophie takes piano lessons, and plays soccer. Their parents can barely keep up to their energetic kids. But they agree it’s a blessing Sophie and Benjamin get along so well.

That changes when Sophie starts middle school and her younger brother starts to get on her nerves. But not long after Benjamin is in middle school with his sister just about to leave.

Benjamin plays in the school band and Sophie is on the drama team. Their parents couldn’t be prouder.

Sophie starts high school and introduces the family to her first boyfriend. Benjamin doesn’t like him, and is protective of his sister.

But Benjamin’s instincts are good, and Sophie suffers her first heartbreak. The man consoles his daughter and although she’s sad for awhile, she’s soon back to smiling as much as before. She graduates and goes to college.

Benjamin misses his sister, and spends his time drawing and playing music. He graduates as well and attends a prestigious art school.

As the couple drive back from dropping off their second child at his new adventure, they think back on the wonderful years they’ve spent in the house.

They get home and the woman goes up stairs to take a nap. The man goes to read a book in the living room.

Just as he sits down he hears a little knock on the door. So he goes to the door and he looks around, but sees nothing. So he closes the door but as he’s walking away he hears the same little knock at the door.

He opens the door and looks around, and looks down and he sees a snail.

His mother can only watch in terror, as her son confidently approaches the elephant, pats its head and then gently and carefully extracts the thorn. The elephant, now much restored, gingerly gets to its feet, places its trunk on the lad's shoulder, wipes away its tears then quickly limps away in search of the rest of the herd; occasionally looking back as it goes.

Flash-forward 30 years, the boy- now a man with a family of his own- is sitting ring-side, between his young children, in the big top of a travelling circus.

Performing elephants parade in a large circle, trunk to tail, all the way around the ring.

One of them stops suddenly, causing the others to bunch up behind it. It stares right into the crowd. Right at the man. Then it turns and heads directly towards him.

With its long and powerful trunk, it reaches over the barrier and gently lifts the much-astonished man clean out of his seat, before carefully lowering him down onto the sawdust between them. It slowly raises its leg high, showing the rough skin under its foot. Then ""CLAP!!""- it stamps him completely flat.

A moment later his stomach started to rumble and immediately he knew he had to find the nearest bathroom. 

Unfortunately for him, he went to the city during the campaign season, and the marketplace was crowded more than usual because a politician was campaigning at the center of the marketplace. The line to the bathroom was long. Too long for him to wait through so he took a plastic bag from his backpack, looked for a quiet, secluded corner and did the deed. 

Meanwhile, the politician was busy giving his speech. He stood on a makeshift stage, beside him was a weighing scale.  
""I promise everyone here..."" he said, ""...whatever you have bought be it fish, rice, vegetables...if it does not weigh at least a kilogram I shall personally add to that so that none of you here will leave with less than a kilogram of groceries."" 

The crowd cheered and the politician smirked as he looked at the crowd. ""Winning this election is going to be easy."" he thought. From the corner of his eye, he spotted the man leaving a dark alleyway holding a small plastic bag. ""You there!"" he yelled at the man ""Come up here and join me on-stage"". The man was confused but he reluctantly agreed and went up.

""Would you kindly place that plastic bag on this scale."" he told the man. The man promptly placed the small plastic bag on the scale and it didn't even come close to registering a kilogram. ""As you can see..."" yelled the politician to the crowd as he lifted the plastic bag. ""...this bag weighs less than a kilogram!"" The crowd cheered as the politician raised the plastic bag. ""Let us see what this man had bought, so that I may give him more!"" The crowd cheered once more as the politician put his hand inside the plastic bag. He had a look of confusion as he tried to figure out what it was that his hand was holding. Then confusion turned to disgust as he looked inside and saw the man's crap. 

""This is crap!"" the politician yelled ""Take this man away!"" he ordered his bodyguards who then took the man aside and beat him up.

Tired, beaten and dejected the man took the bus back home to his province. When he arrived he saw his friend who was surprised to see him back so soon. ""You're back already!?"" his friend said. ""How did your visit to the city go?"" he asked. ""Not so good my friend."" the man answered. ""They have very weird customs there...apparently if your shit doesn't weigh at least a kilogram you get beat up.""",A man born and raised in the province decided to move to the city to find a decent job.,7

I hesitated a little, but finally looked at the clock while counting the lies I told in my head. With a blush on my cheeks I admitted I wasn't proud of it, but the clock told the truth.

""Okay,"" Saint Peter said, ""I guess I can let you in now."" While I followed him back to the gates I suddenly had an idea, stopped and asked him if I could see my wife's clock while we were there. He shrugged and said we would pass it on the way out anyway, so that would be no problem. So after a minute of walking he pointed at a large clock on our left on the second shelve from the top. ""That's you wife's,"" Saint Peter said.

I looked at it, thought about and mumbled ""I knew it!"" Saint Peter laughed about it and started walking again when I stopped him and asked him: ""Before we leave... Can I please have a quick look a the clock that belongs to the person who downvoted my joke, because 'he didn't like it'?""

But then it hit me: What have I done? I spent all our family savings on one stupid apple! 

Feeling horrible, I went ahead and cleaned up the apple: with the hopes that the seller will buy it back from me.

He saw the apple and said: wow, that's such a nice apple. I'd give you a dollar for that.

I took that dollar and bought 2 dirty apples with it. Cleaned them very well for an hour, and sold them for 2 dollars.

I was off to races.

""Well son, this is my bear pistol"" the guide explains, drawing the weapon to show to the pair, ""In case we get attacked by a grizzly out there and we can't scare him off, this will be my last resort as a defense."" As he examined the pistol, the son noticed that the sight on the barrel was filed down so the barrel was smooth. ""And why is the sight filed down?"" he asked. ""That's easy"", replied the ranger, ""That's so after you shoot the bear, it doesn't hurt as much when he takes the gun from you and shoves it up your ass.""

Startled, he looked around yet saw no one and concluded that he was just hearing things. Later, he crept into a study and found a safe behind a picture. As he was cracking it he heard the voice yet again whisper from far away, “Jesus really watching you” 

Now really concerned, he stopped what he was doing and crept around the house to check everywhere for the source of this voice. Yet he found nothing. 

So he made a mental note to check with a therapist and was about to go to continue stealing until he heard the voice right behind him say, “Jesus is seriously watching you, stop now before you go too far for redemption”

The man spun around and saw a parrot in a cage looking at him dead in the eye. The man said: “So you are the voice who kept saying that, why?”

“To save you” replies the parrot

“Well I already stole before so I much doubt I’m going to heaven,” said the man. He then decided to leave but heard a low yet ominous growling coming from right behind him

“Seems like you’ll see whether that’s right sooner than you thought” The parrot said “Jesus is our dog”",A man was robbing a house,25

the brim with $10 bills. He guesses there must be at least ten thousand dollars in it.He
approaches the bartender and asks, ""What's with the money in the jar?""
""Well..., you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the
keys to a brand new Lexus."" 
The man certainly isn't going to
pass this up, so he asks, ""What are the three tests?"" 
""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules."" 
So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10 which he stuffs into the 
jar. 
""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do:

First - You have to
drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less, and you can't 
make a face while doing it.""

""Second - There's a pit bull chained in the back 
with a bad tooth. You have to remove 
that tooth with your bare hands.""

""Third - There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. You have to take care 
of that problem.""

The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my $10 -- but I'm not an idiot! I won't do it! You'd 
have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila and then do all those other things!"" 
""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is."" 
As time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says, ""Where's the damn 
tequila?!"" 
He grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can.Tears stream down 
both cheeks -- but he doesn't make a face -- and he drinks it in 58 seconds!


Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole. 

Soon, the
people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a terrible fight
-then, nothing but silence!


Just when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar. 
His clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over his body. 



He drunkenly says, ""Now..., where's that old woman with the bad tooth?","A man, a jar and a dog.",61
