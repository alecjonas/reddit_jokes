""Ugh. You hear that? It's terribly embarrassing having my butt announcing that to anyone nearby.""

""Hmm"" the doctor said, ""and do you have any other health concerns going on?""

The man said ""Well now that you mention it, my right butt cheek has been feeling a bit tender. But I figured that was just from the farting.""

The doctor instructed the patient to drop trou, get up on the exam table and face away from him.

""Aha, just as I thought"" the doctor said, ""you have an abscess.""

The doctor proceeded to prep and drain the abscess. Once he was finished, he asked the patient to get dressed.

""How are you feeling now?"" he asked his patient.

The man pondered this, not feeling particularly different other than the lack of buttock tenderness.

""Hang on a sec, I feel another fart coming on.""

brrrt--

For the first time in ages, the man's fart was just a run of the mill fart. 

The man was quite happy being back to normal. He asked the doctor how he knew what the cause was.

""Quite simply,"" the doctor said, ""abscess makes the fart go Honda!""

""I am a man of deep faith"" explained Bob to his neighbors. ""I don't need to flee my village. God will protect me.""  
&amp;nbsp;  
The water kept rising, and when it was knee high the Sheriff's SUV stopped in front of Bob's house.  
""Come on Bob!"" Screamed the Sheriff. ""You're gonna drown!""  
""I. AM. A MAN. OF FAITH!"" Screamed back Bob from the top floor. ""GOD WILL SAVE ME!""   
&amp;nbsp;  
The water kept rising and rising until it completely covered the houses. Bob stood on tiptoes over his roof to keep his face over the water.  
At that moment, a motorboat approached from the distance.  
""Guys! We have a survivor here! Hey! Come to the boat, we're leaving!""  
Bob, face up, barely an inch over the water level, said in a tiny voice: ""man of faith""... ""God will save""  
&amp;nbsp;  
Finally, the boat had to leave. The water kept rising, and Bob drowned.  

As he got to the doors of Heaven Bob was fuming.  
He spat at saint Peter's feet, kicked the doors open and went straight to God.  

""WHY! I was a man of faith! Why didn't you save me?""  
God was surprised.  
""Bob?"" He said in his deep voice. ""The fuck are you talking about?  I sent two pick-ups an SUV and a fucking motorboat!""","It rained for days, and the flood came.",104

Nobody really knew his identity, except for the fact that he always used to count to three before shooting his victim.

One time, a mob leader wanted a hit on a rival leader, so he hired him. He said ""I want the kill to be clean, leave no trace. And since I'm a big fan of your legend, I'd like to be there when you assassinate the target"". The assassin agrees.

With carefully planned tactics, the assassin infiltrates the rival gang on the pretence of capturing the mob leader.
Finally, in the room with the mob leader and the rival leader, the assassin aims his pistol at the target and counts.

\*BANG\*

The rival drops dead.

""But I thought you count to three"", said the mob leader.

post,8dc6qj,2qh72,jokes,false,1524113746,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8dc6qj/the_last_ride/,self.jokes,,"""Congratulations! You can now handle this route on your own. Remember the company's protocol"", Bobbie beamed as he finished assessing Dave's performance for Bus Service 13. ""Enjoy the night events following the route"", Bobbie mischievously hinted at Dave, his junior who had just joined the company.


Today, Dave steeled his nerves. He will be on his own, handling the midnight ""last bus"" schedule for Service 13, a long but important service, as it serviced a massive industrial area. Of course it's a bustling service in the day, with workers to and fro. As part of regulation, the company has to operate the service even till midnight where there's usually no passengers. Oddly, his only assignment will be to drive this service at this timing, and nothing else. Noone else in the company was jealous of his work but Dave cast aside those thoughts.


Satisfied with the initial inspection of the double-decker bus, he started on his journey from the depot. With only the scenes of forest edges flying by, he examined quiet roads and empty pathways but an eerie feeling crept up as he passed a dilapidated graveyard. The government planned to exhume the site to pave way for more industrial projects, or at least that was what he had read in the papers.


Approaching the start of the industrial area, he wondered if there'll be anyone boarding the bus. As expected, there was noone in the multitude of bus-stops he passed. As the last few factories loomed before him, he noticed someone at a bus-stop.


It was an old lady, dressed simply in a white dress, her dishevelled hair blocking her face, but two things were apparent. She held out her hand flagging the bus but her eyes were transfixed on something above. Specifically, the upper deck of the bus.


Dave slowed down, feeling slightly nervous and as he approaches, the figure maintained her position but her gaze never strayed. Confident that the person was physically there, he stopped and the woman boarded, her face distraught.


""I have never seen so many people up there at this time, it must be because today's Friday the 13th"", she shivered. Dave was dumbfounded as she took her seat beside the stairwell leading to the upper deck. Indeed today was Friday 13th  as he eyed the woman through the rear view mirror. She was 5 seats away from him but her fear was contagious. Dave had goosebumps as he pulled off.


""I'm sorry madam, but what do you mean people up there? You're the first passenger"", Dave inquired, trying to quench his curiousity.


""Nothing nothing! I can hear them stomping above as though they're trying to shush me"", the woman squeaked as she clasped her hand in prayer.


Dave was mortified. He kept looking at the CCTV monitor panel but there was noone in the upper decks. His fear was somewhat relieved as they entered the residential zone and 13 stops later, the woman buzzed the stop. Dave couldn't believe his eyes when the woman ran fleeing out of the bus at her stop. Her face displayed pure agony as she turned back for the last time to look at the bus before disappearing into the shadows of the houses.


Dave controlled his breathing and continued driving. It was only a few stops away till the final depot, so he must see this journey to the end. Still, he kept peeking at the CCTV monitors to be sure but nothing happened as he ended his work for the day.



Dave didn't tell anyone what happened as he turned up for work the next day. Perhaps it was an anomaly, there was no point in looking like a mad man after just a day's work. He checked the bus and headed out for the journey.


The same start as yesterday and again at the same stop, there appeared the lady again. She looked the same, save for her change of clothes but still her gaze was transfixed on the upper deck.


""Today's less busy... but there's a hulking presence amongst them"", she whispered as she sat further way from Dave, nearer the exit doors.


Chill went down his spine. Was there a murderous intent above that he didn't notice? He scanned the monitors just to be safe but he couldn't see anything. Even Dave who didn't believe in the supernatural, was starting to question his beliefs, as he noticed the woman sobbing in her seat.


As if a replay of last night's activities, the woman sprung out and ran when they reached her stop. She didn't even look back.


These series of events repeated themselves as Dave drove the service for more than a year. He thought he could get used to it but he just couldn't. Different nights, different terrors. It has gotten to the point that the woman now regularly sat on the exit door steps, clutching to the walls, sniffling her cries.


""There's something on the roof"", ""I can hear them trying to go down the stairwells"", ""Stop looking into the upper deck, they're restless"", ""We're damned in this service"", ""I hope you're praying as hard as me, it's the only way to resist"", ""Stop crying and wailing, stop! Stop, I can't help you!!!"", ""God bless me please!"", all manners of horrified speeches were said by the woman, either directed to him or to the dwelling above.



""I pray you are safe!"", ""God bless your soul"", ""Be safe"", sometimes she would say that to Dave before she alighted. Dave hated it when she said parting words because it hinted a terrifying presence.


And then one day it stopped.


The lady stopped appearing.


The same day the government had also begun exhuming the sites and transferring the remains to another mortuary.


Dave rue the day he started noticing her absence. She was the only company he had in this damned service route.


He kept checking the CCTV above, afraid of the unknown. He started praying from the moment he start the journey. He brought books of faith, talisman, charms and even turned to vegetarian diet to rid himself of bad karma. But whatever he did, the pressure behind him grew and grew. 


Without the woman, things had started to go awry. He didn't notice them at first but he thought he could start seeing the negativities himself. Flickers in the CCTV monitor, he felt the temperature drop, opposing cars high beamed him, and it started to affect his driving. He would narrowly avoid collision with structures while checking the monitors. He would unconciously speed up and beat red lights when in the vicinity of the violated graveyard.


2 months of this has taken a toll on Dave. He had nightmares every night, images of dark shadows consuming the interior of the bus. In just the short period, Dave had lost a lot of weight, he looked gaunt and his eyes lifeless. His concerned wife pulled him aside and just said she loved him, their children loved him, and if work was the reason he had become like this, he should find another job.


Dave spent the morning thinking about this. The job paid well since it was night hours, it was only 1 route and he had never fell ill in the past year, despite his horror experiences. It was only after the lady disappeared that things have taken a physical toll on him. He concluded that she was part of his divine protection. He had made up his mind. He will tender his resignation.



In front of his superiors, Dave explained his reasons for quitting. He didn't care if they didn't believed him, and he even turned down their offer for a raise. They must know something, that must be why they want to keep me. Without anyone else wanting to run the midnight bus service 13, the company could face a legal repercussion. In the end, they had to call back Bobbie, the only person who had drove that route before Dave. In fact, Bobbie drove exclusively that route for more than a decade, never taking a day off.


Dave took his leave and lo and behold, he met Bobbie outside the office. 


Bobbie exlaimed his surprise, ""I heard you're resigning? But why?""


""I couldn't continue working that route after the only passenger, this lady, I don't know anything about her, but after she stopped apeparing, I just don't have the will to continue"", Dave said.


""That's... a damn shame! She was the only reason why I had agreed to come back! My ailing eyesight was why the company transferred me to day shift. But if I had a choice, I would have stayed on service 13! But now that she's gone... it's all over"", Bobbie wept.


Bobbie continued hopelessly, ""Now who's gonna accompany me in that night ride..."".


""I understand what you meant Bobbie. In hindsight, she was also the reason why I stayed. She was my protector, my guardian angel"", Dave sighed.


""What the fuck are you talking about?"", quizzed Bobbie suddenly.


Dave told his stories to a bewildered Bobbie, who kept quiet the whole time.


""That foxy vixen... I guess she must have retired from her company"" mumbled Bobbie.


Noticing the shocked look plastered on Dave's face.


Bobbie chuckled, ""I guess she'll really do anything to avoid paying the bus fare"".

The manager explainxs the procedure to him -- “We are expert parachute packers, and have never had a failure.  We take you up in the plane and tell you when to jump out.  You pull the main chute ripcord.  It always works.  But if it doesn’t, you pull the auxiliary chute ripcord. You then float softly to the ground, and we will meet you in that truck right over there.”

The man decides to go for it.  The plane takes off and circles the airfield.  He jumps out and after a brief moment of free fall, pulls the main chute, which fails. He then pulls the second ripcord and that fails as well. He looks down towards the ground and says to himself, “I bet that damned truck isn’t there either.”",Overcoming the fear of parachuting.,5

So the lawyer goes home that night and loads all the pigs up in the truck, takes them to the woods and fucks them all one time.

He wakes up the next morning sore and looks out the window to see all the pigs running around like crazy. ""This can't be right!"". He calls the vet and asks how he'll know the pigs are pregnant. She tells him the pigs will just be laying around not doing much. The lawyer tells her the pigs are running around like crazy! She tells him to be patient and to just keep at it.

So he takes the pigs out to the woods every other day and fucks them all two times. After a week or two he sees the pigs are still just running around being crazy. He calls the vet again to tell her it's not working. She says, ""It's really not that hard, just keep trying and if you don't see a change in their behavior the next time, bring them in and we'll run some tests.""

The lawyer decides to go all in and he takes all the pigs out to the woods that night and fucks them all all night long. He wakes up the next morning and is so sore and exhasted. He asks his wife to look out the window and see what the pigs are doing.

The wife goes to the windows and draws the blinds. She yells out, ""OH MY GOD!!!"". Excited, and confused the lawyer yells from the bed, ""What is it? What are they doing?!?"". The wife says, ""All the pigs have loaded themselves up in the truck and one is in the front seat honking the horn!""

And so, the coals were attacked. The man fell down screaming in agony.

There is a man who frequents one of the restaurants and always sits in the same spot and has a good friendship with the owner through his regular and long running patronage to the restaurant.

One day, the owner notices that the man hasn’t turned up at his usual time, and wonders why it might be that he didn’t turn up. He decides not to overthink it and instead just goes with the assumption that he is ill or otherwise indisposed for some important reason.

However this persists for quite some time, and the owner wonders if perhaps the man had grown tired of their food, or perhaps something else had put him off coming anymore. 

The owner chances to look outside and sees nothing more than the man on the other side of the street eating at the other restaurant!

Now he is really worried that they had done something wrong to make him betray his patronage to them and switch to the other restaurant, but he is at first too scared to confront him and decides to give him a chance to come back.

The next day the owner sees him at the rival restaurant again! He decides he must confront him about it or else he will never know, so he crosses the street and waits outside until the man has finished. The man looks a little surprised although not unhappy to see the owner waiting for him wanting to talk. 

The owner says to him: “Why have you left our patronage my friend? I don’t understand, what did we do wrong? Was the food no longer to your liking?”

The man says: “You didn’t do anything wrong, and the food was fine, but I went to the dentist the other day and he told me to eat on the other side.”",Two rival restaurants are on opposite sides of a road...,11

The dietitian goes, ""What seems to be the problem?""


The moth replies, ""Where to start, doc?  Each day I wake up at 6:00 a.m. next to a moth wife I once loved, who I have slowly drifted away from over the days.  Her once beautiful moth body has sagged to the point that I don't even recognize her, and her nagging grows more incessant every day.


Once I get out of bed I go through the dull repetitions of a meaningless life: shower, shave, brush my teeth, and all of the other normal moth drudgery.  As I step into the kitchen to make my morning coffee I see my two unremarkable moth children, who I am convinced are someone else's because they look nothing like me.  Of course I pretend to love them as any moth should, but there's a part of me that just wants to smother them.


When I finally get into work at 8:30 I arrive at my desk to find what seems like the same towering stack of papers each day.  No matter how hard I work a new stack is there each morning, and I wonder if it's even worth the struggle.  I'd love to quit but I keep telling myself that I need the money to support my moth family, a family I don't even love.


I go to sleep each night and wake up each morning with an unshakable feeling of emptiness.  If only that feeling of emptiness were a little stronger, maybe then I would have the courage to pick up the loaded guy I keep on my nightstand and end this hellish facade!""


The doctor replies, ""Well... I'm very sorry to hear that you are not feeling well and it's clear that you need treatment, but your problems seem to be more appropriate to bring up with a psychiatrist.  Why did you come to a dietitian's office?""


""Because the light was on.""",Moth Joke,10

post,8d7pwb,2qh72,jokes,false,1524074434,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8d7pwb/the_tale_of_paul_and_old_joe/,self.jokes,,"There once was a man named Paul who, after some trouble with the law, found himself homeless behind a fast food joint just outside of Wichita, Kansas. He stayed there for a few days, drinking from the bathroom sinks and eating scraps from the trash, when an old rancher named Joe found him and took pity. 

""Look,"" the old man said, ""if you don't mind some hard work, I'll take you back to my ranch. I'm in need of a ranch-hand, and I think I could offer you a bed and rustle up some warm grub."" Paul graciously agreed, and headed off to the ranch with old Joe.

The first few weeks were hard. He had to shovel manure, coral the horses, and learn to rope cattle. His muscles ached and his hands were covered in blisters. But he had a warm bed in the loft of the barn and three hot meals a day, and old Joe was kind, so he kept at it.

Well, the weeks turned into months and Paul turned out to be a fine ranch-hand. He could do barn chores faster than anybody and roped cattle with the best of them. He still stayed in the straw bed in the barn loft and ate hot chow with old Joe and Joe's wife.

Seasons changed. The grass went brown and the winds turned cold, but Paul still worked as hard as ever, rising as early as 3 am to get started on the barn chores. The months turned into years and he grew close to kind old Joe.

One day Joe took him aside and said, ""Paul, you've really grown on me. I can't help but remember the poor state in which I found you and how much you've changed. You're the best ranch hand I ever had. I want you to start sleeping in the farmhouse, in my son's room. He died a couple years before I found you, in a car crash, and I've left his room empty since... but I want you to have it. You're like a son to me now.""

In tears of gratitude, Paul agreed, and started sleeping in the farmhouse.

Well, the stages of life pass like seasons-- the spring of birth, the summer of youth, the fall of aging, and the winter of death-- and old Joe fell ill with pneumonia. They called the doctor out to take a look and the news wasn't good-- old Joe had grown weak and the medicine couldn't get on top of the infection. Joe was on his deathbed.

After the doctor left, Joe asked a distraught Paul to come closer. He whispered, ""Paul, my second son. I need you to do something for me. When I was in the war, I took a gold watch off a Jap who tried to bayonet me. It's been a treasure of mine because it reminded me of the fragility of life and the horrors of war. Wanting to keep it safe, I sealed it in a fence post on the far side of the pasture. I painted the top white so I could remember where it is. Paul, I'd like to have that watch with me now, while I wait to pass on to the Lord.""

Paul agreed. Filled with determination and aware that time was running out, Paul saddled up the fastest horse on the ranch and galloped at full speed to the end of the pasture. He dismounted at the far end and started looking for the white-topped post.

He checked one, then another, then another. No white tops, no hidden watches. Frustration growing, Paul broke out into a run, first running one way, then the other.

Finally, he found a post that looked promising. The paint on top was faded gray, but still there. Paul ran his fingers over the top, feeling the rough, weathered surface, and found a small crack. He pulled the post open in expectation and found... nothing. There was no watch. 

""You lookin' for a watch?"" a voice from behind called out.

Paul turned and saw an old man, maybe even older than Paul, standing behind him. ""Who are you?"" Paul asked.

The old man smiled. ""They call me Billy, but that's not my real name. I'm Joe's brother. I stay out here in the shed by the far corner of the pasture, and watch over the cattle when they come this way. In return, my brother gives me three square meals a day and a roof over my head.

""I can't work anywhere else, after I took some shrapnel in my back on Okinawa. I was there, with Joe, when he took the watch. I knew how much it meant to him, so I was a little surprised when he stuck in an old fence post. After some months had gone by and Joe stopped checking on it, I took the post with the watch and locked them up in my shed here for safety. 

""I rustled up and old scrap post, painted the top white, and stuck it where you are now. It ain't the post you want. What you're lookin' at, right there, is just a repost."" ",The tale of Paul and Old Joe,18

One friend: you know its going to take at least 1 hour for me to be back here right? I will only go if you promise not to touch the sandwich until I return.

Two Other friends: sure! we promise not to        touch the sandwich until you return.

After being persuaded, he drove to the reservation, handed his ticket to the medicine man, and wondered what he was in for.

The medicine man slowly, methodically produced a potion, handed it to him, and with a grip on his shoulder, warned, 'This is powerful medicine. It must be respected. You take only teaspoonful, and then say '1-2-3.' When you do that, you will become manlier than you have ever been in your life, and you can perform as long as you want."" The old man was encouraged. As he walked away, he turned and asked, ""How do I stop the medicine from working?"" ""Your partner must say '1-2-3-4,'"" he responded, ""but when she does, the medicine will not work again until next full moon.""

The old man was very eager to see if it worked so he went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine, and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom. When she came in, he took off his clothes and said, ""1-2-3!""

Immediately, he was the manliest of men. His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes, and then she asked, ""What was the 1-2-3 for?""

Dazed and confused I crawled out of the ditch to the edge of the road when a shiny new convertible pulled up with a very beautiful woman who asked, ""Are you okay?""
As I looked up, I noticed she was wearing a low cut blouse with cleavage to die for...
""I'm okay I think,"" I replied as I pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.
She said, “Get in and I’ll take you home so I can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head.”
""That's nice of you,"" I answered, ""but I don't think my wife will like me doing that!""
""Oh, come now, I’m a nurse,"" she insisted. ""I need to see if you have any more scrapes and then treat them properly.""
Well, she was really pretty and very persuasive. Being sort of shaken and weak, I agreed, but repeated, ""I'm sure my wife won't like this.""
We arrived at her place which was just few miles away and, after a couple of cold beers and the bandaging, I thanked her and said, ""I feel a lot better, but I know my wife is going to be really upset so I'd better go now.""
""Don't be silly!"" she said with a smile, while unbuttoning her blouse exposing the most beautiful set of boobs I’ve ever seen. ""Stay for a while. She won't know anything. By the way, where is she?""

Mario takes off his clothes and Maria being a girl raised in a monastery only with women is surprised when she sees Mario's penis. She asks him: 

She- What is that?

Mario understands that she has no clue about what is going to happen so tries to use the situation in his favor, so he says: 

He- This is a penis, I am the only man in the world with such a thing. Let me show you what's its use.

So both have sex that night and Maria is very happy that she is married with the only one that has something like that. 
The next day Mario goes to work but is surprised when he returns home, as Maria is waiting for him irritated at the doorstep. He asks:

He - What's the problem darling?

She - You are just a liar, you told me that you were the only man with such a thing between your legs!

He- Yes, I am, why do you think I am not?

She- Because I saw today behind the bush your friend Luigi. I think he was peeing and he has the same thing as you!

Mario tries again to put the situation in his favor:

He- You are right, he also has one. But you should know that I gave him that. I actually had two, but since he is my best friend, I gave one to him.

Maria believes Mario so they make peace with each other.
The next day when Mario is returning from work sees his wife even more irritated waiting for him at the doorstep. So he asks:

He- What is darling, what happened today?

She- You are an idiot! Why the hell did you give him the better one?!!

One day, the priest makes a bet with the other guys that he could convert a bear in the woods over to his religion. The others nod and say ""Yeah, I'll bet we could do it quicker than you could!"" So they all agree that the next time they meet, they'll share stories about how they were able to convert a bear.

They all end up in the hospital, but the priest is in the best shape of all of them. They decide to meet in the rabbi's room. The priest has his arm in a sling and says, ""Yeah, it was tough at first, but I was able to dash it with some holy water. The next thing I know, it started saying Hail Mary. He's coming to mass this Sunday.""

The other two clergymen nod in approval, and the preacher goes next. The preacher is in pretty bad shape. He's in a wheel chair, and he has a concussion, a broken leg, and a broken arm. He says ""Well, when I finally happened upon it, I wrestled that thing to the ground and started beating its head with a Bible.

Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor. Horatio thought about this and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it.

Without pause, Nick readily agreed to the scheme.

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that, among all of the citizens of the kingdom,only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and was hailed by the King and Queen as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick . . .

The moral of the story - Pay your bills.",There once lived a beautiful queen,50

She greatly enjoyed his company, as did the dog, but she was still too in love with her ex-husband to reciprocate his feelings.

John and Sarah had worked together at the town’s mysterious chocolate factory for many years, and they’d often get one another chocolate as gifts. Sadly for John, this was about the extent of the relationship.

One day, John found half of a chocolate bar with a golden wrapper outside his front door. The inscription on the wrapping said *One bite, and you’ll become the object of your love’s deepest desire. But only for an hour, after which you’ll live no more*.

Without hesitation, he took a bite and was instantly transformed into a spitting image of Sarah’s ex-husband. He ran down to her door and when he opened it, Sarah threw herself into his arms and they made love for nearly an hour. 

After the passionate lovemaking, and without a word, Sarah ran out the door. John lay there for a minute, savoring his final moments, and decided he’d best walk back up to his home for the end. On the walk back, a car pulled up next to him, it was Sarah.

“Oh John,” she said “would you mind helping me out? The dog got into some chocolate about an hour ago and now I can’t seem to find him anywhere!”",There once was an old man named John who lived alone on a mountainside.,1

So, I hear all my friends tell me how much they like New York, so I decide I'm gonna go visit.  I take the plane to New York from Rome, an' by the time I get there, it's the middle of the night.

So I go to my hotel, and find my room, and I look around, an' on my bed there's a pillow an' a blanket but no sheet.

So I go to the front desk an' say, ""Hey!  I wanna sheet!""

The guy at the desk say, ""Everybody wanna sheet.""

An' I say, ""No, I wanna sheet onna bed!""

An' he say, ""You don't getta sheet onna bed you sonna ma bitch,""

I don't even know this guy, an' he call me sonna ma bitch.

So I keep yellin' at this guy, an' they throw me outta the hotel, an' by now it's getting light out, so I go lookin' for breakfast.

I find a nice place to eat, and order the eggs and bacon.  An' when they bring me the plate, there's the eggs an' the bacon, but only one piece of toast.  So I go to the counter an' say, ""Hey!  I want two piece!""

An' the kid say, ""Everybody want two piece.""

An' I say, ""No, I want two piece onna plate!""

An' he say, ""You don't get two piece onna plate, you sonna ma bitch!""

I don't even know this kid, an' he call me sonna ma bitch.

So I keep yellin' at this kid, an' they throw me out of the place.

So it's middle of the day now, an' I'm really gettin' hungry, so I find a nice restaurant, an' I order the steak.  An' when they put the food onna table, there's the plate, and the knife, but no fock.  So I call the waitress and say, ""I wanna fock.""

An' she say, ""Everybody wanna fock.""

An' I say, ""No, I wanna fock onna table!""

An' she say, ""You don't getta fock onna table, you sonna ma bitch!""

I don't even know this lady, an' she call me sonna ma bitch.

So, I keep yellin' at this lady, an' they throw me outta the restaurant.

An' now I decide that New York isn't as nice as my friends say, so I go back to the airport.  An' in the airport, there's a nun standin' there askin' for money.  So I give her some change an' she says, ""Peace on you.""

An' I say, ""Piss on you too, you sonna ma bitch, I'm goin' home to Italy!""",An Italian in New York,24

A little while later the Bus Driver takes his tape and measures the grill, and then he goes over to his wife while she is still bending over the garden and measures her rear and gasps, ""Geeeez, it really *IS* as wide as the grill!"" She ignores this remark as well. 






Later that night in bed, the Bus Driver begins feeling a bit horny. The wife responds, ""If you think I'm gonna fire up the grill for one little wiener, you are sadly mistaken.""",A Bus Driver and his wife......,7

Professor one responds: “Deal.”

On his way to the bathroom, the second professor stops the waitress and says: “Next time you come over to my table I am going to ask you if you have taken calculus and what the antiderivative of cos(x) is. If you say yes and answer that the antiderivative is sin(x), I will give you a large tip.”

Waitress responds: “Okay.”

After the second professor returns from the restroom, the waitress approaches the table they are at.

Professor two says: “Excuse me miss, have you ever taken calculus?”

Waitress responds: “Yes I have.”

Professor two: “Do you happen to know the antiderivative of cos(x) then?”

Waitress: “Yes, the antiderivative of cos(x) is sin(x).”

Professor one tells his colleague: “You were right, they don’t forget calculus after they finish the class.”

The waitress leaves. While walking away she mumbles to herself: “The antiderivative of cos(x) is sin(x) + C dumbasses.”

Terrorists have been re-categorized from “Tiresome” to “A Bloody Nuisance.” The last time the British issued a “Bloody Nuisance” warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.

The Scots have raised their threat level from “Pissed Off” to “Let’s get the Bastards.” They don’t have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.

The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from “Run” to “Hide.” The only two higher levels in France are “Collaborate” and “Surrender.” The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France ‘s white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country’s military capability.

Italy has increased the alert level from “Shout Loudly and Excitedly” to “Elaborate Military Posturing.” Two more levels remain: “Ineffective Combat Operations” and “Change Sides.”

The Germans have increased their alert state from “Disdainful Arrogance” to “Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs.” They also have two higher levels: “Invade a Neighbour” and “Lose.”

Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels .

The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.

Australia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from “No worries” to “She’ll be alright, Mate.” Two more escalation levels remain: “Crikey! I think we’ll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!” and “The barbie is cancelled.” So far no situation has ever warranted use of the last final escalation level.

He tries to figure it out again, to no avail. There's nobody around who can be saying it, and nobody else can hear it. He is grateful to leave work for the day and get away from the awful voice. But after he's in his car for just a few minutes, he hears it again.

&gt;Quit your job, sell your house, drive to Vegas...

He's really freaking out now. There is nobody in his car that even could be saying this. it's just a voice. And when he gets home he keeps hearing it.

&gt;Quit your job, sell your house, drive to Vegas...

He thinks he just needs to rest, but when he lays his head down to sleep, he hears it again.

&gt;Quit your job, sell your house, drive to Vegas...

The whole night, I keeps him up. And the next morning he keeps hearing it. Finally, he snaps and gives in. He calls his job and tells them he's quitting, no notice. He sells his house as quickly as he can and jumps in his car to go down to Vegas.  On the drive, he doesn't hear the voice so he figures he's doing something right. When he gets to Vegas, he hears. 

&gt;Take all your money, go into the Bellagio, and exchange it for chips...

He parks his car, walks in with an armload of cash and exchanges it at the cashier. He's ready when the voice comes again.

&gt;Go to the roulette area. Sit down at the second table on the left...

He quickly finds the roulette table the voice mentioned and sits down. The croupier is amazed by how many chips he brought, but he doesn't care. He's just listening for the voice. 

&gt;Bet all your chips on 17 black...

The man pushes all the chips forward. ""17 Black!"" he tells the croupier.  His bet on the table, the croupier spins the wheel, and it lands in 21 red.  Then the voice says

&gt;Damn...

The man nods vigorously, “Yes sir, yes sir, it all started when I was born with one testicle and I just knew that bowling was the life for me, but alleys have always been pretty scary...” He went on talking in loose associations not making any sense, clearly not aware of his situation or where he was.

The doctor lets him go on for about a minute before stopping him, and saying “Well, thank you very much, sir, I hope you have a great day.”  The three turned and left the room.

They put the left half back in and removed the right half, asking him to count to 10 again.

Finally they decided to just go for it and removed the whole brain. They again asked him to count to 10 one more time.

In heaven God said to them you're all nice gentlemen I'll let you live once again if you admit your greatest flaw and swear to never do that again.

The first man told God I'm very greedy I'll make sure to spend more money and also donate money to charity.

God said fine you're allowed to return

And just like that the first man was alive again

The second man told God he ate too unhealthy and he would make sure to never eat fast food again.

God said fine you're allowed to return

And just like that the second man was alive again

The third man told God he had a bad habit of putting his schlong in the wrong hole even when his partner didn't want that

God said fine you're allowed to return

And just like that they all were alive again

Now when all three men were back they decided to celebrate that they're still alive

The first and third man wanted to go eat pizza

The second man thought I'll tag along but I won't eat any pizza

After the first and third man had eaten their pizza one of them left the crust on the pizza

The second man then thought the crust isn't that unhealthy it won't hurt if I eat just a little

As soon as he touched the crust he vanished in a cloud of smoke

The first and third man became very scared and determined to never fail their promises to God 

On the way home they took a shortcut through a very thin Alleyway

The Alleyway was so thin they couldn't walk beside each other so they went one man in front and the other in the back

The first man who was also the one in the front
Saw a 100dollar bill on the ground ahead of them
He thought to himself that if he picked it up he would vanish but he also thought I could donate it to charity so those who need it can get it.

As the 100dollar bill came closer and closer the first man still hadn't made a choice

When he was just above the 100dollar bill he quickly bent down and picked it up

And the third man disappeared",Once upon a time...,3

Except Jesus' ball lands gently on the surface of the pond, rolls up on the green, two feet from the hole for what will surely be an easy one putt. Everyone congratulates Jesus appropriately. 

The third in the group ambles up to the tee and squares his shoulders. A short backswing and an awkward forward jerk and his ball too is now headed straight for the water and goes in with a splash. A moment later a large fish leaps out of the water with the his ball in its mouth. An eagle swoops down from the sky, catches the fish and flies over the green. A blinding beam of sunlight is reflected into the eagle's eyes causing him to lose focus and drop the fish on the green with a thud. The ball pops loose from the fish's mouth and rolls toward the hole with promise, only to stop 1/8th inch from dropping in. Not 5 seconds later a stiff breeze wofts by and pushes the ball in the cup for a hole in one.

She helped him get into a freshly laundered pair of silk pajamas and told him she'd go get him a steak. When I left him he was beaming like I'd never seen before and I told him I'd see him in the morning.

The next morning I pulled up and my grandad came limping rapidly over to my car, wrenched the door open and told me to drive, startled I asked him why.

""but grandad, you said you loved it here and wanted to stay last night!“

"" I know, but on the way to breakfast this morning I fell over and this huge orderly ran up to me, pulled my pajamas down and fucked me like a rented car, apparently they do that when you fall over!“

post,8cv2fd,2qh72,jokes,false,1523954683,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8cv2fd/the_magical_train_conductor/,self.jokes,,"A train conductor wakes up early in the morning for his job in a country that has unique spiritual beliefs. He performs his morning routine, drives to work, and boards his train. Once the train is filled with passengers, he begins his usual route. However, the train conductor made the mistake of taking a corner too quickly, causing the train to derail. When this happened, hundreds of passengers were killed in the accident. The train conductor was taken in for a trial and was found responsible for the death of the passengers. He was sent to death row for his crimes.

The train conductor was asked to pick a final meal before his execution. Trying to delay it for as long as possible, he requested a special kind of berry that can only be found at the top of Mount Everest. Annoyed, the warden agrees to retrieve this special food for him, as that is his right. A few days later, the berry is brought to him. He eats it slowly, and is then escorted to the electric chair to be executed. The guards strap him in, he gives his final words, and the lever is pulled. Miraculously, the train conductor survives. Due to the beliefs of the people in the country, the man is allowed to live because they believe that anyone who could survive death like this has been blessed by God. He was allowed to return to his normal life of being a train conductor.

The very next day, the man wakes up. He performs his morning routine, drives to work, and boards his train. Again, the train fills up with passengers, and the train begins its journey. Unfortunately, the train conductor once again takes a corner too quickly, and again the train is derailed. The passengers once again are killed in a horrible accident. The train conductor was taken to his trial, and was found guilty of murder. He was sent to death row once more.

Again, the train conductor is asked what his final meal will be. This time, he asks for a special fish that can only be found at the very bottom of the Mariana Trench. The warden is informed and again is annoyed, but just like last time, he understands that it is his right to have a final meal of his request. A few days later, the fish is brought to the train conductor. He eats it slowly, and is then taken to the electric chair. They strap him in, he gives his last words, and the lever is pulled. Once again, the train conductor survives. The warden and guards simply could not believe it. However, he was again allowed to be free, due to the spiritual beliefs of the people. People truly thought he was blessed by God, and that he was a special human being indeed.

The day after, the man once again goes through his usual routine. He boards his train, and tells himself he will not screw up this time. The passengers boarded the train and the journey began. The ride went well until the very end, where the train conductor once again derailed the train due to taking a corner at high speed. Again, many people die, and he is taken to trial. They again find him guilty, and he is sent to death row.

The warden walked to the train conductor's cell and told him that despite the law, he would not be receiving a final meal, as he believed the food that the conductor was being brought was responsible for his survival. Although the train conductor was disappointed, he understood. He was taken to the electric chair. He was strapped in, allowed his final words, and the lever was pulled. The train conductor screamed in agony. The warden and guards believed that the deed had finally been done. However, they were shocked to find that the train conductor was still alive.

The warden was in pure disbelief. ""How do you do it?"" the warden asks. ""I thought the food was making you impervious to death itself!"" The train conductor looked up at the shocked warden and said, ""Oh no, it isn't the food...

... I'm just a bad conductor.""",The Magical Train Conductor,3

But due to the distance, Jacob couldn't hear. So Alex got an idea, he'd just act out what he wanted.


So he looks at Jacob and points to him, then he points back to himself, then he acts out hitting a nail with a hammer.


Jacob, understanding what Alex need gave him a thumbs up, then he unbuckled his trousers and started jerking off.


Outraged and sick of Jacobs shit, Alex climbs down to the ground floor and starts yelling at him.

There wasn't much crop and the cows could only give so much milk. He decided to try something new. He decided to grow Marijuana. Now, given lack of competition, he knew it would be highly profitable. To test how cows would react to the plants, he placed a plant in the barn overnight and was elated to see that they had not touched it. Perhaps the pungent smell or the foreigness of the plant. Nonetheless, he bought $50000 worth plants illegally and to hide them planted them in the  barn. To afford this he had placed the house as the collateral. A few days went by and he had succeeded in forming a small network of people who would help him out. Eventually he started making profit. One morning however, the moment he opened the barn, all the plants were gone and cows were completely obtunded. The neighbors caught a whiff of this and reported him. He was promptly arrested and had lost everything from the inheritance. But he was okay with this as he very well knew that the steaks were high.

So  Congress decides that this will be settled with an ACTUAL Presidential race. As in, the three candidates have to run a mile and the one with the lowest time wins. 

So, Bernie Sanders runs. Gets a whopping 10:48, almost 11 minutes. A no-go for him. Coming in last, he slumps off in defeat. Next is Trump. He gets 10:20, barely beating Bernie. He’s confidant that “Crooked Hilary” won’t be able to beat him. Keep in mind that all of the candidates are pretty old. Their organs are falling out by the time they’re all done running. Their organs are falling out from standing up straight, probably. Hilary finishes, and she collapses on the ground from exhaustion. Her time was 9:37. She won, finishing in 9 minutes and 37 seconds. Some senators approach her, and she’s ready to give her speech of thanks. She says, 

“Wow, I did 9:37. That’s gotta he some kind of record, right?” 

Someone replies , 

“No, actually. Bush did 9:11.”","In an alternate universe, the 2016 Presidential Election didn’t go as planned...",338

So I went outside and walked down the street, wondering what I should use it for. Before long, I came across a man on the sidewalk who was carrying a beautiful duck. I asked him if he'd give me the duck for the dollar I had, and he did. So I took the duck and started heading back home. But on my way, I saw this beautiful woman. I asked her if she would have sex with me if I gave her the duck, and she said sure, that it was a lovely duck. So we had sex, and I gave her the duck. But she immediately told me that she had such a great time that she would give the duck back if we could do it again. So naturally, I accepted the offer. But while we were having sex, the duck wondered off into the street and was run over by a car. After we were done, I looked at what was left of the duck, and it was basically just a flat pancake on the ground. The woman apologized, and gave me twenty-five dollars to buy a new duck. So I thanked her and headed home. I showed my father the twenty-five dollars I had gotten, and he congratulated me and asked how I got it. So I told him, ""A duck for a buck, a fuck for a duck, and 25 bucks for a fucked up duck.""",Getting $25 for free (hint: use a duck),30

He lives there quietly content for over a month before meeting anyone.

One day the American hears a knock on his door and opens it to find his neighbor a big, burly, red-headed bear of a Scotsman with hairy legs covered by a traditional kilt. The American invites him in and makes a pot of tea for the two of them.

“I came here to invite you to a party at my place tonight.” The Scotsman says.

“That sounds great,” the American replies, “I haven’t gotten to know anyone yet so I’d love to see what you do for fun around here.”

“But I’ve got to warn you,” the Scotsman tells him, “There’s going to be drinkin’!”

“That’s alright,” the American replies, “I bought a few bottles of whiskey at the duty free shop when I first arrived and this seems like a great occasion to open them up.”

“But I’ve also got to warn you,” the Scotsman continues, “There’s going to be fightin’! Any time there’s drinking at my house there’s always bound to be a fight.” 

“That’s alright,” the American replies, “I was bullied a lot in high school and learned martial arts to defend myself so if there’s fighting I can handle it.” 

“But I’ve also got to warn you,” the Scotsman continues, “There’s going to be dancin’! Always have a good dance or two or three at my house!” 

“That’s alright,” the American replies, “You see, the reason I was bullied in high school was because I was a competitive waltz champion. I can dance with the best of them no problem.”

“But I’ve also got to warn you,” the Scotsman continues, “There’s going to be fuckin’! Hot, sweaty, hairy, steamy sex in every corner of me cottage!”

The American blushes, his hands shake as he sets his tea on the end table. “I’m not sure that’ll be good for me. You see, I get really nervous around girls. I’ve never dated much, or had success with flirting, I’d probably embarrass myself in front of every woman there. Maybe I shouldn’t come.”

“Girls?!” The Scotsman laughs as he slaps the American on the shoulder, “Don’t be daft and worry about that laddie! It’s just goin’ to be the two of us there!” ",An American Man Moves to Scotland,30
