It's been nearly three weeks since he's eaten anything besides what he could forage and he's been reduced to sleeping in caves and under trees.

One afternoon he comes upon an old mansion in the woods.  It has vines covering most of it and the man can't see any other buildings in the area. However, he sees smoke coming out of the chimney implying someone is home.


He knocks on the door and an old man answers, with a beard almost down to the ground. The old man squints his eyes and says ""What do you want?""


The man says ""I've been lost for the past three weeks and haven't had a decent meal or sleep since that time. I would be most gracious if I could have a meal and sleep in your house for tonight."" 


The old Chinese man says ""I'll let you come in on one condition: You cannot mess around with my daughter."" 


The man, exhausted and hungry readily agrees, saying ""I promise I won't cause you any trouble. I'll be on my way tomorrow morning.""


The old Chinese man counters ""Ok, but if I do catch you then I'll give you the three worst Chinese torture tests ever known to man.""


""Ok, Ok"" the man said as he entered the old house. Besides, he thought to himself, what kind of woman would live out in the wilderness all her life? 


Well, that night, when the man came down to eat (after showering), he saw how beautiful the daughter was. She was an absolute pearl, and while he had only been lost three weeks, it had been many, many months without companionship. And the girl had only seen the occasional monk besides her father and well, they both couldn't keep their eyes off each other throughout the meal.


That night, the man snuck into the girls' bedroom and they had quite a time, but had kept the noise down to a minimum. The man crept back to his room later that night thinking to himself, ""Any three torture tests would be worth it after that experience."" 


Well, the next morning the man awoke to a heavy weight on his chest. He opened his eyes and there was this huge rock on his chest. On the rock was a sign saying ""First Chinese torture test: 100 lb rock on your chest"".


""What a lame torture test. Is this the best the old man can do?"" the man thought to himself as he got up and walked over to the window. He opened the shutter and threw the rock out. On the backside of the rock is another sign saying ""Second worst Chinese torture test: Rock tied to right testicle"".


The man, seeing the rock was too far out the window to be grabbed, jumps out the window after the rock, figuring broken bones was better than castration. Outside the window is a third sign saying ""Third worst Chinese torture test: Left testicle tied to bedpost"".",Three Worst Chinese Tortures,8

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man who drove trains for a living.,521

""Naah, don't worry about it, this is the strongest ship ever built, we'll just plow right through it."" The captain says, taking a puff from his joint. The cadet calms down and leaves to go back to his post.

As the ship approaches the iceberg, the skipper starts to realise how colossal this ice block actually is. In a new wave of fear, he runs back to the bridge and burst into the door once more, releasing a huge cloud straight into he's face. At this point, the cadet is starting to feel a little stoned, but still manages to exclaim:

""Captain! We are about to hit a big iceberg! We need to change immediately!""

""Naaah man, don't worry about it, there aren't any big icebergs in these waters!"" The captain answers, sending the cadet out once more.

Feeling a little bit too buzzed, the captain places his joint on the table, in order to take a break from the smoking.

Meanwhile the cadet outside on his post sees the skip is about to hit the iceberg, so once more he walks to the bridge to warn the captain.

He bursts into the room, once more a huge cloud of smoke hits him right in his face. The cadet raises his hand and points at the joint:

The blazing heat continued as the two walked. Eventually, the heat re-wired his brain cells and he had a sudden sexual arousal. Horny as he was, he looked around to finish his deed. No human to be seen, his eyes locked onto the camel. 

The man then pulled down his pants to insert his rock solid dong into the camel. When he went to insert it, the camel took a step forward. The man went for it again, but the camel took another step forward.

Figuring this isn’t gonna work, the man pulled his pants back up, and the two continued their walk.

A few hours passed, when the two met a lady lying on the sand. The lady was beautiful and had every feature a man would ask for. The man and camel went up to her to see if she was alright.

“Are you ok ma’am?” said the man.

The lady looked up to the man and said “sir, I have been left by my group of people, and I have finished my final drops of water.” Her eyes landed on the man’s water. “Will you please, kind sir, give me some of that water of yours? I will do anything you ask for...”

“Anything?” The man replied with a grin.

“...anything...” the lady said, knowing what was to happen.

-""She HAS to take her pants off when she goes to pee, that'll be my chance!"" 

-""But I can't just walk into the bathroom like that... I know, I'll go to the park with her!"" 

So that's what he does. He organizes a trip, brings some food and lots of water, and strolls off deep into the park with her. 

A few hours passed, it's getting darker, and after eating and drinking all that time his girlfriend excuses herself to go do some ""business"". 

""Now or never""- He thinks. 

He crouches down, and then quietly crawls though the bushes. Then he sees the silhouette of his girlfriend, squatting, with a huge thing hanging down inbetween her legs. 

""GOT YOU!!!"" - He yells, grabbing it from behind her.

Whereas the party of the first part, also known as “Lawyer,” and the party of the second part, also known as “Light Bulb,” do hereby and forthwith agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed-upon duties, i.e., the illumination of the area ranging from the front (north) door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just inside the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the parties.

The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the following steps:

1.) The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or without elevation, at his option, by means of a chair, step-stool, ladder, or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a counterclockwise direction, said direction being non- negotiable. Said grasping and rotation of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be undertaken by the party of the first part (Lawyer) with every reasonable caution by the party of the first part (Lawyer) to maintain the structural integrity of the party of the second part (Light Bulb), notwithstanding the aforementioned failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) to perform the aforementioned customary and agreed-upon duties. The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform, and in such case the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as this agreement is concerned so long as the non-negotiable directional codicil (counterclockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (Lawyer) throughout.

2.) Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (Light Bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part (“Receptacle”), the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local, and federal statutes.

3.) Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of beginning installation of the party of the fourth part (“New Light Bulb”). This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in Step 1 of this document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable.

NOTE: The above-described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (Lawyer), by said party of the first part (Lawyer), by his heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him to do so, the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (north) door consistent with maximization of commerce and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as “The Firm.”",How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?,139

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.  

 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.  
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.  
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.  


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,16

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.
 
But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.

Drink: Beer
Personality: Casual, low-maintenance; down to earth.
Your Approach: Challenge her to a game of pool.

Drink: Blended Drinks
Personality: Flaky, whiny, annoying; a pain in the buttocks.
Your Approach: Avoid her, unless you want to be her cabin boy.

Drink: Mixed Drinks
Personality: Older, more refined, high maintenance, has very picky taste; knows exactly what she wants.
Your Approach: You won't have to approach her, if she is interested, she'll send YOU a drink.

Drink: Wine - (does not include White Zinfandel, see below)
Personality: Conservative and classy; sophisticated yet giggles.
Your Approach: Tell her you love to travel and spend quiet evenings with friends.

Drink: White Zinfandel
Personality: Easy; thinks she is classy and sophisticated, actually has no clue.
Your approach: Make her feel smarter than she is.... this should be an easy target.

Drink: Shots
Personality: Likes to hang with frat-boy pals and looking to get totally drunk...... and naked.
Your Approach: Easiest hit in the joint. You have been blessed this evening. Nothing to do but wait. However, be careful not to make her mad!

Then there is the MALE addendum. The deal with guys is, as always, very simple and clear cut:

Domestic Beer: He's poor and wants to get laid.

Imported Beer: He likes good beer and wants to get laid.

Wine: He's hoping that the wine thing will give him a sophisticated image to help him get laid.

Whiskey: He doesn't give a hoot about anything but getting laid.

Tequila: He is thinking he has a chance with the toothless waitress.

White Zinfandel: He's gay.",Seven New York City bartenders were asked if they could nail a woman's personality based on what she drinks.,25

So he asks, ""What is 5 plus 5?""

After nearly 30 seconds she eventually says, ""Ninety?""

The leader is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh -- everyone is disheartened - the blonde starts crying and the 50,000 girls begin to yell and wave their hands shouting, ""GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE! GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE!""

The leader, unsure whether or not he is doing more harm than good, eventually says, ""Ok! Ok! Just one more chance -- What is 2 plus 2?""

The girl closes her eyes, and after a whole minute eventually says, ""Four?""

He tends to be away for a couple of weeks at a time, so he was always worried about his wife cheating on him. The man headed over to his local sex shop to see what he can find.


The shop was small, a little old, much like the man who ran the shop. The old man asked him what he was looking for, and the businessman explained his predicament. ""Hmm,"" said the old man, ""we have dildos, vibrators, attatchments, everything you could think of. But I don't think we have anything that could keep her entertained that long... except... no, no, nevermind..."" The businessman begs him to show him what he meant, and the old man pulls out an ornately carved wooden box. But when he opens it, it just looks like any other dildo. Which the businessman says to him. The old man smiles and says, ""ah, but watch this! Voodoo dick, the door."" Suddenly, the dildo rose from its box, hovered over to the door, and began to screw the keyhole. It wasn't until the wood started to crack that the old man said, ""Voodoo dick, back to your box!"" The businessman, excited, asked him how much it would cost; at first, he didn't want to sell, but several hundred dollars ended up changing his tune.


When it came time for the businessman to leave for another trip, he gave his wife the dildo, telling her that if she ever felt lonely while he was gone, simply say ""voodoo dick, my pussy."" Now, after a few days, feeling horny and a little foolish, she wife opens the box and says, ""voodoo dick, my pussy."" The dildo rises from his box and sets straight to work. After a few of the best orgasms of her life, she decides she's done and goes to pull the dilso out of her. It doesn't budge no matter how hard she tries. He forgot to tell her how to turn it off. Panicked, the wife throws on a skirt and drives off to the hospital, but has another orgasm on the way, nearly swerving off the road. To her horror, she sees police light in her rear view, and pulls over.


Seeing the woman's disheveled state, the officer says, ""how much have you had to drink, ma'am?"" She says, ""You don't understand, officer, haven't drank anything! There's a voodoo dick stuck inside me and it won't stop screwing!!""

""Blimey... A lobster lawyer? That is impressive,"" says the bartender.

The Lobster puts his briefcase up on the bar, deftly opens it with his claws, and produces a document that looks to be at least 100 pages. He slides it to the bartender.

""This is a legal contract that covers all the questions usually asked of me whenever I walk into a bar. I've just finished a pretty rough case and would like to get to drinking as soon as possible, so if we could skip over the usual jokes and just get through this without delay I'd be much obliged.""

The bartender looks at the lobster carefully, but soon nods in agreement.

""Fair enough, mate,"" he says. ""Let's work through this.""

The bartender flips over the cover page and starts reading aloud.

""'Point 1: I am a lobster of legal drinking age and you'll find in Annex A a copy of my legally acceptable identification.' Well, okay, no problems there.

""'Point 2: You can serve me more than water and are absolved of any misfortune that befalls me while drinking at your establishment.' What's your favourite drink?""

""Vermouth, usually,"" says The Lobster, ""but I'm hoping for a few stiff glasses of whiskey tonight.""

""Okay,"" the bartender continues reading, ""'Point 3: We've established I am a lawyer, and therefore reasonably wealthy. This should assuage any fears you might have about my capability to settle my tab, but I am happy to pay up front if you have any concerns.'""

The Lobster slaps a crisp $50 bill onto the bar.

""Well alright then,"" says the bartender.

""There's just one more point to read and agree to,"" says The Lobster.

The bartender raises an eyebrow, seeing that he's still on page one and there are a considerable amount of pages left to read, and quickly flips through a number of the pages to confirm that there is, in fact, writing on every page.

""Look,"" he says, ""before I read the rest, I have to ask: why the large clause?""

The Lobster gives a little sigh.

""Dunno,"" he says. ""I'm a lobster. I guess I've always had them.""",A Lobster Walks Into a Bar,24

“Don’t worry, child,” says the priest, “It’s perfectly normal to have such desires and share them with your partner. Nothing serious, just say two prayers and you will be cleansed of your sins.”

“But Father,” continues the man, “It doesn’t end there. On Tuesday, I was at my girlfriend’s house again, but she had gone out with her mates, and the only one there was her sister, and, well… the two of us alone, the house empty… I sinned again, Father.”

“Oh, child,” says the Father, “You must be strong and fight those urges! Eight prayers shall cleanse you of your sins.”

“But Father,” says the bloke again, “On Wednesday, I was at my girlfriend’s house again, and she wasn’t there then either, and the only one at home was her mum, and, well… the two of us alone, the house empty… Again I sinned, Father.”

“Good Lord,” says the priest, “Child, you must think about what you do, so pray-”

“But Father,” says the bloke, “On Thursday, I was at my girlfriend’s house again, and the whole family had gone to the shop, and the only one there was her aunt, and, well… the two of us alone, the house empty… I sinned yet again, Father.”

The priest falls silent.

“And then,” continues the bloke, “On Friday, I was at her house again, and they had gone out for the weekend and the only one there was her granny, and , well… the two of us alone, the house empty…”

The priest still did not answer.

“And on Saturday,” said the bloke, “I went to her house again, and there was nobody there except for her father, and, well…”

The man awaits a reply, but upon hearing none, he exits the booth – only to find the priest up on the belfry.

So my wife called him a ""Shit head.""

Nigel nodded and had another sip of his beer.  

The American man continued ""i hear you guys are pretty good hunters"" to which Nigel replied ""Sure am, mate.""

The American then asked ""You ever been hunting bears?"" 
""Yeah mate, but doze kwalas too easy to catch."" 
""Nah, not Koala bears, I'm talking big grizzlies!"" 
""Oh we ain't got none of them back in Straya.""
 
The American man then invited Nigel to come to his hunting cabin the next day to go hunting with him and his friends. 

The next day the Americans show up at the cabin with all the bells and whistles, all carrying assault rifles and practically wearing SWAT gear, as they're prepping their gear they see young Nigel walking towards them, wearing nothing but a singlet, a pair of stubbies (short shorts), one thong (flip flop) and carrying nothing but a boomerang. The whole place erupted with laughter.

""Hey, you lost a shoe!""
'Nah, mate. I found one.'
""Where is your gun? You're not gonna catch anything with that stick!""
'It's not a stick, it's a boomerang!""
""Either way you ain't catching any grizzlies today with that.""

Nigel got  quite cranky at this and shouted ""I'll show you!"" And sprinted off full speed into the trees. 

The Americans decided rather than trying to follow him blindly they would go into the cabin and have a few drinks and wait for him to cool down and come back. A few hours go past and they decide he is either lost or dead so decide to go look for him. As they get up and start to get ready they hear a voice outside.

""OPEN DA FUCKING DOOR, OPEN DA FUCKING DOOR!""

They look out the window and Nigel is running towards the cabin, behind him is a big grizzly bear chasing him with a big bump on his head.  They run to the door and open it, Nigel jumps to the side at the last minute and the bear runs into the cabin. Nigel closes the door behind the bear and shouts through the closed door 

""Alright, you skin dis one, I'll go get anudda one.""

post,cuydpm,2qh72,jokes,false,1566677238,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cuydpm/the_meaning_of_life/,self.jokes,,"A young man goes to search for the meaning of life. He decides to ask around.


The first person he meets is a wealthy man. ""That's easy,"" he says. ""The meaning of life is to accumulate wealth. Then you can transform and inspire your community."" The young man takes this advice to heart. He studies hard, gets into a prestigious school and becomes a stock broker. He has an inherent gift for the work and wealth comes easily. Before long, he is living in the lap of luxury. Of course he remembers to do good work in his community as well, but try as he might, there is only so much he can change. He still feels like something is missing. Now a middle aged man, he decides to ask someone else about the meaning of life.


The next person he asks is a hedonist. ""That's easy,"" he says. ""Life is rich in all kinds of personal pleasures. Sample each one, indulge all your senses!"" The middle aged man takes this advice to heart. Using his vast fortune, he is able to travel the world. He eats the rarest delicacies, makes love to the most beautiful women. He tries all manner of exotic substances in order to expand his mind. But soon enough, his fortune is gone, and despite the many unique experiences he has had, he still finds something missing. 


Now an old man, he decides to ask one more time. The next person he meets is a preacher, who says, ""that's easy. Dedicate the remainder of your life to communion with God."" So the old man joins a church and repents his sins. His days are spent in prayer and meditation. However, he is bothered by the many differences in the religions of the world. The way they all claim to be right strikes him as arrogant and overbearing, and sure enough, he still feels like something is missing inside him.

One day he takes a long walk on the beach and spots a monk going through some sort of martial arts exercise. His kicks and punches flow like water and the expression of peace on his face is sublime. So once again, he gathers his courage and asks; ""Excuse me, sir, do you know the meaning of life?""


""That's easy,"" says the monk. ""You must first master and then let go of the self. On the highest mountain in Tibet there is a monastery. There you will find the wisest men on Earth, who have spent many decades devoted to this path. Go learn from them.""


As always, the old man takes this advice to heart. He sells what's left of his things, buys some mountain climbing supplies, and ascends the mountain. He is exhausted but there is indeed a beautiful temple before him! When he walks through the door, there are masters in flowing robes sitting on the floor, each with a line of disciples before them. Each master is teaching a complex martial art technique meant not only to help combat a strong opponent, but to strengthen one's own body and mind.


The old man gets in the first line, but they are teaching a throw which would be too hard on his back.


The old man gets in the second line, but they are teaching a spinning kick. He lacks the dexterity for this.


The old man gets in the third line, but they are teaching a precise counterattack, and his reflexes have dulled with age.


Soon enough he realizes that he must start with the most basic training these sages can offer, so he tracks down a disciple that doesn't look particularly busy and says; ""excuse me, sir? I came here looking for the meaning of life but I am terribly lost. I need an easy technique to get me started. Could you please help me find the punch line?""",The Meaning Of Life,49

""Welcome to Anti-Earth,"" The driver said, ""don't worry we are going to change the name soon.I am here to take you to your quarters and show you the colony on the way.""

They had been driving for a couple of minutes when the recruit saw glowing buildings far away. 

""Why are the buildings shining like that?"", he asked.

""Didn't they brief you about the colony?"", the driver asked ""We don't call it Anti-Earth just because, it's literally the opposite of Earth. Any element rare on Earth is as common as carbon(C) here, and interestingly carbon(C) doesn't occur naturally here. So we had to make good of what we had, the buildings are made of rare metals like radium(Ra) which glow in the dark.""

After half an hour they arrived at what seemed the main highway, the road had a faint bluish glow and the sides were lined with metallic posts shining faintly in the double moonlight. They stopped near a small dilapidated shack with the words ""COMMUNICATION OFFICE"" crudely etched on the walls. 

""This is your office. You are supposed to handle communications for the colony,"" the driver said. ""We can't use any wireless communication as the high amount of radioactive gases in the atmosphere interferes with the signal, so we have to use a type of telegraph instead. Come on, I'll show you our most important resource.""

They walked a bit till they reached a plantation full of bizarre trees. Some were made of precious metals, some of common earth metals and some of them were glowing radioactively.

""This is the plantation for building the posts. We brought these seeds from Earth and planted them, apparently as they couldn't get the conventional elements they just used what the soil contained. We just sell the gold(Au), silver(Ag) and platinum(Pt) trees to Earth, the iron(Fe) and aluminium(Al) are used for constructing equipment and there are some pretty rare elements like uranium(U) and astatine(At) (which is the rarest element on Earth) which are used for scientific research. However, these aren't what we are here for."" 

The driver motioned him to follow him towards a small area of trees with a silvery sheen to them.

""These are made of rhenium(Re) one of the densest elements with one of the highest melting and boiling points. It is strong enough to withstand the toxic atmosphere and radioactivity of this planet. So we use it to make the telegraph posts. As you may have noticed we have lined almost the whole road with telegraph lines.""

""You don't mean..."", the recruit began.

""Yes,"" the driver cut him off,""this place is full of (Re)posts.""",A man was recruited for a space colony,29

So the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a miniature piano and sets it on the bar, then he reaches into his other pocket and pulls out a frog and sets the frog at the piano.

Low and behold the frog cracks his little fingers and starts to play!

The barkeep is just blown away by this and agrees that the man can drink for free for the rest of the night. Meanwhile, there is a wealthy businessman watching this unfold from a corner, so he gets up and approaches the man sensing a business opportunity. He says ""Excuse me, but I saw your frog and I was wondering if he was for sale?""

The man replies ""Sorry the frog is not for sale"" and continues sipping his drink.

The businessman offers $10,000 for the frog, which the man again politely declines, followed by offers for $20,000 and $30,000. Until the businessman finally gives up and goes back to his seat.

The man finishes his drink and asks the barkeep ""Hey, if I can show you something else even more amazing, would you let me drink here for free any day?"" The barkeep thinking he has seen everything now readily agrees, what could be more amazing than a playing frog?

The man reaches into another pocket and brings out a mouse and puts him on top of the piano. A few seconds later the mouse starts to sing along with the frog's playing! The barkeep is absolutely floored by this and again agrees to honor his deal.

The businessman also sees this and again approaches the man, he offers $100,000 for the frog and the mouse, which the man again declines. The businessman in a final effort says ""OK, what about $100,000 just for the mouse?""

The man takes a sip of his drink and says ""Just for the mouse? Yeah OK"" so the businessman cuts him a check right there, and takes the mouse and leaves.

The barkeep says to the man ""Are you crazy!?"" A mouse like that has got to be worth 10x that much! What were you thinking?""

The man calmly sips his drink and replies with a wry smile ""The jokes on him, the frog is a ventriloquist.""","A Man walks into a bar and asks the barkeep, ""If I can show you something you have never seen before, can I drink free tonight?""",80

When their son finally was born, they named him Cythera, after the Greek island with the same name, where the couple had gone for their honeymoon. 

Their son grew up to be a nice and well-mannered young man, and was just about to start seeking for a job when he got a letter from a distant relative, who lived in Mexico. The letter read as follows:

*Dear Cythera.*

*I am your great great-grandfathers granddaughter, and I need you to move to Mexico*

*You see, I run a family business that have been passed on for several generations. Just recently, my grandson died fighting a wild bull, and I have no close relatives to pass the business on. You were the closest one I was able to track down, and I must therefore ask you to move here and inherit the business.* 

*My time on this earth is soon over, so I need you to come as soon as possible.*

*Sincerely, María*

Cythera was baffled over getting this possibility, but he didn't plan on letting it slip by, and already the next day was he on a flight to Mexico. At his arrival he was greeted by some friends of the family. They had somehow misheard Cythera for Cito, and him being rather socially awkward, decided not to correct them. It didn't take long before everyone called him Cito, so Cythera decided it would be easier just to change his name to it. 

The family business turned out to be a spa. It was tradition to rename the spa after the owner, and the spa was currently called Spa María or just María as the locals called it. María was still in charge, but it was clear that she didn't have much time left. When she ultimately died, it was Cito who was the new owner. He felt very unprepared, but after a week, he was finally ready to open it to the public. A little crowd had gathered to witness the grand reopening. The spa came under new leadership that day. It was no longer the Spa María people were familiar with, no, now it was the Spa Cito.",First post on here,3

The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat. The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog.

The war weary soldier asked, ""Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?"" The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my Little Fifi is using that seat?"" The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.

Again he asked, ""Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired."" The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant.""

The soldier didn""t say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.

The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, ""You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your automobiles on the wrong side of the road.

About halfway through the height, the man spots a purple flower out of the corner of his eye. He goes over to it and picks it up. He turns to his friend and says, 
“Hey, look!  A purple flower!”

His friends face starts to turn white.
“Dude, what’s wrong?”

His friend starts screaming and running down the hill. He starts to scream,
“DON’T EVER TALK TO ME AGAIN!”

The man is very confused. He decides that he might as well not run after him, so he starts to walk down the hill.

Once he got to the bottom of the hill, he went to the small shop for hunting gear near the forest. The shopkeeper is an old friend of the mans father. He walks into the store and the shopkeeper says,
“Boy, you look off. What’s wrong?”

He replied, “I’m not sure what just happened. I was on a hike and my friend just ran off!”

The shopkeeper asked “What made him do that?”

The man started, “Well, I picked up this purple flower-“

The shopkeeper cut him off. “A purple flower!? Do you have it with you?”

The man said “Yes.” and pulled out the flower. 
The shopkeeper started screaming. “GET OUT OF MY STORE!” he yelled. He pulled one of the rifles from the wall and started to load it. The man immediately ran out of the store and down the dirt road.

He made it to the suburbs of his town. He thought, “Wow, today has been crazy. I can’t wait to tell my girlfriend this.”

He called a cab and started down the road. The driver made conversation.
“Hey, how ya doin?”

“Oh, not great.”

“Huh? Why’s that?”

“It’s a very weird story. I was hiking with my friend when I found a purple flower. He ran away from me, then-“

The cab driver cut him off. “A purple flower?”

The man pulled out the flower and said, “Yes, this flower right here.”

The driver slammed on the breaks and screamed, “GET THE HELL OUT OF MY CAR!”
He was pushed out of the car. 

He started the walk to his girlfriends house. Once he finally got there, he opened the door to his girlfriend preparing dinner. He decided it would be best not to mention the flower until after he had dinner.

They sat down and begin to ate. His girlfriend asked, “Did anything interesting happen today?”

To which the man couldn’t help but reply, “I was hiking with my friend today when I found this purple flower,  and then he started-“

Unsurprisingly, his girlfriend cut him off. “Purple flower!?”

“Yes,” the man said. He was bracing for the screaming, and then it hit.

“GET OUT! GET OUT NOW! WE NEVER DATED! WE NEVER EVEN MET!”

He walked out the door as it was slammed behind him. 

Confused, he went to his parents house for guidance. He knocked on the door and they opened it, happy to see their son. They watched TV and talked for a bit before the flower cake up.
“Mom? Dad?” he said.

“What is it?” his mother replied.

“Today, I found a purple flower on a hike, and everyone’s been screaming about it the whole day!”

“That’s horrible,” his father said. “Do you have it with you? I want to see it.”

Relieved, the man pulled out the flower. His mother took the pillow next to her and put it over her face. His dads face turned beet red. He 
screamed,
 “GET OUT OF OUR HOUSE! YOU’RE NOT MY SON! I NEVER HAD YOU!”

He ran out of the house, sobbing. It was now getting dark and he was soaked from the rain. He sat down at a bus station next to an old woman. The old woman looked at him and said, 

“You look distressed. What’s wrong?”

He explained. 
“Well, today I was on a hike with my best friend when, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a purple flower. I picked it up and he started running and screaming. I was confused and then went to the hunting shop near the mountain. I walked in and showed him the flower and he sent me out of the store! Then I got a taxi to go to my girlfriends house, but when I told him about the purple flower, he threw me out. Then, once I got to my girlfriends house, I told her, and then she said that she hated me and never even knew me! Then, I went to my parents and asked them about it, and they threw me out too! I don’t know what’s going on.”

The woman nodded. “You know, there’s a library across the street. You could probably find something about it there.”

The man lit up. “Thank you so much!” he said. He started running across the street and then he got hit by a bus and died.

Moral of the story: Look both ways before crossing the road.",A man was on a hike with his best friend.,44

As the man sat reading his paper, he glanced over to see a young couple playing billiards on the nearby table, one was a young woman in her 20's while the other was a slightly older man. The gent returned his gaze to his paper, glancing up every so often at the couple.

One time as he turned the page and glanced up, he saw, to his shock the young woman was bent over the table revealing that she was wearing no underwear and on each cheek was tattooed a number 6.

The man was very superstitious and took this as a sign, he immediately got up and rushed to the man selling raffle tickets, asking ""has number 66 been bought?"", the man replied no and the older gent quickly purchased the ticket and left for the night.

""I bet you $10 I can spit into a shot glass with me in my stool and the glass behind you."" Bartender takes the bet. The man takes a deep breath, and launches a spit dead center into the shot glass. Amazed the bartender congratulates the man, says he's never seen anything like that and hands him $10.

Next day same man walks in and tells the bartender he bets him $50 that he can spit into a shot glass with him on one end of the bar and the glass all the way at the other end. It was a pretty long bar so the bartender took the deal. The man takes an even bigger breath, aims and launches a spit that flies over the entire bar and lands dead center into the shot glass. Amazed and a little angry, the bartender reluctantly hands him the $50.

The next day the bartender eagerly awaits the man to come in so he can bet again and try to get his money back. The man walks in greets some of the other patrons,  taking his time before sitting at the bar. The bartender rushes over to him and asks ""what's the bet going to be today"" . The man says he doesn't want to keep taking his money but the bartender insists on another bet. Finally the man says to place a large glass by the store window and that from the bar he can pee into it for $50. The bartender figures there is no way that's humanly possible and tells the man he takes the bet but 8ncreases the bet to $100. The man agrees. He gets next to the bar unzips and begins peeing. He's peeing to the left, the right, he's spraying everywhich way he can to try and reach the glass. When it's all said and done the bartender and man look in the cup and there's not a drop of pee in it. The bartender jumps up and down with joy that he won. The man simple takes out a $100 and hands him the money without batting an eyelash and just simply goes back to drinking his drink and talking with other patrons. 

The bartender finds this very strange and says:
""Aren't you upset that you lost??""

""oh the $100? No not upset. I didn't lose""

""what do you mean you didn't lose? You completely missed the glass!""

He saw a little girl come over so he covered his crotch with the paper he was reading. The girl walked up to him and asked, ""What do you have under the newspaper?"".   
He responded, ""It's a little bird but it's sleeping, so can you please go away?"" ""Okay!"" and she left. 

Later he decided to get some rest, so he took a nap. When he woke up, he found himself at the ER with a few frantic faces working on him. When they saw him wake up they rushed and asked him what had happened. He said he didn't know, but mentioned the little girl to them, and he described her. So they went to look for her at the beach. 

At the beach they found the girl playing in the sand, so they walked up to her and asked her what happened to the man. She said, ""Oh nothing. When the man fell asleep I went to him because I wanted to play with the bird. After a while it spat on me and I got mad. So I cracked its eggs, burnt its nest and broke its neck.""
