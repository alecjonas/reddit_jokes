The driver, a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulls over and gets out to see

The driver feels so awful that he begins to cry. A beautiful blonde woman driving down the road sees a man crying on the side of the road and pulls over.
She steps out of the car and asks the man what's wrong.
""I feel terrible,"" he explains, ""I accidentally hit the Easter Bunny with my car and KILLED HIM.""
The blonde says,""Don't worry.""
She runs to her car and pulls out a spray can. She walks over to the limp, dead Easter Bunny, bends down, and sprays the contents on him.
The Easter Bunny jumps up, waves a paw at the them and hops off down the road.
Ten feet away he stops, turns around and waves again, he hops down the road another 10 feet, turns and waves, hops another ten feet, turns and waves, and repeats this again and again and again and again, until he hops out of sight.
The man is astonished. He runs over to the woman and demands, ""What is in that can? What did you spray on the Easter Bunny?""
The woman turns the can around so that the man can read the label.
It says..
(Are you ready for this?)

She had the restaurant’s logo, the label from a bottle of vodka, drawn on everything. Chairs, tables, light fixtures, bathroom sinks, etc. They were everywhere! Worse yet, it was done with a #2 pencil. The weird owner would also keep all the larger serving spoons on the top shelf. It was high enough that some of us couldn’t reach them. One day, Lily purchased two step stools specifically for reaching the ladles. As per the restaurant theme, they had to have hundreds of the small labels penciled all over them. The artist she hired was an elderly lady. She was very well educated, but tired out easily. The elderly lady had finished the first one and needed to take a short break. The owner came storming into the kitchen, very drunk and demanding why the first one was done, but not second. She tried to answer, but Lily was too wasted to listen. This really irked me, so I spoke up and said...  

“You're literally lit, Lily. Let the literate letter lady litter little lead liter labels on the latter little ladle ladder later.”

""What is that?""

""Then this means you like living things""

""Yeah""

""Then this means you like women, because they are living things.""

It was at the moment that Fred said he wished so too, that he’d be able to get up one morning and be able to walk that a shooting star passed by the widow.

Having heard his son’s scream, the father follows in quick pursuit of him.

All he does every day is drink and drink. Rum, tequila, beer, vodka, he has it all. Doesn't matter how it tastes or looks; he'll down it.

At first it started out at a simple party at Dominc's place. His best bud, Bob, invited him so he couldn't say no. Plus there were cute girls there and he had to impress, so he had a little booze. He didn't even remember the night, but that's where he met his future wife Rebecca.

Even though originally it was a social thing Ted dug himself a pretty big hole. Now all he does is binge drink at the bar, binge drink at home while the game's on, and even binge drink while driving.

As his life spirals out of control he begins to become irritable. Grumpiness and rudeness become a norm. Little quips here and there. Calling people chubby, cutting in line, nothing harmless.

Then the anger set in. He can't control himself. He just builds up all that pent up rage. Eventually it comes to a point where he fights with his wife every day. Shouting matches are commonplace about trivial and mundane stupid things. Rebecca even has to yell unceremoniously that he's gonna be a father. 

He often is wasted, not remembering the week before. He even misses his own child's birth because he was blacked out. After a particularly heated argument he storms off to his favorite pub, The Lion's Arm. The evening goes as usual until some drunkard put a hand him to steady himself. Ted mistakes it and slugs him as hard as he can. A brutal bar fight wrecks the place, and the police are called.

After a few miserable days in jail he's let out with a coming court date. His boss calls him to tell him he's fired. Even worse Rebecca is fed up and asks for a divorce. She kicks him out, and so he goes to his only friend left, Bob. 

Bob at this point makes over 100k a year as a lawyer, has a hot, loving wife, and three kids. 

Ted crashes for a few days until he sulks to Bob to watch the newest cop drama on the couch. After awhile he finally asks:

""You have an amazing life, you don't even drink anymore, do you?""

Bob lowers his head, turns, and replies:

""Of course I do, though I do it legally in moderation Ted.""

Ted starts to tear up, and quietly speak out:

""I'm a dead beat dad who no one loves... who just nearly killed someone.""

He pauses, wavering slightly.

""Man I can't put down the bottle and it's making me become the worst kind of person.""

Bob takes a long deep sigh, frowns, and says:
""Don't be a dick Ted.""",A man named Ted is unable to put alcohol down.,8

Quickly, the new ""gorilla"" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo. People from all over are coming to see the ""Human-like"" gorilla.

About a month in, the craze has started to wear off. So, to get peoples' attention back, he decides to climb over his enclosure and hang from the net ceiling above the lions den next to him. A large crowd of people gather watching the spectacle in awe and terror. Suddenly the man loses his grip and falls to the floor of the lion's den. The man starts screaming ""HELP!! HELP!!!""

""I've been searching everywhere for the legendary tower of knowledge, but it doesnt seem to exist."" ""Legendary tower of knowledge huh"", asks the bartender, ""I've never heard of anything like that, what it supposed to be?"" ""Well, it's supposed to be like a bible of jokes"", replies the guy, ""I want to be funnier, and this tower place is definitely the answer"". ""Where have you looked so far?"" asks the bartender. Well, it started off this morning when I was hit by a bus. I actually died and wound up in heaven! I waited in a queue with three nuns who had to cleanse their sins in holy water. The first one said she once saw a penis, so she washed her eyes in it. The third one rushed to the front saying she'd better gargle it now before the second nun puts her ass in it. It was St Peter who told me to find the legendary tower of knowledge... Before I knew it, I was pulled back to earth. I knew then I had to find this tower, so I stood up and got on the bus that had hit me. The bus driver apologised and said he could make it up to me, but I didn't fancy meeting him in the cemetery at night time; sounded a bit rapey. So I sat at the back of the bus and asked a hippie and a hot nun if they knew of the tower, but noone knew. I got off the bus and picked up my nephew, Johnny, from school. He ran up to me shouting, ""Uncle I've been blessed with an 8 inch penis."" ""I doubt it Johnny"", I replied. He said, ""I was, but the priest's been taken to jail now"". While at the school I checked their library to see if there were any books about this tower. When I got there a guy was ordering fish and chips. The librarian told him that its a library, so he whispered, *fish and chips please*. I couldn't find anything about the tower but I did see a frog telling a chicken with three books that he'd ""reddit, reddit, reddit"". I left the library and crossed the playground with a chicken who wanted to get to the other slide. I asked the chicken if he knew anything about the tower and he told me that ""Yo momma's so fat, when she fell over I didn't laugh, but the sidewalk cracked up."" I went to my dad's house to see if he knew. I got to his door and knocked twice. He said, ""who's there"" and I replied ""dad?"" He said, ""No you're not, I'm dad"". So I left him to it and went to my doctors appointment. I said, doctor doctor, I died earlier today and I can't feel the left side of my body... He said, ""it's ok, you're all right now."" I left the doctors and came across a blonde lady piecing together something on the floor. She asked me to help her with her rooster puzzle, but all I could see was a spilt box of cornflakes. I figured she wouldnt be able to help, so moved on. I went past a tattoo parlour and walked in. A guy was getting $100 tattooed on his penis. I asked him why and he said $100 is all his wife blows these days. Finally I walked past this street performer being watched by an Englishman, a French man, a Spaniard and a German. He noticed they couldn't see him so he stood on a wooden crate and asked if they could see him now. They replied ""yes"" ""oui"" ""si"" ""ja"". Then I entered this bar as a burger walked out, apparently you don't serve food here? ""Have you tried looking on reddit?"" says the bartender, ""try r/jokes, seems appropriate... "" The guy whips out his phone, logs onto reddit and asks around on r/jokes if anyone knows about the tower. Eventually he comes across THIS post and realises it's a story about him! He asks about it in the comments and OP responds, saying, ""Dude, it seems you've found what you're looking for. It's not a legendary tower of knowledge, It's an epic wall of text!""","Guy walks into a bar, sits down and orders a beer.",23

Each guest pulled a classic Jewish joke written on a piece of paper and told the joke to the crowd.

To prepare for this competition my wife, two sons, and I spent over six months reading every Jewish joke book we could find, including many now out-of-print, to cull only the very best Jewish jokes for the game. We were on the lookout for Jewish jokes everywhere. My son found a few howlers from his Torah portion in Leviticus, but they didn’t make the cut.

The joke competition was fierce. It turned out, not all of the delivered people had excellent delivery. But love and nachas — that was abundant. Now that the competition is long over, I am happy to share the winning five best Jewish jokes ever.

Not a very scientific process, you say? Okay, let this be the peer review. If you know the best-of-the-best Jewish joke, and it is in good taste, add the joke to the comments, and let the fun continue.

However all through his life the nun's who live in the orphanage have looked after him. All of his birthdays and all Christmases they've given him what he wanted.

A few days before his 18th birthday one of the nuns apporaches Johnny and asks what he wants for his birthday.

""I want a car"" he quickly replies.

""Now you know you can't have that Johnny, you don't have a licence and you can't drive""

He's having none of it though. So one of the nuns comes up with a brilliant idea and suggests they get him one of the toy electric cars for kids and reckons he won't know any better.

So they leave that outside the door of his bedroom on the morning of his birthday and he's delighted with life, it's the best thing in the world. For weeks he's flying around the corridors of the orphanage.

One day one of the nuns decides to have a bit of fun and pretends to be a police officer. ""STOP JOHNNY, PULL OVER"".

Johnny slowly stops the car and the nun approaches, ""Johnny, have you got your car insured."". 
Johnny looks all flustered and pulls a candy wrapper from his pocket and hands it to the nun. 

""Ah brilliant!"" she says and sends him on his way.

The next day comes around and the same nun stands in the corridor pretending to a police officer, ""JOHNNY PULL OVER, do you have a licence"".

The first blonde replies, ""Oh, that's easy! It's the holiday in November when everyone gets together, eats turkey and are thankful...""   
""Wrong!, you are not welcome here, I'm afraid. You must go to the other place!"" replies St. Peter.   
He turns to the second blonde, and asks her the same question:   
""What is Easter?""   
The second blonde replies, ""Easter is the holiday in December when we put up a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate the birth of Jesus.""   
St Peter looks at the second blonde, bangs his head on the on the pearly gates in disgust and tells her she's wrong and will have to join her friend in the other place. She is not welcome in Heaven.   
He then peers over his glasses at the third blonde and asks,   
""Do YOU know what Easter is""?   
The third blonde smiles confidently and looks St Peter in the eyes, ""I know what Easter is.""   
""Oh?"" says St Peter, incredulously.   
""Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish celebration of Passover. Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one of his disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with nails through his hands and feet. He was buried in a nearby cave which was sealed off by a large boulder.""   
St Peter smiled broadly with delight. The third blonde continued...   
""Every year the boulder is moved aside so that Jesus can come out and, if he sees his shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter.""

The rabbit drinks the beer and eats the toastie. He then leaves.

The following night the rabbit returns and again asks for a pint of beer, and a Ham and Cheese Toastie.

The barman, now intrigued by the rabbit and the extra drinkers in the pub, (because word gets round), gives the rabbit the pint and the Toastie. The rabbit consumes them and leaves.

The next night, the pub is packed.

In walks the rabbit and says, 'A pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie, please barman.'

The crowd is hushed as the barman gives the rabbit his pint and toastie, and then burst into applause as the rabbit wolfs them down.

The next night there is standing room only in the pub.

Coaches have been laid on for the crowds of patrons attending.

The barman is making more money in one week than he did all last year

In walks the rabbit and says, 'A pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie, please barman.'

The barman says, 'I'm sorry rabbit, old mate, old mucker, but we are right out of them Ham and Cheese Toasties.'

The rabbit looks aghast.

The crowd has quietened to almost a whisper, when the barman clears his throat nervously and says,
 'We do have a very nice Cheese and Onion Toastie.

The rabbit looks him in the eye and says, 'Are you sure I will like it.'

The crowd's bated breath is ear shatteringly silent.

The barman, with a roguish smile says, 'Do you think that I would let down one of my best friends. I know you'll love it.'

'Ok,' says the rabbit, 'I'll have a pint of beer and a Cheese and Onion Toastie.'

The pub erupts with glee as the rabbit quaffs the beer and guzzles the toastie.

He then waves to the crowd and leaves....

NEVER TO RETURN!!!!!!

One year later, in the now impoverished public house, the barman, (who has only served 4 drinks tonight, 3 of which were his), calls time.

When he is cleaning down the now empty bar, he sees a small white form, floating above the bar.

The barman says, 'Who are you?

To which he is answered,
 'I am the ghost of the rabbit that used to frequent your public house.'

The barman says, 'I remember you. You made me famous.

You would come in every night and have a pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie. Masses came to see you and this place was famous.'

The rabbit says, 'Yes I know.'

The barman said, 'I remember, on your last night we didn't have any Ham and Cheese Toasties. You had a Cheese and Onion one instead.'

The rabbit said, 'Yes, you promised me that I would love it.'

The barman said, 'You never came back, what happened?'

'I DIED', said the rabbit.

'NO!' said the barman. 'What from?'

After a short pause, the rabbit said ...

Nothing out of the ordinary: some shirts, a jacket, and his favorite pair of shorts. Now, you should know: Robert isn’t the fittest of my friends — he’s what we affectionately refer to as “husky”, and IMO the shorts he likes to wear don’t help him avoid looking like a cubist version of a human.

So he goes back to the dry cleaner two days later, and the owner told him they had a problem with the shorts: like I said, Robert’s a larger guy. His shorts are larger too, almost as wide as they are long. So apparently the dry cleaner is having an issue removing a certain stain from the shorts, and Robert isn’t happy about it. He’s yelling at the owner, telling him that he shouldn’t market himself as a dry cleaner if he isn’t going to CLEAN the clothes. That’s when the owner hands him a brochure about this brand new method of dry cleaning, where they actually use sponges in the cleansing process; the owner mentions it because he’s pretty sure that the sponging process will help remove the stain from Robert’s shorts. After a minute of looking at the brochure, Robert agrees to try the new method. So the owner yells to his assistant in the back:

It took a while for the tractor to be moved, so while the paramedics waited to treat him, the young man started chatting with one of the female paramedics, who he was immediately falling for. 

After the tractor was finally moved, he stayed a few days in the hospital to recover and make sure everything was okay. The female paramedic visited a few times, and he finally got up the guts to ask her out. To his delight, she said yes. 

Once he was recovered, he picked her up to take her to dinner at a nice restaurant. Since this was the 90’s, when they arrived, the hostess asked them if they preferred to sit in the Smoking or Non-Smoking section. Neither of them smoked, so they chose the Non-Smoking section.

Halfway through their appetizers, the woman’s eyes were watering and she was having a difficult time breathing. The Smoking section nearby had a lot of heavy smokers, and she was sensitive to the smoke. She decided to come clean and tell the young man she was bothered by it. “Listen, I’m having a really good time, but I can’t tolerate the smoke. Could we reschedule?”

Suddenly, he opened his mouth while and took a really deep breath, inhaling all of the smoke in the restaurant, swallowed, and closed his mouth. The restaurant’s air was smoke-free.

The woman stared at him, dumbfounded, and finally found the semblance to ask him, “What the hell was that!?”

The legionnaire follows the instruction and he arrives in a small bedroom with a tired old hooker waiting for him. “It’s 100 francs”, says the woman. The woman lays done on the bed and put a sheet on her head to protect herself. The soldier crouch down above her and let go a huge dump all over her. When he’s satisfied, he pays and leave.

3 month later, the soldier is back in town. He decides to go to the same place. “Third door on the left”, says the Madame. Once again, he find the same woman, crouch down above her and let go another enormous shit bigger than the last. He pays and leave.

2 months later, he decides to go for a third time. “Third door on the left”. Once again he crouch down on the woman but this time, he pushes and pushes and nothing comes out. He feels sweat coming on his brow. He pushes and pushes and after 15 minutes a very small hard shit, like a coma, falls down on the woman. The woman takes off the sheet protecting her and says:

The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy and prosperous people. The second kingdom is more humble, but has it's fair share of wealth and power too. The third kingdom is struggling and poor and barely has an army.

The kingdoms eventually go to war over the control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armor, each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 of their best knights, with fine leather armor and few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only warrior, an elderly Knight who has long since passed his prime, with his personal squire.

The night before the battle, the knights of the first kingdom make merry and party late into the night. The knights of the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of mead, and drink late into the night as well.

In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the Knight.

The following morning, the knights of the first two kingdoms are too hungover to fight, and the Knight of the third kingdom is too old and weary to get up. So, in place of the knights the squires go into battle. The fight lasts long into the night, and as the dust settled only one squire was left standing, the squire from the third kingdom.

And it just goes to show that the squire of the high pot in noose is equal to the squires of the other two sides.",On a continent far far away..,114

""Folks, I can tell you, our Navy submarines, are so big and so good, would you believe it, they can remain submerged from the moment they leave the port, to the day they enter it again 6 months later. You haven't ever seen such great submarines in your entire life, folks.""

Putin, not looking really impressed, answers:

""That's great, Donald. But my new nuclear submarines can stay submerged for almost an entire year. They are able to drive around the whole world without refueling, restocking, surfacing. What do you think of that?""

The two turn to Angela Merkel, and ask, ""How long can the German submarines stay under, Mrs Merkel?""

Before Mrs Merkel can answer, the water next to them starts bubbling, and a big grey hull emerges from the sea. As soon as it comes to rest, the hatch on the tower creaks open, and a man in black uniform steps out. He raises his hand, and shouts, ""Heil Hitler, we need more diesel.""

His father looks at him and replies: “Your grades are crap, you look like a hippy, and you don’t come to church with your mother and I anymore. Why would I buy you a car?”

The boy thinks long and hard and proposes a deal: “If I were to fix those things, would you be willing to buy me a car for my birthday?”

His father smiles and says, “If you get your grades up, cut your hair, and start coming to church, I will buy you a car.”

So over the next few weeks, the young man bust his ass. He gets his grades in order, even making the deans list. He starts going to church on Sundays, studies his Bible every night, and even finds time to join a youth group during the week.

With his birthday just around the corner, he finds his father and asks if he has done well enough to justify a vehicle. 

His dad smiles and says, “I am very proud of all that you’ve done son, but I also asked you to cut that hair. So, no.

The boy, dejected but not defeated, looks at him and says, “Ahhhh, but father, in my time studying the Bible I noticed a fair few things. Most notably, many prominent men that you look up to have long hair. Moses was said to have long hair, many of the disciples had long hair, and even Jesus had long hair. So I don’t think it’s too far out of the question for me to keep my hair this way.

Brian, however, has some basic medical training, and helps stop the bleeding. Brian decides to wrap Daniel's severed hand up with a plastic bag and takes him to the hospital. The ER doctor sees the two and looks disappointed.

""You two need to be more careful! You're lucky this wasn't more serious. Go to the waiting room, come back in an hour, and I'll see what I can do.""

An hour later, the doctor sees Daniel, and fixes his hand, good as new.

However, Daniel and Brian aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, and three weeks later, they're back at it again, cutting wood in the forest. Having learned nothing from the first experience, Daniel accidentally cuts his own leg off. Brian knows this is bad, but hopes for the best. He stops the bleeding, and wraps Daniel's severed leg in a plastic bag and takes him back to the hospital.

The doctor looks absolutely bewildered. ""I can't believe you two at all! This is ridiculous! Go to the waiting room, come back in an hour, and I'll see what I can do.""

They obey the doctor, and an hour later, Daniel comes out of the operating room, good as new.

For God knows what reason, one month later, Daniel and Brian are cutting wood in the forest again. This time, Daniel accidentally cuts his own head off. Brian knows this is as bad as could be, but he hopes for the best. He places Daniel's head in a plastic bag and rushes to the hospital with Daniel.

The doctor cannot believe his eyes. ""Are you kidding me! This is an outrage! You two are the absolute biggest idiots I've ever seen!"" He composes himself and decides he needs to try and save Daniel.

After the surgery, the doctor comes out and sees Brian. ""I'm sorry, Brian, but Daniel didn't make it.""

""I understand, he did cut his own head off,"" Brian sighed sadly.

""Oh, no, the surgery went fine,"" the doctor replied, ""it's just that he suffocated in that plastic bag.""",Daniel and Brian are cutting wood in a forest.,50

The doctor's reply was, 'Well, father, this is a natural phenomenon for all men, and it will happen even to you from time to time'.

The Pope exclaimed 'But you must do something about this! I have mass in an hour, and this thing isn't going away!'

The doctor replied 'You have two options... either I can administer an injection to your penis to make the problem go away, which will hurt and make you feel ill, or you can just quietly go into the toilet over there and relieve yourself.' 

Fearing the injection, the Pope elects the second option.

Unbeknown to him, a paparazzi photographer had sneaked into the Vatican, and just as the Pope reaches that point of no return, up pops the photographer and begins snapping away.

The Pope immediately summoned his security guards, who arrested the photographer, and began to quite thoroughly and professionally beat him up. 

The photographer shouted out, 'Hey, I thought you were a Christian organization! What has happened to your forgiveness?'

His anger having passed, the pope agreed with the photographer, and relented, saying 'Yes, my son, you are right, we shall release you. Unfortunately, we cannot return your camera, as we cannot allow the scandal of what is contained on the film to be seen in the outside world.' 

Never slow to take an opportunity, the photographer replied, 'But this is how I make my living! If you take my camera, I'll lose the money I could have sold the photographs for!'

The Pope, feeling guilty, agreed. 'Very well, we will compensate you. How about $100,000?' 

Ecstatic, the paparazzi agreed, and was soon on his way.

The Pope, in time, attended confession. Of course the whole story came out. For his penance, he was ordered to walk three times around St. Peter's, with the offending camera around his neck.

Out on his walk, he meets a Japanese tourist who said: 'Ah, so, very nice Japanese camera you got there, Mr. Pope, ah, may I ask how much you pay for it?'

Being the Pope, he cannot tell a lie, so he replied, 'I must confess that I paid $100,000 for it.' 

'Ah.... so....' said the Japanese gentleman, 'look like someone saw you coming",Heard the one about the Pope!,4

""Forgive me, Father, for I am an unworthy doctor. Today I lost my 15th patient. It just happened so fast. Another casket filled, another stain of blood on my hands. And I'm considering leaving medicine for good.""

The priest takes this in stride. ""I've had many doctors in my confession booth, my son. It is not a sin to fail every test of your mettle, for we are born flawed under God. For every patient you've lost are 100 more living and content with your work. And for them, a long lineage of grandchildren echoing forever who will be grateful for your strife and forgive you for those who you could not save.""

The man sits in this moment and thinks. ""Thank you, Father. That eases my heart. I think I can keep going, now. And I think I'll pick up some toys from the toy store next door to my work, surprise my kids when I get home, I think that'll help a lot.""
