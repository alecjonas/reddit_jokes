One day the farmer is sitting down paying off last month's heating bill when he realized that they were broke. He told his son to go into town and sell the duck for as much money that he could get.

So the boy started off to town. He came up to a prostitute that was uglier than the ass of the duck he carried in his arms. The hooker looked straight at the boy and said, ""The fucking begins at $10, you got $10?"" The boy had no money, so he started to walk away, but the hooker stopped him and said that she would accept that duck in his hands instead of $10. The boy gleefully accepted, so they went off and had sex.

An hour later, as the boy was leaving, the hooker pleaded that he fuck her again because it was the best fucking of her life. She offered him the duck back, and they went at it again.

Another hour passes, and the boy heads home, duck in hand. On the way, the duck gets spooked and flies from the boy's hands. It flew directly into the path of an oncoming car, obliterating the duck. The man driving gets out and apologizes for the boy's duck. The man hands the boy 25 dollars for his trouble and goes on his way.

Later, the boy goes home and hands his father 25 dollars. The father notices that his son looks exhausted and asks him, ""What happened?"" The boy's reply was this: ""I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and 25 bucks for a fucked up duck."" ",Fuck a duck!,29

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it.

She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ""No, this is my first time.""

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

""Just a minute."" she said, and walked to the door, and locked it.

Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ""Do these excite you?"" she asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was shake my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on.

As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her knickers and sat down at a desk. ""Well, come on,"" she said, ""we don't have much time.""

So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOW. I was done within a few minutes.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown, ""Did you put that condom on?"" she asked.

I said, ""I sure did."" and held up my thumb to show her.","I recall my first time with a condom, I must have been 16.",36

Well, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after what the man claimed, but her husband felt he really didn't need them. He was satisfied with things they way they were. The Jamaican quickly figured out the wife felt like she was getting the short end of the stick, so to speak. 

The wife asked the man, ""How could sandals make you into a sex freak?"" 

The Jamaican replied, ""Tell him to just try dem on, Lady."" So the husband, after some badgering from his wife, finally gave in, and tried them on.

As soon as the husband slipped them onto his feet, he got this wild look in his eyes. There was a level of excitement his wife hadn't seen in many years! In the blink of an eye, the husband grabbed the Jamaican, bent him violently over a table, yanked down his pants, ripped down his own pants, and grabbed a firm hold of the Jamaican's hips.

Edward worked as a government official tasked with creating essays questions for high school students to use in their exams, and Edward was really good at it. Edward's essay questions were renowned to be tough to answer correctly and despite many students offering him large sums of money to take an early look at the questions, he always refused.

Recently however, Edward had fallen on hard times. His wife had left him for another man, and he had been diagnosed with lung cancer; both the divorce and medical had left him with scarcely a penny. Despite all this Edward still refused to take any money from students wishing for an early glance at the essay questions he had written. 

The day before the national exams were to take place, Edward received a call from a government official. The official informed Edward that since this year's essay questions had been written already, the government was now sacking him before his yearly bonus in order to save money, and that they had created a computer program which would create essay questions every bit as hard as Edward's.

Edward was enraged, he reminded the official that for all these years he had faithfully served the government without taking any bribes from those who wanted and now they were just going to toss him away!? The official was unapologetic, and ended a call with the sentence: 'good luck next year, if you live that long.'

Edward stood there shaking with anger. His first reaction was to grab his coat and head to the city hall and give them a piece of his kind, but alas, the snow was waist thick and Edward, in his diseased state, could not get through. There was only one option left for him to get back at the government.

Edward, Snowed In, decided to leak An Essay information online to the general public - sabotaging this year's exam.

And thusly, as the next day began and millions of people had heard rumours of what Edward had done, they logged into their social media accounts and opened up various online news outlets hoping to hear the story, the headline that would shake the nation.

Collectively they read: ""We have updated our privacy policy""",Snowed in Edward,0

""Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it.

Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. 

Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. 

The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. 

After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: 

You have tennis elbow. 

Soak your arm in warm water. 

Avoid heavy lifting. 

It will be better in two weeks.""

Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. 

He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. 

To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. 

He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. 

The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:

""Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. 

Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. 

Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. 

They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.

""Since you were unconscious, we did put a replacement in place for you. The only problem is that all we could find in such short notice was a baby elephant trunk."" 

The man checks it out and is satisfied with the replacement. He's released from the hospital a few days later and returns to his life. 

A few weeks later he has his first date since the accident. He's having a nice conversation with his date when he hears the distinct sound of his pants zipper slowly opening. He blushes, hoping his date didn't hear the noise. 

A few moment later the end of the baby elephant trunk that is his penis snakes over the edge of the table, snuffing and tapping, searching over the table cloth. His date notices and watches, eyes wide. 

Suddenly, it grabs a dinner roll from his bread plate and whips back under the table. 

""Was that your penis?"" his date asks, her eyes wide and her cheeks flushed. 

Embarrassed, he can only nod and the color rises in his cheeks. 

""That was amazing,"" she said, ""Can it do it again?""

they shall carry on living with their tool dry and dead!*

This spell guaranteed none would have their way without paying a terrible price. With his newly found reassurance, Arthur launched into battle. 

After what seemed like a lifetime of fighting, the battle had been won. The King and a few of his brave men were able to finally return home! Once all the necessary celebrations had been dealt with, the King of Camelot rounded up all his Knights at the table for a final speech.

""Thank you all for completing your duties in my absence; I wish to make a toast, but first, I must request all of you to remove your pantaloons. I need to be certain I'm standing among men of value.""

In a horrifying twist, knight after knight dropped their undergarments only to reveal they had all been struck by the deadly spell, and their genitals had all withered and died...**except one man!** Sir Lancelot!

Disappointed but relieved, Arthur walked over to Lancelot and congratulated him on his honor, integrity, and loyalty to his king and kingdom.

""Sir, my good good Sir, you truly deserve a place at this table. Please, tell these animals among us what it takes to be a Knight of the round table."" Said the King.

Ron went into the chicken coop and fucked every chicken within an inch of its life. The farmer was flabbergasted. Ron then went into the stables and mounted the horses and proceeded to fuck them too. The farmer was shocked. He then turned his attention to the fields and fucked the hell out of every single cow. The farmer amazed thought wow I guess he really is a horny goat. The following morning the farmer didn't hear a rooster crow or even a peep from the animals. He went out and saw all the animals sleeping from their night of debauchery. Suddenly in the distance he saw buzzards circling in the sky, fearing the worst the farmer ran to the scene where the buzzards were and saw Ron lying dead and spread eagle in the middle of the field. ""Dammit Ron"" he said to himself. ""You've gone and fucked yourself to death"". Ron slowly opened one eye looked at the farmer and pointed to the buzzards and whispered ""Shhhhh they're about to land""",Ron the Rooster,35

Sue arrives shortly afterward, in gray Chanel. After the required ritualized kisses she joins Jan in a glass of wine.

Then Mary walks in, wearing a faded old tee-shirt, blue jeans and boots. She too shares the wine.

Jan explains that after leaving high school and graduating from Princeton in Classics, she met and married Timothy, with whom she has a beautiful daughter. Timothy is a partner in one of New York's leading law firms. They live in a 4000 sq. ft. co-op on Fifth Avenue, where Susanna, the daughter, attends drama school. They have a second home in Phoenix.

Sue relates that she graduated from Harvard Med School and became a surgeon. Her husband, Clive, is a leading Wall Street investment banker. They live in Southampton on Long Island and have a second home in Naples, Florida.

Mary explains that she left school at 17 and ran off with her boyfriend, Jim. They run a tropical bird park in Colorado and grow their own vegetables. Jim can stand five parrots, side by side, on his penis.

Halfway down the third bottle of wine and several hours later, Jan blurts out that her husband is really a cashier at Wal-Mart. They live in a small apartment in Brooklyn and have a travel trailer parked at a nearby storage facility.

The doctor gave the man a jar and said, “Take this jar home and bring back a semen sample tomorrow.“

The next day the old man reappeared at the doctor’s office and gave him the jar, which was as clean and empty as it had been on the previous day.

Naturally the doctor inquired as to what happened.

“Well doctor,” the old man explained, “it was like this. First I tried with my right hand, but nothing. Then I tried with my left hand, still nothing. Then I asked my wife. She tried with her right hand, then with her left, and still nothing. She even tried with her mouth, still nothing. We even called up Maggie, the lady next door. She tried with both hands, followed by her armpit. She even tried squeezing it between her knees. However still nothing.“

Looking shocked the doctor said, “You asked a neighbour?“

To which the old man replied, “Yes but none of us could get the lid off the jar.“

The first guy comes back to the troll with 5 oranges, and the troll says, ""If you wish to be free, you must put each and every orange up your arse without a reaction. If you succeed you are released for good. If you fail you shall become my supper!"". So the first man pulls down his trousers, and gets half of an orange in before he winces in pain, and is thrown back into the cage.

The second man comes back and is told the same thing, but this one brought blueberries. He pops one in, two, three, and on the fourth one he bursts out laughing, and is tossed into the cage. The first guy asks ""Why did you laugh? You could have gone free!"". The second man replies, ""It was all going well until I saw the other guy running back with an armload of pineapples.""

post,8o9fp0,2qh72,jokes,false,1528041474,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8o9fp0/the_story_of_the_pink_ping_pong_balls/,self.jokes,,"A wealthy man had a little boy. For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.

So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.

A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-' 

Then he died. ",The story of the Pink Ping Pong Balls,0

Sally decided she would put and end to this. So she started by locking the dog up inside, but the man had managed to do it again. She had no idea how he got in, but he managed to dive into the brushes and disappear. This continued for weeks, and no matter what sally tried, he would always find a way to get it done  and before he could get caught, dive into the brushes. So sally decided to put the dog out of it's misery (without telling Steve). So on thursday she took the largest knife they had and stabbed the dog to death. Steve was heartbroken. Steve wanted a new dog but Sally couldn't let him get one. She knew what would happen, and how she had already tried to stop it. 50 years later Sally and steve were playing a game where the person with the darkest secret won.

The professor is happy until he gets the bill. He tells the plumber, ""How can you charge this much? This is half of my paycheck."" But he pays it anyways.

The plumber tells him, ""Hey, we are looking for more plumbers. You could become a plumber and triple your salary. Just make sure you say you only made it to 6th grade, they don't like educated people.""

The professor takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But the company makes an announcement that all of their plumbers must get a 7th grade education. So they all go to night school.

On the first day of night school they all attend math class. The teacher wants to gauge the class so he asks John, ""What is the formula for the area of a circle?""

John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is negative pi times radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong so he starts over, but again he comes up with the same equation. After staring at the board for a minute he looks out at the other plumbers and sees that they are all whispering, ""Switch the limits on the integral!""

After a night of wine, talk, and flirting in the candlelight, the sexual tension between the two became too obvious, too strong to let rest. Thus, as a master seducer, Prince T’Challa decided to take their relationship one step further. 

She consented, of course. The Prince was very attractive, and she was not blind to the attraction they both felt for one another. Thus, arm in arm, the two ventured into the Prince’s bedroom, where a night of passion was destined to follow.

But as T’Challa pushed the woman onto the bed, her voice suddenly stopped him. 

“Wait,” she hissed from atop the royal crib. “Although I am attracted to you, I do not wish to bear a child, not even yours.”

post,8o42p6,2qh72,jokes,false,1527978019,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8o42p6/chegg_serial_killer/,self.jokes,,"(I originally posted this on /r/JokeShop, and am still very open to improvements.)

I messed up badly, and I want to share my story.

A few years ago, I was offered a dream job at my school's career fair. Great company, great pay, great benefits, just great all around. There was only one stipulation: I had to finish that final semester with a 4.0 GPA.

As the semester was wrapping up, I was stressed and busy and needed help. I posted three of my classes' final assignments on Chegg (a well-known homework help site), and I ended up submitting all of the answers the Chegg ""experts"" gave me.

I failed all of those assignments, and dropped to a B in those classes. Chegg had taken away my dream job that I had worked so hard for that semester, and I didn't have any backup plan. My initial shock soon turned to anger, and I decided to track down and kill all of the people who ruined my life by incorrectly answering my questions on Chegg.

I won't go into the details, but suffice it to say that I have a very particular set of skills, and I found those damned Cheggs one by one. I abducted and killed each one, careful to leave no incriminating evidence, and buried them all in a single makeshift coffin in the middle of the woods.

Since the three were all from different parts of the country, they were all handled by local authorities and no connection among the victims was even considered. I had gotten away with the perfect crime. Until... well...

Apparently bodies generate a lot of gas as they decompose, and three bodies decomposing in a single coffin in a shallow grave were too much to contain. The coffin burst, a small sinkhole formed above it, and some hunter noticed the smell and reported it to authorities.

Once the DNA had been identified, the Chegg connection was quickly made, and before I knew it I had a SWAT team outside my door.

I'm on death row now, and when I look back I can't believe how foolish I was.... It didn't have to be this way.

So, Reddit, don't repeat my mistake.

Never put all your Cheggs in one casket.",Chegg Serial Killer,17

He was hoping that nobody heard it, but to his dismay, a wave of disgust fell on the faces of those in the congregation. After the service, he was berated by nearly everyone in attendance for “insulting Jesus” and “bringing shame to the church.” The next Sunday, next to no one was in attendance at church, and those who came refused to talk to the priest after mass. The next day he left his village in shame and embarrassment and moved to the United States to start a new life. He found a job and a wife and raised a beautiful family. He became an American citizen and got a high paying job. He was living the American dream, but in the back of his mind, he was still uneasy about how he left his village, and always wanted to go back.

Decades later, the priest had become an old man and was becoming very sick. He had told his children that he wished to go back to Poland before his death, just to get some closure. Finally he flew back to his village, looking unrecognizable from his past self. Life in the village was continuing as normal, and when he went to church a few days after he arrived, he was happy to see that it was in full attendance, showing that no one remembered his incident that one Sunday and that it was forgotten history. At peace with himself, he went to the church coffee hour, where a young boy, who clearly had never seen him before, asked him who he was. The priest laughed.

“You definitely haven’t seen me before. I haven’t been to this village since 1923.” The boy’s eyes lit up.

You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press against the base of your spine. It’s this pressure that’s causing your headaches.’ Shocked by these revelations the man leaves, but with the headaches not getting better, he eventually agrees to go under the knife.
After the op he feels great for the first time in ages. As he’s walking along the street he passes by a tailor’s and decides to treat himself. As he enters the tailor looks at him and says, ‘Let’s see, I’d say you take a size 44 long?’ The man scoffs, ‘That’s right. How did you know my exact size?’ 
‘It’s my job to know,’ says the tailor. ‘How about a new shirt to go with it? I’d say you take a 34 sleeve with a 16 neck.’
‘Right again!’ Says the man. ‘How on earth?’
‘It’s my job,’ says the tailor. ‘What about some new underwear to finish off your new look? Let’s see, I’d say you’re a size 36.’ The man laughs, ‘ wrong this time! I’m actually a 34. I’ve worn size 34 since I was 16.’
The tailor tuts,’You shouldn’t do that, sir. You see a size 34 would press your testicles against your spine and give you terrible headaches.’

Saint Peter checks his list, but does not see the engineer.  The engineer says, ""I have lived my entire life for good, there must be some sort of mistake!""

When he gets to hell, he does not like it!  After a couple of eternities he approaches Satan.

""You know, it is hot down here!  Plus boring... there is nothing to do but burn and wail.  I have a couple of ideas that could help.""

Later, God is calling Satan to gloat but Satan cuts him off.

""You know... it is not so bad down here.  One of the new souls installed some skylights and some bay windows and really opened up the place.  Plus he installed central air and even got us WiFi.  It has never been better down here.""

God was confused. ""Wait.. who did all this work?""

When Satan told God the name of the engineer, God checked his books.

God said to Satan.  ""That guy doesn't belong in hell, there was a mistake. All engineers go to heaven, you know that. Send him up right away.""

Satan replied with not just a no, but a hell no.  ""He has some projects to do down here, he is now installing a swimming pool.""

God got angry.  ""Satan you cannot just keep him!  He belongs to me!  I.. well... I..   I'll sue!""

Satan just laughed.  ""How are you going to do that?  I have all the lawyers!""",An engineer dies.,46

One morning, fifteen or twenty years alone, he wakes up to see an English ship\-of\-the\-line in the small bay.  The Captain rows ashore and asks the sailor to report.  The sailor tells him his tale and takes the Captain on a tour of his island.  


""This pier you have built.  This is solid work.""  


""Thank you Captain.""  


""And your house!""  


""I knew there was no room for self\-pity and wanted to make do.  I even built a fireplace to remind me of home, though I never use it.  Over here is my workshop where I made rope and stone tools. I dry fish over there.  Although I was alone all these years, as a member of the Royal Navy, I owed the Crown my best.""  


""And what's this?""  The Captain sees a small Church.  Wood beams, a fine altar, two or three pews, as though waiting to welcome any congregation.

A widow has been lonely for a while now and she wants to be with another lover. So she puts a personal ad in the paper to find her new lover. The ad reads “Looking for a lover. Must never hit me, run around with other women and must be good in bed”

A couple of days later the woman hears someone ring her doorbell and opens it to find a man in a wheel chair with no legs or arms. The woman has no idea why this man is at her door step and asks him if she can help him.

The man says “I saw your ad in the paper and I’m here to be your lover”. The woman thinks this is a joke and curiously looks around to see if someone is playing a prank on her. The woman, curious with the man, asks “you have no arms or legs, how are you gonna be my lover?”

The man tells her “I have no arms, so I could never hit you. I have no legs so I could never run around with other woman. And as far as being good in bed, well how do you think I rang your doorbell?”",Looking for a new lover,9
