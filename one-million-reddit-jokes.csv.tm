post,4gd075,2qh72,jokes,false,1461586083,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4gd075/the_priest_and_half_a_lemon/,self.jokes,,"There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath. After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.

Many years passed by like that.

At the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.

With his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:

\- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked:

\- Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.

A week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:

\- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked:

\- Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:

\- Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.

\- Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:

\- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:

\- Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.

\- Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:

\- Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.

\- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!

\- There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:

\- But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:

\- Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?

\- All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.

The priest was good, and never told anyone.",The priest and half a lemon,312

The girl heads out at sunrise too, but unfortunately mistakes which pier the arranged meeting was supposed to take place at, causing her to go to the incorrect one. She waits at the pier all day and upon her boyfriend failing to show up angrily tears the ring off of her finger and throws it into the ocean where it is swept away in the surf.

There, she found an old man about her age, who had also lost his spouse years earlier. They exchanged a few messages and decided to meet one day in a park. Upon meeting, they both realized that they were extremely compatible and started talking about taking their relationship further.

The old man said to her, however,

""I really like you and would like to see you on a regular basis, but I have one special request. You see, these days it's hard for me to jerk myself off with my arthritis, so if you are willing to give me handjobs now and then, I will shower you with all my affection.""

The old lady thought for a little and soon agreed. So they found a secluded area in the park, the old man unzipped his pants, and she gave him a handjob.

Every Wednesday they would meet at the same secluded area in the park and she would give him a handjob. And in return he bought her nice gifts, was affectionate, and made her extremely happy. The relationship suited them both very well.

One Wednesday, the old lady went back to the park, but the old man was nowhere to be found. She was sad, but figured he had somewhere to be. But the next Wednesday he wasn't there either, and the week after that. She worried that something had happened to him, and she tried but could not get in touch with him. She became sad and depressed at having lost her newfound love.

One day, she went for a walk in the same park where she used to meet the old man, and as she was walking, she noticed an older couple in a secluded area of the park. As she got closer, she noticed, son of a bitch it was the old man! And some new woman was giving him a handjob! Furious, she ran up to them and confronted the old man.

""What's going on here?! I thought we had a great thing going!"" she yelled to the old man.

""Well, we did have something really special, and you were very good to me. But this lady has something that you don't have.""

""What? I was perfect for you! What could this woman possibly have that I don't?"" she asked.

""The genie thundered, 'You have released me from my ten-thousand year imprisonment, and I am in your debt. I will grant you three wishes as a token of my gratitude.'

""The genie says, 'Your wish is granted.' And the ocean parts, and out walks this gorgeous woman in this beautiful dress, and she takes my hand and we fall in love and the genie marries us right there. It was incredible.

An established farm owner took the boy under his wing to teach him all that he knew.  Once the boy finished his initial training, the owner gave the boy a very special seed.

“You must work hard, boy.  If you water and fertilize this seed, and make sure it has enough light, it will grow into something wonderful!”

The boy watered and fertilized the seed only once, and to his surprise it sprouted into a bush of herbs.  The boy was astonished that the simple directions of the owner were true; the boy had not put much effort or care into the task, yet the plant grew on its own.

The winter passed, and in the spring the boy was saddened to see that the herbs had died.  He went to the farm owner to ask why.

The owner was sipping hot tea.  “Ah, annuals,” said the owner, who then went on to explain that the type of seed he gave the boy would sprout only once and then die.  Pleased with the boy’s progress, he gave the boy another very special seed.

“You must work hard, boy.  If you water and fertilize this seed, and make sure it has enough light, it will grow into something wonderful!”

The boy watered and fertilized the seed only once, and to his surprise it sprouted into a beautiful flower.  Again the boy was astonished that he simply planted the seed and it grew despite that he had forgotten to care for it.  He smiled to himself in an arrogant fashion, proud that he had developed such a green thumb.

He waited another year, and the flower bloomed again.  The boy deduced that the seed he was given must have been of a different sort, one that would sprout many times before it would die.  And yet after another year passed, it was clear that this plant had died too.  He went to the farm owner to ask why.

The owner was sipping hot coffee.  “Ah, perennials,” said the owner, who then went on to explain that the type of seed he gave the boy would sprout several times across the years before dying.  Confused with why the plant had died after only two years of life, he gave the boy another very special seed.

“You must work hard boy.  If you water and fertilize this seed, and make sure it has enough light, it will grow into something wonderful!”

The boy watered and fertilized the seed only once, and to his surprise it never even sprouted.  “This was supposed to be easy!” the boy shouted in frustration.  The last two seeds had bloomed without him doing any work at all.  He stormed into the farm owner’s house, demanding to know why the seed had not sprouted.

The owner was sipping a cocktail.  “Ah, millennials,” sighed the owner.

Lorde has a gig in the coolest club in town and the squad decided to go to the club after a short pre-drinking. The pre-drinking took place at Al Bundys home and they had profound discussions. Vegeta to King Joeffrey ""man do you ever fucked a girl in the other hole?"" ""NO of course not!"" responds Joeffrey, ""i don't want to get her pregnant!"" After short pre-drinking they start their journey.  
All except Al Bundy. Al was a little bit to drunk for partying. He was standing in the bathroom and told the showerhead to stop crying.
The others were on their way. All completely drunk. Frodo saw a tree and climb on it ""fellers!! that's the biggest broccoli i've ever seen!!"" The others laughed. BUUUUUUUMMMMMMM!!! a porsche has crashed into the tree. 
The driver was screaming ""my porsche! my porsche! my porsche!"" Broseidon rushes him to help! ""Hey bro forget your porsche, you've lost your arm!!"" 
The porsche driver responds ""my rolex!  my rolex! my rolex!""
""Don't worry dude I'll take care of it!"" says Joeffrey! Proud he looks at his new watch! Moments later the paramedics arrived and so the journey of the 6 friends and Markus continues. 
""THIS IS SPARTAAA!!!"" Cristiano Ronaldo shouted. They've reached the coolest club in town! &gt;&gt;&gt;SPARTA&lt;&lt;&lt; It was heavily guarded by 300 doormen. Unfortunately Frodo's worn-out clothes were not classy enough to enter the club. He had to stay outside. Meanwhile  Broseidon, Vegeta, San Goku, Cristiano Ronaldo King Joeffrey and Markus went into the club. ---Well, of course, like every other group of friends that enter a club they lost each other a few moments after entering... So everyone has to fight alone to find love--- Lorde was playing on a big stage in the middle of the main floor. Everyone was
partying.
Broseidon goes straight to a beautiful Lady. After some smalltalk they kissed each other... everything seems fine, but right before Broseidon wants to ask for her number,  another guy shows up. And for some reason the Lady was completely into that other guy. Broseidon had no chance to get the girl. He looses the battle against this mysterious guy who calls himself Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. What a dickhead! he's never seen something like that before! Unbelievable...
King Joeffrey walks into an rnb-floor and sees a fat girl dancing on a table. He walks over to her and says, ""Wow, nice legs!"" She is flattered and replies, ""You really think so?"" Joeffrey says, ""Oh definitely! Most tables would have collapsed by
now"".
Cristiano Ronaldo had it going on with a hot blonde lady. The whole time she talks about her husband who died cause of a small flesh wound he was getting in a battle against some wannabe-soldier. He killed the wannabe but later the wound had festered and so he died because of a sepsis, and then it gets all crazy with slaves, witchcraft, fire and all that shit. She said now she's fully into her career and stuff but Cristiano didn't listen, he just wanted to bang her. After sone drinks they went to the toilet to do some grown up stuff. Cristiano riped his clothes off.... ""doesn't look my body like dynamite?"" - ""maybe, but with that short fuse it's worthless!"" She said and left Cristiano behind crying in the toilet. At the same time King Joeffrey was beaten up cause he had made fun of Kathleen Jenner and the new principal of the scool in town didn't tolerate such intolerant douchebags. Meanwhile Markus wants to get a date. He wasn't a womenizer but he had heard from his friend Stifler that women like tough guys, so he walks up to a lady at the bar and says: ""eyyy you like tough guys??"" - 
She: ""hmmm could be"" -
He: ""Well i don't use toilet paper..."" - 
She responds ""Ohhhhh... raaawwrr... you have to show me ;)"" 
Just kidding. She slaped him and ran away. San Goku flirts with a tall girl and he was really into her. He was very politely and also paid her some drinks, then he ask for her number... but the girl responds ""You find it in the phone book."" - ""but I don't know your name"" San Goku said. The girl just answered ""that's in the pone book to!"" 
Poor San Goku... Vegeta has watched the whole scene from behind...
Sooo back to Broseidon. He's found another cute girl to approach. He get's in touch with her. But suddenly a dude with short pants and a Bowling shirt shows up. This prick told about a beach house in malibu and paaaaff the girl was fallen in love with that strange way to old man. But that was nothing compared to what's next. You should have seen Broseidon's eyes as he flirted with the next girl and suddenly a small ugly guy with a bowl haircut appears. So this dickhead really claimed to be an astronaut. And the worst thing, the chick did believe him!! What a liar! Can you believe that?! ""I bet this bowl haircut dick still lives at his mum's  house"" Broseidon thought. Clearly that was to much for him. He decided to get completely drunk!
After his hopeless attempt before, Markus sits alone at a table and drinks a pepsi. At the table next to him there was a beautiful brunette... Markus wondered what he could say... He knows, everytime he is talking to a girl he says something stupid. Suddenly the brunette stands up and walks away. So he thought ""I guess it's better this way, it wouldn't have worked out anyway"" but while he was thinking about how much it wouldn't worked out with her the brunette came back and sit down at the table again. ""THAT'S A SIGN!"" he thought ""WE ARE MEANT FOR EACH OTHER!!"" so he empties his pepsi,  streches out his chest and walks up to her like a champion ""heyyyyyy.... you've been pooping?""
Vegeta had enough... only girls who are way to young and with waaaaayyy to much make up... He get's approached by a lot of girls. One of them, was really persistent. Ironically it was the bitch that had dumped San Goku before. Vegeta remembers her, so he just says ""Words can't describe how beautiful you are...""
She ""awwwwww that's so sweeeeet! :)""
V: ""but numbers can. 2/10.""
Vegeta turns around, and calls a cab. On his way home he was wondering why Lorde had hairy legs... but then he discard the thoughts, cause he had to think about his next biceps workout
tomorrow.
Finally Broseidon was kissing a gorgeous blonde wich said she works at the cheesecake factory. What he didn't know: the sexy blonde was on her period. But she just thought ""Ahh he's so sweet and also really drunk, he won't even notice!""
The next morning Broseidon wakes up alone in the bed wondering what had happened the night before... He gets a shock!!! The whole bed was covered in blood! He just remembers the blonde girl from the cheesecake factory but what happened next? What have he done? Immidiately he runs to the gun locker! ""GOOD! All cartridges complete so I haven't shot her!"" he tought. Next he checks the knife block in the kitchen. All knifes there, no knife is bloody ""Oh good i haven't stabed her!"" But then he thinks ""wait a moment... I don't have a gun locker... I haven't even a knife block! Where the fuck am I and what have I done to the girl?"" In panic he runs through the apartment. Suddenly he stop in front of a mirror... thinking ""FUCK!!! I'VE EATEN HER!!!!""","#long One evening, Broseidon, Al Bundy, Cristiano Ronaldo, Vegeta, San Goku, King Joeffrey, Frodo and Markus decided to go for a drink.....",0

He'd only have sex with the lights off.

The wife assumed he merely had some shame in the penile department, but she loved him, so happily obliged. An added bonus was that it felt like he was actually reasonably well-equipped downstairs, so everything was good.

However, 20 years of blind sex took its toll on her and their relationship. In the middle of one of their love-making sessions, the wife dived for the lamp and turned on the light.

She saw her husband with his pants on and a dildo in hand.

There was a brief moment of silence, then the wife sternly stated: ""You have some explaining to do.""

The husband looked her dead in the eye and said: ""I'll explain this when you explain the kids"".

Little Tommy took the opportunity and stuck little Susie with a pin he had brought from home, and she jumped straight up in her seat and yelled, ""Holy Lord Almighty!!""

Susie found herself drifting off to sleep again, and a few minutes the teacher asked to the class, ""Who was crucified on a cross and was resurrected three days later?""

Little Tommy saw his chance and stuck Susie with the pin again, and she shot up out if her seat and screamed, ""Oh my sweeet Jesus!!""

The teacher was again a little confused but still pleased with her response, and continued on with the lesson.

Again Susie drifted off to sleep. And sure enough, after a dew minutes the teacher had another question. ""What did Eve say to Adam after their twenty-third child?""

After 5 lashes the pillow breaks and they keep lashing him. After the 20 lashes he's bawling and his back is horribly scared. They haul him away to be sent back to Spain.

""OK,"" he says, ""How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?"" 

""Oh Charlie, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!"" 

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. 

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence. The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. 

As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground . 

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know. 

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. 
The Policeman, thinks I've got to ask them what their secret is. So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Since her birthday was not far off, he asked what she’d like as a gift. “I’d like to be eight again,” she replied, still looking in the mirror.

On the morning of her birthday, he rose early, made her a nice big bowl of Coco Pops, and then took her to Adventure World theme park. What a day! He put her on every ride in the park; the Death Slide, the Wall of Fear, the Screaming Roller Coaster, everything there was.

Five hours later they staggered out of the theme park. Her head was reeling and her stomach felt upside down. He then took her to a McDonald’s where he ordered her a Happy Meal with extra fries and a chocolate shake.

Then it was off to a movie, with popcorn, a soda pop, and her favorite candy, M&amp;Ms. What a fabulous adventure!

Finally she wobbled home with her husband and collapsed into bed, exhausted.

He leaned over his wife with a big smile and lovingly asked, ""Well dear, what was it like being eight again?""

Her eyes slowly opened and her expression suddenly changed.

He works day and night to become the new leader of this hive. Unfortunately the role as leader goes to this bumble bee that was just popular but never did anything. So our bumble bee decides to leave the hive

He decides he wants to go to school. He enrolls in school and graduates with a 4.0 GPA and goes on to Harvard university. He graduates Harvard with another 4.0 GPA and is 1st in his class rank. 

Our bee decides he wanted to use his knowledge to help the people. he becomes the governor of the state and eventually becomes the president. He is the best president the U.S has ever had. He helps end all wars and achieves world peace, finds the cure for cancer and even the cure for a broken heart. Unfortunately when his second term came to a new end, he had to leave office. Everyone was sad. Even the new president elected was sad our bee was leaving.

After being the president and cleaning up the world, he started to think about his family and the hive he left. He hadn't visited them in years and wondered what had happened. So he went back to the hive wondering what everyone will be like and if he will belong. When he got there he was shocked. The hive was in terrible shape. It was worse than ever. Our bee takes over as leader and turns the hive back around. The hive is now in the best shape of its existence.
It took many years to clean up but to him it was worth it and he was finally home.

One hot day after a long days work he decided to go to the water spring because he was thirsty. But when he got there, there was a line. The line went on for miles. Our bee calculates how long it would take until it would be his turn and determines it would take 4 hours! So he goes to find the other water spring but to his suprise there is an even longer line! He calculates that the time it would take for him to have his turn and calculates it would take a whole day.Desperate and out of options he remembers an old fruit punch tree he used to go to when he was a baby. So he ventures out to the fruit punch tree and when he gets there, there's no punchline!

However he wants to look lenient in the eyes of their respective countries so he reduces the lashes to twenty and allows them to have two requests each before being lashed. 

The Spanish is first to be lashed and requests a bottle of tequila and a pillow strapped to his back. They let him drink the tequila and strap the pillow to his back and then commence the lashes. After 5 lashes the pillow breaks and they keep lashing him. After the 20 lashes he's bawling and his back is horribly scared. They haul him away to be sent back to Spain.

The French man is next and he requests two pillows (one per request). After 10 lashes the pillows break and they continue with the next 10. By the end he's also horribly scarred and bawling, but not as bad as the Spanish guy.

While they are hauling off the French guy the judge turns to the Brit and says ""Well it's your turn now. What do you request?""

The British man responds ""First I want the original punishment of 100 lashes. I don't believe I should get off easy.""

The Judge yells ""You're crazy! why would you do that?""

The Brit responds ""Because my next request is to have the French man strapped to my back.""

The cowboy replies, ""Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in Arizona, the other is in Colorado . When they left our home we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank together. So I'm drinking one beer for each of my brothers and one for myself."" The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there.

The cowboy becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way.

One day, he comes in and only orders two beers. All the regulars take notice and fall silent. When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, ""I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss.""

The cowboy looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns in his eyes and he laughs. ""Oh, no, everybody's just fine,"" he explains, ""It's just that my wife made me quit drinking but it hasn't affected my brothers, though.""

I made him get a job raking leaves for a big real estate company, and one day while he was at work he started talking to a couple that stopped by a house on a whim. Well, he sold them the house right there on the spot. Turns out he's got a natural gift for selling houses, now he owns a huge realty company and he just gave his best friend a mansion for his birthday!""

The second guy says, ""That reminds me of my own son. After high school he was living at home, just playing on the internet all the time. One night while he was bored, he bought a couple penny stocks with his last $50. He was hooked, and spent a ton of time learning everything there is to know about the market. He's made so much money on the market now that he owns his own investment firm and he just gave his best friend a million dollar portfolio for his birthday!""

The third guy says, ""This is crazy but that sounds just like my son. After he graduated he was bumming around, sleeping on his friend's couch. He got a job washing cars at a car dealership for beer money. One day he helped convince some customers to buy a car, and on a hunch the dealership owner made him a salesman. He's been so successful that now he owns three dealerships, and he just gave his best friend a Mercedes Benz for his birthday!""

Upon finishing his story the fourth man returned from the bathroom. They tell him that they'd been talking about their sons and the fourth man says, ""Oh god, I hate to say it but to be honest my son is a little bit of a disappointment. He's thirty now and a hairdresser, and I just found out he's gay and has a bunch of boyfriends.

Every Israelite lived in a family hut, all except for old lady Nina, whose husband had passed on with no children. Everyone complied to this rule for the quite some time, but one day when Moses consulted the Bush, the Bush told him that one of the Israelites had failed to follow the rule, and unless that Israelite was disciplined or came forward to confess their sin and be shamed in front of the tribe, they would all be slaves of the Pharaoh for eternity. Naturally, this caused some commotion as to who could have violated this rule, and also naturally, all denied having leavened the bread. Everyone had their families as witnesses claiming they did not break the rule. All except for Nina, as she lived alone. Since she was so well respected, no one questioned her at first, but eventually all the evidence began to point in her direction. Rather than asking her directly, and thus humiliating her before the Israelites, Moses asked the Burning Bush if she was the perpetrator. He and his brother Aaron approached the holy ground, and Moses asked aloud ""BUSH, DID NINA LEAVEN?""","During the Exodus, before the Israelites left Egypt, Moses talked to the Burning Bush.",18

She sprinted to the bus stop, and was able to make it on time, but was the last one on. Because of this, there were no more seats in the front of the bus with all of the kids her age, so she had to go sit in the back of the bus with all of the big, bad fifth graders. When she got back there, one of the fifth graders looked at her and said,

""Hey there little girl! Do you want to hear the *worst word in the world*?""

The little girl, taken aback since it was her first day of school, replied,

""S-s-sure?""

""You must promise not to *ever* repeat it, because very bad things will happen if you do!""

""O-o-okay,"" she said.

""The *worst world in the world* is.....

STRAWBERRY!!!""

The little girl gasped, started crying, and ran to the front of the bus to tell the bus driver the atrocity that she had just heard. Frantically, she said,

""BUS DRIVER!! The big bad fifth graders in the back of the bus just told me the *worst world in the world*!!!""

Surprised, the bus driver replied,

""Little girl! It's okay, you don't have to listen to those big, bad fifth graders! They're just trying to scare you since it's your first day! But what did they tell you that the *worst word in the world* was?""

""THEY SAID I CAN'T REPEAT IT OR BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN!!"" the little girl cried back. ""I CAN'T SAY IT!""

""Little girl! It's okay! I'm your bus driver! You can trust me! I won't tell anyone you repeated it!""

""O-o-okay,"" sobbed the little girl. ""They said it w-w-was... STRAWBERRY!""

The bus driver immediately slammed on the brakes and yelled,

""YOU GET OFF OF THIS BUS RIGHT NOW LITTLE GIRL. HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT WORD ON MY BUS!""

The little girl, sobbing her eyes out, obeyed and ran off of the bus. Unfortunately for her, it had started pouring rain, so she had to run the rest of the way to school in the rain.

Now, since it was her first day, her teacher knew that something was wrong when he saw the little girl come into his class 45 minutes late, soaking wet. When there was a break, he pulled the little girl aside, and asked,

""Little girl! Is everything okay? Why were you so late to your first day of school?""

The little girl, still sobbing at this point, said,

""Teacher! Today has been the worst day every! First I was almost late to the bus, so I had to sit with all of the big, bad fifth graders in the back of the bus! They told me the *worst word in the world*, so I ran and told the bus driver! He got really really mad at me and kicked me off of the bus, so I had to run to school in the rain on my first day!""

""Oh my! That is so terrible!"" the teacher said. ""I'm so sorry! What word did these fifth graders say that was so terrible?""

""NO! I CAN'T SAY IT AGAIN!"" the little girl yelled.

The teacher replied, ""It's okay little girl! I'm your teacher! You can trust me! What is the word?""

""It-it-it's..... STRAWBERRY!"" the little girl sobbed.

""YOU GET OUT OF MY CLASSROOM RIGHT NOW AND GO SEE THE PRINCIPAL YOUNG LADY! HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT IN MY CLASS!"" the teacher roared.

Bawling, the little girl ran down the hallways of the school, frantically looking for the principal's office. When she finally found it, she burst into the room, weeping. The principal, instantly concerned, went up to the little girl and tried to calm her down. When she finally managed to stop the little girl's crying, she sat her down in the chair and asked,

""Little girl! Why are you here already? It's only your first day of school!""

Still tearful, the little girl said,

""Principal! I've had the worst day ever! First I was almost late to the bus, so I had to sit with all of the big, bad fifth graders in the back of the bus! They told me the *worst word in the world*, so I ran and told the bus driver! He got really really mad at me and kicked me off of the bus, so I had to run to school in the rain on my first day! My teacher then asked me why I was late, so I told him, and he asked what the word was! I told him, and he kicked me out and sent me here! THIS DAY IS TERRIBLE!""

The principal, trying to absorb everything that he had just been told, tried to comfort the little girl,

""Little girl! It's okay! You're okay here! But tell me, what is the *worst word in the world*?""

""NONONONONO I CAN'T SAY IT PRINCIPAL!"" the little girl shouted back. ""I JUST CAN'T!""

""It's okay! I'm your principal! You can trust me! I won't tell anyone!"" she replied.

""O-o-okay. It-it-it's..... STRAWBERRY!""

""HOW DARE YOU USE THAT WORD IN THIS SCHOOL! YOU ARE EXPELLED! GET OUT OF MY SCHOOL RIGHT NOW!"" the principal yelled.

Not knowing what to do with herself and absolutely bawling her eyes out, the little girl ran out of the school, and saw a church across the street. Thinking someone there might help her, she ran across the street without looking, and got hit by a car.

Moral of the story:

Look both ways before crossing the street.

The train suffered a terrible crash and only those in the front of the train survived. Joe was put on trial for the negligent homicide of nearly a hundred people. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by the electric chair.

When asked what he'd like for his last meal, he replied simply with ""A banana, if you will."" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. Joe ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen.

However, after the electricity was activated, nothing happened. The guard was astonished. Not knowing what to do, he simply let Joe go.

A few days later, Joe was back to work conducting trains. Shortly after his return, he managed to derail yet another train, again killing nearly a hundred people but surviving the crash. As before, he was charged and found guilty of multiple negligent homicides. Again, he was sentenced to death by electric chair.

It was the same prison guard as before. He was surprised to see Joe again but held his tongue, for the man was about to die and it would be rude to question him. ""What would you like for your last meal, sir?"" Joe respond as he did last time: ""A banana, if you will."" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. Joe ate the banana in regular fashion and again braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen.

The electricity was activated and Joe was prepared. But, as before, he was unhurt. The prison guard checked for any malfunctions but found nothing, not believing the entire situation was possible. Now even more incredulous than before, and not knowing what to do, the guard let him go.

Joe was, against all odds, alive and was incredibly still allowed to continue his job as a train conductor even though he was responsible for the deaths of almost two hundred people.

He was thankful to be allowed to continue his job but also scared. He would try to drive more carefully from now on. However, this effort didn't help much, as the very next train he was conducting, he managed to somehow crash. He was the only survivor of the train, which again contained over a hundred people. He was again charged, and again found responsible for the deaths of over a hundred people. He was sentenced to death by electric chair.

The prison guard was the same, the meal was the same, the procedure was the same. After giving Joe the banana, the guard was silent. He couldn't bring himself to say anything, all he could do was prepare the chair.

Joe sat in the chair, expecting death. The guard activated it and, again, Joe was unscathed. The prison guard couldn't contain himself. He simply had to ask, ""Sir, how did you manage to crash a train 3 times? And how did you survive the chair 3 times? Did the banana have something to do with it?"" 

Joe paused for a moment. Then he replied: ""No, I suppose I'm just a terrible conductor.""",Joe the Train Conductor,335

The bartender decides not to comment on this at first and just asks: ""What can I get you?"" The joke replies: ""A beer please"" - ""ok, coming up"". The bartender proceeds to take a glass out of the shelf and pours the joke a nice and cold beer. ""Here you go"". - ""Thanks"".

Around 20 minutes pass. The joke sits at the bar, drinking alone. Meanwhile, other people enter the bar. There are two attractive people in love, an old man who used to live a life of adventure and always has an anecdote to tell to the other guests (whether they ask him for it or not), a couple of tourists who have read about the bar in guides as ""a place to hang out"", some college kids who have read about the bar in guides as ""a place to get wasted"", and some regular guests who just give the barkeeper a slight nod to indicate they desire their usual drink.

The beer didn't seem to cheer up the joke at all. After around half an hour, the barkeeper finally decides to say something. He walks over to the joke and says ""Hey buddy, what's wrong?"" The joke sighs and says ""I can't do anything right. My wife loves another man, my job is a dead end and my kids both act up in school. Plus, my back is killing me and no medication seems to help. I don't know what to do"". The barkeeper proceeds to comfort the joke with a combination of experiences from his own life and self-help classics and it seems to help. It would be an overstatement to say the joke loved his life after their conversation, but he was clearly in a better mood than before. ""Thanks, man. That was great advice"", he said and smiled. 

Some more guests kept coming in during the course of the night.",A joke that is too long and doesn't have a punchline walks into a bar.,12

Johnny said, ""I’ll be fast. I’ll throw the money on the floor, you bend down, and I’ll be finished by the time you pick it up."" 

She thought for a moment and said that she would have to consult her boyfriend… So she called her boyfriend and told him the story. Her boyfriend says, ""Ask him for $200, pick up the money very fast, he won’t even be able to get his pants down."" 

So she agrees and accepts the proposal. Half an hour goes by, and the boyfriend is waiting for his girlfriend to call. Finally, after 45 minutes, the boyfriend calls and asks what happened.

She responded, ""The bastard used coins!""

But too often people with great talent go... unfulfilled. I knew this guy, he went by the name Jaques De Gatineau. Jaques was a great man. He was a thinker, a real smart guy, I guess you could say he was our hope. While I was scrambling to get out of highschool. Jaques De Gatineau, he was accepted to all the best universities and got three degrees. He was going to be the next great.
There was Peter Leroux, Wilfred Pasteur, Jerome tsonga, the three wise men of quebec. Jaques De Gatineau was to be the next. But he vanished.
So years pass, I started to travel and get around. I traveled from here to there, and to here again. So at one point in my life, I found myself at Sea World. And so I have a guy show me to where the baby dolphins are being feed, cause who doesn't like baby dolphins? And guess who I saw! None other than Jaques De Gatineau! 
So I walk up to the guy, and I say ""Jaques De Gatineau, I feel ashamed for you. You were our hope. You were to go to Canada's capital of Ottawa. We pinned all of Quebec's hopes onto YOU."" Now that's a terrible burden, to have a town's hopes pinned on him.
 So he's feeding these little baby dolphins. And I say ""I'm ashamed of you Jaques De Gatineau, you could have done so many great things."" 
And he said ""well, I think I'm serving a youthful porpoise.""",The Dolphin Joke,5

There have been a couple things added in the design:

* A complete face lift: /r/jokes has a more modern look and feel.

* Making it look like a comedy club. The bricks and glowing neon sign are examples of that. 

* Cleaner submit and comment pages as well as submission and comment views

Please note: if you find any bugs please let us know which OS and browser you are using, a screenshot would be preferred so we know exactly what you are referring to.

Right now, the below is on stuff I will be fixing and/or adding in a future update.

* More robust RES Support, including a nightmode

* Fixing that shifting logo

* More consistent color scheme/fonts

The cardiologist was there waiting for the service manager to come and take

a look at his bike when the mechanic shouted across the garage, 'Hey Doc,

want to take a look at this?' The cardiologist, a bit surprised, walked over

to where the mechanic was working on the motorcycle.

The mechanic straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag and asked, 'So Doc,

look at this engine. I opened its heart, take the valves out, repair any

damage, and then put them back in, and when I finish, it works just like

new.

So how come I make $39,700 a year and you make $1,700,000 when you and I are

doing basically the same work?'

The cardiologist paused, leaned over, and then whispered to the mechanic...

Three friends die and go to heaven. When they reach the Pearly Gates, St. Peter greets them, giving them the usual spiel that everyone gets when they're about to enter, and as they are walking in he says "" By the way, I almost forgot the new rule. Whatever you do, don't step on a duck."" The three friends think this is an odd rule, but they agree to it and step in. 

The second they enter they realize that the final rule might be harder to follow than they thought. Heaven is TEEMING with ducks! Try as they might, they quickly realize that avoiding the birds is going to be a difficult task. And then it happens, ""QUACK!"" Friends Two and Three look over in shock as Friend One steps on a duck. Quickly, an angel rushes over with one of the most unattractive people the three of them have ever seen. ""Because you stepped on a duck, you are condemned to spend the rest of your time in the Kingdom shackled to this person. Have a good eternity."" The angel shackles the two together and flies off. 

After seeing what happened to Friend One, the other two are more wary of the consequences and begin treading extremely lightly. The two of them make it another three days before, on the dawn of the fourth day, a loud ""QUACK"" is heard. Friend Two looks to Friend Three, wide-eyed, fearing the worst. The angel rushes over, ties Friend Two to a hideous being, and flies away. 

The third friend, now petrified that this will be his fate, becomes incredibly paranoid, barely walking anywhere. He lasts one week, two weeks, but on the beginning of the third week, an angel brings one of the most stunningly beautiful people the friend has ever seen, shackles the two of them together, and flies off. Bewildered and excited, Friend Three proclaims, ""Wow! What did I do to deserve this?"" And the person the friend is shackled to turns and replies ""I don't know what you did, but I stepped on a duck!""

He goes to stand up and falls flat on his face.

""That's strange. I can't have possibly had that much to drink."" He attempts to stand up a second time. Same result.

""I'll just crawl to the front door and get some fresh air. That ought to sober me up.""

The man army crawls all the way to front door, reaches for the handle, pulls himself up, and falls flat on his face out onto the sidewalk.

""This cannot be happening. I only live a couple of blocks from the bar. It looks like I'll have until then to sober up from the crawl.""

The man then makes the journey home, crawling his confused self all the way to his front door where he tries to stand up and walk inside. He falls once again just inside the doorway.

""Am I really going to have to crawl all the way upstairs into the bedroom?!""

Sure enough, he makes his way up the stairs, into the bedroom, to the foot of the bed. With one last attempt he gets to his feet, and falls into his bed for the evening.

The next morning the man is awoken by his disgruntled wife.

""I see you were out drinking all night.""

""So what's the challenge?""
""Sorry mate, that's not how it works, you have to pay to find out.""
Curious, he agrees and gives the bartender ten dollars.
The bartender pull a large bottle of pepper tequila out and places it on the counter.
""Ok, so you have to chug this entire bottle of liquor and not vomit. After that, the biggest, meanest pit bull you ever seen in your life is out back. He's got a sore tooth and you have to pull it out. Lastly, there's a ninety year old woman upstairs who has never had an orgasm. You have to make things right before she dies.""

""Well, that's why the jar has so much money in it.""

After a few hours of drinking, the man comes back to the bar really drunk and says, ""Fuck it, is my money still good for that challenge?""
The bartender informs him that it is and brings out the bottle of tequila.
The man chugs the entire bottle of tequila, and slams the bottle down with a wince on his face.
He stands up and walks out the back door. Immediately, the bar hears the dog's barking and the man yelling in pain. About thirty minutes later, it quiets down.
Everyone in the bar is wondering if they should get up and check to see if the man is ok. Right before the bartender could finish telling someone to go check, the man comes bursting in the door, barely standing, clothes ripped, and bloody as hell.

Day after day, it is the same thing. ""John, quit your job, sell the house, don't tell the wife, and fly to Vegas.""

""John, quit your job at the bank. Sell the house for no less than $200k ,take out all of the cash, don't tell Mary, and take the 11:15am flight direct to Vegas...""

Eventually, John can't handle it anymore, and he bites. He quits his job at Delaware Savings and loan. Goes under contract on the small cape cod for $285k, leaves his highschool sweetheart, Mary Jones, in the dark about it all, and sits down in seat 11A on the non-stop, 11:15am Delta flight to Las Vegas. 

When he lands, suitcase full of cash, he waits, thinking ""Now what?""

""Take an Uber from a portugese man named Alan,"" the voice says...

John pulls out his phone and, sure enough, he sees Alan's name in the Uber app. 

""Straight to the Venetian Casino"" whispers the voice in John's head. 

John gets increasingly excited on the drive to the casino. The voice keeps getting more and more intense. 

""Get chips for your cash at the third cashier. Only in black Chips."" says the voice. 

""Walk directly to the 3rd Roulette wheel. The one on the left. A one-armed Asian croupierre will be calling the table!"" the voice exclaims. 

John walks directly there and looks the woman in the eye. He glances down. ""Hello, Mai"", he says, ""I'm here to... play roulette..."" and John gives her a wink. 

""PUT ALL OF YOUR CHIPS ON 36!!!!"" Screams the voice in John's head. 

""All bets are down"" Mai, the croupier says. The ball spins. John's palms are sweaty and he rubs them on his pants, tapping his foot on the floor. 

""Double zero"" says Mai. 

""Damn. I really thought I had it that time"" said the voice. ",John arrives home from work one day to hear a voice in his head telling him to quit his job,5

Reaching into his rear pants pocket, the arrogant officer removed his badge and proudly displayed it to the rancher. ""See this fucking badge?! This badge means I am allowed to go wherever I wish.... On any land !! No questions asked or answers given!! Have I made myself clear?.... do you understand?!!""
The rancher nodded politely, apologized, and went about his chores. A short time later, the old rancher heard loud screams, looked up, and saw the DEA officer running for his life, being chased by the rancher's big Santa Gertrudis bull...... With every step the bull was gaining ground on the officer, and it seemed likely that he'd sure enough get gored before he reached safety. The officer was clearly terrified.

The problem is that Charlie also wants the cat, so we're having a contest to see who can tell the biggest lie. The winner gets to take the cat home.""

The clergyman is shocked, and launches into a long-winded sermon about the evils of lying, beginning with ""Boys, you shouldn't have a lying contest, for lying is a sin!"" and ending with, ""When I was a boy your age, I never lied!""

After he finished, the boys were silent for a moment.
