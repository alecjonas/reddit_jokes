A bus driver was just starting along his route. It was still dark and raining and the temperature hovered just above freezing.

As he approached the first stop on his route he could see some poor soul laying on the bench. He stopped the bus, opened the doors and called out to the soaking wet person laying there.

""Hey, buddy!"" The guy sat up and looked as wet and cold as he was drunk. ""Hey fella, get outta the rain and on the bus.""

""I can't"", mumbled the drunk, ""I don't haff any money.""

""Nevermind that, get on the bus"", said the driver kindly. So the drunk staggers up the steps and plonks down in the seat across from the driver. He looked so bedraggled and sad that the driver wanted to make him feel at least a little bit happier.

So he says to the drunk, ""Hey, buddy, hey watch this!""

He stops the bus and a sour-looking older woman gets on, shaking her umbrella. She deposits her fare, and as she goes past the driver, he says, ""Tickle your c#nt with a feather?""

The woman wheels around, ""What did you say?!!""

The driver answers, ""Typical country weather....Don't you agree?""

The woman is red-faced and embarrassed at what she thought she heard and mumbles yes, she agrees and sits herself well down the back.

The drunk is smiling a bit, so the driver knows its having a positive effect. ""Watch this one"", he says.

Sure enough, at the next stop another woman gets on. She looks like she's never cracked a smile in her life. As she drops in her fare and starts to move past the driver, he mumbles, ""Tickle your snatch with a feather?""

The woman gasps and says,""I beg your pardon?!!""

To which the driver answers, ""I said typical nasty weather.""

The woman is completely shaken and apologises and agrees, yes the weather is atrocious. Then hurries to her seat.

Now the drunk is chuckling quite freely.

The driver leans over and says to the drunk, ""Why don't you do the next one?""

The drunk shakes his head, ""No, I'm too dr-dr-drunk."" ""Nah"", says the driver, ""you do this one.""

So as the bus stops, the drunk pulls himself up straight in the seat, smooths his clothes out and stares straight ahead. His face is a study in concentration. As the lady pays her fare and begins to pass by the drunk, he says in a clear, strong voice, ""SCRATCH YER C#NT WITH A STICK?""

The woman, absolutely shocked, turns to the drunk and says, ""WHAT did you say to me?!!""

""F#ckin' cold, eh?!""",The Drunk &amp; the Bus Driver,7

There to greet them is none other than Satan, who tells them a secret method to getting into Heaven: Each man must spend 1,000 years in a room with their greatest vice. If he does so, he will be allowed to enter Heaven. The catch? At the end of the 1,000 year period, if the man asks to be let out of the room, he instead will be trapped inside forever.

The first man, being a lifelong alcoholic, is presented with a room identical to his favorite drinking spot. Some of his old drinking buddies are present, along with infinitely replenishing spirits of all kinds! The first man is ecstatic and, thinking it will be an easy feat, runs inside and slams the door behind him.

The second man, known for being quite the pervert, immediately feels his blood start pumping as the second door is opened. Inside are women of every shape, size, color, you name it. Every woman this man has ever fantasized about is here, ready to obey his every command. Without a word the second man rushes inside, closing the door behind him.

Now the third man, having been a cannabis connoisseur for most of his life, stands in awe of the marvel before him. Inside his room is a forest containing every strand of marijuana conceivable; the shrubs are the most beautiful green hues, ebitting the stickiest of smells; the ground is littered with the highest quality nuggs, the dirt is hash rocks and kief, and the trees are actually twenty foot tall plants. The stoner can't wait to get eternally stoned and happily jaunts inside his room.

1,000 years pass...

Satan, being a man of his word, decides to check on each of the men. He opens the door to the first man's room, only to find the most disgusting mess he had ever seen: blood, booze, and bodily fluids create a disgusting miasma throughout the room. Broken glass litters the floor, and the man's once-friends lie dead in various states of decay. After searching for a while, Satan happens upon the man, shrivelled up and nestled in a pile of bottles, crying and bleeding profusely. The man's wracking sobs stop as his trembling lips work to form a sentence: ""P-please... Get m-me out of here...""
Satan, a man of his word, reminds the man of the condition upon which he was imprisoned, and having broken his end of the bargain, the man is trapped inside eternally.

""The second man must have done better than that one"", Satan thinks to himself while opening the second door. Moments later, hundreds upon thousands of people come flooding out, men, women, children of all creeds, along with the scents of human waste and burnt flesh. Eventually Satan sees the man he locked in here riding the wave of people. ""Get me out of here!"" The man screams, and Satan seals the door forever.

The third door is all that remains now; as Satan opens it, he sees the stoner meditating in the center of the forest, surrounded by a pool of tears. The forest had been untouched for the full thousand years. Satan is understandably quite confused! The stoner opens his eyes in disbelief and runs over to Satan, and shaking him by the collar he says: ""Do you have a lighter, man?!""","Just beyond the Gates of Hell, an alcoholic, a womanizer, and a stoner find themselves standing in front of three identical doors.",222

Whistling a light ditty, he slipped his computer out of his bag and opened up his email. In his cheerful bliss, the man accidentally misspelled his wife's address, and his note was directed instead to an elderly preacher's wife whose husband had passed away just the day before.

When the grieving widow checked her email the next day, she took one look at the monitor, let out a piercing scream, and fell to the floor in a dead faint.

At the sound, her family rushed into the room and saw this note on the screen:

The day of the competition rolls around, and each of the Anglers take it in turns. The first man is a big beefy lad, and he catches 5 fish.

The second is a woman in her 30s, typical american heroine- plaid jacket, shotgun in the 'Trunk' (imitation of course but she  brags that its real) and platinum blonde hair. She manages to catch 17 fish, and it looks like the competition is already over.

Finally, Alan is up. As usual, he only catches 15 fish, which is still good for him. He walks past his competitors, beaming.

""Why are you so happy?"" They ask him.

""My wife is up next, and she's sure to win!""

The other competitors laugh, they've seen his wife. Shes in her 50s, tight permed hair and with a little apron, the pinnacle of domesticity, looking like she's never fished in her life.

To their surprise, she catches 250 fish! The competition is called off due to concerns for local wildlife, and everyone is clamouring around Alan and his wife.

A reporter from the local paper wants to do a story on the amazing event and says ""who are you amazing Anglers?""

The population of this country is 237 million.   
 

104 million are retired. That leaves 133 million to do the work.   
 

There are 85 million in school, which leaves 48 million to do the work. Of this there are 29 million employed by the federal government, leaving 19 million to do the work.   
 

2.8 million are in the Armed Forces, which leaves 16.2 million to do the work.   
 

Take from the total the 14,800,000 people who work for State and City Government and that leaves 1.4 million to do the work.   
 

At any given time there are 188,000 people in hospitals, leaving 1,212,000 to do the work.   
 

Now, there are 1,211,998 people in prisons. That leaves just two people to do the work. You and me.

&amp;#x200B;

So there was this billionare, very sucessful enterpreneur, that decided to invest a large chunk of his funds in a new business: The Husband Shop

The Husband Shop is a 6-floor building, each containing an assortment of husbands bearing more or less the same characteristics, however the next floor has a costier but better selection.

So, this Lady goes to visit the shop and she sees this at the first floor: ""At The Husband Shop we strive to present to you the very best in man. This Floor has 100% loyal men"".

Quite pleased with what she sees, she goes to the next one and it says: ""This Floor 100% loyal men and they are very handsome!"".

She investigates further, and on the third floor she sees: ""This floor has 100% loyal men, and they are handsome and romantic!""

On the fourth floor she finds: ""This floor has 100% loyal men, which are also very handsome, romantic and great with kids!""

The fifth floor had the following: ""This floor has 100% loyal men, all of them are very handsome, romantic, great with kids and they'll rock your world in the bed every time!""

She was absolutely amazed by what they had put together, and she knew they had the best for last, so she found this:

&amp;#x200B;

""Congratulations! You are the 4,986,221st visitor this year! Sorry, there are no husbands in this floor. We regret to inform we abandoned ""The Husband Shop"" development as we realized women were nearly impossible to please"".

&amp;#x200B;

In order to appeal to both genders (and alleviate the uproar of sexism accusations), the billionare made ""The Wife Shop"", and they put a lot more effort this time around.

Since the other business became so famous because of the unusual service, a reporter did some digging, and he came back with this:

""Upon arriving 'The Wife Shop', or TWS, the costumer is immediatly greeted by an employee that will explain the concept of the business and will acompany Him or Her through the floors, in the same method they used on The Husband Shop.

The First Floor says: Welcome to The Wife Shop! We keep our promise to strive for excellency, but this time it's all about finding you your perfect wife! This floor has the most gourgeous women you'll ever find.

The second floor says: ""This floor has absolutely gorgeous women and they are all incredible in the bedroom.

The 4 remaining floors are yet to be visited"".",A long time ago I read this joke I found so good I wrote it down. I found this note today,586

The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy prosperous people. The second kingdom is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power too, and the third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.

The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have.  The first kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire.  The second kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own.  The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.

The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and make merry, partying into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and also drink late into the night.

In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.

The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up.

In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night, but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.

And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",Once upon a time...,40

""Well we've got three shipments that all need taken up north to Pepper’s Corner Market,"" says Flower, ""Asparagus, Brussels sprouts, and Artichokes.""

""I'll take the Artichokes!"" Tom says as he walks in the room, late as usual, happily walking past the other two. The Artichokes would be the heaviest so he would get paid slightly more for the same trip. 

Brock and Ollie often argued over the produce and then Tom would hear his cue, come bursting through the door, and take the best choice.

Brock and Ollie sigh in unison, they were hoping he wouldn’t turn up.  

""Fine I'll take the sprouts,"" Ollie concedes and they all head off.

""Man, that Tom Gordon is the worst human being,"" Brock says over the radio to Ollie. 

""I know,"" Ollie agrees, “he always takes the good shipment. Wish he’d let us have it for once.”

“I’m thinking of getting a new truck here pretty soon,” Brock said, “Probably get a heavier one so I can haul more.  This one’s in good shape, figure I can sell her easy enough.”

“Definitely won’t be able to keep up with me then,” Ollie challenges his friend, “not that you can now.”

“Hey I don’t care, it runs fine just doesn’t have much room,” Brock answers, “plus I bet I can beat you as it is.”

They drive for about an hour before Ollie gets a call from Ava. 

“Well Brock,” Ollie radios to his friend, “I guess I won’t beat you this time.  I just got a call from Mrs. Kahto and she wants me to go give Tom a tow.  Guess he’s stuck on the side of the road somewhere.”

“Leave him there,” Brock says impatiently. 

“I wish I could. Why am I the one that has to get him?”

Ollie pulls up behind Tom and gets out to find him standing near his back right tire.  

“Got a flat huh?” Ollie asks him seeing the tire squashed against the ground.

“Yeah,” says Tom, “Thanks for coming to get me. Damn thing always leaks.”  

“Well you know, that’s what you get for always taking the heavy shipments,” Ollie says nicely enough.

Tom looks at his flat tire regretfully.

The only thing that was missing was a good quarterback. He had scouted all the colleges and even the Canadian and European Leagues, but he couldn't find a ringer who could ensure a Super Bowl win.
 
Then, one night while watching Fox News he saw a war-zone scene in the West Bank. In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Israeli soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand-grenade straight into a 15th story window 100 yards away. 

KABOOM!
 
He threw another hand-grenade 75 yards away, right into a chimney. 

KA-BLOOEY!
 
Then he threw another at a passing car going 90 mph. 

BULLS-EYE!
 
""I've got to get this guy!"", the Coach said. “He has the perfect arm!""
 
So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football. And the Bears go on to win the Super Bowl.
 
The young man is hailed as the great hero of football, and when the coach asks him what he wants, all the young man wants is to call his mother.
 
""Mom,"" he says into the phone, ""I just won the Super Bowl!""
 
""I don't want to talk to you,” the old woman says."" You are not my son!""
 
""I don't think you understand, Mother,"" the young man pleads. ""I've won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans.""
 
""No! Let me tell you!"" his mother retorts. ""At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and I have to keep your sister in the house so she doesn't get raped!""

My grandfather and the rest of his section would rush out with their green paint and pour it over the side of the ship. Then, when the U-boat commander would raise the periscope to see what kind of ship had driven over them, he would only get a film of green paint on his lens.

""We have Five floors ...... go up floor by floor and once you find what you're looking for you can stay there, it's easy to decide since each floor has a sign telling you what's inside"".

**First floor**, the sign reads ""All men here are horrible lovers, but they are sensitive and kind"". ....... the friends laugh, and without hesitation they move to the next floor.

**Second floor**, the sign reads ""All the men here are wonderful lovers, but they generally treat their women badly"". ...  clearly this wasn't going to do, so they move to the third floor.

**Third Floor**, the sign reads ""All the men here are great lovers and sensitive to their women"" ........ this was good, but there was two more floors, so on they went.

**Fourth Floor**, the sign was perfect it reads ""All the men have perfect builds, are sensitive and attentive to their women, are perfect lovers are also single, rich and straight"".

The Women seemed pleased but they decided that they would rather see what was on the fifth floor before they settle on the fourth.

*When they reached the Fifth Floor, there is a sign that reads ""There are no men here, this floor was only built to prove that there is no way to please a woman""*",Women Only,9

The first nun was quite impressed and asked where she could get some of these condoms. The second nun said, ""You get them at the drug store, Sister, just go and ask the pharmacist for them."" 

The next day the good sister went to the drug store and walked up to the counter.
""Good morning sister,"" said the pharmacist. ""What can I do for you today?""
""I'd like some condoms please"" said the nun. The pharmacist was a little taken aback, but recovered soon enough and asked, ""How many boxes would you like -- there are 12 to a box."" ""I'll take six boxes that should last about a week"" said the nun.

The pharmacist was truly flabbergasted by this 
time, and was almost afraid to ask any more questions, but his professionalism prevailed and he asked in a clear voice, ""Sister, what size condoms would you like-we have large, extra large, and big liar size.""

All was well for a month or two, but Sam was getting very sexually frustrated. He asked another crew member what they did when they were so horny, and the guy gestures to the camels that were kept nearby, and said that’s what the camels were for. My friend was horrified and would not listen to the other crew member describe just how the camels were used. Another few weeks went by, and Sam began really looking at the camels. Most were smelly and huge, but there was one smaller female that caught his eye. She seemed cleaner, very docile, and had these long eyelashes, with a bit of a coquettish look to her face. Another couple of weeks, and Sam found himself spending quite a bit of his off time grooming and, well, fondling this sweet girl. One night the pent up frustration and easy availability of the camels finally convinced him it would not only be ok, but could actually be a beautiful, mind blowing experience. He brought a short ladder, and led the lovely young lady away from the pack, whispered to her was gonna treat her right, and set up his ladder. But as he began his foreplay, just a little tease with his fingers and hand, she bit, kicked, stomped on him and ran off. When the other guys heard the ruckus, they came running to find my friend, heart broken, bleeding and in shock at the rejection.  He asked the crew what he did wrong, and they said, “well, when we get frustrated, we usually just ride the camels to town.”",So my friend Sam got a job with a large oil company to work in oil fields in the Middle East.,8

On their last day in the woods, the men decide to go for a little walk. Suddenly, they hear someone whimper. They follow the noise to a well and with combined efforts, they rescue a little fairy from its ground.

‚Thank you very much, you saved my life! As a reward, I‘ll grant each of you kind men a wish. Since I am no ordinary fairy but the douchebag fairy, the wishes will come with some twist though: You can‘t tell anybody what you wished for until one year has passed or you‘ll die. Also, your wives will get double the amount you‘ve wished for. Go on, think about your wishes and they will come true tomorrow!‘

With a big poof the fairy is gone. Slightly shocked and irritated by this strange encounter, the businessmen decide to go home early and meet again a year from now.

Time passes and a year later the men meet again: Two of them wear old, shabby rags while the third is covered in expensive designer clothes. The latter asks: ‚Holy mother, what has happened to you two?‘

,Well, I wished for a big yacht and my wife got a yacht twice as big. There, she was host of a ton of parties. During one of them, she met her new partner, a divorce attorney. Together, they bled me dry. I had to sell everything I ever owned.‘

The other one replies: ‚I‘ve wished for a million dollars. With her money, my wife decided to follow advices on r/wallstreetbets. It took all my money to pay her debts. Then, she left me because I was poor. But now, you tell us what you‘ve wished for. You look great!‘

The bartender says, ""Sure, I'll take a bet. What's your action?""

The man offers a $50 bet that he can bite his own eyeball. The bartender, thinking it's easy money, accepts his bet, and is shocked when the man removes his glass eye and bites down on it.

Laughing, the man sees that the bartender is upset about losing his money, so he offers him a chance to win it back. ""Double or nothin' says I can bite my other eye.""

The bartender thinks it over. He knows he was just tricked out of $50 but he also knows that this man can't possibly have two glass eyes, so he pulls another $50 from the register and accepts the man's bet.

The man promptly takes out his false teeth and gently closes them around his other eye.

Now the bartender is visibly angry to have been had for $100, and the man's laughter isn't helping. Just before he throws him out of his bar, the man puts his hand up.

""Real sorry about that, pal. I get people with that bit all the time, but you've been a good sport, so I'll give you another chance to win some cash. I've got... $500 that says if you slide a shot glass down the bar top, I can run alongside of it and piss into the glass without missing a drop. This is kinda hard for me to do, though, so I think it's fair if you give me two chances at it.""

The bartender, eager to win his money back from the man, thinks to himself and realizes just how hard it would be for this man to piss into a shot glass while running at full speed. Especially knowing he only has one eye to line up his shot. After a minute of deliberation, he willingly accepts the bet.

The man drops his pants to his ankles and when the bartender puts the shot glass down on the counter, shouts a resounding, ""Go!"" prompting the bartender to slide it along the bar top.

The man chases after it, holding his dick at an angle to properly aim it. However, pissing while running at full speed isn't easy, so he only manages to get a couple of drops in the glass by the time it reaches the other end.

Catching his breath, the man reminds the bartender he has a second try, and that the first was simply to get his bearings straight. Once again, he shouts, ""Go!"" giving the bartender his cue to send the shot glass back down the bar.
Once again, the man chases wildly after it, spraying piss all over the bar top, stools, floor, and even hitting some of the bottles of liquor behind the bar. However, not one drop of urine found it's way into the shot glass.
Head hanging low, he hands the bartender $500, to which the bartender gleefully accepted, jumping up and down in joy and cheering in victory at the cash he had just made.

All of a sudden, a man in the back of the bar slams his fist hard against his table and screams ""Fuck!"" at the top of his lungs.

The bartender mutters aloud, ""I wonder what his problem is.""

To which the man replies, ""Oh, I just bet that guy $10,000 that I could piss all over your bar and you'd be so happy about it you jumped up and down with joy.""",A man walks into a bar...,96
