She humbly and politely replies that she would like an audience with the Holy Mother Mary, if this were possible.

Peter agrees on the spot and escorts her personally to
a little door. He knocks softly. There's a murmured reply from within. He opens the door and indicates to his guest to enter.

Within, sitting in a plain chair, is a middle-aged woman in the garb of the first century, engrossed in her knitting. The nun sits reverently for some time at Mary's feet and finally gestures so as to ask a question.

Mary looks up from her knitting and indicates it's OK
to ask questions.

""Reverend Mother, please tell me, you were chosen from
all women to be the Mother of G-d, you -- a simple woman, I know -- but if you could, please, just give me an inkling of what it felt like when IT happened, when Jesus was born?""

So I'm sitting at my desk, I do security for a living, and was asked to go remove a stuffed bunny someone had left on the company sign outside. So I stand up, I go to do so, and I come back with a new toy to keep in my car cause I drive a white van (that part actually isn't true, it's a black Impala).   


Sitting down, I get curious as to where this bunny came from, because it wasn't there the day before. So I begin to back up the security cameras. I spend a few hours, browsing through hours upon hours of footage to track where this damn bunny came from.   


The poor thing was left on the sign by my boss, who found it on the ground by his car, which got transported there by several vehicles who have dragged it into the parking lot from the nearby road leading in, and it got there from being kicked around by passing vehicles all day, after having dropped out of a dump truck not 48 hours prior to it now sitting on my desk. This poor bunny had been kicked, dragged, beaten, worn down, and still seemed to be in fairly decent shape. This bunny, who has gone through Hell in his traveling around came out with a metaphorical smile.

So the devil takes the man to the entrance of the first kingdom and opens the door.

""I definitely don't want to spend eternity standing on my head. Please show me the next kingdom.""

This kingdom turns out to be essentially the same, but instead everyone is standing on their heads on a concrete floor. ""This is even worse than the first one!"" the man says. ""I'm definitely going to pass. Please show me the third kingdom now.""

The politician replies that of course he wants to go to heaven. The spirit tells him that before he chooses, he has to visit both places so each one will get a fair chance.

First they visit heaven. It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if a bit underwhelmed.

Hell, on the other hand, is magnificent. It’s the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has a buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, a beautiful garden, a pool with a water slide, a dance floor, a massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison.

“I can’t believe I’m saying this,” says the politician, “but I think I’d rather go to hell!” 

“Very well,” says the spirit. “Turn around.”

When the politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than a minute ago. All of the attractions are gone, everything is on fire, and the people are screaming in agony.

“I don’t understand!” cries the politician. “This isn’t what you showed me before!”

“Well, that was the campaign,” replies the spirit. “Now you’ve voted.”

But what is that! That smell! Rugelach! Is it a hallucination? Strengthened by the smell of his wife’s cooking, he put a foot down onto the floor. And then another. He stood up and took a step. Then down the stairs carefully toward the kitchen, the source of the smell.

There was Sheila in her well-worn apron pulling a sheet pan of rugelach out of the oven. There were two more already on the counter and other pastries too.

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""",Once upon a time there lived a young monk named Sam,28

Jamal had 3 tiers of camels for $200, $500 and $1000.

""The length of time the camel can go without stopping for water,"" replied Jamal. ""For example a $1000 camel can go a week without a drink.""

Furious, the American returned to Jamal's to complain about the performance of his dromedary.

""Did you brick him?"" asked Jamal. 

""Brick him?"" replied the now puzzled American. 

At that point Jamal took the camel to a water trough.  While the camel was drinking Jamal took 2 bricks and smashed the camel's testicles between them.

The day of the race finally arrived, and Sam slowly pushed his vehicle up to the starting line with all the other forest critters. Everyone was laughing so hard at him, saying there was no way he could compete with the others. Determined, Sam got in his vehicle and waited for the start.

A bird flying overhead called out the countdown. ""Three... Two... One! GO!""

POOF! In a cloud of smoke, Sam had burst ahead and was already yards in front of everyone else.

The Americans at the time knew they couldn't let the dog go, there's no telling what Hitler could have done to the dog before he died. So they came up with an ultimatum. ""We will scan the dog, and should we find anything suspicious inside, the dog will be killed and you lot will be thrown in jail!"" The family, with their hands tied, were forced to agree.

An esteemed American general accompanied the mission to scan the inside of the dog. After several minutes, they concluded nothing of suspicious content could be found. The general, frustrated, exclaimed, ""Ah, NUTS!""

Hunter practiced for 3 months and returned with better skills. Lion heard about his return and was again ready. Hunter spotted the lion drinking water  but shot missed lion's right ear by a whisker. Hunter was again ass-fucked by lion in front of villagers.

Humiliated hunter felt suicidal. He lifted himself up and vowed to return again. Hunter went to his master to practice. After 6 months of rigorous training and incessant practice hunter returned.

Once upon a time, on the tropical island of Adiaster, a primitive tribe lived in a village of grass huts. There were no rival tribes on the island, no natural disasters to speak of, and no huge monsters that might emerge from the jungle in a primal rage to destroy the village. In general, life was good.

And life was about to get better! For on this particular day, a new king was ascending to the throne. Before his succession to the throne, the king had been a notorious party animal; he threw parties almost every day, and villagers flocked to his hut to participate. Ever the life of the party, the king had always been gracious host, and when his succession became imminent, villagers rejoiced at the prospect of such an amiable king.

But no kingdom is perfect, and this kingdom;s problem was classism (a problem many other kingdoms have had as well). Within this tribe, the hunters were at the top of the social hierarchy. They garnered glory and respect from their daring hunts, and were generally seen as the coolest kids on the block. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the builders and engineers of the tribe were considered the lowest class. They were often referred to as ""*nerds""* , an ancient Adiasterese term meaning ""those who bury their nose in books and diagrams all night long and have got no game"" (Adiasterese etymology is quite fascinating). As such, builders and engineers were often excluded from the kingdom's social events.

The king knew this. In fact, he had perpetuated this classism even before ascending to the throne. Even though he had never purposefully excluded engineers from his parties back in the day, nearly every attendant had been a hunter, creating an environment that would have made engineers feel incredibly uncomfortable if they showed up. The king resolved to bridge this gap between the classes of his tribe, and to do this, he promised to throw a lavish party on his coronation day. This was going to be a party for the ages: it was to be held in the palace, it was to last all night long, and everyone was invited.

This presented a problem, however. Although the palace was larger than any other hut in the village, it still wasn't large enough to hold everyone. The king decided to prepare for this by instructing his engineers to build a second floor to the palace, so that the entire tribe could party in his new house.

The head engineer was slightly nervous about the structural integrity of a hut with two stories, and he voiced those concerns to his future king. The king would not have it. ""This must be the party of a lifetime!"" he declared. ""This will bring our tribe closer together and usher in a new age of equality between hunters and engineers. You shall be in attendance as my guest of honor! You MUST build a second floor!"" When the head engineer remained uncertain, the king leaned into his head engineer's ear and whispered ""I heard there'd be *girls* at this party, too,"" and eventually the head engineer relented. The second floor to the palace was built.

This new palace was the talk of the town! Everyone thought it was the most impressive hut they had ever seen. But the king, though he would never admit it to anyone, was nervous about his coronation party. If the party wasn't *poppin'*(meaning ""a happy time for everyone involved"", usually associated with a public event that anyone can enter, as opposed to ""*lit""*, which usually carries the connotation of a more private event), it could fracture his kingdom for generations. To improve his chances of a *poppin'* party, the king called the head engineer into his chambers the night before the party and demanded that a disco ball be installed in the ceiling of the first floor.

The head engineer was flabbergasted. Not only was this incredibly short notice, but a heavy object putting pressure on the center of the building could result in the entire house collapsing. He argued with the king for hours, but the king remained undeterred. The next morning, mere minutes before the coronation began, the final touches on the disco ball were finished. The coronation itself went off without a hitch, the king was carried into his palace on his throne, and as the sun set, it was time to party.

The king had scheduled the party to begin as soon as night fell, and as soon as the sun had dipped below the horizon, the palace was flooded with people (which was highly unusual; In Adiasterese culture, it is customary to arrive to a party 45-60 minutes after the scheduled starting time). All the king's worries about his party faded immediately upon seeing the eager crowd; throngs of hunters, healers, fishermen, and even engineers had filed into his palace and having the time of their lives. Eventually, the head engineer arrived, and true to his word, the king loudly announced his guest of honor to a rowdy cheer. As the night wore on, the tribe seemed to grow closer. Hunters and engineers laughed together, drank together, and even played *pong* together (a traditional Adiasterese game in which small rocks are thrown at jugs of fermented fruit). Everything was going according to plan.

In the middle of the night, as the party continued, the king noticed that many of the partygoers had spilled drinks all over his throne. Ordinarily, this would have resulted in capital punishment; the throne had been passed down through generations of royalty and was sacred to the inhabitants of the village. But the king knew that now was not the time for punishment. It was a party! Getting all serious and traditional now could ruin the unity that he had worked so hard to foster. In order to save his throne from more desecration, he ordered several hunters to carry it upstairs, where no drinks were being served.

The head engineer, upon seeing this, yelled at the king to stop. He knew that if an object as heavy as the royal throne was brought onto the second floor of the house, the whole building would collapse. Unfortunately, the king was enjoying the party too much to be concerned with the head engineer's worries. ""Oh come on!"" he roared, ""enjoy the party! You've done enough worrying for a lifetime. Have some fun!""

But the king should have heeded his engineer's warning. For at that moment, as the throne was placed on the second floor, the hut collapsed. The party dissolved as the surviving tribespeople fled the scene. When the king came to, nearly half of his tribe had died, including his head engineer.

\~

Ten years later, the king still ruled his tribe. He still threw parties every day, in his rebuilt palace, and as always everyone was invited. But he still remembered that day that he lost half his tribe and one of his closest friends. To anyone who would listen, he would repeat the valuable lessons he learned that day:

Little Johnny bursts out laughing because he realizes the urinal is talking to him. He proceeds to take a piss in that urinal, to which it replies, ""mmm, thanks kid."" 
The voice sounds as if someone was actually there drinking it, so finding this funny, Johnny returns every day to this urinal. After referencing it in class one day, his friends look at him as if he's insane, saying not to know what he's talking about.
""Yeah, it even knows my name now,"" Johnny explains. That night, he goes to his parents who also look at him like he's crazy when he tells them, but also concerned. They muster a laugh though and his mom gives him a bottle filled with a clear liquid.
""Here,"" she says, handing him the bottle, ""give this water to the urinal, it's probably dehydrated with all that salty piss. Just make sure only the urinal gets it.""
So the next day, Johnny says to the urinal, ""here, have some water,"" and pours it down.
The urinal starts choking and says ""WHAT THE FUCK JOHNNY,"" and seems to go unconscious with a load thud.
When Johnny's parents talk him the next morning, he tells them that the water knocked the urinal out. Scared out of her mind, the mom says, ""Johnny, that was poison I gave you!!! . . . You're an hour late to school already, why?""
Johnny, still surprised about the whole urinal thing, tells her, ""For some reason the bus driver didn't pick anyone up today.""

Cleveland Browns football practice was delayed nearly two hours today after a player reported finding an unknown white powdery substance on the practice field.

Coach Hue Jackson immediately suspended practice while police and federal investigators were called to investigate.

After a complete analysis, FBI forensic experts determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line.

Practice was resumed after special agents decided the team was unlikely to encounter the substance again.

The village lived mostly self-sufficiently with farmers specializing in crops and trading with other farmers for goods and services. Jack, a humble sugar cane farmer, lived in this village when something horrible happened one night.

One morning, Old Man Richards woke to find half his cows slaughtered and eaten. Amid the corpses and bones were large, monstrous foot prints leading from Old Man Richards cows and into the forest. Word quickly spread of the butchering as Old Man Richards lived in the middle of the village and everyone who went about to trade that day had to pass by. 

That night, a horrible sound came from the chicken coups on Farmer Hopkins land. The same large foot prints from the previous night could be seen coming from the forest, passed Old Man Richards cows and into Farmer Hopkins coups. The village could not deny that something was terrorizing them and by mid day, every man woman and child had gathered in the center of the village near where the cows and chickens had been taken.

The villagers came to call the creature the ""Midicrin"" after it's propensity to strike lands in the middle of the village. They deduced that the Midicrin would strike one of three places next, Miss Angie's prize loons, for which the village had become renowned for during the few times it traded with other townships, a blackberry patch owned by Ernest Eford who was somehow older than Old Man Richards, or Jack's sugar cane farm.  

Jack sat awake all night keeping an eye on the distant forest tree line and his sugar cane fields. After what seemed like an entire day's worth of time, a strange soft pounding sound startled Jack. A terrible creature as tall as the tallest building in the village with legs as long as Jack's entire body came lumbering toward him. Paralyzed with fear, Jack watched as the Midicrin stalked forward with a ghostly silence and grabbed a mouthful of sugar cane. As the beast continued his eating, Jack watched the monster suddenly lurch and hurl up his nightly meal. The beast fell for a moment before slowly getting back up and stalking back toward the forest. 

Jack called the meeting later that day to tell of his encounter that night. Everyone became loud with cheers when Jack told of how the beast fell ill after consuming the cane. Then, Jack told the town of his idea. Surly after not eating it's usual meal the previous night, the Midicrin would be hungrier than usual. Jack postured that if they fed Miss Angie's loons with the sugar cane, the beast would inadvertently fall sick again and the entire village, hidden in waiting, could come out at once and strike the beast. 

Jack gathered as much sugar cane as he could afford to lose and brought them next door to Miss Angie's birds. After setting the trap, the village waited for night to fall and the creature to return. Sure enough, the Midicrin came back, past Old Man Richards' cows, past Farmer Hopkin's chickens, and of course past Jack's poisonous sugar cane. The Midcrin came to Miss Angies birds and began to feed ravenously. It was only after a short time that it stopped, hurled out what it had eaten, and fell backward. The entire village, charging with pitchforks and lit torched, began to berate the Midicrin until it had spilled enough blood to surely be dead. 

The moral of the story, as Jack explained, was that a loon full of sugar helps the Midicrin go down. ",The Story of Jack the Sugar Cane farmer,18

So, he's watching a heavy metal music video, and the guitarist plays an amazing solo. The horse says ""that looks amazing, I want to do that!""

The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""",A horse is sitting at home watching MTV....,0

When I got there, I could see some fingers holding onto the edge of the building. The man having an affair with my wife was hiding. So i stamped on his hands to make him fall. He fell but landed in a bush. I wanted to kill him so i pushed our fridge over the edge to crush him. As i pushed it off, I slipped and fell to my death.""

The leader is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh -- everyone is disheartened - the blonde starts crying and the 60,000 girls begin to yell and wave their hands shouting, ""GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE! GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE!""

The leader, unsure whether or not he is doing more harm than good, eventually says, ""Ok! Ok! Just one more chance -- What is 2 plus 2?""

The girl closes her eyes, and after a whole minute eventually says, ""Four?""

""Yes!"" The Labrador replies.
After recovering from the shock of hearing the dog talk, he man asks, ""So, tell me your story!""
The Labrador looks up and says, ""Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the SAS.
""In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one imagined that a dog would be eavesdropping.
I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years, But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at Heathrow to do some undercover security work, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded several medals. I got married, had a few puppies, and now I've just retired!""
The man is amazed. He goes back into the house and asks the owner how much he wants for the dog.
""Ten quid!"" The owner says.
""£10? But this dog is absolutely amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheaply?""
""Because he's a lying cunt. He's never been out of the garden!""",A man sees a sign outside a house: 'Talking Dog For Sale'....,763

It would take the man almost 2 months to reach him. He set out on his journey, after a lot of travelling, he finally reached the place. The saint lived in a cave and never went out of the woods. The man reached the cave, and the saint was meditating there. The man approached him, the saint opened his eyes and asked, ""Tell me child, have you come here to seek my help?"" The man replied with a yes. the saint offered him some tea, and the man agreed. It was the best tea he had ever had, it was obvious by his expression too, the saint said that he used fresh tea leaves and natural sugar to make it. After they were done, the saint asked the man about his problems, and he replied with, ""My dick is unnaturally big, almost 25 inches and it gives a lot of problems, I've tried everything doctors recommended, but had no results. Please help me!"" The saint said, ""It'll take you 3 days of travel from here, where you'll find a pond that glows in bright golden colours, there you'll find a talking frog, just tell her that you want to marry her. When you so she will reply with a No, and when she does, your dick will come down by 5 inches."" The man wasn't ready to believe it, but he thought of giving it a shot because he had come too far. The saint gave him a map to reach the place, and some tea leaves as a gift. When he reached the pond, he did really find a talking frog. She said, ""What do you want?"" the man replied with, ""Will you marry me?"" and he got denied, and magically, his dick shrunk. He asked her again and got denied. 15 Inches still felt big, so he asked her again, ""will you marry me?"" The frog got angry and replied, ""How many times do I have to tell you? NO! NO!

There are people who spend their whole day throwing lines out.  They just move from line to line, throwing it out and moving on.  Then there are other people who keep their eyes on a bunch of lines, and when a fish tugs on one, they run over and jerk the line to hook the fish. All day, just hooking fish after fish.

""That seems like it would be tedious.  How do you decide which job you want?  Do you just end up doing whatever you started with until you quit?""

""Well, no.  Everyone starts by hooking the fish.  Not many people really like that job, so everyone has to start there.  After you've been at it for a while, if a position opens up somewhere else, you can spend a few days trying out casting or reeling.  The jobs that pay the best, the ones that everybody wants, are baiting and gutting the fish.  Gutting isn't pleasant, but the pay is good and you can work indoors.""

Well, what you probably don't realize is that you have to earn your position.  Newbies and people who aren't good at their job start out here on the street.  If you're good enough, though, you can earn a spot working on the pier, where they get twice as many fish.  And if you're a master of your specialty, you can get a place out there at the very end.

As he approaches the ball he notices a small frog right next to the spot where his ball landed. Not wanting to hit the frog, he bends down and moves the frog onto a rock nearby. As he sets up his 8 iron shot, he hears the frog croak 'ribbit 9 iron'. Strange, he thought but what the heck. He pulls out his 9 iron and hits a perfect shot onto the green, 2 feet from the pin. With a smile he turns to the frog and said 'you must be my lucky charm'. The frog hops onto his cart and proceeds to tell him the exact perfect club for each shot that day and the man ends up shooting the round of his life.

Following the round of golf the man takes the frog home, beer in hand, the man smiled at the frog and said 'you must be my lucky charm'!  You gave me the greatest golf round I've ever played, is there anything I can do for you?' The frog looked the man in the eyes and said 'Ribbit, kiss me'. After a wince, the man thinks what the heck and picks the frog up and gives it a kiss. Like magic, the frog suddenly turned into a beautiful, blond, naked...19 year old girl.

...and I swear, your honor, that's exactly how she ended up in my room or my name isn't Donal J Trump!

""Sir, do you know how fast you were going? Let me see your license""

The man responded ""Officer, I don't have a license""

""What?? Where is the paperwork for this van?""

""I don't have any paperwork, this is a stolen van. I was making a drug run when you stopped me.""

The officer immediately pulled the man out of the van, handcuffed him, and put him in the back of his police car before calling for backup.

10 minutes later, there were several police cars on the scene, including the officers supervisor and a drug sniffing dog.

The supervisor pulled the man out of the back of the police car to interview him.

""So let me get this straight, you don't have a drivers license or paperwork for this van?"" 

""Of course I do. My license is in my wallet in my back pocket. The paperwork for the van is in the glove compartment."" 

The supervisor, confused, sees that everything is in order just as the man said, and also discovers at that point that there are absolutely no drugs in the van.

""The officer that pulled you over said you had no license, no paperwork, and you were driving a stolen van full of drugs. What's going on here?""

The man, feigning surprise, looked at the supervisor and said,

They like putting on warpaint, doing war dances, shouting out war chants, and other pre-battle rituals.  One of their favored methods to declare war on a planet is to take some of the local flora and fauna of a world and violate those living things in front of the world's leaders.  This acts as a metaphor to symbolize that their whole world will soon be similarly violated.

One day these aliens come to Earth.  Identifying America as the nation with the most powerful military, the aliens touch down on the White House lawn.  The President's Secret Service surrounds the craft and they are promptly slaughtered by the aliens.  The Army is called but they, too, fall to the aliens' superior numbers.  The Navy and Air Force try to strike back but they are too technologically inferior to do anything.  The aliens burn the White House to the ground and sack Washington DC.  They incinerate the museums and kill the President's family, even his dog.  But this is but a small taste of what's to come for Earth.  

After all of this, the aliens decide it is time for their sacred ritual of declaring war.  As they begin to do their war dances and war chants, the chief alien finds some local flora in the form of a bag of peas in an abandoned grocery store.  Grabbing those peas, the alien chief violates those vegetables right in front of the President.  The peas, having come from the planet's soil, are an excellent metaphor to show the violation that will soon await the whole Earth.

""We come in peas!"" the chief screams defiantly to the President, greeted by thousands of fanatical cheers from his loyal followers.

""Sure doesn't seem like it..."" the President says to himself.",There exists a race of aliens in our galaxy...,1
