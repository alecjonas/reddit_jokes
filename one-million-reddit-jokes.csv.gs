For example, the trade name of Tylenol also has a generic name of Acetaminophen. Aleve is also called Naproxen. Amoxil is also called Amoxicillin and Advil is also called Ibuprofen. 

The FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra. After careful consideration by a team of government experts, it recently announced that it has settled on the generic name of Mycoxafloppin. Also considered were Mycoxafailin, Mydixadrupin, Mydixarizin, Dixafix, and of course, Ibepokin.

Pfizer Corp. Announced today that Viagra will soon be available in liquid form, and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage suitable for use as a mixer. It will now be possible for a man to literally pour himself a stiff one. Obviously we can no longer call this a soft drink, and it gives new meaning to the names of ""cocktails"", ""highballs"" and just a good old-fashioned ""stiff drink"". Pepsi will market the new concoction by the name of: MOUNT &amp; DO. 

Thought for the day: There is more money being spent on breast implants and Viagra today than on Alzheimer's research.

He lands at the airport and takes a bus as far as it will take him, to a little town at the base of the mountains.

He rents a pack animal to take him as far as the animal will go up the mountain, where he finds a native he can hire as a guide.

After days of traveling, hiking, dirt, scrapes, heat, and cold, he climbs and finds the yogi's cave. He is starving and exhausted, but elated to find the old man alive and well, resting outside.

The man says: ""Great yogi, I have traveled for a long distance, through many obstacles to ask you about how to live a good and long life, to live as long as you, as happy and content as you, please tell me.""

The yogi says: ""The secret  to a long life, free of stress, is to never argue with idiots.""

However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.

MTA then hired an ornithological behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.

The ornithological behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause:

When crows eat roadkill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""Truck.""",200 Dead Crows,145

He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus-stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus. The butcher follows, dumbstruck. As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery. After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the ""stop"" bell, then the butcher follows him off. The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step. He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He does this again and again. No answer. So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door. A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.

The monk isn't the silent type, and being friendly, he strikes up a conversation with the American man. They really hit it off, and eventually the American confides in the monk that he's not particularly happy with his life. 

The monk asks the man if his life has any meaning. 

""Meaning?"" The man ponders. He really thinks it over, and realizes that, no, his life doesn't have much meaning. 

He gets home feeling reinvigorated by his epiphanistic conversation with the monk. He MUST find meaning to make his life worth while. He tries EVERYTHING. He spends years doing charity work. While fulfilling, he feels that he's doing it for purposes of self validation. The wrong reasons. The meaning of life, he decides, is not there. 

He attempts for years to focus on the self. Meditation for days on end, self imposed hunger strikes to learn what hardship really means. He still doesn't feel he has a purpose, a true meaning. And he was getting older....

Well, over the years he tried it all. Hiking, building schools, charity work, self actualization work, community engagement. All of it made him feel superficially good, but nothing gave him the *meaning* he so desperately needed. He decided to go back to the monk, see if he was still alive, and ask for more advice. He was so deeply moved last time, surely he could help again. 

He flies to Malaysia and tracks down the very same monk, now older than seemingly possible. With infinite wisdom, he listens to the man and his troubles. 

""So you see,"" the American said, ""I just can't find meaning anywhere, no matter where I look.""

""Of course,"" the monk says. ""You were in the middle of your story. You still are. You must find the ending.""

""The ending?"" asks the man. ""But I'm searching for meaning IN life, not after it!""

""Ah,"" the monk said. ""But you see...the ending justifies the meaning."" ",An American is on vacation in Malaysia when he meets a monk.,4

The commanding officer has them facing the opposite way of him. He walks up to the first potential agent from behind and speaks to his ear; loudly enough so all 3 can hear, but in a smooth, calculated tone, almost whispering: 

“You’ve passed every test up to this point; your physical attributes, your clear, critical thinking, and your apparent loyalty to our country.” 

“Now is the time for you to truly test that loyalty. I’m handing you my pistol. It’s loaded.”

“Behind this door is a small holding cell containing your wife. You’re required to end her life within the next 60 seconds, or you are to return home and resume your previous duties.” 

-The agent turns his head, quizzically, and slowly reaches for the pistol. After a short delay, the officer sternly states “NOW. You only have 35 seconds. GO.” 

You can hear a woman sobbing the instant the door is opened. Nervously, the agent enters, and the door closes behind him. 

“Time’s up!” 

The door creaks open. The agent, looking stunned, leads out with his wife holding his hand. He uses his other hand to give the pistol back to the commander. 

“I knew you weren’t cut out for this. Hand your papers in by 18:00.” 

The commander turns to Agent number 2. “I think you know what to do. Your wife is behind that door. 60 seconds. GO!” 

The 2nd agent is more determined looking. He grabs the pistol, nervously, as he nearly drops it in transition. Same as his palm slips on the door handle, using his body to shove the door open. Clearly he as mortified and confused. Again, as the door opens a woman is heard sobbing.

A long 45 seconds pass by. 

“Enough! Come on out!” 

The 2nd agent bursts out, furious.
 “I’ve been training my whole life for this, and for what?! This is insane! I’m not going to kill my wife!” 

He hands the pistol to the commander and him and his wife walk out. “I’m a little surprised that you couldn’t handle what it takes to rise to our ranks. Hand in your papers by 18:00.” 

Finally, the commander walks in front of the final agent. He looks toe-to-head; “I think we know the dr-“

The agent rips the pistol from the commander’s hands. “This door, I assume?!”—As he quickly opens the door, a woman is crying out: “James! I thought you loved—“ 

BANG! 

BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! *Click *Click 

... 

... 

After the shots finished ringing in the holding cell, suddenly the commander hears smashing and screaming from the small room. He starts to look terrified and confused. Right as he steps towards the door, it swings open violently; so hard that it hits the wall and bounces back into the agent’s outstretched arm. 

The agent, tattered and sweaty, calmly states: 

“Why didn’t you tell me the gun had blanks in it? I had to beat her with the chair.” 

",3 Secret Service agents are on their final day of training,3

The search and rescue begins and after a few days, along the road in the desert, they find the bus all turned over and burnt in the front yard of a small farm.


Police then go to the house, knock on the door, and are received by a farmer, who lets them in to his house.


The police ask about the bus and the politicians inside.

""Yep, they're all buried in my backyard. I dug a big hole, took them out of the bus and buried them. That's what my old man taught me, to have respect for those who passed away."" Says the farmer.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monk accepts him, feeds him, and even fixes his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man says, “All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?” The monk reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.” The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.” The monk reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.” The monk leads the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.” The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?” The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.” The man is relieved to no end.

Some potted grouse or salmon paste

One weekend, the members of the synagogue gave their long-time rabbi a brand new Cadillac.  By sheer coincidence, the parishioners gave their pastor a new Cadillac on the same day.

Everyone laughed at the coincidence, and the two clerics agreed to have a race.  A course was planned out, and the next day the two men took off.

The Catholic priest had a slight edge through the town, but when the course led out into more rural areas, the rabbi took the lead.  Eventually the course took them to a narrow dirt road, wide enough for only one car, and the rabbi was ahead while the priest was right on his tail.  They passed a sign that said, ""Danger!  Bridge Out Ahead!"", and they came to a cliff where a bridge had recently been washed out.

The rabbi slammed on his brakes, his car's wheels locked up, and screeched to a stop just two feet in front of the cliff.  The priest has just a tick slower to react, and his car rammed the rabbi's car, pushing its front wheels over the embankment.

With the rabbi's Cadillac balanced precariously on the cliff, the priest scrambled to help the rabbi to safety.  Once both men were safe, they called the police and waited for their arrival.

A Boston cop came to the scene first.  He looked at the two cars in the road.  He looked at the damage to the front end of the priest's car.  Then he looked at the rabbi's car, hanging on the cliff, with damage to its back end.

The cop took off his hat and scratched his head, wondering what to make of the situation.  Finally, in a thick Irish brogue, he asked, ""So, father, at what speed was the rabbi going when he backed into you?""

His dad said, ""Don't worry: there's a total fallback for this. There's going to be a punch bowl at the dance. Every time a slow dancing song starts, just offer to refill everybody's punch. A whole bunch of other people will be there too and it will easily take the entire song's time to do, and you won't have to worry about dancing.""

She went into the woods to look for it and found a frog
in a trap.

The frog said to her, ""If you release me from this trap, I
will grant you three wishes.""
The woman freed the frog, and the frog said,
""Thank you, but I failed to mention that there was a condition to your wishes.

Whatever you wish for, your husband will get ten times of it!"" The woman
said, ""That's okay.""

For her first wish, she wanted to be the most
beautiful woman in the world.
The frog warned her, ""You do realize that this
wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis
whom women will flock to"".
The woman replied, ""That's okay, because I will
be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me.""
So, KAZAM-
she's the most beautiful Woman in the world!

For her second wish, she
wanted to be the richest woman in the world.
The frog said, ""That will make
your husband the richest man in the world. And he will be ten times
richer than
you. ""
The woman said, ""That's okay, because what's mine is his and what's
his is mine.""
So, KAZAM- she's the richest woman in the world!

The
frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered, ""I'd like to have a
mild heart attack.""

Moral of the story: Women are clever. Don't
mess with them.

Attention
female readers:
This is the end of the joke for you. Stop here and continue
feeling good!

Male
readers: Please scroll down.























The man had a heart attack ten times
""milder"" than his wife!!!

Moral of the story : Women are really dumb but think they're really smart .

Let them continue to think that way and just enjoy the show

PS: If you are a woman and are still reading this; it only goes to
show that women never listen!!!",Woman was out golfing one day when she hit the ball into the woods.,6

This theorem can now be supported by a mathematical equation based on the following two postulates:  
  1. Knowledge is Power.
  2. Time is Money.
  
As every engineer knows: Power = Work / Time
  
Since:  
Knowledge = Power  
Time = Money  
  
It follows that: Knowledge = Work/Money.  
Solving for Money, we get: Money = Work / Knowledge.
  
Thus, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches infinity, regardless of the amount of work done.

It appeared to be three naked black men sitting on a bench, the one in the middle had a white penis. This made the couple ponder for a while.

What was the message? Was it a commentary on racism? Perhaps an insight into class struggle and a desire for one race to be like the other to gain more status in society? Perhaps nothing more than a shocking display meant to make you question your place in society. 

Finally, after much thinking and much debate, they ask a docent of the art museum the meaning of the painting. Their suspicions were confirmed: it was a very deep painting that had all kinds of hidden meaning about class struggle and racism. Content with the answer from the docent they stood and looked at it once more to really let the meaning sink in. 

As they were about to walk away they heard a soft voice with a pleasing accent behind them, ""Vat zat museum employee told you about zat painting is wrong"" Perplexed the couple turned to find a old man behind them leaning over a cane with a smile on his face. 

They inquired, ""how can you possibly know more than someone who works here? They are trained to know about all of these paintings down to the last detail!"" 

The man replied with a twinkle in his eye, ""Vell, to tell you ze truth, I am ze man who painted it."" The couple is slightly taken aback, but they want to know more.

8. It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas: Forced gender-specific gifts: dolls for Janice and Jen and boots and pistols (GUNS!) for Barney and Ben
9. Santa Baby: Gold digger, blackmail
10. Frosty the Snowman: Sexist; not a snow woman
11. Do You Hear What I Hear: blatant disregard for the hearing impaired

Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increases as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor or may choose to go up to the next floor but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband.
On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs
She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.
'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.'

So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.

'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'

Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please and you are all total cows that want,want and fucking want.
Like the rest, you are also nothing but a greedy good for nothing cow.
No wonder you are on you own. you are a horrible cunt, that should be left on the shelf.
Just what you fucking deserve.
Now fuck off!
Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

PLEASE NOTE:

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.

The first floor has wives that love sex.

The second floor has wives that love sex, have money and like beer and fuck you whenever you desire!

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.",A new husband store,19

“Who was that?” asked

his wife.

“Just some drunk guy

you remember about three

months ago when we broke

down and those two guys

helped us? I think you should

help him, and you should be

ashamed of yourself!”

gets dressed and goes out

into the pouring rain. He calls

out into the dark, “Hello! Are

you still there?”

“Yes,” comes back the

answer.

“Do you still need a

push?”

“Yes, please!” comes

the reply from the darkness.

“Where are you?”

It started to snow. The first snow of the season and the wife and I took our cocktails and sat for hours by the window watching the huge soft flakes drift down from heaven. It looked like a Grandma Moses Print. So romantic we felt like newlyweds again. I love snow!

December 9: 2017
We woke to a beautiful blanket of crystal white snow covering every inch of the landscape. What a fantastic sight! Can there be a lovelier place in the Whole World? Moving here was the best idea I’ve ever had. I shoveled for the first time in years, felt like a boy again. I did both our driveway and the sidewalks. This afternoon the snowplow came along and covered up the sidewalks and closed in the driveway, so I got to shovel again. What a perfect life.

December 12: 2017
The sun has melted all our lovely snow. Such a disappointment. My neighbor tells me not to worry; we’ll definitely have a white Christmas. No snow on Christmas would be awful! Bob says we’ll have so much snow by the end of winter, that I’ll never want to see snow again. I don’t think that’s possible. Bob is such a nice man, I’m glad he’s our neighbor.

December 14: 2017
Snow, lovely snow! 8″ last night. The temperature dropped to -20. The cold makes everything sparkle so. The wind took my breath away, but I warmed up by shoveling the driveway and sidewalks. This is the life! The snowplow came back this afternoon and buried everything again. I didn’t realize I would have to do quite this much shoveling, but I’ll certainly get back in shape this way. I wish I wouldn’t huff and puff so.

December 15: 2017
20 inches forecast. Sold my van and bought a 4×4 Blazer. I bought snow tires for the wife’s car and two extra shovels. Stocked the freezer. The wife wants a wood stove in case the electricity goes out. I think that’s silly. We aren’t in Alaska, after all.

 
December 16: 2017
Ice storm this morning. Fell on my ass on the ice in the driveway putting down salt. Hurt like hell. The wife laughed for an hour, which I think was very cruel.

December 17: 2017
Still way below freezing. Roads are too icy to go anywhere. Electricity was off for five hours. I had to pile the blankets on to stay warm. Nothing to do but stare at the wife and try not to irritate her. Guess I should’ve bought a wood stove, but won’t admit it to her. God I hate it when she’s right. I can’t believe I’m freezing to death in my own living room.

December 20: 2017
Electricity’s back on, but had another 14″ of the damn stuff last night. More shoveling. Took all day. Goddamn snowplow came by twice. Tried to find a neighbor kid to shovel, but they said they’re too busy playing hockey. I think they’re lying. Called the only hardware store around to see about buying a snow blower, and they’re out. Might have another shipment in March. I think they’re lying. Bob says I have to shovel or the city will have it done and bill me. I think he’s lying.

December 22: 2017
Bob was right about a white Christmas, because 13 more inches of the white shit fell today, and it’s so cold it probably won’t melt ’til August. Took me 45 minutes to get all dressed up to go out to shovel, and then I had to piss. By the time I got undressed, pissed and dressed again, I was too tired to shovel! Tried to hire Bob, who has a plow on his truck, for the rest of the winter; but he says he’s too busy. I think the asshole is lying.

December 23: 2017
Only 2″ of snow today, and it warmed up to “0”. The wife wanted me to decorate the front of the house this morning. What, is she nuts!!! Why didn’t she tell me to do that a month ago? She says she did, but I think she’s lying.

December 24: 2017
6″. Snow packed so hard by snowplow, I broke the shovel. Thought I was having a heart attack. If I ever catch the son-of-a-bitch who drives that snowplow, I’ll drag him through the snow by his balls and beat him to death with my broken shovel. I know he hides around the corner and waits for me to finish shoveling and then he comes down the street at a 100 miles an hour and throws snow all over everywhere I’ve just been! Tonight the wife wanted me to sing Christmas carols with her and open our presents, but I was too busy watching for the Goddamn snowplow.

December 25: 2017
Merry F!=3D@x@!x!x1 Christmas. 20 more inches of the !=3D@x@!x!x1 slop tonight. Snowed in. The idea of shoveling makes my blood boil. God, I hate the snow! Then the snowplow driver came by asking for a donation and I hit him over the head with my shovel. The wife says I have a bad attitude. I think she’s a fricking idiot. If I have to watch “It’s a Wonderful Life” one more time, I’m going to stuff her into the microwave.

December 26: 2017
Still snowed in. Why the hell did I ever move here? It was all HER idea. She’s really getting on my nerves.

December 27: 2017
Temperature dropped to -30, and the pipes froze. Plumber came after 14 hours of waiting for him; he only charged me $1,400 to replace all my pipes.

December 28: 2017
Warmed up to above -50. Still snowed in. The BITCH is driving me crazy!!!!!

December 29: 2017
10 more inches. Bob says I have to shovel the roof or it could cave in. That’s the silliest thing I ever heard. How dumb does he think I am?

December 30: 2017
Roof caved in. I beat up the snow plow driver. He is now suing me for a million dollars; not for only the beating I gave him, but also for trying to shove the broken snow shovel up his ass. The wife went home to her mother. 9″ predicted.

December 31: 2017
I set fire to what’s left of the house. No more shoveling.

January 8: 2018
Feel so good. I just love those little white pills they keep giving me. Why am I tied to the bed?

""Yeah dude"", replied the genie. ""I just completed genie school, and you're my first customer, like, ever!""

The man couldn't believe his luck. ""OK"", he said, ""I wish for a billion dollars!""

""Done!"", the genie said. He waved his hands, and POOF! Former president Bill Clinton appeared in front of them, and said: ""It's Bill Clinton!""

The man was confused. ""Why did you bring me Bill Clinton?""

""Sorry bro"", the genie replied. ""I'm still new at this and I kinda screwed up your wish.""

""You'll give me a do-over, right?"", asked the man.

""Sorry bro, rules are rules. I can only grant you two more wishes"".

""Genie"", the man retorted, ""I need you to get this right. Please, I wish for a billion dollars!""

""Done!"", the genie said. He waved his hands, and POOF! Former president George W. Bush appeared in front of them and shouted: ""It's George Dubya!""

""Genie!"", snapped the man. ""You're wasting my wishes!""

""Ah, sorry dude! It's hard!""

""Genie! Please, I'm begging you. There's only one more wish and it's my last chance to get rich, and I really, really don't want to see Obama! I can't stand the guy.""

""That's high pressure"", the genie replied. ""OK, let me see if I can get this right"".

The genie then shut his eyes and focused. He hummed and waved his hands back and forth very slowly, for what seemed like an eternity. Everybody watched him intently, while beads of sweat formed on the man's brow. 

Suddenly, the genie threw up his arms and POOF! Donald Trump appeared, looked directly at the man, and said ""Orange ya glad I didn't say Obama?""",A man bought a new lamp on Amazon.,3
