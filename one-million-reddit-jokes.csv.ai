Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Is it going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied,""it's definitely going to be a very cold winter."" The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""

""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""

""How can you be so sure?"" the Chief asked.

The weatherman replied, ""The Indians are collecting wood like crazy.""

She asked him to drop his trousers.

He did.

She reached over the counter, grabbed hold of him and called over the intercom, 'One box of large condoms, checkout 5.'

The next man in line thought this was interesting, and like most of us, was up for a cheap thrill. When he got up to the register he told the checker that he too had forgotten to get condoms and asked if she could have some brought to the register for him.

She asked him what size, and he stated that he didn't know.

She asked him to drop his trousers. He did.

She gave him a quick feel, picked up the intercom and said, 'One box of medium-sized condoms, checkout 5.'

A few customers back was this teenage boy. He thought what he had seen was way cool. He had never had any type of sexual contact so he thought this was his chance. When he got to the till he told the checker he needed some condoms.

Paddy died in a fire and was burnt pretty badly. So the morgue needed someone to identify the body. His two best friends, Seamus and Sean, were sent for. Seamus went in and the mortician pulled back the sheet.

Seamus said ""Yup, he's burnt pretty bad. Roll him over"".

So the mortician rolled him over. Seamus looked and said ""Nope, it ain't Paddy.""

The mortician thought that was rather strange and then he brought Sean in to identify the body.

Sean took a look at him and said, ""Yup, he's burnt real bad, roll him over.""

The mortician rolled him over and Sean looked down and said, ""No, it ain't Paddy.""

The mortician asked, ""How can you tell?""

Sean said, ""Well, Paddy had two arseholes.""

""What? He had two arseholes?"" asked the mortician.

""Yup, everyone knew he had two arseholes. Every time we went into town, folks would say, 'Here comes Paddy with them two arseholes....'""",Paddy,79

Sure enough, there’s an even longer line there, only two packets per person. And there’s literally a whole aisle of shelves that’s just instant ramen, plastic wrap from the boxes is on the floor, and the person picking out their two packs is being very indecisive... there is a decent sized group waiting, so I head to the cleaning products aisle.

This is where it gets crazy. One store employee is tearing open bulk bags of toilet paper, giving one roll to each customer. And there is another employee putting Clorox wipes in baggies, 5 for a dollar. The aisle is packed, shopping carts clacking together.

There was a religious man who lived by a river. One day a sheriffs deputy came by and said to him, “There’s a flood coming. You want to get to higher ground.” The man replied, “Thank you officer, but I trust in the Lord. HE will save me.”

The river began to rise and soon the man’s house was surrounded by water. A couple of firemen in a boat rowed up to the house and said, “Get in we’ll take you to safety!” The man called to them, “Thanks for coming out here. I’m trusting in the Lord. He will save me.”

Not long after that the water came up to the roof of the house. As the man sat on his roof, a helicopter flew over and a national guardsman called over a speaker, “We’ll throw down a line and save you!” “Thank You!” the man yelled back, “But I trust in the Lord, he will save me!” 

As the helicopter flew away, the house collapsed and the man drowned.

What the fish didn't realize was that there was a bear looking at the fish looking at the fly. The bear is thinking: you know what, that fly drops six inches, that fish gets that fly and I'm gonna go in then get that fish I'm gonna have myself a really nice meal. 
What the bear didn't realize was that there was a hunter eating a sandwich watching the bear watching the fish watching the fly. The hunter is sitting there, looking at that fly and he's like you know what, that fly drops six inches, that fish gets that fly, that bear gets that fish, I'm put the sandwich down and get my gun and shoot that bear and have myself a really nice meal. 
What the hunter didn't realize was that there was a mouse watching the sandwich in the hunters hand watching the bear, watching the fish, watching the fly. The mouse is looking at the fly and is thinking you know what: that fly drops six inches, that fish gets that fly, the bear gets the fish, the hunter drops his sandwich and shoots the bear, I'm gonna jump on that sandwich, and I'm gonna have myself a really nice meal.
What the mouse didn't realize was that there was a cat watching the mouse, watching the hunter, watching the bear, watching the fish, watching the fly.

And then, all of a sudden happened. The fly drops six inches, the fish got the fly, the bear got the fish, the hunter threw down his sandwich and shot the bear, the mouse jumped on the sandwich but then it all went wrong… 
The cat went to jump on the mouse and missed and landed in the river, got completely soaked. And I think that's something to be said for or something in life.

The United Way realized that it had never received a donation
from the city's most successful lawyer. So a United Way volunteer paid
the lawyer a visit in his lavish office.

The volunteer opened the meeting by saying, 'Our research
shows that even though your annual income is over two million dollars,
you don't give a penny to charity. Wouldn't you like to give something
back to your community through the United Way ?'

The lawyer thinks for a minute and says, 'First, did your
research also show you that my mother is dying after a long, painful illness
and she has huge medical bill s that are far beyond her ability to pay?'

Embarrassed, the United Way rep mumbles, 'Uh . . . no, I
didn't know that.'

'Secondly,' says the lawyer, 'did it show that my brother,
a disabled veteran, is blind and confined to a wheelchair and is unable
to support his wife and six children?'

The stricken United Way rep begins to stammer an apology,
but is cut off again.

'Thirdly, did your research also show you that my sister's
husband died in dreadful car accident, leaving her penniless with a mortgage
and three children, one of whom is disabled and another that has learning
disabilities requiring an array of private tutors?'

The humiliated United Way rep, completely beaten, says, 'I'm
so sorry, I had no idea.'

And the lawyer says, '

So . . . if I didn't give any money
to them, what makes you think I'd give any to you ??",lawyer story,4

The next day he runs into a native hunter. They chat and the white man mentions that the winter would be cold. the hunter said, ""yes, very cold. I don't think I remember a winter as cold as this one"". The white man realized he misunderstood the first native and really felt unprepared. So he goes home and chops wood all night. He now has a huge pile and he Hope's it will be enough.

He later visits the village and can tell the people are clearly distressed. He finds the chief and asks what's wrong and the chief says, ""very bad winter coming. very cold, lots of snow, not sure how we will survive, worst we've ever seen"".

The man was shocked and asks, ""how do you know it will be so bad?

The sun is beating down and the streets are deserted. Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and everybody lives on credit:

On this particular day a rich tourist is driving through town, stops at the local motel and lays a $100 bill on the desk saying he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night.

He gives him keys to a few rooms and as soon as the man walks upstairs, the owner grabs the $100 bill and runs next door to pay his debt to the
butcher.

The butcher takes the $100 and runs down the street to repay his debt to the pig farmer.

The pig farmer takes the $100 and heads off to pay his bill at the supplier of feed and fuel.

The guy at the Farmer's Co-op takes the $100 and runs to pay his drinks bill at the local pub.

The publican slips the money along to the local prostitute drinking at the bar, who has also been facing hard times and has had to offer him ""services"" on credit.

The hooker rushes to the motel and pays off her room bill to the motel owner with the $100 ..

The motel proprietor then places the $100 back on the counter so the rich traveler will not suspect anything.

At that moment the traveler comes down the stairs, picks up the $100 bill, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, pockets the money, and leaves town.

No one produced anything. No one earned anything.

However, the whole town is now out of debt and looking to the future with a lot more optimism....",The sun is beating down and the.....,27

The citizens appreciated the number 2 so much, to a point that they would determine one's social class by his/her divisibility by 2. And those not divisible by 2 - sorry, then they're slaves.

7 was born an odd number. That's how he became a slave. And today when his master humiliated him again, is the last straw. He said to himself, ""This isn't how things should be. I swear I am going to change this.""

The next day, he escaped from his master's house, and fled to the central square of the city. His master of course called the guards to get him, and 7 was outnumbered, with literally millions and trillions surrounding him.

""EVERYONE, LISTEN TO ME,"" 7 shouted, ""FOR WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY IS THE ONLY TRUTH!

""No one should be born to be enslaved! We are all numbers, and all numbers should be equal, even odd numbers!""

The moment he said it, magic happened, because what he said was indeed true.

    Let N be the set of all natural numbers. E be the set of all even numbers. O be the set of all odd numbers.
    Then, N = E + O

Therefore all numbers are equal even odd numbers. And that's how 7 single handedly ended the long lasting slavery in one day.",All numbers are equal,7

""I'm telling ya man. This is the best bar in the whole city. Every Friday night they have all you can drink specials for $2. And the best part... a sorority house is right next door and the place is just filled with young, gorgeous, single, women.""

""Well let's go next Friday then!""

""Aye, and that's where the problem lies. Like I said, it was all you can drink, so I had my fill and my memory is pretty fuzzy. All I can remember about the place is it had big purple double doors in the front and a golden toilet in the restroom.""

""A golden toilet?""

""Aye, a golden toilet. Even in my blacked out state I can remember thinking how strange it was for the toilet to be painted gold.""

The pair decide they are going to find this bar with the $2 drinks, gorgeous gals, big purple doors, and a golden toilet. The next Friday they head out and catch a cab. They explain to the cab driver what they are looking for and he says it doesn't sound familiar, but if it's in this city he will find it.

So, after driving all over town without much luck they finally pull up to this little dive bar and lo and behold it has over-sized double doors painted a bright purple. The guy gets excited and tells his buddy, ""I think this is it!""

The bar hasn't opened up yet for the night, but they notice the bartender bringing out a bag of trash to the dumpster, so they go over to ask him about it.

""Hey, does this place have golden toilets?""

The bartender is confused. ""What?!?""

""Does this place have golden toilets? I was in the best bar of my life last week and the only thing I can remember is it has purple doors like this one and a golden toilet in the men's room.""

The bartender thinks for a minute, seems to realize what is going on, then opens up the door to bar and yells, ""Hey Sam, I think I found the guy that took a dump in your tuba last week!""",Golden toilet,2

She then whipped out her cell phone and showed me a picture of a Lamborghini ""You see this car? I paid for it by selling hand jobs.""

She leaves and I pass out. The next night I go back to the same casino bar, and sure enough she's there again and I decide I wanted some more. I walk up to her and say ""You were amazing last night, how much would it cost for a blow job?"" She then smiles and says ""1 grand."" Again I'm a little bit set back by the price and I said ""A grand? Is it that good?"" She then whips out her phone and shows me a picture of a HUGE, luxurious house. She then says ""See this house? I paid for it with blowjobs"" so I said ""Alright let's do it"" so this time we go into her car and she decides to blow me in the parking lot, and its the best blowjob I have ever had.


We sit there and I'm blown away by this woman, so I ask her, ""how much would it cost for some pussy?"" She then laughs and points to the casino. ""You see that casino?"" I said ""...yeah?"" She says ""If I had a pussy, I would own that casino.""",Good Ol' 563,8

The bartender says, “Well, first you have to eat a plate of 5 rotten eggs. Second, there is a bear in the basement that has an abscess tooth. You’ll have to pull it. And finally, there’s a 90 year old lady upstairs who has never had an orgasm. You have to give her one.”

The man replies, “Honestly, I was out at the rotten eggs. Thanks though.”

So the man sits down and has a drink. Then another. Then another. And before long, he’s had enough liquid courage to tell the bartender, “You know what? Screw it, I’ll go for it.”

So he places his $100 in the jar and the bartender brings out the eggs. They smell awful and taste even worse, but the man is drunk and there’s gotta be thousands in that jar, so he chokes them down. 

“Great,” says the bartender. “The bear is downstairs. Good luck.” 

So the man goes to the basement. Everyone in the bar gathers at the door to hear what’s happening. It’s quiet at first, and the suddenly there’s a huge commotion. The bear is roaring, the man is screaming, glass is smashing, walls are breaking. It’s pandemonium down there.

Larry decided that it was in his best interest to start a Youtube channel, but he wasn’t really sure what it should be about. After great thought he decided he wanted to start a diss track channel. Remember this. It’s a very important detail.

At the very same time, the nicest man you’ve ever met was building a time machine. Him and his friend were having an argument on one specific thing they called “the Fact” and he was trying to get to the bottom of if it as true or not. He couldn’t quite remember the year the fact was relevant so he set the time for 1996 went on his way.

The Fact was actually just whether or not Paul, the nice man, was the first to meet his wife (then gf), or if his friend had met her first. His friend, Ted, was a sportscaster for the local hockey team. Ted was a bigger man who always wore a purple jersey (the colour of the local team, “The Rhinos”) with his old number which was 16 and gained the nickname Plumb Ted Sixteen. People would hoot it...he was basically a local celebrity along with the other announcer, Ann.

The funny thing about Ann was that her nickname was “Ann announcer” like an announcer. She got it in college because some guy thought it was funny, but she just owned it.

Paul’s wife currently wasn’t around because she was on a work trip for 3 months in a location with no cell/wifi anything for the foreseeable future because I need her to not be around for this story to work.

Something went wrong though. Paul accidently put in the wrong date and ended up somewhere along the same time frame of when Cavemen were around. He actually met one. While he was looking for some minerals to replenish the time machine’s supply, he would struck up conversations with the caveman, cleaned his wounds and taught him some words.

Once the time machine was fixed, he tested it a few more times visiting the cave man a few more times, bringing him food and water. The caveman, in his broken speech grabbed both sides of Paul’s head and said “man, kind” which warmed Paul’s heart. The man didn’t understand names but would often just refer to him as “kind man” or “man, kind”

Back in the future Larry is going by “This Man” as his diss track name. Like...oh “This man” is at it again. He was vaguely friends with Ted and they were talking about Paul and how he’d been missing for a few weeks. They came up with two plans. One was to find Paul, and the other was to make a diss track about the argument “the Fact” and how Ted actually met Paul’s wife first.

What Paul didn’t realize was that time travel has some...unforeseen circumstances. It actually opened a rift into Hades, Hell, whatever you want to call it. As Paul was traveling back to the future one time, he and the caveman were grabbed by the devil himself and put them in a cell.

There was also one other person there. A mortician who had accidently created a portal from cremating a strange mixture of things, Holy Water, a “saint” who was actually a terrible person, and a cross that happened to be in the “saint’s” pocket. Anyways, circumstances aside, the mortician.

Well, because time moves differently they were there for so long that the caveman started to think that this was there home. “Truh of Prison Hades” he started to call himself. He was learning quite a few things from the two others in the eternity they were there.

Meanwhile, in the current timeline, Larry and Ted were looking for Paul. They broke into his house after him not answering and found the time machine. Well, they decided to go through and Ted somehow saw the rift as they passed through and saw Paul and the others sitting there. They snuck in, broke the lock and snuck. The rift closed and they were all stuck in the future timeline.

They all argued about The Fact. Truh learned more english but still couldn’t comprehend that Hell wasn’t there home and so refer as “Truh of Cell” sometimes and “Truh of Hell” other times. “Kind man” and “man, Kind” were also two things that were around.

This made Paul double down and reactivate the time machine. He brought everyone with him. Paul, Larry, Truh, the mortician, who was now a good friend, and Ted all went through to see who was right. They knew they had to go to every game that season for 1996 because nobody knew what year it was, just sometime between 1996 and 1999

According to Ted, the setup for the sportscasting was that each of them had a table, him and Ann (the other announcer) sat looking half at each other, half at the screen...like a 45 degree angle or in a booth above the rink. The time that it happened Ted grabbed for his water and spilled it all over his pants and so had to walk out to change and started a conversation with Paul’s wife just outside the door of the announcer room.

Well, two years later than expected they finally see the situation start everyone goes nuts. They sprint for the alleged location. When they get there...they see it. Plumb Ted is talking to Paul’s wife in the hallway. They panic thinking they’ll be seen by past Ted and jump into a nearby closet.

They gather themselves and everyone falls silent. They wait a bit and go over to the announcers room after everyone has left to hide and talk until they can open the portal to the future again.

How far do you think we can throw that table? Ted asks. They all realize the best way to cooperatively throw a table is to get under it and launch it with their feet. Lay down under it and launch it out the window onto the ice. Turns out the announcer table they threw landed on Paul’s wife and she died.

They get back to the future and “That Man” Larry writes a diss track about Paul, the man who killed his own wife in the past. The song was called “The Fact” in tribute to the journey they’d gone on together, but didn’t realize that the diss track would gain so much momentum and ruin Paul’s life.

So Paul is left depressed, single, and with a viral diss track about him. He eventually commit suicide.

Why am I telling you this. I don’t want you falling into the same situation. Just don’t let “This Man” diss track you for “The Fact” in 1998, that the undertaker, Truh, Man-kind of Hell in a Cell, and Plumb Ted Sixteen, feet-threw Ann Announcer’s table.",The story of the kind man who built a time machine.,2

Most people had around a 50% power percentage, parents would give some of their belongings to their kids at birth so they would be strong enough to walk, but people who went above that 50%, would have extreme strength, and people would often compete to see who could have the most, but no one had ever gotten to 100% power percentage.

So there was this guy named Lort Bumblethorn, and he was renowned for getting to 99% PP, but he got in some financial trouble, sold a house, and went back to around 95%, never reaching back to his record.

Eventually, Lort settled down and had a kid, named Sort. Sort was inspired by his father and believed he could reach 100% PP. He had massive success in his career, getting to 90% power, but sadly, his father passed away, which demoralized Sort.

One day, Sort was in a shop, when an old man approached him, ""Excuse me, are you Lort Bumblethorn?""

""No,"" replied Sort, ""I'm Sort, his son. No autographs please.""

""No, no, I was a good friend of your fathers"", he reached into his pocket and pulled out a bronze rod, ""this was what your father was using to try to get to 100% power, he gave it to me for safekeeping, it can only be used by a Bumblethorn. It is called the 'Nu', and it will get you to 100% power. I'll sell it to you for only $10.00""

""That's a nice story, but I know you're a scammer and the 'Nu' doesn't work, get out of my presence.""

""No,"" pleaded the old man, ""please.""

Suddenly, there was a shimmer of light behind Sort, he turned around, and there was an apparition of his father, the one, the only, Lort Bumblethorn, and he spoke out to his son.

""Sort, buy Nu, it will make your PP very big.""",This takes place in a society where everybody is born really weak.,5
