The Devil arrives and greets the man.  He tells him ""as the one millionth arrival this month you get to pick the Hell in which you shall live out eternity.  You will be shown five individual hells and you must chose one"".

The Devil leads the man to the individual hell chambers.   At the first one the door opens into a chamber where an old, withered looking man is chain naked, spreadeagle to a wall and in front of him is a machine spitting acid globs at him, burning him slowly forever.  The Devil waits for a moment then closes the door...""Next!"" he says.

At the next chamber the door opens up to reveal a similar scene as the first;  an old withered looking man is chained, naked and spread eagle to the wall but this time there is no acid spitting machine. Instead in this one oil is being poured onto the mans head in a slow steady stream, running into his eyes and covering his nose and mouth periodically.  By the look in his eye this is clearly tortuous so and the man shivers and looks away...""Next!"" The Devil says and then move on.

The 3rd chamber opens to a similar scene, an old man chained to the wall, naked and spreadeagled.  There is no acid machine or oil here but instead, to the man's surprise, there is a beautiful tanned blonde lady, naked, sitting at the chained up old mans feet giving him a blowjob.  Unsurprisingly the guy chained up looks rather happy with his lot in hell.

The man at the door stares in disbelief and immediately says ""This one"".

The Devil turns to him and says ""Are you sure? This is the third of five. There are others from which you may choose.""

""I'm sure"" says the man.

""OK"" says the Devil who then turns back to the chamber and says ""OK Lady, you're done here.  We've got a replacement for you"".

If she stayed in Italy to raise the child, he also promised to provide child support until the child turned 18.

She agreed, but asked how he would know when the baby was born.

To keep it discreet, he told her to simply mail him a post card, and write 'Spaghetti' on the back. He would then arrange for the child support payments to begin.

One day, about 9 months later, he came home to his confused wife. 'Honey!' she said, 'you received a very strange post card today.'

'Oh, yeah? Why is it strange?' he said.

The wife responds ""It's from Italy, with no sender and on the back it's written: Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti. Three with meatballs, two without. Send extra sauce.""

The judge said to him: ""Now, I don't know how things work up in Minnesota, but down here in the great state of Texas, you aren't allowed to run over old ladies on the train tracks.""

And so she sentenced him to death by the electric chair.

The next day he was taken to the executioners office, and he strapped him in, and pulled the switch.

And so the next day he went back to work. This time, he brought a different book to read. However, this book was very boring, and it put him to sleep. He was sleeping so deeply, he didn't realize what was going on and accidentally hit a small child on the train tracks.

The next day, he appeared in court.

And so, he once again walked free. He went back to work, and instead of bringing a book, he brought a paddle ball to play with. However, as he was playing with it, it hit him in the head, knocking him out. Because of this, he couldn't stop the train as it hit the mayor on the train tracks.

The next day, he appeared in court.

""Well, for fifteen I can give you 'ol Bill. He's seen a few years but he's still a fast horse"" replies the owner.

""Why so cheap then?""

""Well, he ain't so good at listening. You see, he gets his Whoas and Giddy-ups mixed-up.""

""You're kidding? Well, I don't have much choice. Here's $15, friend.""

After he'd payed for the horse the owner went out to the stable to get Bill. When he came back, the cowboy could see that Bill was indeed old, but had very strong legs. After preparing the saddle, the cowboy hopped on Bill.

""Alright, Bill. Giddy-up!""

Bill would not move, not a twitch from his ears.

""C'mon Bill! Giddy-up!"" he clicked, kicking the horse with his spurs.

Bill wouldn't budge. Not a swish from his tail. Remembering what the owner had said, the cowboy adjusted his reins and called...

""Whoa, Bill!""

Bill's ears perked, and he flew out of the barn like a bat out of hell. Horse and rider were outside the town in seconds, with a huge dust cloud trailing behind them. Off they went, flying over the Arizona hills. The cowboy could barely hold on to his reins; his feet flailing out behind the stirrups. 

Over the next hill the cowboy could see that Bill was running them straight towards the edge of the Grand Canyon. He pulled back on the reins.

""Whoa, Bill! Whoa!"" he cried.

Bill kept running. The edge of the precipice coming closer.

""Whoa, Bill! Stop, damn it!""

He suddenly recalled what the owner had said about Bill's mixed-up directions. Taking a deep breath the cowboy closed his eyes and shouted ""Giddy-up, Bill!""

Bill came to an abruptly fast stop, just one horse-step away from certain death. The cowboy nearly vaulted over Bill into the vast gorge. Bill panted with exhaustion while the cowboy wiped his brow with his kerchief. From atop Bill, he looked down into the canyon at the dry riverbed far below.

A Minneapolis couple decided to go to Florida to thaw out during a particularly icy winter.
They planned to stay at the same hotel where they spent their honeymoon 20 years earlier.
 
Because of their hectic schedules, it was difficult to coordinate their travel schedules together. So, the husband left Minnesota and flew to Florida on Thursday, with his wife flying down the following day.
 
The husband checked into the hotel. There was a computer in his room, so he decided to send an email to his wife. However, he accidentally left out one letter in her email address, and without realizing his error, sent the e-mail.
 
Meanwhile, somewhere in Houston , a widow had just returned home from her husband's funeral. He was a Baptist minister who was called home to glory following a heart attack.
 
The widow decided to check her e-mail expecting messages from relatives and friends.
After reading the first message, she screamed and fainted.
 
The widow's son rushed into the room, found his mother on the floor, and saw the computer screen which read:
 
To: My Loving Wife
Subject: I've Arrived
Date: August 14, 2017
 
I know you're surprised to hear from me. They have computers here now and you are allowed to send emails to your loved ones. I've just arrived and have been checked in.

Each Martian holds out two fingers – they touch and rub each other’s hands until a few minutes later a fully formed tiny Martian appears and drops on to the ground and waddles away.

The Martians turn to the Earthlings and ask, “OK, it’s your turn, how do you do it”?

So, a little self-consciously, the Earth couple take off their spacesuits and fuck.

When they finish, the Martians ask them “OK, but where’s the baby”?

“Oh”, they reply, “the baby will be here in 9 months.”

Officer: May I see your driver's license?

Driver: I don't have one. I stole this car.

Officer: The car is stolen?

Driver: That's right. But come to think of it, I think I saw the owner's card in the glove box when I was putting my gun in there.

Officer: There's a gun in the glove box?

Driver: Yes sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed the woman who owns this car and stuffed her in the trunk.

Officer: There's a BODY in the trunk?!

Driver: Yes, sir.

Hearing this, the officer immediately called his captain.

The car was quickly surrounded by police, and the captain approached the driver to handle the tense situation:

Captain: Sir, can I see your license?

Driver: Sure. Here it is.

It was valid.

Captain: Who's car is this?

Driver: It's mine, officer. Here's the owner's card.

The driver indeed owned the car.

Captain: Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if there's a gun in it?

Driver: Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it.

Sure enough, there was nothing in the glove box.

Captain: Would you mind opening your trunk? I was told you said there's a body in it.

Driver: No problem.

It turns out the trunk is empty.

Captain: I don't understand it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you didn't have a license, stole the car, had a gun in the glovebox, and that there was a dead body in the trunk.

He was texting her everyday, though he had a huge boner everytime he was doing so, he just couldn't resist at all. He could see her without popping a boner pretty easily actually, but talking to her without having one was an impossible task.

The young man decided one day to go and ask her out, by message obviously, since he didn't want August to see his boner when he was talking to her. He knew that she would never go on a date with him, after all, she was the sexiest girl of the whole college, and Adam was a bit of a nerd. He still sent his message, and got a very surprising answer. August told him that she was also having a crush on Adam since 2 months or so.

Adam and August then texted for almost 4 hours, but because it was starting to get really late, and they both wanted to go to sleep, the young girl asked Adam:

- ""Can I come to your place tomorrow? We're on vacation after all.""

Adam, without hesitation, immediately answered positively, and that she could come at 8PM since his parents wouldn't even be at home. They then went both to sleep, though as Adam was starting to fall asleep, he then realised that he had done a big mistake. How was he going to hide his boner when August would come at his place? He really didn't want her to see it, he actually never talked to her in college before, so it wasn't a big deal until now. He then thought that ducktaping his dick to one of his legs would do the trick just fine, she wouldn't see any boner at all, why not after all, I mean you guys are fucking coconuts so yeah.

So the next day, at around 6:30PM, Adam started, well, ducktaping his dick to his right leg, as he thought that he had put enough ducktape, he then proceeded to put his trousers back up.

It's 8PM, his new girlfriend is coming at his frontdoor. The bell rings, Adam is ready. He opens up the door, August is about to give him a kiss that HE FUCKING KICKS HER IN THE FACE!",Adam and August,10

He sweats a bit, makes a couple phone calls, and finally says ""ok, ok, I send, I send.""

post,6tio0z,2qh72,jokes,false,1502667638,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6tio0z/strong_men/,self.jokes,,"One day at the bar, a lady heard a man boasting much about his strong men that he used for everything. The man would tell of great feats of construction, battles, and contests all completed by his strong men. After a little while of listening to this rant, the woman had enough and approached the man, wanting to test his boasts in hopes of exposing him. 

She said, ""Hey, I bet your strong men can't tear down that statue in the street outside even if you had 100.""

He replied, ""I see! A challenge! I'll do it with 10!""

Being a man of his word he sent for 10 of his strong men and within the hour had the statue tumbling to pavement. Still not believing, the women pressed him again.

She exclaimed, ""You have torn down a glorified stone, how about beating up that group of policemen standing across the plaza. Let's see if your strong men are not only strong enough but brave enough.""

The man, undaunted, replied, ""Still not convinced? That is fine. I will do it with 15.""

The strong men, send by the man, rushed across the plaza, dodging cars, and jumped the policemen. Despite being shot numerous times and police back up arriving, the strong men knocked out every policeman that had been standing across the plaza. 

The woman, still not believing, went  to the man again.

She said, ""Now, I have seen these men do impressive things, but from your talk, they should be able to do anything. Don't you like power? If your strong men are so great, why don't you just destroy the government and enslave the people, then you can be the most powerful man in the land! What feat could possibly be greater?""

The man, unflinching, replied, ""Now that's an idea! I'll do it! I will send all 1,000 of my strong men to the capitol and take it over!""

After many days, it appeared the last of the strong men had been roosted from the capitol building after their initial brutal assault. The man, distraught at his failure, jumped off a bridge. However, one strong man, in the first assault on the building, had been dazed and wandered into a library next door where he collapsed in the corner. Due to the confusing next door at the capitol, no one bothered him. Hours later he awoke, still slightly dazed, and wandered around the library. Being a strong man, he had never held a book in his life, having lifted weights and built muscle since his birth. He grasped his first book and began to slowly pour over it, reading page by page. After a few hours he was done and said aloud, ""If this one book contained so much knowledge, how much must there be in this whole place?!""  Encouraged by this, he began to read every book he could, absorbing every piece of information, emboldened by his new mission. At the very end, of the last shelf, he wondered where he could find more. Just as he was about to leave the building, in search of another library, he remembered his mission. Seeing all of the cops and national guard in front of the capitol discouraged him from trying to help his fellow strong men out by forcing his way in. Instead, he figured he could use all of his new knowledge to take over the capitol, and then the country. He pondered on what he had learned and what could help him. Then it came to him, the one thing he had read about numerous times in the library that could help him destroy the government and surely enslave the people.

The chief took the second man off of the steaks, tied a noose and hung him. When he died, they removed his body, roasted it, and ate him. When they were done, the women took his skin and made a second canoe.

Then the chief went up to the last man and asked, ""How would you like to die?"" 
The third man responded, ""I wish to die by fork.""
The tribesmen were confused and handed him a metal fork.

The man then shouted ""FORK YOUR CANOE!"" and began to stab himself to death with the fork.",Skin Canoes,9

Mutt is the fastest horse in the world and Jeff is the second fastest horse in the world. Mutt has won every race he's ever been in, and Jeff has won every race he's ever been in, except the races where Mutt was a participant, in which case he came in second.

So they're reaching the end of their careers, and they're both entered into the last race of the season. Jeff goes to Mutt and says, ""you know what? You're my bestest friend and I love you. I'm ready to retire and I've got no regrets but one -- I've never beat you in a race. In this last race, it would be great if you could let me win."" And Mutt says, ""Well, damn, man. How can I refuse? I'm pretty sure you'll win this next race, trust me.""

So they start the race and Jeff gets out to a fairly sizable lead -- he's pretty far ahead. Mutt's in second a fair bit away, and none of the other horses are even close. But getting to the closing stretch, Mutt starts to pick it up. He goes faster than anyone's ever seen him go before, and while Jeff sprints his hardest, Mutt beats him in a photo finish. Jeff says ""What the hell, man?"" And Mutt says, ""Sorry, man. I couldn't do it."" Jeff's like, ""whatever, man.""

The two of them retire to stud service, and they fall out of contact. They've got good lives, being paid to impregnate all the mares, so it's not like they feel empty. But late at night Jeff's at one of the local bars frequented by all the horses (one of the few that don't say ""WHY THE LONG FACE?  har de harr), and he sees Mutt. Jeff has a bit of a buzz going on and he goes over to Mutt, not even sure what he's going to say.

But Mutt is wasted and speaks first. ""THIS GUY!"" he whinnies loudly. ""I love this guy! Everyone, this is my buddy Jeff! Get this guy a drink!"" Jeff is apprehensive about how drunk Mutt is, but he agrees to share a drink with him and soon they're reminiscing like the old friends they are. ""Man, I've missed you!"" Mutt says. ""I can't believe it's been so long! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!""

Jeff supplies ""You never let me win that race.""

And Mutt goes, ""You're right! Dude, I'm so sorry, I was hearin the siren song of being undefeated. UNDEFEATED, Jeff! But you know, looking back, your friendship was more important than any kind of legacy and I'm sorry.""

And Jeff (who's also a little drunk at this point) says, ""You know what would be great? Like, nothing official, what if we just went to the track right now. We should totally do it. Like, no one would know but us, and we could race and you let me win just once. It would mean a lot to me.""

And Mutt goes, ""Dude, I don't think I could even *hic* beat you right now anyway. Let's do it, man! Let's GO!""

So they get their buddy to drive them to the track (because they're both too wasted to operate a vehicle, especially with hooves), and they hop the fence and take their places on the track. Jeff shouts ""Go!"" and starts running sort of wobbily forward. Mutt takes three steps and falls face first into the dirt. Jeff is doing his best to keep going while Mutt pulls himself to his feet, but when Mutt gets up, it's like he's found a new level of sobriety, and he shoots across the track, beating Jeff comfortably. When Jeff catches up at the finish line, he's like, ""What the hell, man?"" But before Mutt can answer, he throws up and then passes out, drunk.

The two of them stay friends but never talk about the issue again. They get old, and Mutt's not the fastest horse in the world anymore, and Jeff's not the second fastest horse anymore. The two of them are in the twilight of their lives, looking back. And Jeff says to Mutt, ""You know, I don't think we're going to make it past the winter this year. That's all right, though, I've had a great life, and I'm glad that you've been a part of it.""

And Mutt agrees, ""Yeah, in all of our history, you're the only one who I could look at as an equal. Life would have been lonely if not for you.""

And Jeff goes, ""Well, not quite an equal. I never did beat you."" Mutt only nods at this, a little ashamed. And Jeff says, ""You know, I'm almost ready to die. My one regret is never beating you in a race. Do you think -- and this is essentially my dying request -- that we could go out to the track? I think I've got one race left in me. If you could just let me win, I could die satisfied.""

And Mutt says, ""You know, I look back at the young foal who never let you win, and I want to shake him. Talk to him about what's really important -- friendship. I'm so sorry I never let you win before, and this time... yes. Let's go out to the track, run our last race, and you can win.""

So they go out there, take their places, and start going across the track. You can barely tell they started -- they're trudging so slowly. The feeling of competition is still fierce between the two of them, though. They're hyper-aware of their positions, and Jeff pulls out to a bit of a lead. The two of them look at the track like it'll be the hardest thing they ever did just to reach the end, and it may very well be. Their bones are brittle and their stamina is gone. But about halfway through, Mutt starts to walk a little faster -- get almost up to a trot. Jeff tries to speed up, but can't, and when Mutt slowly passes him, Jeff doesn't bother to continue. He just falls down on the ground, exhausted. Ever the competitor, Mutt continues around to the finish line before doubling back to talk to Jeff, who would look dead if not for his faint breathing showing. He may not have much longer -- it's unlikely that he'd ever find the strength to stand again. When Mutt arrives, Jeff struggles to speak:

""Why? Why couldn't you let me win? What is wrong with you? Why is your pride so goddamned important?""

And at this point, a big black dog, who had been watching the race, speaks up. He says, ""You know what? Shame on you, Mutt. If you don't want to let him win, fine. After all, if he can't beat you on his own steam, who's to say he should? But it was wrong of you to lie to him and build his hopes up only to dash them again and again. That is not how a friend behaves, Mutt, and you owe him better than that.""

And Jeff looks hard at Mutt, right in the eye, and says, ""That's stupid. Dogs don't talk.""","There are two horses, Mutt and Jeff, and they're best friends...",11

Every day, he sings the same song that his sister wrote in eight grade. The regulars actively despise him for singing the song every day, but sometimes newcomers enjoy it. 

On one particular day, an executive of a record label comes to the nightclub looking for new talents to sign with him. When he comes across Joe, he is stunned by the talent he saw in him. The regulars laughed as they saw the idiot executive sign with Joe.

However, Joe is soon a rising star in the music industry. Although he only performed a single song, it was almost on the Top 100 songs of that week. People began to request that he write more songs and he agreed.

The problem was that Joe had no idea how to write a song. His manager refused to let him get a songwriter as the song had to come from his heart, like the manager thought the first song did. Joe kept trying to write a good song, but his mind was blank.

Meanwhile, the song suddenly became the top song of the year. Everybody was singing it, but lots of people thought that he was only going to be a one-hit wonder. It all worsened when Joe's sister first heard her brother singing the song.

Joe's sister immediately published proof that she was the one who came up with the song idea and that her brother stole it. Some of the crowd turned on Joe, but the majority of his fans stuck with Joe and defended him, saying that they never would have heard the song if Joe hadn't copied it.

However, this experience was the inspiration that Joe needed to write his own song. He promised his fans that it would be an original song. He worked for days trying to perfect it, and once he was satisfied, he was ready to perform.

He refused to let anybody hear the song before he went out on stage. 

Once he got on the stage he said ""Hey guys, this is a new song that I wrote myself. I wanted to share it with all of you because it reflects what's really in my heart. This song speaks about how I was like and what I did before I became a hit artist after stealing my sister's song. It also speaks to all of you haters out there, who call me a no good thief. Queue the music!"" 

The lights dimmed and the audience became quiet. Then, the music started but it was unexpected. It was one that they were very well familiar with, when Joe started to sing.

""This-post-shit-oh

Care bout' reposts are to kill-o this petite Joe   
They yell ""K"" to nag and cause a Ailed, oh weak Joe  
Parents tell their a-children say 'Not a star, con me Joe?'

Once he was done with his song, the whole crowd started cheering. ""Great performance!"" his manager said, completely ignoring the fact that he ripped off Despacito. ""We don't even need to call this a parody, it's a completely new song!""

Many years past, and Joe became famous in the music industry for plagiarism. However, his fans still continued to defend him saying that ""He did the original writers a favor by spreading their music."" Some songwriters complained that when they first wrote the song, they only got 100,000 hits but Joe was getting billions. 

One day, Joe got sick of the hate. He said ""Fuck this,"" and decided to actually write an original song. It took him years and years to devise this masterpiece and he finally completed it.

When he handed it in to his manager, the manager shook his head. ""This song's a piece of shit"" the manager said. ""But... I spent years working on it"" exclaimed Joe. ""It took 1000x more effort than my other songs"".

The manager looked and him and replied ""Go ahead, put it to the test. Let me know when they laugh you off the stage.""

Once Joe sang the song at his next concert, his ratings plummeted. Everyone disliked his new music and called it boring, long, and meaningless. He left the stage disgraced, and was met by his gloating manager.

The manager started speaking ""You know, they have this saying where I come from. People would rather hear something good a million times than an original piece that was a disaster only once.""

""Was my song really that bad?"" Joe asked, disgraced.

""Yeah, but that's not what I'm talking about"" said the manager. ""This fucking post is a mess of shit that I can't even begin to describe. I have no idea how any of you actually read through that whole thing. There's no punchline except for this and the writer was obviously drunk at noon while writing this. It definitely has tons of grammatical errors and it'll get downvoted to oblivion.
