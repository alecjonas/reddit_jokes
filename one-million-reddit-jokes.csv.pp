off he asked what she'd like to have for her Birthday. 

'I'd like to be six again', she replied, still
looking in the mirror .

On the morning of her Birthday, he arose early, made
her a nice big bowl
of Lucky Charms, and then took her to Six Flags theme
park. What a day!

He put her on every ride in the park; the Death Slide,
the Wall of Fear, the Screaming Monster Roller
Coaster, everything there was.

Five hours later they staggered out of the theme park.
Her head was reeling and her stomach felt upside down.

He then took her to a McDonald's where he ordered her
a Happy Meal with extra fries and a chocolate shake.

Then it was off to a movie, popcorn, a soda pop, and
her favorite candy, M&amp;M's. What a fabulous adventure!

Finally she wobbled home with her husband and collapsed
into bed exhausted.
He leaned over his wife with a big smile and lovingly asked, 'Well Dear,
what was it like being six again?

Her eyes slowly opened and her expression suddenly
changed. 'I meant my dress size, you retard!!!!'

The moral of the story: Even when a man is listening,
he is gonna get it wrong.
",I'd like to be six again,3

By the age of 3 he was reading full newspaper articles and chapter books most kids don't read until middle school and his dad was the proudest dad in the world and wanted to make sure his son knew it.

He went up to his son and said, ""Son, I could never be more proud of you. I am going to go out and get you a present and it can be anything you want.""

The son sat there for a second thinking and said, ""Dad, I really want a pink ping pong ball."" The dad was rather confused by this but decided to go get his son the ball anyways.

As he was in line to check out with the ball he thought to himself, ""Nah he doesn't actually want a stupid ping pong ball"" so he went and got him an R/C car instead. The son was the happiest kid in the world and was so excited to get his new toy and gave his dad the biggest hug he could and the dad sat there smiling.

A couple years later when the son took standardized tests in elementary school he got a perfect score on every exam and his dad was the proudest dad in the world and wanted to make sure his son knew it.

He went up to his son and said, ""Son, I could never be more proud of you. I am going to go out and get you a present and it can be anything you want.""

The son sat there for a second thinking and said, ""Dad, I really want a pink ping pong ball."" The dad was still confused about his sons request but agreed and left to get the son his ball.

As he was about to check out with the ping pong ball he thought to himself, ""Nah my son doesn't really want this"" and went back and got him a brand new Xbox.

When he got home and gave the present to his son the son was ecstatic and jumped up and down and gave his dad the biggest hug he could and the dad sat there with a smile on his face.

Fast forward a couple years and the son is now graduating high school. Top of his class, full ride to whatever school he wanted (Yale for anyone who cares about that detail), graduated with just about every honor you could think of and his dad was the proudest dad in the world and wanted to make sure his son knew it.

He went up to his son and said, ""Son, I could never be more proud of you. I am going to go out and get you a present and it can be anything you want.""

The son sat there for a second thinking and said, ""Dad, I really want a pink ping pong ball."" The dad was yet again confused by his son's odd request but agreed to get the ball.

On his way to the store the dad passed by a motorcycle dealership and thought to himself, ""Nah my son really doesn't that stupid ping pong ball when he can have a brand new motorcycle."" And so the dad bought the new bike for his son and the son was the happiest son in the world and gave his dad the biggest hug he could before hopping on the bike. The dad sat there with a smile on his face as he watched his son drive off.

A couple weeks later, the mom and dad are sitting at the table eating lunch when they receive a troubling phone call. As they heard the call both of their faces started to turn pale, the son was in a terrible crash and was not expected to live through the rest of the day. The two rushed down to the hospital as soon as they could and they hurried to their son's room. When they got there they were happy to see the son was still conscious. The parents rushed to either side of the bed and the dad took his son's hand and looked him in the face and said, ""Son, you have been the best child that anyone could ever ask for and I could never be more proud of you.""

The son smiled and said, ""Thanks dad.""

""I do have one question for you though.""

The son looked up at his old man and said, ""Anything for you Dad.""

""Why did you always want that pink ping pong ball?""

The son smiled and said, ""Well I always wanted it bec-""

Then he died.

post,5sbp3d,2qh72,jokes,false,1486349857,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5sbp3d/the_tramps_holiday/,self.jokes,,"There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would you like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

till the ocean grew dim...

and the earth itself...

began to shrink...

past our moon...

and on...

and Mars...

and on...

higher, and higher...

through the asteroid belt...

and on and on towards the diving board...

past the outer planets, until...

on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...

he reached the board.

He climbed on top and radioed the captain...

and then...

he jumped.

Slowly at first,

but speeding up,

faster, and faster,

speeding past Pluto,

and the other outer planets,

through the asteroid belt,

past Mars,

and the moon,

faster,

and faster,

faster - ever faster,

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster,

past the albatross,

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

DOWN!

THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!

THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL.........

SMASH!

Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping...

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...

I'm a just poor tramp...

so you must understand...

I've been through many a hard ship in my life.""

The king was polite and considerate, he replied: ""I hold the palace meteorologist in high regard. He is an extensively educated and experienced professional, and I pay him very high wages. He gave me a very different forecast. I trust him and I will continue on my way."" So they did.
However, a short time later a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King and Queen were totally soaked and their entourage chuckled upon seeing them in such a shameful condition.

Furious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to execute the weatherman at once! He summoned the farmer and offered him the prestigious and high paying role of royal forecaster.

The farmer said, ""Your Majesty, I do not know anything about forecasting. I obtain my information from my donkey. If I see his ears drooping, it means with certainty that it will rain."" So the King hired the donkey on the spot.

And thus began the ancient practice of hiring asses to work in government and occupy its highest and most influential positions..",Donkey weatherman,95

As the old man drove home he came across an old country store. So he decided to go in and find his wife a gift.

As the old man browsed through the store he came to a large assortment of nuts, so the old man looked to the young clerk and asked ""how much is a pound of walnuts"", the young clerk replied ""they are 7.95"". ""Jesus Christ good gracious"" the old man said, then he looked and said, ""what about a pound of your pecans""?

The young clerk said "" they are 7.24 sir"", ""son of a bitch, how the hell"" the old man exclaimed. Finally the old man found a plain old bag of goobernuts and he asked the clerk, ""ok how much are the goobernuts"", the clerk said ""they are 4.94"".

The old man shaking his head scooped himself a pound of goober nuts and took them up to the register, although the old man had done nothing but complain he said to the young clerk, "" I just want to thank you young man, I appreciate how kind you have been. I know that I have a very strange voice and often times people tend to mock me."" 

The young clerk merely shook his head "" no I want to thank you sir, most people tend to treat me different because of my long and Bulbous nose.""

He is happy to find the bus goes express, and he gets to his apartment building in record time. He walks up the four flights of stairs, thinking about how lucky he is to see his wife and drink a cold beer. He reaches his door but finds it locked. He knocks, and as he leans in he hears his wife moaning, along with the sounds of some guy. Well, he goes red with rage and starts pounding on the door. After a minute his wife opens the door, a blanket wrapped around her naked body. ""It's not what you think!"" she screams, but he ignores her, pushing past to see if he can find the guy. The apartment is only one room, with a bathroom off to the side, so there's not a lot of places to hide. The husband looks under the bed, peeks into the shower, but can't find the guy. Then he notices the window is open. He runs over, looks out, and sees a guy in his shorts hanging from the window below him. The husband starts yelling, ""I'll kill you!"", pulling tools off his belt and throwing them at the guy, until the guy suddenly loses his grip and falls. But since the fall is only three stories, when he lands he only breaks his legs. The husband is furious. He looks around for something to throw, and the closest and biggest thing he finds is the fridge. He pulls it to the window and then pushes it out, and it falls right on the guy, killing him instantly. However, in doing this, the husband works himself up so much he has a heart attack and also dies. 


The next thing he knows the husband is standing in line at the pearly gates. Saint Peter beckons him forward and asks, ""Well my son, how did you die?""

""Well,"" replies the husband "" I came home from a hard day at work and found my wife cheating on me. I was so angry that when I found the guy hanging outside the window I threw things at him until he fell. However, he only broke his legs, and I wasn't satisfied, so instead I grabbed the fridge and pushed it out onto him. But in doing this, I had a heart attack, and here I am.""

""Oh boy."" Replied Saint Peter ""Well, while I'm sad that your wife was not true, it is wrong to kill. I'm afraid you have to go to hell."" With that, the husband is ushered off to hell. 

Saint Peter looks at the next man in line and beckons him forward. ""And how did you die, my son?""

The guy looks perplexed. ""It was the strangest thing, sir. I was sitting at home trying to work out, but my apartment is so small I have to be creative and do pull ups outside my window. Well, I was doing this like normal, when all of a sudden a crazy guy starts throwing things at me. I lost my grip and fell, and somehow by God's grace, I didn't die! I started thanking God, but then the guy suddenly pushed out a fridge, and it landed directly on me!""

Saint Peter scratches his head. ""I am sorry, son. You lived a good life, and as a reward, you get to go to heaven."" And with that, the guy is ushered to heaven.

Suddenly he woke up with a quiver and saw a beardy old man with a cowl beside him.
""Who are you and what the hell are you doing in my bedroom?"" he screamed.
""We are no longer in your bedroom."" ""I'm saint peter and you are in heaven, Johnny.""
""What? I'm dead? But I'm too young to die!"" ""If I'm dead, I demand you to take me back!"" Said Johnny.
Saint Peter scratched his beard. 
""It's not that easy. There's going to be a lot of paper work if we're going to
send anyone back... But sure. You can go back, but only as either a fish or a hen.""
Johnny never liked swimming, his only option was the hen, and after all, the though of being one wasn't too bad according to him. If he can find another nice rooster he may as well have a good life. 
""I want to be a hen."" He said.
As in a blink of an eye Johnny was in a chicken farm, feathered
and neighbouring. Everything seemed fine except he had a 
celestial pressure in his ass. He saw the farm rooster running towards him. 
""Hey, you must be the new hen. What's up? Asked the farm rooster.
""Hello! I'm fine, but I feel an immense pain in my ass."" said Johan.
""That's the ovulation... You've never had an egg, right?""
""Nope, so... how do I do it?""
""Just cackle twice and then squeeze."" Said the rooster.
Johnny cackled twice and pinched. Bam, there was the egg 
lying on the ground. Wow, though Johnny. This was cool.
He cackled again and pinched, another egg!
The third time he cackled he heard his wife crying, ""Wake up
for gods sake, you are shitting down the entire bed!""
**Moral of story: Don't trust anything just cause a hefty rooster
said something.**

post,5s9crk,2qh72,jokes,false,1486322995,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5s9crk/the_dancing_cookie/,self.jokes,,"There was a truck driver that worked for a cookie company. Each week, he would load up his truck with cookies from the factory and make the three-day-long journey to the buyer. He would unload all the cookies and make the three-day-long drive back to the factory. He'd been working at the company for years, and was quite reputable.

One day, he loaded up his trailer and hit the road. After driving for hours, he stopped at a truck stop and inspected his cargo as he normally would, just to make sure everything's okay. When he opened up the doors, there was a hole in one of the packages! He looked around the trailer and his eyes landed on a cookie, walking around the boxes! The driver couldn't believe it, but grabbed the cookie, stuffed it back in the box and taped it shut. ""That should take care of it,"" he thought. After getting a cup of coffee, he started driving again. 

When he stopped for the night, the driver thought that he better check and make sure that cookie wasn't out of the box again. He opened the doors again, saw the broken box and a cookie doing the Charleston! The driver thought he was going insane, but there it was; a dancing cookie. He brought out the duct tape and sealed the cookie back in the box, then went to bed.

The next morning, the truck driver woke up a the crack of dawn, thinking that last night's events were only a dream. After getting a bagel and coffee from a restaurant, he started up his truck and hit the road, jamming to the radio. Once he was fully awake, he remembered the cookie and realized it wasn't a dream. Slamming on the brakes, he took the nearest off ramp from the highway, swung the trailer doors open. Lo and behold, the cookie box had a new hole in it, and the cookie was leading a one cookie conga line on top! Furious, the driver snatched the cookie up, crammed it into the box, and covered the entire box in tape. Pleased that he wouldn't have to worry about the cookie again, he kept driving until the sun went down.

On the third day, after a peaceful night's sleep, the truck driver started on the last leg of the journey to the buyer. He didn't even check the trailer for the cookie, being sure that it couldn't get through the tape. 

When he finally arrived at his destination, the driver checked in at the office and backed his truck up to the loading dock. As the unloading staff opened the doors, a small brown object fell out of a box. They didn't notice anything until they had unloaded a few boxes; one of the boxes was covered in tape and had a hole in it! Thinking it may have been caused by mice, they called over their supervisor. After taking one look, the supervisor called the driver's company, explained what happened, hung up and spoke two small words to the driver:

""You're fired.""

Devastated, the driver didn't know what to do. He grabbed the offending box and stepped back into his eighteen-wheeler and sat there for a minute, in shock. Something caught his eye on the dashboard. It was the cookie, doing the moonwalk. The driver didn't make an effort to put the cookie back into the box, it didn't matter any more.

He drove to the beach, took the box of cookies, and sat at the end of a pier with the cookie next to him, tap dancing. ""I hope you're happy,"" he said to the cookie. ""You got me fired from a job I worked at for years, a job I was happy doing. Now what am I supposed to do?"" The cookie didn't look at him and kept dancing. The driver became madder and madder. ""You think that's funny? How about THIS?!"" He hollered as he kicked the cookie box and cookie off the dock into the ocean.

Isn't that a crumby ending?",The Dancing Cookie,0

He went to the beach, completely undressed and buried himself in the sand, except for his penis, which he left sticking out. 
Two old ladies were strolling along the beach, one using a cane. Upon seeing the penis sticking up over the sand, she began to move it around with her cane, remarking to the other lady, ""There's no justice in the world."" 
The other lady asked what she meant and she said: ""When I was 20, I was curious about it.

When I was 40, I asked for it.
When I was 50, I paid for it.

A few weeks go by without  any bites, but one day a man comes in.  The man had a hunched back and no arms, so the bishop was leary of his ability to perform the job, but the Lord teaches love and acceptance of all.  He says to the man, ""if you can climb into the tower and ring the bell, the position is yours.""  

Elated, the armless man runs up the tower stairs, bypassing the rope that one would normally use, but that he was unable to manipulate.  At the top of the stairs, there was ladder to get into the belfry.  Without hesitation, he climbs the ladder using his teeth, and beams as he looks upon the church's bell.  He backs into the corner of the belfry, takes a deep breath, and runs at the bell full speed.  He slams into the bell, it swings and tolls beautifully.   The bishop kept his word and awarded the man the job.

Weeks go by, and all seems right with the world.  The armless man enjoys his new life, but sometimes, he gets a little dizzy tolling the higher hours.  One day, while performing his duty to mark noon, he misses the bell altogether and sails out the far side of the tower.  He falls to his death, and a crowd gathers around the body.  In the general murmur, a voice calls out, ""does anyone know this man?""  Another replies...

""No, but his face sure rings a bell!""

With a heavy heart, the bishop places out the sign once more, advertising the open position.  Again, weeks pass without a single taker, until another man arrives.  His resemblance to the previous man is uncanny.  A hunched back, no arms, and nearly identical in appearance.  The bishop is dubious, fearful of a repeat of the recent tragedy, but the man falls to his knees, weeping and pleading, and against his better judgement, the bishop makes him the same offer.  The hunchback climbs into the belfry, backs into the corner, runs and tolls the bell, claiming the job.

To ensure the new ringer's safety, the bishop commissions the installation of bars across the open sides of the tower, and life continues on.  Over the next few years, the hunchback enjoys his life within the cathedral.   He is well cared for, and happy to perform his duty, though the midday ringings do tend to take their toll, and like his predecessor, he misses once in a while, but the bars give him security.  Unfortunately, the bars are not maintained, they rust, and at last, they give.  The armless man tumbles out of the tower and falls to his death.  Once more, a crowd gathers, and again, someone calls out, ""does anyone know this man?""  And a voice replies...

""No, but he sure is a dead ringer for his brother!""","Long ago, there was a cathedral...",65

He proceeded to tell them about the newly designated shitting area. After the 20th day there was so much shit gathered at the bow that the ark began to tilt, leaving the stern raised making it near impossible to play pool.

It then felt the warmth of the dung, far warmer that it's former place and began to enjoy the warmth and felt quite happy and began to sing.

Now a hawk that had also decided to take shelter in the barn wakes up to the sound of the bird singing. It sees the bird and swoops down and grabs it before washing it in a tub of water to clean off the bits of dung on it. The bird was feeling thankful for being pulled out of the cooling dung until the hawk just ate it.

Now this story has two morals;

1. Who ever puts you in trouble(shit) isn't necessarily a bad person nor is the one who pulls you out of the trouble a good person.

So they look into the problem, and realise that, although the showers themselves are fast enough, the prisoners actually spend a suspiciously long amount of time drying themselves - causing another possible security threat. The managers then hit on the idea of installing a sort of drying cubicle next to the shower, where each prisoner would enter, be assailed by strong blasts of air from all directions, and be fully dry within half a minute, thus leaving them with no excuse to loiter in the shower.

So they install these drying boxes for the prisoners, and at first they seem to be a great success. However, although the machines worked, they were so powerful that they caused a lot of noise, even from outside of the boxes, and - this is important - the noise could be heard in the managers' offices. So the managers decided to find another solution, and remove the drying machines, because they couldn't do any work with that cacophony happening every evening.

When the technician eventually arrives at the prison to remove the machines, he seems rather reluctant for some reason, but the managers insist he does the deed. However, the moment they are disconnected, there's a massive electricity failure throughout the entire complex, leading to all the prisoners escaping due to lack of electric security systems.

Of course, the managers are outraged, and start shouting at the technician: ""What the hell did you do? I told you to remove those damn drying boxes, not let all the inmates escape!""

The technician says, calmly, ""I thought you knew what would happen if those drying machines were removed...""

This does nothing to assuage the managers' anger, and they keep demanding an explanation as to why they should have known that there would be a power cut. After several minutes of argument, they finally get one.

""Don't you remember?"", says the technician. ""The mighty con drier is the powerhouse of the cell...""",A prison decides to renovate its showers,140

A mouse sees the cheese sandwich and decides to wait for the hunter to shoot so that the sandwich will fall and he can get it.

post,5s1n6i,2qh72,jokes,false,1486227411,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5s1n6i/the_european_vacation/,self.jokes,,"Bob Hill and his new wife Betty were vacationing in Europe, as it happens, near Transylvania. They were driving in a rental car along a rather deserted highway. It was late, and raining very hard. Bob could barely see 20 feet in front of the car. 

Suddenly the car skids out of control! Bob attempts to control the car, but to no avail! The car swerves and smashes into a tree. 

Moments later, Bob shakes his head to clear the fog. Dazed, he looks over at the passenger seat and sees his wife unconscious, with her head bleeding! Despite the rain and unfamiliar countryside, Bob knows he has to carry her to the nearest phone. 

Bob carefully picks his wife up and begins trudging down the road. After a short while, he sees a light. He heads towards the light, which is coming from an old, large house. He approaches the door and knocks. 

A minute passes. A small, hunched man opens the door. Bob immediately blurts, ""Hello, my name is Bob Hill, and this is my wife Betty. We've been in a terrible accident, and my wife has been seriously hurt. Can I please use your phone??"" 

""I'm sorry,"" replied the hunchback, ""but we don't have a phone. My master is a Doctor; come in and I will get him!"" 

Bob brings his wife in. An elegant man comes down the stairs. ""I'm afraid my assistant may have misled you. I am not a medical doctor; I am a scientist. However, it is many miles to the nearest clinic, and I have had a basic medical training. I will see what I can do. Igor, bring them down to the laboratory."" 

With that, Igor picks up Betty and carries her downstairs, with Bob following closely. Igor places Betty on a table in the lab. Bob collapses from exhaustion and his own injuries, so Igor places Bob on an adjoining table. 

After a brief examination, Igor's master looks worried. ""Things are serious, Igor. Prepare a transfusion."" Igor and his master work feverishly, but to no avail. Bob and Betty Hill are no more. 

The Hills' deaths upset Igor's master greatly. Wearily, he climbs the steps to his conservatory, which houses his grand piano. For it is here that he has always found solace. He begins to play, and a stirring, almost haunting, melody fills the house. 

Meanwhile, Igor is still in the lab tidying up. His eyes catch movement, and he notices the fingers on Betty's hand twitch. Stunned, he watches as Bob's arm begins to rise! He is further amazed as Betty sits straight up! 

Unable to contain himself, he dashes up the stairs to the conservatory. He bursts in and shouts to his master: 

""Master, Master! ... The Hills are alive with the sound of music! ",The European Vacation,44

Mike's break is over soon after that, and he returns only to find the celebrity dead, the bodyguard dead, and the beautiful mermaid standing over them with a pistol. She aims the pistol at Mike.

""Just one last thing before I die- why?"" asks Mike. ""I heard it was a *merman* plotting to assassinate the celebrity.""

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.

Finally, the son said, ""Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.""

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, ""If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.""

And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.

The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.

""Father,"" replied the son, ""I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.""

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, ""If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.""

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.

The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.

""Father,"" said the son to this, ""I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.""

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. ""A carton of pink ping pong balls?""

""A carton of pink ping pong balls,"" the boy confirmed.

""I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,"" said the father, ""but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have."" And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.

""Dear son,"" said the father, ""I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?""

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. ""Please humour me, dear father.""

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. ""Dearest father,"" the son started, ""I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls."" One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.

""Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible."" It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.

""Father,"" the son said, ""You've made me very happy yet again."" That night, the son spent on board the tanker.

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.

His father visited the young man in hospital. ""My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?""

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. ""Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.""

The father held his son's hand tightly. ""Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.""

""Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.""

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.

""Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.""

The son nodded weakly.

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.

""Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,"" the father requested.

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.

""I-"" the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.

""I- I-""

Then he died.",A day before his 15th birthday,862

As they talked, her robe slipped open, and it was obvious that she had nothing else on. The poor kid broke into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact.

After a few minutes of flirting, she placed her hand on his arm and said, ""Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming.""

He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely. Now nude, she purred at him, ""What would you say is my best feature?""

Flustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, ""It has to be your ears.""

Astounded, and a little hurt she asked, ""My ears? Look at these breasts; they are a full 38 inches and 100 percent natural. I work out every day and my ass is firm and solid. I have a 28 inch waist. Look at my skin, not a blemish anywhere, how can you say the best part of my body is my ears?""

The occasion was our 22nd anniversary and I was looking for a little something extra for my wife, Toni. What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse-sized taser. The effects of the taser were suppose to be short lived, with no long-term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreat to safety.... WAY TOO COOL!   Long story short, I bought the device and brought it home. I loaded two triple-a batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing! I was disappointed. I learned, however, that if I pushed the button AND pressed it against a metal surface at the same time; I'd get the blue arch of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs.   Awesome!!!   Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Toni what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave.   Okay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it couldn't be all that bad with only two triple-a batteries,... right?  
 
There I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh &amp; blood moving target. I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and thought better of it. She is such a sweet cat. But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised. Am I wrong?   So, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, taser in another.
 
The directions said that a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant; a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water. Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries.   All the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5"" long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference; pretty cute really and loaded with two itsy, bitsy triple-a batteries) thinking to myself, ""no possible way!""   What happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best.....   I'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one side as to say, ""don't do it master,"" reasoning that a one-second burst from such a tiny little ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.... I decided to give myself a one-second burst just for the heck of it.
 
I touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and HOLY MOTHER, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION@!@$$!% !@*!!!   I'm pretty sure Jessie Ventura ran in through the side door, picked me up in the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and tingling in my legs. The cat was standing over me making meowing sounds I had never heard before, licking my face, undoubtedly thinking to herself, ""do it again, do it again!""   Note: If you ever feel compelled to ""mug"" yourself with a taser, one note of caution: there is no such thing as a one-second burst when you zap yourself. You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor. A three second burst would be considered conservative.   SON-OF-A- ... that hurt like hell!!!
 
A minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thing at that point), collected my wits (what little I had left), sat up and surveyed the landscape. My bent reading glasses were on the mantle of the fireplace. How did they get up there??? My triceps, right thigh and both nipples were still twitching. My face felt like it had been shot up with Novacaine, and my bottom lip weighed 88 lbs. I'm still looking for my testicles. I'm offering a significant reward for their safe return.   Still in shock...",MY DAD....,0

After the check was delivered the gentleman pulled out his wallet and dumped the exact amount of money to cover the bill and still leave a generous whole number tip. Bewildered, but not wanting to be rude, the waitress again said nothing.
The third night the man came in with his ostrich once more, ordered an appetizer, some more drinks, and two more entrees different than before. The waitress brought over the check again and watched closely as the man pulled open his wallet and dumped the contents out, which as expected before, was the perfect amount.
""How do you do it??"" She asked, curiosity getting the best of her.
""Well if you believe me, I once was trapped in the desert close to death when I stumbled upon a magic lamp. The genie inside granted me 3 wishes! My 1st wish was to get out the desert so I'd live. The 2nd was to have a wallet that would always have the exact amount of money that I need...""
The waitress interrupted excitedly: ""And your 3rd wish was for a magic ostrich?!""
The man laughed, ""No my dear, it was for a chick with long legs!""",A guy walks into a bar with an ostrich...,21

I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.
Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.
She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

post,5ryd6k,2qh72,jokes,false,1486176869,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5ryd6k/the_penguin_collector/,self.jokes,,"So, there's this guy. This guy collects penguins. He doesn't collect penguin statues or toys or anything, he collects real, living penguins. Penguins of all sorts, Emperor Penguins, King Penguins, Little Penguins, African Penguins, all the penguins. 

Now, these penguins live all over his house. In his bathtub, sink, toilet, fridge, freezer, penguins everywhere. His house is practically bursting with these penguins.

 The mans wife is obviously not impressed with the amount of penguins her husband has.

""Honey,"" she said to him, ""You have got to get rid of all these penguins. We have no room to live. We can no longer afford to have nice things, not only do the penguins ruin everything we own, but we can hardly afford to feed the penguins. You have to get rid of them.""

""I can't do that!"" The man replied. ""I love these penguins. They are like family to me!""

""Either they go, or I go!"" She stated.

After pondering this ultimatum for a while the man decides that he does, indeed, love his wife more than all his penguins put together. But what to do with all these penguins? 

""Why don't you donate them to the County Zoo?"" His wife asked.

""Great idea! I'll call them tomorrow.""

""Honey, you better call them now. I cannot go one more day with these penguins living here.""

The man, saddened by his failed attempt to keep the penguins at least one more day, begrudgingly picks up the phone.

""Hello, County Zoo, how may I help you?"" Spoke the cheery voice on the phone.

 The man took a deep breath and spoke slowly. 

""Hello, I'd like to speak to the person in charge of accepting donations please.""

The receptionist on the other end of the line could hear the sadness in his voice. 

""I'll connect you right away sir"" 

The phone was silent for a minute. The man hoped that no one would be connected, that perhaps he could have one last day with the penguins.

""Hello, County Zoo donation office. How may I assist you?""

 The man's heart sank ""Hello, I have a very large collection of penguins I would like to donate.""

""Penguins?""

""Yes, penguins.""

""Like, real penguins?""

""Yes, real penguins.""

""That's fantastic!!"" The donation coordinator exclaimed ""We have been trying to get penguins here for a long time! We have an area all set up, but no penguins to live there!""

The man smiled to himself. This person seemed very excited to get these penguins. At least they would be going to a happy home and they wouldn't be too far away so he could go visit. 

""My wife says I need to get rid of them today""

""Fantastic! Come on down anytime, we will be waiting!""

It was settled. The many attached his trailer to his truck and started loading up the penguins. After spending an hour counting the penguins to make sure he had them all the man closed the trailer door and stared to drive to the County Zoo. The man got about halfway there and sure enough he got a flat tire.

""Damn it!!"" The man thought to himself. ""The County Zoo is almost closed, how will I explain to my wife if I come home with all these penguins."" 

It was at that point that the man saw another truck coming down the road. He flagged the truck down.

""Sir you have to help me! I need to get these penguins to the County Zoo. They are about to close soon and my wife will kill me if I don't take these penguins to the County Zoo today.""

""You want me to take these penguins to the County Zoo?"" replied the stranger.

""Yes! Please! I'll pay for you to take them to the County Zoo. How about $500. Is that enough for you to take them?""

The stranger took the money.

""Yeah, that should be enough.""

So the two men loaded up the strangers truck with all the penguins and off the stranger went.

After a while the man finally got his truck fixed and off he went to the County Zoo. When he got there though the County Zoo was closed. The man started banging on the gate and yelling until a security guard showed up.

""What is your problem?"" Scoffed the security guard.

""Please tell me, did my penguins arrive safely, are they all there? May I see them in their new home?"" Pleaded the man.

""Penguins? We were excepting some penguins, but we never got them.""

""WHAT!?!"" The man was furious!! ""That jerk stole all my penguins and my $500 was a rude person!!""

""Sorry, sir.""

The man needed a way to blow off steam. He decided to drive around for a while before going home to his wife.

After, maybe, 30-40 minutes the man sees the stranger from earlier. There he was. Walking down the street with a row of penguins following him, far as the eye can see.

The man slammed on his breaks.

He hopped out of his car.

He approached the stranger and said,

""Hey! Jerk! How dare you! How dare you steal my $500 and not take the penguins to the County Zoo!""

""Oh."" Said the stranger. I already took them to the County Zoo. I had money left over so I was taking them to the movie theatre.""

“I’m sorry,” said the stewardess, “you hitchhikers will have to be last.”  This seemed fair enough, so the hitchers waited until everyone else had jumped.

“Crickey, looks like we get the last two chutes mate” said the Aussie.  

Just then the President came along. He was running late as he had been watching the drama unfold on Fox. “Sorry,” he said. “But I am a great great man, one of the best men. I am the brains of America. The country can’t survive without me so I will need one of the chutes.” And so saying, he strapped on a pack and leapt from the plane.

“What should we do now?” the Mexican asked the Aussie. “There are two of us and only one parachute.”

He was a part of people’s lives, from their first prom, to valentines gifts, birthdays, weddings, and even funerals -- he loved his work, and the town loved him. Life for him, his wife Susan, his mom Louis, and their three kids John Jr (JJ), Alexis, and Peter was perfect.

All that changed though when one day, right across the street, a new shop opened: Holy Brothers Holy Flowers. Intrigued, he went over to introduce himself. Turns out two Friars had recently left their order to open a flower store. They were elderly gentleman who had spent decades tending the garden at their Friary, but ultimately wanted to go live in the outside world. John was friendly, and thought to himself “well, I’m sure this town can support two florists,” so we went back to his store and thought nothing more of it. 

But as time went on more and more people started going to Holy Flowers. A rumor had gotten started that the flowers were blessed, and that you’d get good luck by going there. Sales dropped for John, money got tight, and he started to accrue debt. Finally, nobody came into his store at all any more.

One day, out of desperation, he went across the street to talk to the friars. He said “guys, I need you to move your store. My family has owned this place for five generations and I’m going to lose it.” The friars told him to fuck off.

He went home and told his wife. Thinking a womans touch might help, she went to talk to the friars. “My family is going to lose our home, please move to the next town over.” She was again told to fuck off.

In a moment of despair, they sent their children to go plead their case. JJ, Alexis, and Peter went to see the Friars. “Please sirs, or parents are losing everything, you have to help us out.” They too were told to fuck off.

Next, John’s mother Louis, a kindly, persuasive, but tough woman went to talk to them. She was told to fuck off.

Sitting in his dusty empty store John contemplated his failings while he killed a bottle of cheap whiskey. His store, his future, he’s lost all of it. Sitting in a stupor, a thought drifted into his mind. He remembered an old family – acquaintance. He picked up the phone and called the man, a huge (probably former felon) guy named Hugh. Nobody knew exactly what Hugh did, but he wasn’t a good guy. John’s dad had done Hugh a favor once so they were in his good graces, but this was a man to be respected and feared. 

John explained the situation to Hugh over the phone, who simply said “I’ll deal with it” and hung up the phone. 

Two days later Holy Flowers closed. No explanation, no closing sale, the just shut their doors, drove out of town as fast as they could, leaving everything behind. Customers started coming back to John, and he lived happily ever after.

The moral of the story? Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.",John owned the local florist shop.,235

""Voo-Doo Dick?"" his wife asked. ""What is that?""

""You'll see,"" he smirked. ""Just have fun. It's special.""

The next night, she decides to try it out. The directions read, ""Voo-Doo Dick responds to your every wish! Just say the name twice and then say where you want it to please you. To make it stop, say 'Cid Ood-Oov return,' and Voo-Doo Dick returns to its bed to sleep again.""

She took off her clothes. To test it out, she said, ""Voo-Doo Dick, Voo-Dick. My neck."" Voo-Doo Dick began to vibrate and floated to her neck and gave her the best neck message she ever had.

She said, ""Cid Ood-Oov return,"" and Voo-Doo Dick floated back to its box quietly.

She said, ""Voo-Doo Dick, Voo-Doo Dick, my breasts."" Voo-Doo Dick once again floated to her and stimulated her nipples until she was turned on more than she had ever been.

After several minutes of that, she said, ""Voo-Doo Dick, Voo-Doo Dick... my pussy."" Voo-Doo Dick moved down from her breasts and began to fuck her better than she had ever been before. She had orgasm after orgasm until she'd had enough.

But she couldn't remember the safe phrase to call off Voo-Doo Dick. She tried looking for the instructions, but she couldn't find the paper and the constant vibrating and intense orgasms still hitting her wouldn't let her think.

Finally, she decided she had to get medical help. Voo-Doo Dick was still going at it. She clumsily put on a robe, got into her car, and headed toward the hospital to try to get it removed.

She weaved back and forth all over the highway as more orgasms overwhelmed her as she drove. A few miles from the hospital, a highway patrol car pulled her over.

""What in the world is going on with you, lady?"" yelled the patrolman when he got to her window. ""You must be drunk, weaving all over the road. All you look damn near naked.""

She explained what happened and that she was going to the hospital for help.

Next, he takes to twitter “This fish isn’t man enough to face me on board this boat. Sad!” The fish isn’t swayed. So finally, Trump shouts “I will send in a Navy SEAL team to kill your entire family!” The fish is scared and quickly jumps on the boat.

Before even taking it off the line, Trump picks the fish up and holds it high above his head. He squeezes its bladder down onto face.

Trump notices Putin looking on in disgust and says, “What? You knew I love Russian hookers pissing on my face.”",Vladimir Putin takes Donald Trump fishing out on the black sea...,0
