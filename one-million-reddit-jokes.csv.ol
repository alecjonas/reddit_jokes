ied to ignore it, but the voice was persistent... ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas.""

The next day, he was hearing the voice over and over and over again. It was louder than ever. ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas.""

Finally, the guy snaps. ""Fuckit!""

He goes up to his boss, tells him to take this job and shove it up his ass, then walks out. He goes home and contacts a realtor, and sells the house the next day. He packs up the cash in a suitcase, buys a plane ticket, and flies to Vegas. After he walks out of the airport and says, ""Alright, now what?"" ""Go to Caesar's Palace.""

The guy hails a taxi and immediately goes to Caesar's Palace. As soon as he walks into the front door, he hears the voice again. ""Go to the roulette table."" The guy goes to the nearest roulette table. ""Put it all on red 21."" The guy takes all of his money and puts it on red 21.

The croupier spins the wheel, and the ball goes round and round, and finally lands on black 35.

The voice says, ""FUCK!""
",Quit Your Job. Sell Your House. Go to Vegas.,6

Unfortunately, as soon as he starts to draw a crowd, a zoo keeper grabs him and drags him into his office.

The zoo keeper explains to the mime that the zoo's most popular attraction, a gorilla has died suddenly and the keeper fears that attendance at the zoo will
fall off. He offers the mime a job to dress up as the gorilla until they can get another one. The mime accepts.

So the next morning the mime puts on the gorilla suit and enters the cage before crowd comes. He discovers that it's a great job. He can sleep all he wants, play and make fun of people and he draws bigger crowds than he ever did as a mime.

However, eventually the crowds tire of him and he tires of just swinging on tires. He begins to notice that the people are paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to his. Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience, he climbs to the top of his cage, crawls across a partition, and dangles from the top to the lion's cage. Of course, this makes the lion furious, but the crowd loves it.

At the end of the day the zoo keeper comes and gives the mime a raise for being such a good attraction. Well, this goes on for some time, the mime keeps taunting the lion, the crowds
grow larger, and his salary keeps going up. 

Then one terrible day when he is
dangling over the furious lion he slips and falls. The mime is terrified. The lion gathers itself and prepares to pounce. The mime is so scared that he begins to run round and round the cage with the lion close behind. Finally, the mime starts screaming and yelling, ""Help, Help me!"", but the lion is quick and pounces.

The mime soon finds himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion and the lion says, ""Shut up you idiot! Do you want to get us both fired?""",The Mime's new job,32

He directed a nearby Air Force base that will be opened and that all eligible young men and women be invited.

As he and his staff were standing near a brand new F-15 Fighter, a pair of twin brothers who looked like they had just stepped off a Marine Corps recruiting poster walked up to them. The chief of staff walked up to them, stuck out his hand and introduced himself.

He looked at the first young man and asked, ""Son, what skills can you bring to the Air Force?"" 
The young man looks at him and says, ""I'm a pilot!"" 

The general gets all excited, turns to his aide and says, ""Get him in today, all the paper work done, everything, do it!"" 

The aide hustles the young man off. The general looks at the second young man and asked, ""What skills to you bring to the Air Force?"" 
The young man says, ""I chop wood!"" 

""Son,"" the general replies, ""we don't need wood choppers in the Air Force, what do you know how to do?"" 

""I chop wood!"" 

""Young man,"" huffs the general, ""you are not listening to me, we don't need wood choppers, this is the 20th century!""

Finally, the young lady said, ""You know, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but when is the last time you had sex?""

""1955, ma'am.""

""Well, there you are. You really need to chill out and quit taking everything so seriously!? I mean, no sex since 1955!?""

a private room where she proceeded to ""relax"" him several times. Afterwards, panting for breath, she leaned against his bare chest and
said,

""Hello. I am the Viper. And I am coming to your apartment soon."" Then the person hung up.  
The woman didn't know what to think. She went and locked her front door, but was also prepared to write it off as a joke from a bored man.  
10 minutes later, she receives another phone call from the same number. She picks it up. ""Who are you?""  
""I am the Viper. And I am at your building. I'm coming up."" He hangs up.  
The woman panics and calls her best friend. She quickly explains the scary phone calls and asks for advice.  
Her friend says, ""Make sure everything is locked, including the windows. If he calls back, call the police right after.""  
The woman checks everything and then sits on her sofa, heart racing, waiting for something to happen. When the phone rang again, she jumped a little and then answered it. "".... Hello?""  
""Hello. I am the Viper. I am on the 2nd floor. I will be at your apartment shortly.""  
The woman hangs up before he can and calls the police. They assure her they are on the way and to try and arm herself if she has anything that can protect herself if need be.  
The woman grabs a kitchen knife and waits by her front door.  
Someone knocks on the front door.  
Praying it's the police, she calls out, ""Hello?""  
No reply.  
She looks through the peephole. She can't see anyone. She slides the chain into place and carefully opens the door.  
Looking down, she sees the shortest man she's ever seen in her entire life. The man looks up at her.

when he noticed a priest who had stepped out onto the track and blessed the forehead of one of the horses lining up for the 4th race. 

Lo and behold, this horse (a very long shot) won the race. 

George was most interested to see what the priest did in the next race. 
Sure enough, he watched the priest step out onto the track as the 5th race horses lined up, 
and placed his blessing on the forehead of one of the horses. 

George made a beeline for the window and placed a small bet on the horse. 
Again, though another long shot, the horse won. 

George collected his winnings and anxiously waited to see which horse the priest bestowed his blessing on for the 6th race. 

The priest showed, blessed a horse. 
George bet on it and won! George was elated. 

As the day went on, the priest continued blessing one of the horses and it always came in first. 

George began to pull in some serious money and by the last race, he knew his wildest dreams were going to come true. 

He made a quick stop at the bank and withdrew every penny he owned, 
and awaited the priest's blessing that would tell him which horse to place the bet on. 

True to his pattern, the priest stepped out onto the track before the last race and blessed the forehead, eyes, ears and hooves of one of the horses. 
George placed his bet -- every cent he owned -- and watched the horse come in last. 

George was dumbfounded! 

He made his way to the track and when he found the priest, he demanded, 
""What happened, Father? All day you blessed horses and they won. 
The last race, you bless a horse and he loses. 
Now I've lost my life savings thanks to you!"" 

The priest nodded wisely and said, ""That's the problem with you Protestants.""

He arrived at the bus depot and they told him he would be driving a bus with a ""Sesame Street"" advertisement on the side. He found this kind of amusing, and started his shift.

At the first stop, he picked up his first passenger. It was a fat woman. He said ""Hey, I'm Dave. It's my first day on the job, you're my first passenger!"" The woman says ""Hi, I'm Patricia! Have fun on your first day!"" Patricia took her seat and Dave moved on to the next stop.

At his next stop, coincidentally another fat woman came on board. He said ""Hey, you're my second passenger on my new bus route! I'm Dave, nice to meet you!"" She said ""Hi, I'm Patricia! Welcome to the bus route!""

""Wow,"" he thought to himself. ""I can't believe the first two passengers have the same name. Oh well...""

At the next stop he picked up a mentally challenged teenager. He said, ""Hi, I'm Dave. Welcome to the bus."" The teen said ""I'm Ross."" He said ""Nice to meet you, Ross. Take a seat!"" Ross slowly took his seat.

Moving on to the next stop, he picked up a gentleman who said his name was Lester Tenenbaum. ""But you can just call me Lester T, that's what my friends call me."" So he told Lester T to take his seat and he moved on to the next stop.

While driving to the next stop, Lester T decides to take his shoes and socks off at his seat, and he starts picking the skin off his toes. ""Disgusting!"" thought Dave. Nonetheless, he continued on the bus route.

Dave's shift finished without any further peculiarities and he went home. When he got home, his wife says, ""Hi, honey! How was your first day on the job!""

He then heads straight out to the pool and a great deal of crashing, splashing and shouting can be heard through the bar.

The other day I went to the local religious book store and I saw a ""Honk if you love Jesus"" bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on the back bumper of my car, and I'm really glad I did. What an uplifting experience followed!

I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord, and didn't notice that the light had changed. That bumper sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must really love the Lord because pretty soon, he leaned out his window and yelled, ""Jesus Christ!"" as loud as he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, ""Go Jesus Christ, Go!""

Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all of those loving people. There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach, and saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I asked my two kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed, looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck sign. So, I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back.

Several cars behind, a very nice man stepped out of his car and yelled something. I couldn't hear him very well, but it sounded like, ""Mother trucker,"" or ""Mother's from there."" Maybe he was from Florida, too. He must really love the Lord.

A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking toward me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed to yellow, and stepped on the gas. And it's a good thing I did because I was the only driver to get across the intersection. I looked back at them standing there. I leaned way out the window, gave them a big smile and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away.",Honk if you love jesus!,229

At the bottom it says “See the amazing Goldstein”. He has some time to kill, so he figures what the hell and stops in.  It’s the usual dog and pony show until the very end, when there’s a drum roll, the lights go out, and a single spot shows a table in the center ring with three walnuts on it.  A tiny little old man slowly walks up to the table, pulls out the most enormous member the salesman has ever seen, and with three mighty blows, smashes the walnuts to bits.  The crown goes crazy. The salesman leaves dumbfounded, and can’t believe what he’s seen.  Indeed, over the years, no one believes his wild tale.

20 years go by, and the salesman again finds himself passing through the same small town.  To his surprise, the now-faded sign for the circus is still there, still saying “See the amazing Goldstein”.  He’s sure the circus is out of business by now – anyway, Goldstein must be long dead – but he drives over to check it out.  Sure enough, the circus tent is still there, so he buys a ticket and goes inside.  Same acts as before, with different dogs and different ponies.  Finally, the lights go out, there’s the drum roll, and in the spotlight is a table with three large coconuts on it.  Goldstein comes out, now ancient and using a walker, and slowly makes his way to the table.  Again he pulls out his huge Johnson.  BAM BAM BAM, he smashes the coconuts to bits!  Again, the crowd goes crazy.

The salesman is so impressed go goes backstage afterwards to talk to Goldstein, and tell the old man how impressed he is.  “I saw you 20 years ago, and you smashed 3 walnuts – that was amazing.  But now…three coconuts”?!?
Goldstein sadly shakes his head and says “Yeah, sorry about that sonny, but my eyesight just isn’t what it used to be”.

post,67612t,2qh72,jokes,false,1492996321,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/67612t/the_new_army_recruit/,self.jokes,,"A new recruit arrives on the front lines during world war 2. When he gets there he is told resources are stretched thin and they have not rifles to spare him, although they still expect him to go on patrol. He goes straight to his captain and explains the situation, the captain hands him a broom and tells him if he sees any germans to point the broom handle at them and shout ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" to kill them. The recruit thinks this is the most ridiculous thing he has ever heard but he has no choice so he agrees and heads out. While on patrol he comes across a German soldier. The German reaches for his rifle, so with no other option the recruit points his broom and shouts ""BANGITY BANG BANG"" and to his surprise the German drops dead. When he arrives back he immediately thanks the captain.

A couple of weeks went by and our guy had become quite the crackshot, even having a telescopic sight fixed to his broom. One day he was scouting the enemy position from under some bushes when he bumps into a German crawling the other way, in the cramped space he barely manages to point his broom at the German in time, so he returns to his captain and demands a weapon for close quarters combat. The captain takes a piece of string out of his drawer and tells him to hit an enemy with it and shout ""STABITY STAB STAB"". This time he trusts the captain and sure enough it works great.

Another couple of weeks go by and our guy is a legend. He kills dozens of Germans with his broom and string and receives several awards. One day while on patrol in a forest he sees a crazy German soldier in the distance running towards him and shouting at the top of his voice. He is pretty confident in his abilities, takes careful aim and shouts ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" but the German keeps on coming. He aims again ""BANGITY BANG BANG"" and again nothing. The German is getting really close so he takes out his string, but as he swings it out and shouts ""STABBITY STAB STAB"" the German just runs straight into him, knocking him clear off his feet into a tree and breaking several bones. ""TANKITY TANK TANK"" the German continues shouting.",The New Army recruit,130

They're kind of like limericks, but less strict. All jokes follow this pattern in some way:


""All the children do x, except [name]
because he/she does y.""


Where y rhymes with the name. You can experiment with tense and phrasing as you like. The point is to make y as unexpected and comical in relation to x as possible. Of course, there is also the game of making these jokes as dirty and morbid as possible.


Some examples:


All the children were planned, except Jake.

His parents made a mistake.

---

All the children were tired, except Jane.

She had cocaine.

---

All the children stared into the microwave, except Jack.

He stared back.

---

All the children were swimming, except Joe.

His lungs were full of H2O.

---

All the children are loved by their parents, except Dale.

He is for sale.

---

All the children died in the school shooting, except Tim.

They'll regret not respecting him.

---

All the children were cannibals, except Lucy.

She was juicy. 

---

All the children killed a terrorist, except Belle.

She killed an infidel.

---

All the children crossed the road, except Neil.

He was hit by an Oldsmobile.

---

All the children can handle explosives, except Grace.

She is all over the place.

His wife left him for a woman; she accidentally ran over his dog as she backed out of the driveway; he was fired from his job; he's got $100K in student loans; and with no job and no second income, he's just lost his home, too.

Taking his last few hundred bucks, he heads to New York City to see if he can make a change.

Sadly, his fortunes don't change despite the change of scenery. In fact they get worse: As soon as he sets foot in New York, he gets robbed.

Now penniless, he says to himself, ""That's it. I'm done,"" And decides to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. 

No sooner than he climbs up to jump, he hears a guy with a similar accent to his own.

""Whatever the problem is, God loves you. There's no reason to jump,"" the man says, ""I'm Dave. What's your name?""

""Joe,"" he says, ""But don't try to stop me. My life is shit,"" and proceeds to give him the laundry list of why his life sucks.

""Wow. That's a rough tale, friend, I understand.... Hey, listen, just one question before you jump. Just one. Where are you from so I can tell the police when they get here?""

""Virginia. I'm from Virginia.""

""Virginia? No way. I'm from Virginia, too!! What city?"" Dave asks with amazement.

""Franklin.""

""What!? That's crazy! I'm from Franklin, too!""

At this point, the two men are smiling and laughing like old friends, and Joe is seriously reassessing his plan.

""If you're from Franklin, you've got to be a God-fearing, man. Why I bet you're a Baptist, aren't you, Joe?""

""Yes, yes I am! Amen!""

At this point the two men are giddy with glee, Joe has changed his mind, and has started to turn around to get down.

""I can't believe it... I just can't believe it, this is incredible! All this way to New York City to meet another Baptist from Franklin, Virginia. It must've been God's plan for us to meet,"" Dave says shaking his head in disbelief. 

Just then, Dave crosses his arms in skepticism and asks, ""Wait a second... are you Northern or Southern Baptist, Joe?""

""I'm a PROUD Northern Baptist! Hallelujah!"" Joe proclaims as he starts to step down from the ledge.

Dave gasps, his eyes wide as pie plates.

In that instant, the soon-to-be fatal mistake registers with Joe.

""DIE HEATHEN SCUM!!"" Dave howls as he unfolds his arms and pushes Joe into the drink.","Why, I'm a Baptist, Too! (Long)",3

Once they're both in the bedroom the wife gets close to Jeeves and asks him softly to remove her dress for her. 

He does so.

She then leans closer to Jeeves and gently asks if he could take off her bra and panties.

As asked Jeeves removes the bra and panties of his master's wife without hesitation.

It was an obsession. One Sunday was a picture perfect day for golfing. The sun was out, no clouds in the sky, and the temperature was just right. The preacher was in a quandary as to what to do, and shortly, the urge to play golf overcame him. He called an assistant to tell him that he was sick and could not do church, packed the car up, and drove three hours to a golf course where no one would recognize him. Happily, he began to play the course. An angel up above was watching the preacher and was quite perturbed. He went to God and said, ""Look at that preacher. He should be punished for what he is doing."" God nodded in agreement. The preacher teed up on the first hole. He swung at the ball, and it sailed effortlessly through the air and landed right in the cup three hundred and fifty yards away (as they say in basketball, nothing but net). A picture perfect hole-in-one. He was amazed and excited. The angel was a little shocked. He turned to God and said, ""Begging Your pardon, but I thought you were going to punish him."" God smiled and said, ""Who's he gonna tell?""
