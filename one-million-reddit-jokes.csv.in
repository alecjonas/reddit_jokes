The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""

On the third day, God created the cow and said, ""You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.""

The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""

And God agreed again...... On the fourth day, God created humans and said, ""Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.""

""Oh, no!  I have to go fix my husband his dinner!  He's going to be so angry if it's not ready on time.""  And she dashes out of her friend's house, her great hand forgotten on the table.

When she gets home, she realizes she has very little time, not enough to go to the grocery store, and all she has in the cupboard is a wilted lettuce leaf, an egg, and a can of cat food.  In a panic, she opens the can of cat food, mixes in the egg, and garnishes it with the lettuce leaf just as her husband is pulling up.  She watches in horror as he sits down to his dinner, and then she realizes he is loving it!

""MMMM, honey, this is the best dinner you have made for me in 40 years of marriage.  You can make this for me any old day, mmmmm!""  And that night they had sex for the first time in months, and it was great!

Needless to say, every Thursday from then on she made this dinner for her husband.  She tells her bridge cronies about it and they are all horrified. ""You're going to kill him,"" they say, or ""He's just yanking your chain,"" but she continued to make him his catfood dinner and then afterward they would boink like fiends.

One week, her husband died, and all the bridge women the Thursday after the funeral attacked our new widow for being so callous.

Well, the bellringer for one such church, upon reaching retirement age, quit his position, leaving a job opening. Unfortunately, the demand for such a job was low and the bellringer position remained empty for several weeks. Eventually, a man walked into the priest’s office and told him that he wanted to apply for the job.  “But,” said the priest, “you don’t have any arms!” 

“That’s alright,” replied the man, “I can use my forehead - I was a bellringer for many years before I moved to this parish.”

Desperate for the position to be filled, the priest accepted the man’s application.  The man was indeed a fine bellringer and the jolly tones of the great bell rang every Sunday without fail.  Tragically, one morning, the bellringer slipped and fell down the tower, plummeting to his death below. The police were called in, and they asked the priest if he and the bellringer were close.  The priest replied: “Not particularly, but his face sure rings a bell.”

In a fortunate twist, the dead man’s identical twin brother also had experience ringing church bells, so the priest hired him to fill the void.  However, he was was tolling the bell one morning when the tower was struck by lightning, fatally electrocuting him. Again, the police questioned the priest as to whether he and the dead man had been friends.  

“No,” the priest said, “but he was a dead ringer for his brother.”

He immediately gags and throws up some of his lunch onto his plate.

The man with leprosy looks across at him and they make eye contact.

The waiter comes to the table and asks the gentleman if he can replace his meal.

""Please,"" he replies. 

The waiter returns to his table with a plate of the city's best spaghetti. He smells the garlic, basil, tomatoes, and olive oil and then digs in. He's a few bites in when his eyes wander to the other patrons, and again he sees the man with leprosy.

He wretches and hurls onto his plate. 

The man with leprosy is now looking across the room at him with anger in his eyes.

The waiter comes back to the table and asks if there is something wrong with the meal.

""Not at all. I'm sorry,"" says the gentleman, embarrassed. ""Please brings me another plate.""

The waiter comes back a third time bearing a plate of the city's best spaghetti. The man, intent on enjoying his meal, keeps his head down and begins to eat. Halfway through the plate, he lifts his eyes to the heavens in salute to the beauty of a perfect meal and sees the man with leprosy again.

He loses his meal all over the table in front of him.

This is finally too much for the man with leprosy. He stands up and shouts, ""If you have a problem with how I look, you better just leave!""

“Oh.” said the man, wondering why cocks were the method used to track lies, that too in heaven. Despite his confusion, he asked, “Whose cock is that?”

“That’s Mother Teresa’s. The cock has never swung, indicating that she never told a lie.”

“Incredible!” said the man.

She asked the store manager: “How much for these shoes?”

He replied: “$300”

The blonde: “That’s too expensive! Can’t you bring the price down?”

The store manager said he couldn’t,and got irritated when the blonde persisted.

Finally, after arguing with her for awhile he said: ""There's a pond with alligators behind the store! Why don't you kill an alligator and get your alligator shoes free?!"" 

The blonde replied: “Fine. I will.” 

After two hours, the manager got a bit worried that the blonde might have come to harm with the alligators. He decided to go out and check on her.

When he arrived at the pond, he saw the blonde lugging a dead alligator and flinging it on the ground next to 7 other dead ones.

Before he could ask what she was doing, she wailed “Oh my gosh! This one doesn’t have any shoes either!”

The livers are missing from the bodies, as is muscle from the shoulders, legs and back, the tongues, a variety of human flesh all carved out and eaten by Lecter after killing his victims.

Not only that, but he escapes the scene by cutting off other body parts to disguise himself and cover his tracks. He peels off faces to wear them as masks, cuts out fingertips to break through fingerprint locks, even scalps a man to wear his shaggy hair as a wig and disappear into the crowd while the police look for a receding hairline. He slips away every time, leaving skinned corpses in his wake.

One night he gets sloppy. A silent alarm in a rich fellow's mansion brings the police to him. The moment he hears a siren in the distance, Hannibal bolts for the door. He prepares his usual disguise, stripping the face from a slain servant, donning a jacket from the wardrobe, and fleeing into the night. But the police are already circling the block, and the crowd is sparse tonight.

Searching for a way out, Hannibal races down the sidewalk, passing two people walking side by side. He ducks between the large hedges surrounding the gate to another home, and pulls the bloody mask from his head to look around and get his bearings. He leans out to look down the sidewalk, but another passerby happens to pass that gate at the same time, and they collide.

""Oh my god! You're that killer, Hannibal Lecter!"" the man shouts. His cover blown, Hannibal flees, and in a moment of panic he shoves the bloody face into the man's hands, who remains there, stunned and horrified as Lecter disappears into the night.

The police round the corner, a car and three officers on foot surround the gate, guns drawn, and scream at the man, who is still holding the horrific evidence of the crime, to put his hands up. One of the officers, confused by the fact that the suspect doesn't match the description at all, raises his voice to ask, ""This is the guy skinning people? Is this really him?""

The man holds up the gore-caked jowls in his hands and shakes his head frantically. ""No, no!"" he shouts, waving it about. ""I've just got one of those faces.""","Hannibal Lecter escapes his prison, and begins a cannibalistic killing spree.",47

The study took two years and cost over $1.2 million. The study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft was to provide the man with more pleasure during sex.

After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study was incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of $2 million, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex.

When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didnt really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around $75.00 ( 3 cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete. They concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead.

The senior-most zookeeper turns to the other two and says, ""Do you guys have any ideas? Our only adult male gorilla had surgery yesterday and is in no condition to mate. We need to think of something fast."" Both Junior zookeepers stood silently looking at each other. 

Then the youngest zookeeper who had just started the job that week timidly says, ""I...I think I might know something to do."" 

The senior zookeeper responds, ""Ok. Go on.""

He continues, ""Well. I have this friend, Billy. Billy is kind of weird, but I bet he'll do it for $500.""

""Do what?"" 

""You know...have sex with the gorilla.""

The two other zookeepers start laughing.

""No. I'm serious. I know he'll do it"", the young man restates.

The senior zookeeper stares in disbelief, but then looks at Chloe's enclosure and the immense damage she's already caused.

""Well. Shit."" Says the senior zookeeper. ""Nobody knows about this, but us. You are to tell no one or it's all of our asses. Get him here by the end of the day."" The young man rushes away to his car.

About an hour later, the young man returns with Billy, a thin, awkward looking man in his early twenties. Billy stares at the other zookeepers with a very concerned and suspicious look on his face. 

""You're the guy?"" The senior zookeeper says.""

""Yes. Billy... I'm Billy"", he responds.

""And you're here to...""

""Have sex with the gorilla?""

""...yes. That.""

""Yes I am"" replies Billy.

""Ok. Well thank you"", says the senior zookeeper. ""We appreciate your help.""

""No problem!"", Billy shouts with a smile.

The zookeeper opens the door to the enclosure. ""She's in there. Go on in"", he says. Billy pauses and looks at the zookeeper in disappointment.

""What's wrong"", says the zookeeper.

Billy responds, ""it's just...well...I'm not gonna be able to get you that $500 until next week.""",Three guys are working at a zoo's gorilla exhibit...,8

post,91vbpx,2qh72,jokes,false,1532549172,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/91vbpx/hank_and_frank/,self.jokes,,"This businessman retires, he’s had a good life, made a lot of money, ready to take it easy.  He’s driving around the countryside one day and he sees this farm with a couple horses running up and down this hill, over and over.  He’s just amazed by these horses, they look so fast to him.

So he pulls in the driveway and goes up to the farmhouse.  He meets the farmer and asks about the horses.  “Well, that one there with the white splotch above his nose is Hank, and that one with the white spot under his chin is Frank, they’re brothers.”  So the businessman watches for awhile with the farmer, chatting the day away, watching Hank and Frank going up and down the hill.  Finally, as the sun is going down he asks the farmer if he’d be willing to sell them.  “Well, I hadn’t really thought about it, we always like having horses on the farm, but I’m old now, not much for riding.  I guess we could part with them, to someone who’d care for ‘em.”  So he makes a deal with the farmer to come and get the horses in a week, have a vet check them out, the whole shebang.

He goes home and the next day he immediately contracts to have a stable built, a vet to check the horses, buys a big truck and trailer for the horses, feed, hay, everything he needs to properly take care of his new horses.  He even contacts an old family friend he knows use to train horses.

A week passes, the horses check out fine and he brings him back to his house, now a proper ranch.  The trainer comes over and checks out Hank and Frank, running up and down the hillside all day just like at the old farmer’s.  The trainer is mighty impressed with the fine animals, young and strong, and asks the businessman if he’d thought about racing them.  He hadn’t thought of it, but he’s retired and has time, seems like racing horses is what old businessmen do.  Next thing you know he’s hired the trainer, found two local lads to ride Hank and Frank, and registered him for the town races.

So the day of the town races comes along, the businessman is beaming, just happy to have found something new and exciting to do, the trainer feeling like a young man again, the two young jockeys (Stan and Dan) nerves all bundled up ready to go.  Hank and Frank, they don’t hardly seem to notice that anything is going on.

The horses are led to the blocks and the last one’s loaded, gun fires, and the gates open!

And Hank and Frank just bolt out of there, Stan and Dan almost left behind as they hold on tight.  And at the quarter point Hank and Frank have already left the other horses well behind, 3 lengths already and just leaving them further behind.

At the halfway mark it’s Hank and Frank by 6 lengths, Hank and Frank neck and neck.  Then at the last turn, Hank and Frank by 10 lengths, 11 lengths.

Coming to the line by 20! lengths, it’s Hank and Frank.
Hank and Frank
Hank and Frank…
Hank wins!

And the businessman and the trainer and the jockeys are bursting with excitement and joy, the crowd is blown away, and it’s just an amazing win.

Well now he’s gotta enter the horses in the County Races, you just can’t have a pair of horses like that and NOT race them.  He gets new silks for Stan and Dan, Stan with green and yellow checkers, Dan with blue and white checkers, he builds himself a mantle over the fireplace for his trophy, and he hires on the trainer fulltime.

The County Races comes along, the businessman is beaming, shaking hands with the other owners, the trainer confident as he watches,  Stan and Dan proud in their brand new silk.  Hank and Frank just go along with it all, never giving anyone a second look.

Then the horses are led to the blocks and the last one’s loaded, gun fires, and the gates open!

And Hank and Frank bolt out of there, Stan and Dan ready for the wild ride this time, silks whipping in the wind.  At the quarter point Hank and Frank have already left the other horses well behind, 2 lengths already and just leaving them further back.

At the halfway mark it’s Hank and Frank by 5 lengths, Hank and Frank neck and neck.  Then at the last turn, Hank and Frank by a good 10 lengths, and they just seem to get faster!

Coming to the line by 18 lengths, it’s Hank and Frank!
Hank and Frank
Hank and Frank
Hank and Frank…
Hank wins!

And it’s just amazing, no one’s seen anything like these two horses, and well now he’s gotta race them in the State Championship!

The big race comes along, now everyone’s talking about these horses, Hank and Frank.  You can see the nervousness in the other owner’s eyes, even some of the jockeys.  There can’t be two horses like this can there?

And the horses are brought to the gates, Stan and Dan sitting proud atop them.  Stan in green and yellow checks, Dan in blue and white.  The last horse is put into the gates, and then they’re off!

Coming to the first turn it’s Hank and Frank, just leaving everyone in their dust again.  Heading down the backstretch, at the halfway mark by 5 lengths, pulling away, 6 lengths, 7 lengths.
Coming ‘round the last turn, it’s Hank and Frank by 8 lengths, coming towards the finish, 10…12 lengths it’s Hank and Frank.
Hank and Frank neck and neck
Hank and Frank
Hank and Frank…
Hank wins!

Well now there’s no doubt about it, what kind of horses can these be?  Why the businessman doesn’t have any choice but that he’s gotta enter them in the Kentucky Derby!

And the businessman counts the days while the trainer trains, the jockeys jockey, and through it all the horses just love running up and down that hill all day, up and down.

So now THE big race comes around, all the best horses from the country, all the richest owners.  Laughing when a reporter mentions Hank and Frank, why they’re just horses that have been running against nags this whole time!

The trumpets blare, thousands upon thousands of fans in the stands, in the middle of the track.  Giant stupid flowered hats and pretentious drinks, the rich and the drunks and the everyday man all gathered for the event.

The blocks are filled, the horses are off!

And coming around the first turn it’s close, all the best horses, but there are Hank and Frank, pulling out a length ahead.  Coming down the backstretch, Hank and Frank never slowing, 2 lengths, 3 lengths, 5 lengths coming around the bend.

Coming down the final stretch, Hank and Frank far in the lead, 8 lengths, 9 even.

Hank and Frank
Hank and Frank
Hank and Frank….
Hank wins!

And the crowd is nuts, the businessman and trainer, the jockeys Stan and Dan all in the winner’s circle with the flowers and press.

So the Preakness is just two weeks later, and what do Hank and Frank do just as soon as they get home.  Up and down that hill all day.  The businessman just watching them as he sits in his chair, trophies up on the mantle.  Up and down, up and down.

Two weeks come, the horses all being led to the gates.  Stan in his green and yellow checks, Dan in blue and white.  The horses in the gates, the bell rings, and they’re off!

Into the first turn it’s close, the best horses in the country running, and there’s Hank and Frank, just pulling ahead.

Coming down the backstretch, Hank and Frank pulling ahead, 2, 3 lengths.

Around the last turn and coming to the finish, it’s Hank and Frank up by 6 lengths, neck and neck, nose and nose.

Hank and Frank
Hank and Frank
Hank and Frank…
Hank wins!

And the crowd is really incensed, because now we have another Triple Crown contender, and his biggest rival is his brother, and by the same owner even!

But when they get back to that ranch, there go Hank and Frank again, up and down that hill.  Everyday, all day, just playing, running up and down that hill.

Then it’s the biggest day, the Belmont Stakes.  All of the national press there, the international press even, waiting to see if this could be the year.

The horses led to the gates.

Stan in his green and yellow checks, Dan in blue and white.

Led to the gates, the last horse in…and they’re off!

And Hank and Frank are right there nose and nose, the horses challenging them, riders determined to beat this pair.

At the quarter length it’s too close to tell, but then you can see the white splotch of Hank, the white spot of Frank, pulling ahead.

Coming to the half way point, Hank and Frank up by a length, pulling away, jockeys cursing in frustration.

Around the last turn, Hank and Frank blazing, even faster now, foaming as they feel the line coming up, neither horse giving the other an inch, the pack fading 5 lengths behind.  Never fading, neck and neck.

Hank and Frank…
Hank and Frank…
Hank and Frank…
It’s a photo finish…




Hank wins!

And it’s unbelievable, a Triple Crown winner, the two best horses anyone’s ever seen, the businessman dumbstruck at everything around him, the grounds crew afraid the stands will collapse with all the pandemonium.

When it’s all done, the businessman returns to his ranch, mantle overflowing with trophies, his pipe in hand as he watches Hank and Frank up and down that hill.  

He’s retired now, Hank and Frank living well, still playing.  Up and down that hill, over and over.  Until one day, as they’re taking a break from their playing, grazing for grass and roots, tasty flowers, Frank is along the fence when he sees a dog.

The dog walks over to him and says, “Hey, aren’t you that horse Frank that ran in all those big races?”

“Yes, I am” said Frank.

“Well, I have to ask you, how come in all those races, how come Hank never let you win one?”

Frank had never thought of that, and that was a good question.  “Well, I never thought of that, that’s a good question,” he said to the dog.  “Let me go find out.”  And so he went over down to where his brother Hank was grazing.

“Hey Hank, that dog over there just asked me, how come you never let me win any races?”

Hank looks over at the dog for a second, then back at his brother and says, “Get real, dogs can’t talk!”

The prize for winning is a pet turtle. 


About half way through the day a drunken old man totters up and asks to play the game. The carny sees the the old man is squinting and nearly blind from old age and also very inebriated, but takes the man's money anyway and hands him the contest rifle. The old man takes it and proceeds to shoot three perfect bullseyes. ""Wow that was incredible!"" The carny says, ""here is your prize,"" handing the old man a turtle. The old man nods drunkenly and stumbles off in to the crowd. 


An hour or so later the old man comes back to the carny's booth significantly more intoxicated and demands to play again. The same as before, the old man shoots three perfect bullseyes. He wins another pet turtle and then heads back in to the crowd holding the turtle in one hand and feeling his way along with the other. 


At this point the carny is very impressed because in all the time he had been running the game only a handful of people have ever won the prize turtle, let alone a drunken and nearly-blind old man doing it twice.


A few hours later the carny is about to close up shop when the old man stumbles up again completely wasted and insists for one more turn. Despite being so drunk he can barley stand straight he again shoots three perfect bullseyes. 


""That is really amazing sir, the carny says, ""but I'm sorry, so few people ever win this game that I only brought two turtles to give away as prizes.""

The manager of the storehouse put a ""help wanted"" flyer up, and a shy boy from the countryside applied for the job.

The manager was interviewing the boy, and asked:


""So, you're from the countryside?""


""Yup""


""Do you have any prior sales expertise?""


""Yeah, in the countryside...""


Even though the boy seemed shy, for some reason the manager liked him, and gave him the job. After the first day on the job, the manager comes around to see how the boy has managed. 


""Well, how many sales did you make?""


""One.""


The manager, a bit disappointed, asks:


""Well, usually our salespeople do around 20-30 deals a day. How much was your only sale worth?""


""Five hundred thousand""


""What? Five hundred thousand? What on earth did you sell to the customer?""


""Well, I sold this man a small fishhook, then a little bit bigger hook, and a third hook. Then I sold him a set of lures and a kit to make fly's for fly fishing. Then, of course he needed some line, so I sold him some normal line, a stronger line and a extra strong line. To which, the customer, of course needed proper poles, rod's and reel's. Then we came to the conclusion, that he definitely needs a boat for this. From that point on we went to the boat department, and I sold him a proper yacht with all the extra gear. Then, the customer thought that the old Cadillac he came with couldn't pull a yacht of this size. So on we went to the car department and I sold him a proper Range Rover and a trailer for the yacht. All-in-all, the deal came to be a little bit over five hundred thousand dollars. ""

A Wyoming rancher had a bull named Caesar who was
getting old, so he decided to sell him on the auction market.

The only problem was that the nearest railroad was miles
away and across across a river that hadn't yet been bridged.

Since Caesar had grown somewhat crotchety in his old age
the rancher organized a crew of three men who he sent off
with his ranch foreman to lead Caesar to the railroad line.

After two days of travel Caesar and the crew arrived at the
river near the market town.  The tired crew members
suggested to their foreman that they be allowed to relax and
fish awhile before catching the ferryboat.

""What shall we do with Caesar while you fish?, asked the
foreman.

The men replied, ""Oh, he can just graze on this lush grass
along the river.""

As bad as he as feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong.

Jack had to force himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he saw was couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table.

And, next to them, a single red rose! Jack sat up and saw his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed.

He looked around the room and saw that it was in perfect order, spotlessly clean.

So was the rest of the house. He took the aspirins, and cringed when he saw a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror.

Then he noticed a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick:

""Honey, breakfast is on the stove. I left early to get groceries to make you your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling!""

He stumbled to the kitchen and sure enough, there was hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper. His son was also at the table, eating.

Jack asked, ""Son, what happened last night?""

""Well, you came home after 3 A.M, drunk and out of your mind. You fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door.""

Confused, he asked his son, ""So, why is everything in such perfect order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??

His son replied, ""Oh THAT! Mum dragged you to the bathroom to clean you up, and when she tried to take your pants off, you screamed, 'Leave me alone bitch, I'm married!""",A good bar joke that always makes women laugh,20583

She'd make continents(ignoring Antarctica) compete in building large sculptures of her and the last place sculpture would result in massive genocides from the Queen herself.

One day a group of the Queen's followers decided that they'd rebel against her, because they never even wanted to follow her as a ruler, they just wanted to live. The group consisted of  four men and one of them, John, was given the task of discovering the Queen's weakness. The rest would gather weapons and armor for their legendary betrayal.

John hid in the Queen's bedroom, the Queen walked in and began to strip her clothes. Though she revealed nothing, because she was actually a robot with no nudity to show. It appeared that the Queen's cat was the actual mastermind behind her actions. John even admitted how obvious it should've been, because the Queen never separated from her beloved ""pet"" cat.

Well, all the same he paid it and then the plumber said to him, ""I understand your position as a professor. Why don't you come to our company and apply for a plumber position? You will earn three times as much as a professor. But remember, when you apply, tell them that you completed only seven elementary classes. They don't like educated people.""

So it happened. The professor got a job as a plumber and his life significantly improved. He just had to seal a screw or two occasionally, and his salary went up significantly.

One day, the board of the plumbing company decided that every plumber had to go to evening classes to complete the eighth grade. So, our professor had to go there too. It just happened that the first class was math. The evening teacher, to check students' knowledge, asked for a formula for the area of a circle. The person asked was the professor. He jumped to the board, and then he realized that he had forgotten the formula. He started to reason it, and he filled the white board with integrals, differentials, and other advanced formulas to conclude the result he forgot. As a result, he got ""minus pi times r square.""

He didn't like the minus, so he started all over again. He got the minus again. No matter how many times he tried, he always got a minus. He was frustrated.

post,91f3hk,2qh72,jokes,false,1532415183,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/91f3hk/the_butcher_dance/,self.jokes,,"A guy has spent five years traveling all around the world making a documentary on Native dances. At the end of this time, he has every single native dance of every indigenous culture in the world on film. He winds up in Australia, in Alice Springs, so he pops into a pub for a well earned beer. He gets talking to one of the local Aborigines and tells him about his project. The Aborigine asks the guy what he thought of the ""Butcher Dance."" 

The guy's a bit confused and says ""Butcher Dance? What's that?"" 

""What? You no see Butcher Dance?"" 

""No, I've never heard of it."" 

""Oh mate. You crazy. How you say you film every native dance if you no see Butcher Dance?"" 

""UmmSUM. I got a corroborree on film just the other week. Is that what you mean?"" 

""No no, not corroborree. Butcher Dance much more important than corroborree."" 

""Oh, well how can I see this Butcher Dance then?"" 

""Mate, Butcher Dance right out bush. Many days travel to go see Butcher Dance."" 

""Look, I've been everywhere from the forests of the Amazon, to deepest darkest Africa, to the frozen wastes of the Arctic filming these dances. Nothing will prevent me from recording this one last dance."" 

""OK, mate. You drive north along highway towards Darwin. After you drive 197 miles, you see dirt track veer off to left. Follow dirt track for 126 miles 'til you see big huge dead gum tree - biggest tree you ever see. Here you gotta leave car, coz much to rough for driving. You strike out due west into setting sun. You walk 3 days 'til you hit creek. You follow this creek to Northwest. After 2 days you find where creek flows out of rocky mountains. Much too difficult to cross mountains here though. You now head south for half day 'til you see pass through mountains. Pass very difficult, very dangerous. Take 2, maybe 3 days to get through rocky pass. When through, head north-west for 4 days 'til reach big huge rock - 20 ft high and shaped like man's head. From rock, walk due west for 2 days and you find village.Here you see Butcher Dance."" 

So the guy grabs his camera crew and equipment and heads out. After a couple of hours he finds the dirt track. The track is in a shocking state and he's forced to crawl along at a snails pace and so he doesn't reach the tree until dusk and he's forced to set up camp for the night. He sets out bright and early the following morning. His spirits are high and he's excited about the prospect of capturing on film this mysterious dance which he had never heard mention of before. True to the directions he has been given, he reaches the creek after three days and follows it for another two until they reach the rocky mountains. The merciless sun is starting to take its toll by this time and his spirits
are starting to flag, but wearily he trudges on until he finds the pass through the hills - nothing will prevent him from completing his life's dream. The mountains prove to be every bit as treacherous as their guide said and at times they almost despair of getting their bulky equipment through. But after three and a half days of back breaking effort they finally force their way clear and continue their long trek. 

When they reach the huge rock, four days later, their water is running low and their feet are covered with blisters but they steel themselves and head out on the last leg of their journey. Two days later they virtually stagger into the village where the natives feed them and and give them fresh water and they begin to feel like new men. Once he's recovered enough, the guy goes before the village chief and tells him that he has come to film there Butcher Dance. 

""Oh mate. Very bad you come today. Butcher Dance last night. You too late. You miss dance."" 

""Well, when do you hold the next dance?"" 

""Not 'til next year."" 

""Well, I've come all this way. Couldn't you just hold an extra dance for me, tonight?"" 

""No, no, no! Butcher Dance very holy. Only hold once a year. If hold more, gods get very angry and destroy village! You want see Butcher Dance you come back next year."" The guy is devastated, but he has no other option but to head back to civilization and back home. The following year, he heads back to Australia and, determined not to miss out again, sets out a week earlier than last time. He is quite willing to spend a week in the village before the dance is performed in order to ensure he is present to witness it.
However, right from the start things go wrong. Heavy rains that year have turned the dirt track to mud and the car gets bogged every few miles, finally forcing them to abandon their vehicles and slog through the mud on foot almost half the distance to the tree. They reach the creek and the mountains without any further hitch, but halfway through the ascent of the mountain they are struck by a fierce storm which rages for several days, during which they are forced to cling forlornly to the mountainside until it subsides. It would be suicide to attempt to scale the treacherous paths in the face of such savage elements. 

Then, before they have traveled a mile out from the mountains, one of the crew sprains his ankle badly which slows down the rest of their journey to the rock and then the village enormously. Eventually, having lost all sense of how long they have been travelling, they stagger into the village at about 12:00 noon. 

""The Butcher Dance!"" gasps the guy. ""Please don't tell me I'm too late!"" 

The chief recognizes him and says ""No, white fella. Butcher Dance performed tonight. You come just in time."" 

Relieved beyond measure, the crew spend the rest of the afternoon setting up their equipment - preparing to capture the night's ritual on celluloid as dusk falls, the natives start to cover there bodies in white paint and adorn themselves in all manner of bird's feathers and animal skins. Once darkness has settled fully over the land, the natives form a circle around a huge roaring fire. 

A deathly hush descends over performers and spectators alike as a wizened old figure with elaborate swirling designs covering his entire body enters the circle and begins to chant. Some sort of witch doctor or medicine man, figures the guy and he whispers to the chief ""What's he doing?"" 

""Hush"" whispers the chief. ""You first white man ever to see most sacred of our rituals. Must remain silent. Holy man, he asks that the spirits of the dreamworld watch as we demonstrate our devotion to them through our dance and, if they like our dancing, will they be so gracious as to watch over us and protect us for another year."" 

The chanting of the Holy man reaches a stunning crescendo before he removes himself from the circle. From somewhere the rhythmic pounding of drums booms out across the land and the natives begin to sway to the stirring rhythm.

Bobby was in elementary school and had a happy life. Unfortunately, that was all going to change in one day.

The day started off with Bobby eating breakfast at the table when he heard the school bus honk its horn. Bobby quickly finished his cereal, gave his mom a kiss goodbye, and was off to school on the bus.

Bobby enjoyed looking out the window on the way to school. Today, Bobby noticed a billboard sign with nothing on it other than the words, ""Purple Dandelion."" Bobby knew that dandelions were usually yellow, and was thus very confused. He sat there for a few minutes trying to decipher the billboard but came to no reasonable conclusion.

Being the inquisitive person he is, Bobby walked up the aisle of the school bus to ask the driver if she knew what the significance of ""Purple Dandelion"" was.

""Excuse me,"" said Bobby. ""I just saw a billboard with the words 'Purple Dandelion' on it. Do you know what it means?""

""In all my life, I would have never imagined those words to come out of the mouth of such an innocent young child!!! Those are such horrible words to say, young Bobby!!! I will not tolerate that language on my bus!"" said the driver. And with a screeching halt, the bus came to a stop and Bobby was kicked off.

Very confused, Bobby now had to walk the remainder of the way to school. Fortunately for him, it was only a few blocks. Unfortunately for him, this would mean that he would be late. Since Bobby figured that he had some time, he continued to try and figure out the significance of ""Purple Dandelion.""

Twenty minutes late for class, Bobby sauntered into his class room. Ms. Lewis, his teacher, was very surprised to see him walk in. ""Bobby, why are you late for class?""

""Well Ms. Lewis, I saw a billboard on the bus to school this morning that confused me a bit. I asked the bus driver if she knew what it meant, and she ended up kicking me off the bus. I had to walk the rest of the way here.""

""That's odd. Bobby, what did the billboard say?""

""Purple Dandelion.""

There was a gasp from all the other children and Ms. Lewis as well. ""I will not tolerate that kind of language in my class. Go to the principal's office right now!""

""But...""

""No buts. Go now!""

Even more confused, Bobby turned around and headed towards the principal's office. There he sat until the principal called him in.

""Bobby. You're such a wonderful student. Why are you here in my office?"" said Mr. Brown, the school's principal.

""Well, I saw a billboard on bus this morning. I didn't know what it meant, so I asked the driver. She then kicked me off the bus. I then had to walk the rest of the way to class and was twenty minutes late. When Ms. Lewis asked why, I explained to her and she blew up. She then told me to come here.""

""Bobby, what did the billboard say?""

""Purple Dandelion.""

""Bobby! I'm very disappointed in you. I'm suspending you effective immediately. Take this note to your mother right now.""

Mr. Brown sent Bobby home with a note explaining everything to his mother. Unfortunately, it was in a sealed envelope so he couldn't see why he was being suspended. Sulking on the way back home, Bobby figured it couldn't get any worse.

Bobby openned the back door and found his mom in the kitchen.

""Bobby, what are you doing home so early?""

Bobby handed the envelope to his mother and she read the note inside.

""Bobby, I am very disappointed in you! I would have never imagined that I could raise a son that turned out like you. Where did I go wrong?!?! I want you out of the house this instant. I don't ever want to see you again!""

Sobbing, Bobby packed up what he could carry and left the house.

Thirty years later, Bobby is in a bar. His whole life was ruined because of one stupid billboard. He never finished his education, never got a job, and was a homeless bum. While nursing a drink, the barkeep overheard some of Bobby's mumblings. ""Why so glum?"" said the barkeep.

Bobby explained his life story to the bartender and how the words ""Purple Dandelion"" ruined his life.

""Ah, I see,"" said the bartender. ""I think today is your day. Believe it or not, but I can tell you why your life has been so miserable. I know what 'Purple Dandelion' means.""

""You do? Please tell me. It'll give me closure on this horrible life I've led,"" said Bobby.

""I'll tell you what. Run across the street to that convenience store and pick me up a loaf of bread and a gallon of milk, and when you return, I'll tell you.""

""Of course, anything!"" exclaimed Bobby.

Bobby rushed out of the bar and before he got even halfway across the street, he was struck by a freight truck and killed instantly. He never found out what the meaning of ""Purple Dandelion"" was.

So what is the moral of the story of Bobby and the Purple Dandelion?

They're driving on this back road when a storm picks up. The wind blows a tree down in front of their car, and the only sign of civilization was a farmhouse about a mile back. They get out of the car and run back to the house. They arrive soaking wet, and they knock on the door, and an old lady answers. She tells them to come in and make themselves at home.They do, and she offers them hot tea, and then shows them where they can sleep for the night. She gives them clean towels to dry off with, and tells them good night.

About an hour later, the three guys hear an awful scream from downstairs. They run down the first flight of stairs, the second flight of stairs, and the third flight of stairs, only to find the old woman laying on the floor, missing an arm. They rush to start first aid on her, but she said ""don't mind me, this happens all the time. I'll be fine in the morning"" The guys think this is strange, but she is fine and breathing, so the go back up to their rooms.

Another hour after that, they hear another scream. They run down the first flight of stairs, the second flight of stairs, and the third flight of stairs, only to find the old lady missing her OTHER arm. Now they're really concerned, and try to call 911, but the phone is dead. The old lady asks to be lifted into her chair, and insists she's fine. They all look at each other, and go back to bed.

Another hour later, sure enough, they hear a scream again and they run down the first flight of stairs, the second flight of stairs, and the third flight of stairs, to find the ghastly sight of the old lady, minus both her arms and her LEFT LEG! They try to find it, moving furniture while one guy tries the phone again. Nada. The old lady insists yet again that she is ok, and the three guys go back to bed.

Yep, you guessed it. An hour later, scream. The guys walked down the first flight of stairs, the second flight of stairs, and the third flight of stairs, and the old lady is only a torso and a head, laying on her back, her old calico dress trailing on the ground. The three guys are nice enough to pick her up and prop her back up on the couch, and as they leave, she reminds them that breakfast is in three hours.

Nothing more happens until the rooster crows the next morning. They guys all talk to one another, and are convinced the old lady slipped them something in their tea. The march down the first set of stairs, the second set of stairs, and the third set of stairs, only to find the old lady cooking breakfast, all her limbs intact. She turns to they guys and asks ""do you want eggs or cereal for breakfast?"" The first guy says eggs, the second votes for cereal, and the third for eggs.

In his hand he carried a worn out old hat and a equally worn out Bible. The church he entered was in a very upscale and exclusive part of the city. It was the largest and most beautiful church the old cowboy had ever seen. The people of the congregation were all dressed with expensive clothes and accessories.

As the cowboy took a seat, the others moved away from him. No one greeted, spoke to or welcomed him. They were all appalled at his appearance and did not attempt to hide it.

As the old cowboy was leaving the church, the preacher approached him and asked the cowboy to do him a favor: “Before you come back in here again, have a talk with God and ask him what he thinks would be appropriate attire for worship.”

The old cowboy assured the preacher he would.

But the next Sunday, he showed back up for the services wearing the same ragged jeans, shirt, boots and hat.

Once again he was completely shunned and ignored. The preacher approached the man and said, “I thought I asked you to speak to God before you came back to our church.”

“I did,” replied the old cowboy.

“If you spoke to God, what did he tell you proper attire should be for worshiping in here?” asked the preacher.

“Well, sir, God told me that He didn’t have a clue what I should wear. He said He’d never been in here before.”",One Sunday morning an old ragged cowboy entered a church just before services were to begin.,20
