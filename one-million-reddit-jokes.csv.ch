He said he went to the bull fights and later found the best Italian food he had ever had right outside the stadium. The pasta was fresh, the sauce was amazing, and the meatballs were the most tender and well seasoned he had ever had. On his last day of vacation he said he wanted to go back to the Italian restaurant so he did and ordered the same dish. They brought it out and the pasta was fresh, the sauce was even better, but the meatballs were much much smaller. He ate them and they were still amazing. As he was leaving he was asked if his meal was as good as the first visit. He told them everything was great but he didn't understand one thing. He said the first time he came in the meat balls were the size of tennis ball and this time they were like marbles.

The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulation requiring that family unity be maintained to the highest degree possible.


The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him.


After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.


After two recesses to check legal references and confer with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Cincinnati Bengals, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone.",Sorry Cincy,53

He responds 

"" I don't know""

"" Should I buy one?""

"" I don't know"" 

The customer leaves and the manager is absolutely furious, he takes the man aside and says to him.

The robber, bursting with anger, places the gun one inch away from the man's face and says: ""Say that again. I dare you"".

The robber sticks the gun into the man's forehead and threatens with a more serious tone: ""One more word and I swear I am pulling the trigger"".

The man, no longer showing the slightest hint of amusement, says: ""Look, there is a first time to everything, but this is unbelievable. Do you really have any idea of what you are doing?"".

""that is it!"" the robber snaps. ""I have a gun, you are unarmed, everybody else is scared to death, and there are zero guards in here! Don't you understand the situation? I completely got this under control!"".

The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation in which you will have to make a decision. Only you will know the results, so remember that your answer needs to be honest.

THE SITUATION:

You are in Florida, Miami to be specific.

There is chaos all around you caused by a hurricane with severe flooding. This is a flood of biblical proportions. You are a photojournalist working for a major newspaper, and you're caught in the middle of this epic disaster. The situation is nearly hopeless.

You're trying to shoot career-making photos.

There are houses and people swirling around you, some disappearing under the water.

THE TEST:

Suddenly you see a man in the water. He is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken down with the debris. You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar. You suddenly realize who it is.

It's Donald Trump! At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him under forever.

YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS:

You can save the life of Donald Trump or you can shoot a dramatic Pulitzer Prize winning photo, documenting the death of one of the most powerful Republicans in America.

THE QUESTION:

Here's the question, and please give an honest answer. ""Would you select high contrast color film, or would you go with the classic simplicity of black and white?""",This is a test.,34

It had been a long tour and tensions had been running high. A first violin player was a wreck from excessive alcohol consumption, the trumpet section engaged in much infighting due to competing egos, and the timpani player showed up late to many performances.

Donovan Schmidt, the leader of the orchestra at the time and renowned for his bad temper, was furious. The flight delay was the last straw and his patience was starting to get the better of him.

After enduring a 30 minute argument between his bassoon and tuba players, Schmidt snapped and threw his baton at them. 

Sailing through the air the baton pierced a bassoon player's eye, entered his brain, and he promptly dropped dead.

The ensuing months saw Schmidt dragged in and out of court and the nation waited with baited breath to see what would become of his fate.

Finally, it was ruled by a jury of his peers that he should face the death penalty by electric chair. Shocked and dismayed, the arts community rallied around Schidmt, but it was to no avail. The date had been set.

Strapped into the chair and with his head shaven, Schmidt had tears streaming down his face as the warden gave the nod to throw the switch....then, nothing happened. 

Confused, the death row technicians reset the machine, rewired the harness and waited for the Warden's signal....then, nothing.

This happened 4 times in a row, until the warden screamed at his officers ""just what in the hell is going on in there?!""

Scratching his head, the senior corrections officer yells out to the warden ""I dunno...I guess he must be a bad conductor.""",In 1952 the New York Philharmonic was on a national tour...,17

Twice a month on the weekend, he heads out for the lake early and spends most of the day.

He does this come rain or shine.

One Saturday morning he gets up early, dresses quietly, gets his lunch made, puts on his long johns, grabs the dog and goes to the garage to hook up his boat to the truck and down the driveway he goes.

Coming out of his garage rain it is still dark and the rain is pouring down; it is like a torrential downpour.

There is snow mixed in with the rain, and the wind is blowing 50mph.

He makes a go of it, but the weather worsens the further he drives.

Finally, his common sense outdoes his desire to fish, and reluctantly, he turns around. 30 minutes later, he has made it back to his driveway.

He goes into the house and quietly turns on the TV to the weather channel.

He finds it’s going to be bad weather all day long, so he puts his boat back in the garage, quietly undresses and slips back into bed.

There he cuddles up to his wife’s back, now with a different anticipation.

He reaches around and cups one breast in his hand. Snuggling up to her neck, he whispers,

“The weather out there is terrible.”

To which she sleepily replies,

“Can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that shit?”",The man who loved fishing,46

To kick things off, he opens his new sub with a contest to see who can come up with the funniest, most absolutely original joke.  Post after post pour in, but he notices in each one how a punchline was stolen from here or how the joke was just rehashed from there.

""Alright everyone, I'm going to ask each of you what you did during lunch. I'll them ask you to write something on the board related to what you did - if you spell the word correctly, you'll get a biscuit.""

The children all seem quite excited by this activity. The teacher begins...

Teacher: ""Let's start with you little Johnny. What did you do during lunch?""

Johnny: ""I played in the sand.""

Teacher: ""Wonderful Johnny. If you can write 'sand' on the board, you get a biscuit.""

Johnny successfully writes 'sand' on the board and is happy.

Teacher: ""Miss Jenny, what about you? What did you do during lunch?

Jenny: ""I played on the slide.""

Teacher: ""Very good Jenny. If you can write 'slide' on the board, you can have a biscuit.""

Jenny succeeds in writing 'slide' on the board and is ecstatic.

The teacher moves on to her next student..

Teacher: ""Achmed, what did you do over lunch?""

With a stammer in his voice and tears welling up in his eyes, Achmed starts his story.

Achmed: ""I tried to play in the sand, but the boys called me names because I am different. Then I tried to play on the slide and the girls called me names and told me to get lost!""

Teacher: ""Achmed, that sounds like blatant racial discrimination! I'll tell you what, if you can write 'blatant racial discrimination' on the board, I'll give you a biscuit.""",A teacher addresses her students after they've come back from lunch,30

“So, you’re a politician…” “Well, yes, is that a problem?” “Oh no, no problem. But we’ve recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you’re free to choose where you want to spend eternity!”  
  
“Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??” says the politician. “Them’s the rules” Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears… And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he’s in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds… Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can’t be right?  
  
“Open your eyes!” says a voice. “C'mon, wakey wakey, we’ve only got 24 hours!”. Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he’s in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite… And there’s a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. “Who are you??” The politician asks. “Well, I’m Satan!” says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. “Welcome to Hell!” “Wait, this is Hell? But… Where’s all the pain and suffering?” he asks. Satan throws him a wink. “Oh, we’ve been a bit mis-represented over the years, it’s a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there’s extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It’s a beautiful day, and if you’d care to look outside…” Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. “It’s one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there’s another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!” says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he’s admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he’s admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear… And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep… And is woken up by St Peter. “So, that was Hell. Wasn’t what you were expecting, I bet?” “No sir!” says the man. “So then” says St Peter “you can make your choice. It’s Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on”. “Well… I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I’d prefer Hell” says the politician. “Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!” Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.  
  
The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise.

They walked down a dank hallway until they came upon a door. “This is your first option of three for you to serve your eternal damnation. Behold.” The EAD slides the hatch on the door and the evil man (let’s call him Jeff) peers in and sees a roomful of other sinners standing on their heads on the splintered, rotten, wooden floor. Jeff let’s out a laugh, “That’s so fucking stupid! Why in the hell would I want to do that forever? What else you got?”

The EAD leads Jeff further down the hallway and the come upon a second door. “Option #2 awaits you,” says EAD as he slides open the tiny window. Jeff looks in and sees basically the same thing—sinners standing on their heads, but in this room, the floor is crusty brick. Jeff snaps indignantly, “What the fuck? If I ain’t doing that on a wood floor, what makes you think I’d do it on bricks? Let’s go, you’re wasting my time.” EAD shrugs and tips his head to the side, pointing into the darkness down the hallway. 

They slog further until they finally come to the end of the hallway to the third door, facing them. “This is it. You gotta pick one.” EAD slides open the window and Jeff pushes him aside, anxious to see this final option. He is immediately slapped with an awful stench, and after wiping away his burning tears he sees a much larger group of sinners, every one smoking cigarettes and sloshing around kneed-deep in wet, steaming shit. Jeff launches into fury, but then catches himself and rubs his chin while he thinks for a minute. “Hmm, I love to smoke, I love it!, and I’m sure I’d eventually get used to that smell. Plus, I get to walk around!” “Yessir, I’ll take it!”

EAD calls over the guard to unlock the door, who then shoves Jeff into the room. He mingles with the crowd a bit and bums a smoke. He lights it and takes a long drag, when suddenly the hatch loudly slides open and the guard pokes his nasty face in, and hollers, “Break’s over! Back on your heads!”",Going to Hell [Long],6

Once upon a time there was a kingdom. This kingdom had a highly respected coat-of-arms flesh and blood animal, a golden-woolled sheep. One day this famous animal has walked away from the kingdom. Days have passed and the king haven't got any news from the whereabouts of the sheep. The king made an announcement, if someone finds the golden-woolled sheep then that person will get the half of the kingdom. But if someone gets home with empty hands then the person will hang. Two months have passed, hundreds have been hung the animal was still missing. The oldest son of the king had enough of this embarassing situation and told to the king that he is going to search the sheep next morning to restore the honor of the kingdom. The king appreciated the courage of the oldest son but warned the man what are the consequences of the search. The same rules are valid to him as well. Pointless searches result hanging, no exceptions. The oldest son went to the expedition, one month passed, he had no clue where is the sheep, had to go home. The king was really frustrated and sorrowful but a promise is a promise. The oldest son was hung. Months have passed after this tragic event and the sheep was still missing. The middle son of the king had enough of this embarassing situation and told to the king that he is going to search the sheep next morning to restore the honor of the kingdom and in memory of his brother. The king wanted to prevent this as he was affraid to lose another son. The middle kid was unstoppable, he went after the animal even so he know what are the consequences. Two months have passed, he had no clue where is the sheep, had to go home. He has been hung. The pain was indescribable for the king. Another months have passed, the animal was still missing. The youngest son of the king had enough of this embarassing situation and told to the king that he is going to search the sheep next morning to restore the honor of the kingdom and in memory of his brothers. The king locked him to his room to prevent the potential loss of his last son. The young kid was really stubborn. One night he managed to escape his room and went after the golden-woolled sheep. Three months have passed and he was not lucky. The animal was still missing. We all know what was the destiny of the youngest kid. As the animal disappeared without any clue the king gave up the whole search. He has stepped down, could not suffer more.

THE END.  
I know this is a sad and meaningless joke. Let me try to tell you another one, I hope you will like it more.

The train adventure

Once upon a time there was a man who went to a long trip with train. He got a seat  in a non-smoking cabin. He had a fellow traveler, a beautiful woman and her poodle. The train has not stopped since the departure. It was 3 hours ago. The man really wanted to smoke. He thought probably it won't be an issue as he always does that and his partners have always approved this. He almost lit the cigarette but the woman told him to stop as this is a non-smoking cabin and she hates the smoke. It was okay for the man, he thought that he can wait for the next stop. The train got to a tunnel. The departure was 5 hours ago and the conductor said that the next departure won't be there soon as the train will stop only at the terminus and it is 5 hours more to get there. The man thought now he waited a lot, he has to smoke. The urge is rising. He almost lit the cigarette but the woman told him to stop as this is still a non-smoking cabin and she hates the smoke. She threathened the man also if he lit a cigarette then she will throw it out throught the window and call the conductor. The man accepted this as he was the careless one and bought a ticket to a non-smoking cabin. An idea struck his mind. He realized that the woman has a poodle who had no muzzle. It was also against the rules. The man said that if the woman does something with his cigarette then he will throw the dog out through the window as it is against the rules. They have made a deal. The terminus was 2 hours away but the man could not hold his urge back. He had to smoke. If no, he will go crazy. So he lit the cigarette. The woman stood up and threw out the cigarette as she promised. The guy became really angry. He threw the dog out after the cigarette. They were so angry they could not talk to each other at that moment, just stared at the landscape through the windows. 10 minutes have passed and a surprising thing happened. They saw the dog who ran beside the train. What was in the dog's mouth?

NO. Not the cigarette. The golden-woolled sheep.

They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger of the two aliens addressed it.

""Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.""

The gas pump (of course) didn't respond.

The younger alien started to get mad at the lack of response and the older one said, ""I wouldn't do that if I were you.""

The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated the greeting.

Again, there was no response.

Annoyed by what he perceived to be the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said impatiently, ""Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Do not ignore us in this way! Take us to your leader, or I will fire.""

The older alien again warned his comrade, ""You don't want to do that. You really don't want to make him mad!""

""Rubbish,"" replied the younger alien.

He aimed his weapon at the pump and fired.

There was a huge explosion.

A massive fireball roared outwards and towards them and blew the younger alien off his feet and deposited him in a burnt and crumpled mess 200 yards away in a cactus patch.

Thirty-five Earth minutes later, when he finally regained consciousness, refocused his three eyes and straightened his bent antenna, he looked dazedly up at the wiser one, who was standing over him, slowly shaking his big green head.

""What a ferocious creature,"" said the young fried one. ""It damn near killed us! How did you know it was so dangerous?""

The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler onto the crispy, peeling flesh and shared some knowledge.

""If there's one thing I've learned during my travels through the galaxy,"" said the wise old alien. ""When a guy has a penis he can wrap around himself twice and then stick it in his ear, you don't mess with him.""",Two aliens landed in the New Mexico desert near a gas station that had been closed for the night.,76

post,de4m8w,2qh72,jokes,false,1570375375,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/de4m8w/a_store_selling_new_husbands/,self.jokes,,"A shop selling new husbands has been opened.

There women can go to find a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance are the following:

You can only visit this store ONCE! It is six floors and the value of the products increases as you come up the floors.

You can choose a product on one floor or you can choose to go up one floor.

But you can't walk down a floor, except to leave the store.

A woman enters the Husband's Shop to find herself a husband. On the first floor there is a sign on the door that says:

&amp;#x200B;

First Floor - These men have permanent jobs.

She is interested, but continues to the second floor where it says:

&amp;#x200B;

Second Floor - These men have a permanent job and love children.

""It's fine"" she thinks, ""but I want more"".

&amp;#x200B;

So she continues upwards. On the third floor it says on the sign:

Third Floor - These men have a permanent job, love children, and look extremely good.

""Shit,"" she thinks, but feels like she has to move on.

&amp;#x200B;

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign says:

Fourth Floor - These men have a permanent job, love children, look insanely good and help with the housework.

""Oh, God help me!"" she says, ""I can't stand it!""

But she still goes up another floor and the sign says:

&amp;#x200B;

Fifth Floor - These men have a permanent job, love children, look insanely good, help with the housework and are very romantic.

She is so tempted, but goes up to the sixth floor, where it says following on the sign:

&amp;#x200B;

6th floor - You are visitor number 31.456.012 on this floor.

There are no men on this floor. This floor exists only as evidence that it is impossible to satisfy women.

Thank you for visiting Husband's Store

&amp;#x200B;

To avoid being accused of gender discrimination, the shop owner has opened a ""New Wife Shop"" just opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

The first floor has wives who love sex.

&amp;#x200B;

The second floor has wives who love sex, have money and like beer

&amp;#x200B;

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never had visitors.",A store selling 'New Husbands',30

The waiter, who is also the owner, walks up to the blind man and hands him a menu. ""I'm sorry, sir, but I am blind and can't read the menu. Just bring me a dirty fork from a previous customer. I'll smell it and order from there."" A little confused, the owner walks over to the dirty dish pile and picks up a greasy fork. He returns to the blind man's table and hands it to him. The blind man puts the fork to his nose and takes in a deep breath. ""Ah, yes, that's what I'll have -- meatloaf and mashed potatoes."" Unbelievable, the owner thinks as he walks towards the kitchen. The cook happens to be the owner's wife. He tells her what had just happened. The blind man eats his meal and leaves. Several days later, the blind man returns and the owner mistakenly brings him a menu again. ""Sir, remember me? I'm the blind man."" ""I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. I'll go get you a dirty fork."" The owner retrieves a dirty fork and brings it to the blind man. After another deep breath, the blind man says, ""That smells great. I'll take the macaroni and cheese with broccoli."" Walking away in disbelief, the owner thinks the blind man is screwing around with him and tells his wife that the next time the blind man comes in he's going to test him. The blind man eats and leaves. He returns the following week, but this time the owner sees him coming and runs to the kitchen. He tells his wife, ""Mary, rub this fork on your panties before I take it to the blind man."" Mary complies and hands her husband the fork. As the blind man walks in and sits down, the owner is ready and waiting. ""Good afternoon, sir, this time I remembered you and I already have the fork ready for you."" The blind man puts the fork to his nose, takes a deep whiff, and says, ""Hey I didn't know that Mary worked here...""",(long) a blind joke.,39

Unsure of its safety, one friend volunteers to investigate while the other three stay behind.

Taking a deep breath, the bravest of the friends walks through the front door and finds a witch waiting for him.

“Oh, ho ho. Stuck on this island are you?” The witch asks, “Well, I’ll tell you what. I’ll give you all the fresh water you can drink if you can give me an orgasm.”

The man, seeing no other options, agrees, and so the witch lays herself upon her kitchen table and spreads her legs, unleashing a swatch of noxious fumes from her ancient nethers.

The man looks around the room quickly, desperate, and spots a tray of corn on the cob cooling on the windowsill. 

Grabbing one, he rams it into the witch, and starts going to town on her until she starts to jerk, spurt, and squirt as she suddenly comes to an orgasm. Then quickly throws it out the window before she can see.

“If you do that one more time. I’ll give you a million dollars.” The witch says in a daze.

Shrugging, the man grabs another piece of corn on the cob and rams it into the witch until she again jerks, spurts, and squirts, coming to an orgasm. He quickly throws Then quickly throws the corn out the window and stands back in triumph.

“If you do that just one more time, I’ll give you a magic Jeep that you can use to fly off this island and never return.”

The mans eyes widen. He grabs the last piece of corn on the cob and rams it into the witch, and sure enough she’s soon jerking, spurting, and squirting to orgasm. The man throws the corn out the window and bursts out the door of the shack.

Running back onto the beach he sees the magic Jeep waiting for him, with a million dollars and a lifetime supply of clean water sitting in the back, but he doesn’t see either of his three friends...

Suddenly, the three other friends come running up from around the side of the shack with huge smiles upon their faces.

“Man, I don’t know what you were doing in there, but we just had the best damn corn on the cob...”",Four men are stranded on a deserted island,14

Dirty, poor service, but the three men were poor and the drinks were always cheap. They welcomed themselves into the pub and sat at the bar.

Notoriously, the service was poor. The barkeep chatted with other bar patrons for a good long while before walking over to the three and taking their orders. Less then kindly, he asked them what they wanted. Te German ordered a pint of beer, whatever they had. The Frenchman ordered their best red wine, not the house swill. The Irishman ordered a glass of good Irish whiskey on the rocks.

After a long, long while, the three received their drinks. They all made faces when they were served, each finding something amiss. Not that any of them were shocked; the pub had to earn its reputation somehow. The German's beer had a lipstick stain on the pint glass. The Frenchman had a long black hair in his wine. The Irishman has dead fruit flies in his whiskey, drowned and floating.

Each man reacted and acted upon his muddled drink of a different course.

The German simple took a cocktail napkin from the pile and scrubbed off red lipstick and started drinking. The Frenchman, appalled and disgusted, pushed away his stemmed glass and sent the wine back. The Irishman lifted up his stout rocks tumbler and held it his eye, glared into the drink. At the flies.

Sticking his fingers into the ice and whiskey, he picked out one of the flies and bellowed at it, ""SPIT IT OUT, YOU WEE LITTLE BASTARD! SPIT IT OUT!""","A German, a Frenchman, and a Irishman walk into a pub.",7

He is unable to sleep however, as his increasingly drunk friends tell political jokes loudly.

After a while, the tired man gets frustrated and walks downstairs for a smoke. He stops in the lounge and asks the receptionist to bring tea to their room in five minutes.

The man walks back into the room, joins the table, leans towards a power outlet and speaks into it:

""Comrade major, we want some tea to room 62 please.""

His friends laugh on the joke, until there is a knock on the door. The receptionist brings a tea pot. His friends fall silent and pale, horrified of what they just witnessed. The party is dead, and the man goes to sleep.

After a good night's rest, the man wakes up, and notices his friends are gone. Surprised, he walks downstairs and asks the receptionist where they went.

The nervous receptionist whispers that KGB came and took them before dawn.

The man is horrified. He wonders why he was spared.

The receptionist responds:

""Well, comrade major did quite like your tea gag.",Three men are in a hotel room in Soviet Russia,398

Deep in the mountains, he saw a gigantic drizzly resting. 

He took aim, and pulled the trigger. 

He went to where he had seen the bear,  but it was nowhere to be found. 

He felt a tap on his shoulder, turned and saw the bear

""I am so tired of hunters trying to kill me,  so you have a choice. You blow me, or I kill you.""

The hunter did the deed, and the bear left happy. 

After a month the hunter returned to get his revenge. He got a larger rifle, and laid in wait for the bear. 

After days, he found the bear again, took aim, and shot. 

He went to where the bear was, and again it had dissapeared. He felt a tap on his shoulder, turned, and again saw the bear. 

""You didnt learn your lesson last time? Same options, your choice.""

The hunter did the deed again, and left humiliated. 

Almost a year later he returned. He prepared even more, getting explosives, traps, and an elephant rifle. 

He set up all of his traps in a clearing, and made sure to bait it with a feast. 

He laid waiting for the bear for a week, barely eating, and not moving. At last, the bear came sniffing around, and stopped in the clearing for the feast. 

In one move, he activated the explosives, the traps, and shot the bear. A cloud of smoke and dust flew up and stayed for 10 minutes. 

The hunter went to the clearing to finally claim his prize. And he felt the tap on his shoulder. He turned, and there was the bear, completely unharmed with a smirk on his face. 

""Let's be honest, this isn't about the hunting anymore, is it?""",The Hunter,58
