If you put a woman on a pedestal and try to protect her from the rat race, you're a male chauvinist. 
If you stay home and do the housework, you're a pansy. 
If you work too hard, there's never any time for her. 
If you don't work enough, you're a good-for-nothing bum. 
If she has a boring repetitive job with low pay, this is exploitation. If you have a boring repetitive job with low pay, you should get off your lazy behind and find something better. 
If you get a promotion ahead of her, that is favouritism. If she gets a job ahead of you, its equal opportunity.
If you mention how nice she looks, its sexual harassment. If you keep quiet, its male indifference. 
If you cry, you're a wimp. If you don't, you're an insensitive bastard. 
If you make a decision without consulting her, you're a chauvinist. If she makes a decision without consulting you, she's a liberated woman. 
If you ask her to do something she doesn't enjoy, that's domination. If SHE asks you, it's a favour. 
If you appreciate the female form and sexy underwear, you're a pervert. If you don't, you're gay.
If you like a woman to shave her legs and keep in shape, you're sexist. If you don't, you're unromantic. 
If you try to keep yourself in shape, you're vain. If you don't, you're a slob. 
If you buy her flowers, you're after something. If you don't, you're not thoughtful. 
If you're proud of your achievements, you're full of yourself. If you don't, you're not ambitious. 
If she has a headache, she's tired. If you have a headache, you don't love her anymore. 
If you want it too often, you're oversexed. If you don't, there must be someone else.

 Father O'Malley rose from his bed one morning. It was a fine spring
 day in his new west Texas mission parish. He walked to the window of
 his bedroom to get a deep breath of the beautiful day outside.
 
 He then noticed there was a jackass lying dead in the middle of his
 front lawn. He promptly called the local police station.
 
 The conversation went like this:
 
 ""Good morning. This is Sergeant Jones. How might I help you?""
 
 ""And the best of the day te yerself. This is Father O'Malley at St.
 Ann's Catholic Church. There's a jackass lying dead in me front lawn

 Sergeant Jones, considering himself to be quite a wit and recognizing
 the foreign accent, thought he would have a little fun with the good
 father, replied, ""Well now Father, it was always my impression that
 you people took care of the last rites!""
 
 There was dead silence on the line for a long moment...

""Oh my god guys,"" says Vinny, ""you shouldn't have.""

""Oh my god, you shouldn't have!"" he exclaimed again.


""Vinny, that's not all of it,"" says one of the godfathers, who proceeds to hand him a folder. Inside, Vinny finds a contract for a 30 million dollar hit.


""YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE!"" Vinny exclaimed, excitedly.


""Wait, Vinny,"" says the godfather, ""there's more,"" and leads him to a staircase going down to the restaurant's, where they find the contract's target, all tied up to a chair, his mouth taped shut, just waiting for Vinny to kill him and get the money.

“Guys. Guys,” says Vinny, tears now forming in his eyes from the happiness. “This is amazing. I don’t have to do anything for this hit. Thank you, guys, so much.”

“Wait Vinny, there’s still more,” says one of the mobsters, and approaches the target. He rips off the duct tape over the guy’s mouth, and the target starts singing:

She was a very good-looking woman, and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching. So, she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand. 

Two men applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied, she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. 

He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. 

Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, ""You have done a really good job and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels."" 

The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. 

However, one o'clock came and he didn't return. Two o'clock came and no hired hand. He returned around two-thirty and found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace. 

She quietly called him over to her. 

""Unbutton my blouse and take it off,"" she said. Trembling, he did as she directed. 

""Now, take off my boots."" He did so, slowly. 

""Now, take off my socks."" He did. 

""Now, take off my skirt."" He did. 

""Now, take off my bra."" Again with trembling hands he did as he was told. 

""Now,"" she said, ""take off my panties."" He slowly pulled them down and off.

She passes by the abandoned warehouse only to see Alfred the local arsonist hanging about. Struck with curiosity and a foreboding sense of danger the nun decided to hide and watch. She watched as Alfred gathered dozens of old gas cans and spread them around the warehouse. Alfred then proceeds to pour a trail of gas out of the building then lights the trail from the doorway. Alfred not knowing the warehouse was still full of old chemicals created a huge fireball that blew him across the lot and burned him severely.  The nun rushes in to help. Seeing as Alfred is bleeding badly the nun tries to rip the seam on her sleeve to make a bandage she can’t get the leverage she needs to get it so she shouts at Alfred’s barely conscious form “YOU MUST BREAK THIS BAD HABIT IF YOU WANT TO LIVE!”,Nun of you are allowed to read this.,3

Over to the left is where the Muslims generally hang out. In here are the Buddists,” and so on.

Finally, before rounding a corner, Peter stops and brings a finger to his lips, warning the man, “Ok, you need to be REALLY quiet around this area.” He then slowly leads the way around the corner and shows the man a large group of people on their knees in quiet, devout prayer, murmuring softly to themselves. And after a few moments, the two of them slowly back away.

She again replied, ' Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem.

Seeking shelter, he found an old stone pub with a light on, and stumbled in through the front door.  The pub was painfully small, with just a handful of stools, a barkeep, and one old man sitting in a stool on the end of the bar, and smelled like the sort of must that can only come from centuries of use.

The college kid sat down on one of the old, wooden stools and ordered a Guinness.  Scowling, the barkeep pulled an ancient can out of some recess of the bar and poured it sloppily, as the college kid handed him a fiver.  The college kid slowly started sipping his drink, staring at the bar, waiting for the rain to pass, when suddenly he noticed that the old man was staring at him.  

""How do you do?"" the college kid asked him.

The old man just turned and spat on the floor.  Finally, after a long moment, he spoke in a heavy Scottish brogue.

""Duh ya see this bar?  I built this bar out of solid mahogany, I did.  Board by board, I did.  But do they call me old Willie the bar maker?  Nooooooo.""

""Alright,"" thought the college kid, as he turned back to his (ugh) Guinness and continued waiting out the rain.  After a long minute, he heard the old man cough and turned his way again.

""Duh ya see that low stone fence out through yonder window?  I built that fence, I did.  Stone by stone, I did.  But do they call me old Willie the stone layer?  Noooooooo.""

""Okey dokey"" thought the college kid, and he gave the old man a ""cheers"" gesture with his (jesus christ) Guinness and turned back.  After another long minute, he heard the old man start to speak again.

""Look out yonder, at that pier stretchin' out into the loch.  Ya see that pier?  I built that pier, I did.  With me own two hands, I did, board by board.  But do they call me old Willie the pier builder?  Noooooooo!""

Several were dropped and rolled down toward the fence. Another boy can riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery, and he slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard 

""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me."" He just knew what it was.

""Oh, my,"" he shuddered, ""it's Satan and the Lord dividing soul at the cemetery.""

He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along. ""Come here quick,"" said the boy, ""you won't believe what I heard. Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls.""

The man said, ""Beat it, kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk?""

When the boy insisted, though, the man hobbled to the cemetery.

Standing by the fence, they heard, ""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.""

The old man whispered, ""Boy, you've been tellin' the truth. Let's see if we can see the devil himself.""

Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of Satan.

At last they heard, ""One for you, one for me. And one last one for you. That's all.

Now let's go get those nuts by the fence, and we'll be done..."" ",Nuts by the fence,168

He can't believe that a kangaroo walked into his bar, ordered a martini, and then actually had a twenty-dollar bill to pay for it.

So, in amazement, he takes the twenty and walks to the cash register to make the change. While he's standing in front of the cash register he stops for a second and thinks to himself, ""Let me try something here and see if the kangaroo notices anything."" 

So he walks back over to the kangaroo and hands him two dollars change. The kangaroo doesn't say anything, he just sits there sipping the martini. After a few minutes the bartender just can't take it anymore.

""You know,"" he says to the kangaroo, ""we don't get too many kangaroos in here."" 

""At eighteen dollars a drink, I'm not surprised,"" says the kangaroo.

""You noticed!"" exclaims the bartender. The bartender rips off his clothes, revealing he is actually a gorilla. ""Since you are also a talking animal, I will grant you one wish.""

""Could you make me a martini that magically refills?"" The kangaroo asks.

""I don't know that kind of magic, and I have no idea how to create that kind of drink!"" The gorilla moans.

""Ok, can you stop people reposting on r/jokes whilst only changing the setup?"" The kangaroo asks.

Aghast, I watched the poor bartender slouch over to the tap, and pulled three perfect pints, which he deftly delivered without spilling a drop.  I had to admire his skill and professionalism.

All night it went like this, meathead pounding the bar, yelling ""Jackass! Get me another round of beers!"", and each time, he'd deliver them without a word.

  
Now, I have a tendency to stick my nose where it doesn't belong, and you know what, I thought this guy needed to grow a freaking backbone.  Leaning over the bar, I waved him over.

The last man walks in, and after 30 second he walks out with blood all over him

No sooner had I come back aboard the ship, though, did I find meself under the gaze o' Captain Nobeard!

""Well, matey,"" said she, ""I see you be having a fine new pet!""

""Aye, Cap'n,"" said I. ""His name be 'A'turnin,' on account of his...""

""Enough!"" the captain shouted. ""Since ye been having such *fun* ashore, tonight you can sweep the anchor chain!"" Handed me a broom, did she, and tasked me to sweep every inch of metal holding our anchor.

I took to the chore as any sea-dog would, but each time I was about to get underway, A'turnin would flap down from me shoulder and perch there on the broomstick!

""Back on the shoulder with ye!"" shouted I to the bird... but he paid no mind, so I took to tossing him in the air, in the hopes that he'd land back on me shoulder. Each time I did, he'd come back down to rest on the broomstick, keeping me from my work. I'd throw A'turnin off, and he'd come flapping back. I'd throw him again, and there he'd perch!

This went on through the night, until the red horizon of morning dawned. When the captain came out to check on me, she were beset by a great fury.

""What is the meaning of this, swab?!"" demanded she. ""Why be the anchor chain still unclean?!""

I swallowed then, did I, and answered as honestly as I could:

""I'm sorry, Cap'n!"" said I. ""I been tossin' A'turnin all night, and I haven't swept a link!""","Given that it be Talk Like A Pirate Day, I be havin' a story about me parrot!",61

A new girl came to school, she was like a 6/10 and had frizzy hair and really long bird-legs. Everyone made fun of her calling her “Birdy” “Big Bird” “Bird Legs” etc. 

I saw her at lunch one day all by herself, I mean even I have friends to sit with, I felt really bad for her so I built up my courage to sit with her. We get to talking and it turns out we actually have a lot in common. We kept in touch and eventually began dating, I even lost my virginity to her.   
My new relationship makes me feel more confident about my life and I began working out more, eating healthier and expanding my circle of friends, I felt cooler and cooler. However, my gaining in popularity meant my gf began to drag me down. Everyone started asking me “why are you dating Bird-legs” or “I can’t believe you are going out with that Birdy girl”. I stupidly listen to them because i was an arrogant male teenager and decide to break up with her. We broke up via text and got into a huge fight. She said that she had been there for me since I was a loser. I blow her off and say I don’t like her anymore. She called me the next day crying, but I wasn’t having it and hung up.   
I felt like a boss for dumping the only girl that had ever liked me.   
Next day I came to school feeling chipper, but everybody’s got their heads hung and looking somber, a couple of girls are even crying. I wondered what was going on and my friend came up to me and tells me “I’m really sorry”... “sorry about what?”  
“You dont know?” He says somberly, “I thought you of all people would have heard first...”  
“Heard about what? Tell me goddamnit”  
“I thought everyone had heard... about the Bird”

The IRS auditor was not surprised when the old man showed up with his attorney.

The auditor said, ‘Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.’

‘I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,’ says the elderly guy. ‘How about a demonstration?’
The auditor thinks for a moment and says, ‘Okay. Go ahead. ‘

The old guy says, ‘I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.’
The auditor thinks a moment and says, ‘It’s a bet.’
The elderly guy removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.
The old guy then says, ‘Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.’

The auditor can tell he isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.
The elderly guy removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with his attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.
‘Want to go double or nothing?’ the elderly person asks ‘I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.’
The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

The old guy stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.

But the elderly guy's attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.
‘Are you okay?’ the auditor asks.
‘Not really,’ says the attorney. ‘This morning, when He told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it'",One day an elderly rich person is summoned by the IRS.,3945

The mouse delighted in his friend’s company unaware that the friend was slowly turning into an enemy. The reason? The frog felt slighted because though he visited the mouse everyday, the mouse on his part, had never made an attempt to visit him. 

One day he felt he had been humiliated enough. When it was time for him to take leave of the mouse, he tied one end of a string around his own leg, tied the other end to the mouse’s tail, and hopped away, dragging the hapless mouse behind him. 

The frog dived deep into the pond. The mouse tried to free himself but couldn’t, and soon drowned. His bloated body floated to the top. 

A hawk saw the mouse floating on the pond’s surface. He swooped down, and grabbing the mouse in his talons, flew to the branch of a nearby tree. The frog, of course, was hauled out of the water too. He desperately tried to free himself, but couldn’t and the hawk soon put an end to his struggles.

Graduation came, he was accepted into Harvard's School of Law (to no one's surprise), and that was the last I saw of him. Or so I thought...

Twenty years later, my wife and I are on a road trip to head over to Anaheim, California, for our yearly vacation. We go see Universal Studios, we take a peek at DisneyLand, and we go to SeaWorld since my wife always wanted to see a dolphin. The dolphin attraction was quite fascinating; they had a system where you could pay a quarter and have a keeper give a dolphin a piece of fish for you - and since dolphins are so smart, the young ones figured that they could put in a little elegance to please their audiences in order to get more fish.

The youngest dolphins were served by a man that looked vaguely familiar to me, and I spotted him again once we were leaving the park. I approached him, and sure enough, it was none other than Justin Reimer! My wife and I walk over to him, I introduce the two together, and we invite him for a beer.

While we're discussing things over a pint, I ask him why he's at SeaWorld. ""I thought you were gonna go big, dude! You even got into fucking HARVARD! Hell, half the class thought you were going for President!""

""Well, Anon, after I graduated, Suma Cum Laude, I went to work for the second-largest law firm in New York City. I was doing so well, I was offered a partnership in the law firm, and I accepted. A few years passed and the firm was doing great, then someone from the Republican Party came to me and asked me if I wanted to '... become a senator. We think you have a chance at winning the upcoming election.' This was gonna be a major change in my life, and I told him I'd take some time to reflect on it. That weekend, I went out to my summer house in The Hamptons to do some hard thinking. So I took a good hard look at my life and realized that I wasn't on a path that was morally sound, for me. After all, being a lawyer is just helping wealthy criminals beat the system. And the Republican Party? I mean... c'mon. 'This just isn't for me', I thought. So, when I saw a posting for the job I'm currently working, which is feeding baby dolphins, I figured 'Why the hell not?' Because here, at SeaWorld, I find I truly have a chance to serve a youthful porpoise.""","When I was growing up, I went to school with a boy named Justin Reimer.",7

1)Drink five bottles of hard whiskey in one go.

2)Enter a room where there was a starving lion and pluck out its eyes with bare hands.

Many  people bravely tried their hand at it. Few could get beyond the first  stage. And the inebriated few who managed it, got promptly eaten  up by  the starving lion. There was none who could read the third stage.

And  then, one fine day, a nonchalant man walked into the contest. Five   bottles of whiskey were nothing for him. He emptied five bottles in five   gulps. Then he said, “Show me the lion!” When shown the room, he  coolly  walked in. There was no hint of fear on his face, but rather the  cool  confidence of a person who knew he could do it.

Sounds  of a mammoth fight came from the room. Screams of the man and  growls  of the lion were intermingled. Thumps and thuds which shook the  very  earth ensued. All of a sudden there was a piercing, heart-rending  roar  from the Lion. The audience waited with bated breath, their hair  stood  on end. And then, as suddenly as it had begun, the titanic roar   stopped. An eerie silence prevailed.

As  the audience watched, with eyes popping out, the door of the room  opened, and out came the man. Badly bruised, with blood streaming from   his face, hands and legs, he stumbled out – victorious, nevertheless.   His face had the glow of satisfaction of an emperor who had just won a   battle.

After seeing the roots burning Roxanne said, “If you want to surprise Sarah in bed, you need to go home early for work and walk into your bedroom wearing nothing but boots. If you do this, she will orgasm.” George was reluctant at first, but eventually went along with Roxanne’s advice.

 He left work at noon and went home. He walked into the garage and stripped down to nothing but boots. George then walks straight into his bedroom, and sees Sarah having sex with her black personal trainer from Thailand. Surprised to see George home so early, Sarah orgasms right there in bed.

Now, of course, the issue is that race isn't such a cut-and-dry thing, so after sorting through the obvious cases, it comes time to figure out the bi-/multi-racial people. So, to start the process, they gather all of the black/white biracial people in New York in Yankee Stadium to sort through. The announcement goes over the loudspeakers:

""Everybody please remain in your seats so we can deal with you in a calm and orderly fashion. We will be sorting through each of you to determine whether you are ultimately black or white. If you are deemed black, you will be going to Africa with General Zheng-""

An older man dressed in military fatigues is shown smiling and waving on the Jumbotron.

""Whereas if you are white, you will stay here in North America, and you will be overseen by General Wong.""

The Jumbotron again cuts to an older man in military fatigues, only this time he is screaming his head off at one of his assistants, who is cowering in fear. As he notices the camera is now on him, rather than smiling and waving like General Zheng, he gives a scowl to the crowd and resumes barking orders at his underlings.

Upon seeing this, one man in the crowd turns to his neighbor and says,
