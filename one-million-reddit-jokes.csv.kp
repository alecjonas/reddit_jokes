At this point, we’re winging it. We’re going to measure between two points of your body, and whatever the distance is in inches, that’s how many thousand dollars you’ll get. So think about what two points of your body are furthest apart and we’ll get started.” 

The first soldier to be measured is pretty tall, so he requests that the measurement be taken from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet. The man with the measuring tape says “73 inches, that’ll be 73 thousand dollars.” The soldier receives his check and goes home. 

The second soldier has long arms, so he requests that he be measured from one fingertip to the other with his arms outstretched. It’s 74 inches. He gets his check and goes home. 

The third soldier is a grizzled old sergeant whose face is pockmarked with scars. As the measurer approaches he says “I want you to measure from the front of my pecker to the back of my balls.” 

“Listen,” the VA official tells him, “I really think you should reconsider. You’ve got your future to think about.” The old sergeant stays firm in his request and pulls down his pants. 

The measurer approaches with the tape but pauses upon inspecting the sergeant’s undercarriage. “Sir,” he says, “where are your balls?” 

“Vietnam.”

In the culture that they lived in, most believed that when a person died, a new star was born in the sky for them. However, Joke did not believe this, and he firmly believed the soul was stored in comets, since they were sent from the heavens down to Earth. 

Most would laugh at him, saying, ""You are ridiculous to believe that someone's soul would be stored in comets after they pass! You surely can't be serious!""

But Joke kept his belief, and his family stood firmly behind him on it as well, believing it just as much as he did. 

When he died, there was a service, and they buried him at night. At the end of his burial, everyone looked up to the stars.

They all whispered quietly, ""A new star is born for Joke, who has passed on from us into the heavens.""

Everyone said this except for his family.

The officer, a little surprised, says ""So it won't be in the glovebox when I open it?""

The guy adds ""Not a good idea to open the glovebox. There's a loaded gun in there. Unregistered, serial number's been filed off, it was likely smuggled into the area as well.""

The officer is very taken aback by this, and asks if there's anything in the trunk he should know about.

""Well, the problem with the trunk is that there's a dead body in there.""

The officer calls for backup dealing with this, and when backup arrives, the officer has his gun to the guy, who's out of the car and cuffed on the ground. The backup officer searches the car and goes up to the guy, and says ""Sir, my partner says that the car was stolen and there's a loaded gun in the glovebox, but it was just the registration and insurance information in your name.

Everyone knows the Hotness scale of 0-10. However, not many know the amount of people at each level.

Assuming 7.4 Billion people there are:

~5 billion 5's

~1 billion 6's

~100 million 7's

~9 million 8's

~220 thousand 9's

~2 thousand 10's.

Now the scale is weighted upwards. So 6's are all people between 6 and 6.99999, 7's are people between 7 and 7.9999 etc.

However, this means that 10's are actually 10's and up.

So the eternal question, are there 11's?

Yes, there are 11's and that's why I hang out at convenience stores for you see,

So the zoo owner asks one of his workers to wear a gorilla suit they have in storage for an extra $100 a day if he will go in the gorilla cage and pretend to be the gorilla until the zoo can afford a new one.

Quickly, the new ""gorilla"" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo. People from all over are coming to see the ""Human-like"" gorilla.

About a month in, the craze has started to wear off. So, to get peoples' attention back, he decides to climb over his enclosure and hang from the net ceiling above the lions den next to him. A large crowd of people gather watching the spectacle in awe and terror. Suddenly the man loses his grip and falls to the floor of the lion's den. The man starts screaming ""HELP!! HELP!!!""

On the day of the triple execution, they are brought to be beheaded. The priest blesses the execution, saying all is done in God's name, and the King orders the three executed.

The mathematician is to be killed first, and the executioner gives him two options: would he like a hood on or off, and would he like to be face up or face down.

So the mathematician says ""Well, they all arrive at the equivalent state of beheading, so it's an arbitrary choice. I suppose I'll take no hood and face down, since it's the simplest solution.""

So they lock him into the guillotine, the executioner drops the blade... and it stops inches from his neck.

The priest exclaims ""It's a sign from God! This man is innocent! He must be let free!""

The King agrees, pardons the mathematician, and lets him go.

Next up to be killed is the physicist. He is given the same options: hood on or off; face up or face down.

So the physicist thinks, and says ""Well, I've spent my whole life looking up at the stars and studying them... but it's broad daylight. I will take the hood to make it dark like night, and face up towards the Heavens.""

So they lock him into the guillotine, the executioner drops the blade... and it stops inches from his neck.

The priest exclaims again ""It's a sign from God! This man is innocent! He must be let free!""

The King agrees, pardons the physicist, and lets him go.

Finally, it's the engineer's turn to face the guillotine. He's given the same options: hood on or off; face up or down.

The engineer ponders, and says ""I've spent my whole life studying machines and mechanical devices. If I am to be killed by the most efficient killing machine of all time, then I will look at its workings while I die! Hood off and face up!""

So they lock him into the guillotine, and the executioner is about to drop the blade, when the engineer exclaims: ""I see the problem!""","A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer are all found guilty of treason...",499

Robin replies, “ I see millions of stars.”
“What does that tell you?” asks Batman.
Robin ponders for a minute.
“Astronomically speaking, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets.
Astrologically, it tells me that Saturn is in Leo.
Chronologically, it appears to be approximately a quarter past three.
Theologically, it’s evident the Lord is all-powerful and we are small and insignificant.
Meteorologically, it seems we will have a beautiful day tomorrow.
What does it tell you, Batman?”
Batman is silent for a moment, then speaks:
“Robin, you idiot, someone has stolen our tent.”

But just as he was reaching for an application form, Andrei stopped him.  

""Wait a minute,"" Andrei said. ""If this is all they are making it out to be, we should both go at once. But if, by some tiny chance, anything should be a little less than promised... why then, we will be in the middle of Siberia, thousands of miles from anywhere, and what will we do then?""  

""You're right,"" said Vladimir. ""But how can we find out what conditions are really like? Perhaps one of us should go first and find out, and then he can write home.""  

""A good idea,"" said Andrei. ""Except that we can expect that the mail will be scrutinised, and it would not do to be found saying anything critical of the Government, now would it?""  

""Very well,"" said Vladimir. ""Then let us agree that if the letter home is favourable, then the other one of us will come - unless the letter is written in red ink, for that will be our sign that the letter is not truthful.""  

They agreed to this and spun a 20-kopek coin for the privilege of being the one to make the investigation, and Vladimir after all was the one to go to Siberia while Andrei waited patiently for the letter. When it arrived, weeks later, he was delighted to see that it was written in blue, and he read as follows:  

*Dear friend! Everything is as they said. There is full employment here, the work is interesting and fulfilling and the hours are most reasonable. As for the wages, a man can earn here as he never did in Moscow even, and the accommodations are clean, dry and warm such as to excite the envy of an American, well lit and furnished with every kind of modern convenience. There is plenty to eat and drink, and the shops are filled with everything a man might wish to buy -- with, surprisingly, the absence only of red ink.*",Two Russians saw an advertisement for a job in Siberia.,13

The priest is incredulous. ""Then go and sin, sisters, so you can confess. I will wait here for you.""

The nuns go off to sin on the orders of the priest, and half an hour later they are back, queuing up in front of him.

The first sister replies, ""Yes, father. Forgive me for I have sinned. I defaced the church with graffiti!""

""Say three Ave Maria's and drink some holy water,"" the priest tells her. ""What about you, sister?"" he then says to the second nun.

""Father, forgive me for I have sinned. I broke my vow of chastity and had sex with a farmer,"" she confesses.

""Five Ave Maria's, and drink some holy water, sister."" He then turns to the third and last nun, who is desperately trying hard not to laugh.

He was quick-witted and humorous; as a Zen Buddhism follower he was very serious and self-disciplined. He often discussed buddhism with his good friend, Zen Master Foyin. The two lived across the river from one another.
Following is an interesting and famous story about him and Zen Master Foyin.
One day, Su Dongpo felt inspired and wrote the following poem:
I bow my head to the heaven within heaven
Hairline rays illuminating the universe
The eight winds cannot move me
Sitting still upon the purple golden lotus

The “eight winds” in the poem referred to praise, ridicule, honor, disgrace, gain, loss, pleasure and misery – interpersonal forces of the material world that drive and influence the hearts of men. Su Dongpo was saying that he has attained a higher level of spirituality, where these forces no longer affect him.
Impressed by himself, Su Dongpo sent a servant to hand-carry this poem to Foyin. He was sure that his friend would be equally impressed. When Foyin read the poem, he immediately saw that it was both a tribute to the Buddha and a declaration of spiritual refinement. Smiling, the Zen Master wrote “fart” on the manuscript and had it returned to Su Dongpo.
Su Dongpo was expecting compliments and a seal of approval. When he saw “fart” written on the manuscript, he was shocked . He burst into anger: “How dare he insult me like this? Why that lousy old monk! He’s got a lot of explaining to do!”
Full of indignation, he rushed out of his house and ordered a boat to ferry him to the other shore as quickly as possible. He wanted to find Foyin and demand an apology. However, Foyin’s door closed. On the door was a piece of paper, for Su Dongpo. The paper had following two lines:
The eight winds cannot move me

And then he proudly proceeded to demonstrate to her what it was for. Maria was pleased. After their honeymoon was over, Pedro returned to work. On returning home in the evening after his first day at work posthoneymoon, Pedro found a very upset Maria waiting on their front porch.

'Pedro, you said you were the only man in the world with one of those and yet today, when I saw Gonzalez changing his clothes behind the shed, he had one, too!'

Ever a 'Fast Thinker' on his feet, Pedro said, 'Oh, Maria, Gonzalez is my best friend. Since I had two, I gave him one. So he is the only other man in the world with one.'

The pilot and copilot finally appear in the rear of the plane and begin walking up to the cockpit through the center aisle. 
Both appear to be blind; the pilot is using a white cane, bumping into passengers right and left as he stumbles down the aisle.  The copilot is using a guide dog.  Both have their eyes covered with sunglasses.  
At first, the passengers do not react thinking that it must be some sort of practical joke.  After a few minutes though, the engines start revving, and the airplane begins moving down the runway.  The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness.  They start whispering among themselves and look desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance.  
Yet, the plane starts accelerating rapidly, and people begin panicking.  Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer and closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and more hysterical.  When the plane has less than twenty feet of runway left, there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once.  At the very last moment, the plane lifts off and is airborne. 
Up in the cockpit, the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and tells the pilot: ""You know, one of these days the passengers aren't going to scream, and we aren't going to know when to take off!""

Whatever you wish for, your husband will get times ten!""

The woman said, ""That's okay.""

For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world.

The frog warned her, ""You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis whom women will flock to.""

The woman replied, ""That's okay, because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me.""

So, KAZAM-she's the most beautiful woman in the world!

post,7xhjyp,2qh72,jokes,false,1518610161,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7xhjyp/blind_man_in_a_restaurant/,self.jokes,,"

A blind man walks into a restaurant and sits down. The waiter, who is also the owner, walks up to the blind man and hands him a menu.

""I'm sorry, sir, but I am blind and can't read the menu. Just bring me a dirty fork from a previous customer. I'll smell it and order from there.""

A little confused, the owner walks over to the dirty dish pile and picks up a greasy fork. He returns to the blind man's table and hands it to him. The blind man puts the fork to his nose and takes in a deep breath.

""Ah, yes, that's what I'll have -- meatloaf and mashed potatoes.""

Unbelievable, the owner thinks as he walks towards the kitchen. The cook happens to be the owner's wife. He tells her what had just happened.

The blind man eats his meal and leaves.

Several days later, the blind man returns and the owner mistakenly brings him a menu again.

""Sir, remember me? I'm the blind man.""

""I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. I'll go get you a dirty fork.""

The owner retrieves a dirty fork and brings it to the blind man.

After another deep breath, the blind man says, ""That smells great. I'll take the macaroni and cheese with broccoli.""

Walking away in disbelief, the owner thinks the blind man is screwing around with him and tells his wife that the next time the blind man comes in he's going to test him.

The blind man eats and leaves.

He returns the following week, but this time the owner sees him coming and runs to the kitchen.

He tells his wife, ""Mary, rub this fork on your panties before I take it to the blind man.""

Mary complies and hands her husband the fork. As the blind man walks in and sits down, the owner is ready and waiting.

""Good afternoon, sir, this time I remembered you and I already have the fork ready for you.""

The blind man puts the fork to his nose, takes a deep whiff, and says, ""Hey I didn't know that Mary worked here...""",Blind man in a restaurant ...,107

He bit down on her fingers and she let out a violent scream. Clint Eastwood grimaced and squinted his eyes, as only he could. He continued to bite her hand. Again and again and again he tore into her flesh with his teeth. Reese Witherspoon gasped for air as Clint Eastwood moved toward her forearm, her shoulder, and then her neck. Reese Witherspoon shook violently as the blood poured out onto the ground. After what seemed like hours of horror, Reese Witherspoon fell to the ground lifeless and cold. Clint Eastwood froze. He looked down at the carnage and fell to his knees. “What have I done!” he cried out in disbelief. He looked up at David Caruso, trembling with fear in his eyes.

 He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer, when suddenly- He tripped and fell. 

Rolling over to pick himself up, he found the bear was right on top of him, reaching towards him with its left paw,  raising the right paw to strike-

 At that instant the Atheist cried out, 

""Oh my God!""

Time Stopped.

 The bear froze.

The forest was silent.

 A bright light shone upon the man, and a voice came out of the sky:

 ""You deny my existence for all these years, you teach others that I don't exist and even credit creation to cosmic accident... Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament?"" ""Am I to count you as a believer?"" 

The atheist looked directly into the light.... ""Well, it would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask you to treat me as a Christian now... but... perhaps you could make the *BEAR* a Christian?""

...a pause...

""Very well,"" said the voice.  

The light went out.

The sounds of the forest resumed...  

And the bear dropped his right arm... brought both paws together... bowed his head and spoke,

""Lord, bless this food, which I am about to receive.""","An atheist was walking through the woods, enjoying the scenery ,",268

In the year 1972, five men from the DNC committee broke into Richard Nixon's office to find a letter written by Joseph Stalin himself in 1960 regarding a deal that would go down where Soviet water would be poured through the Hoover dam to generate electricity. This went agains the Great Hydrogen Act of 1954 which stated that no compounds of hydrogen would be imported from enemy nations because of the potential flammability hazards it would pose. This meant that Nixon had committed a federal offense of the highest order (which, at the time, was punishable by up to 20 years in prison) and thus had given his enemies grounds for impeachment. The reason this never happened is that, when confronted with the evidence, Nixon chose to resign, seeing that there was no hope for his career in the future. The most crucial piece of all was not the written deal, however— when the men inspected the water supply that was found to be powering the dam, they realized that the water itself gave the secret away to begin with;

It was rushin'.",The Real Watergate Scandal,4

Ollie wanted to play in a rock band again, just like before he died. But the only instrument allowed in heaven was the harp. He was a little sad about it, but learned to play the harp anyway, and became pretty good about it.

But Ollie Oyster missed his good friend Sam Clam. One day he asked God if he could visit Sam. God said ""Well, we dont normally do that kind of thing. But you were a very good oyster, so I can make a small exception. I'll let you visit Sam for one day. But the catch is, you have to take your harp with you. They dont have harps in hell, so when you want to get back into heaven just come to the front gate and play your harp, and we'll know its you and let you in.""

Ollie was overjoyed, grabbed his harp, and went to visit his old friend.

Ollie found Sam, and they soon caught up on old times. Musical instruments of all kinds were allowed in hell, and Sam had formed a band, made a lot of money, and eventually opened his own disco. The two friends partied the night away in Sam's disco, talking about old times, drinking heavily, and having a great time. 

Finally, Ollie realized that time had gotten away from him, and he had only minutes to get back to heaven. He rushed out of the disco, leaving his harp behind. 

He made it to the front gates of heaven, and pounded on the door. St Peter peeked out, and said ""God told me you would be coming back, but I cant let you in until I hear you play your harp!""

So the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”

And the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”

So the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.

So the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”

And the bartender reclaims, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

So the guy processes this. And he’s like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”

And the bartender replies, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”

And the guy’s like, “World peace.”

So the bartender is understandably ashamed.

And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.

And the bartender, in a shy way, says, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”

And the guy’s like, “You don’t have to.”

But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”

And the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s like, “Where do you think that comes from?”

And the bartender’s like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”

And the guy goes, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”

And the bartender’s like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”

So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”

And the bartender goes, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.

And the twelve-inch pianist continues, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”

And the bartender’s like, “That’s horrible.”

And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he states, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”

And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he speaks, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”

And then he starts to cry. And he goes, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”

And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!

And the pianist is like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”

And everybody laughs. And the pianist is like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”

And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me?”

And the bartender’s response is, “No, it’s not like that.” You know? He’s trying to backpedal.

And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.

And the bartender goes, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”

And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”

And the bartender’s like, “Whoa, calm down.”

And the pianist is like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”

And he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.

And suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.

And the bartender’s like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”

And the pianist is like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”

And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”

And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.

So the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.

So the guy’s like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”

And the genie’s like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.

And the guy says, “Well done.”

And then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.” ",So a Guy Walks Into a Bar...,0
