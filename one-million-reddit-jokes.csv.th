All happy and cheerfull about not having to walk home and being able to call an escort that evening I go to the cab spot. Now I'm out of the casino a lot earlier than last time and luckily there's plenty of cabs around. 

The thing is, this one driver, who told me to go suck a dick is standing at the front of the row. Being on top of the world made me come up with a plan to get even with that guy real fast. I go into the last cab and ask how much it is to get to my house, the driver tells me it's 30 Euro's. I tell him I'll pay him €100 bonus if he's up for it and unzip my pants. The dude goes nuts and throws me out of the cab. Luckily for me all the other cab drivers also were not thristy for some man to man action. Arriving at my cab buddy from a couple of week ago I get in and ask him how much to get me home. He tells me €30, I tell him I had a great night at the casino and show him the money. I tell him I want to make people happy today and I'll give him €200 if he waves at all his colleagues when we drive away, but it has to be really cheerfull.

They put all of their possessions in the back of a donkey driven wagon in hopes of selling some of them to make money. As they were traveling, up the road they saw a small group of Cossaks. They braced themselves expecting the worst. Inevitably, the Cossaks ride up to the wagon and begin harassing the old man his daughter. Eventually, the Cossacks knock the old man and his daughter off the cart and ride off with the Donkey and Wagon.

The old man sits on the side of the road and begins sobbing...

Daughter asks, ""Papa, papa, what's the matter?""

To which the old man responds,""Don't you see? They've taken everything we had!""

""Not everything..."", The daughter responds, to which she takes out a small rolled up cloth, which she unrolls to reveal some jewelry and gems.

The old man's eyes widen, ""How did you manage to hide that?""

She answered, ""When I saw them further up the road, I took them, rolled them up in this cloth and hid them in my crotch.""

To which the old man starts crying hysterically...

The auditor said, ""Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, Which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I'm not sure the IRS finds that believable.""

""I'm a great gambler, and I can prove it,"" says Grandpa. ""How about a demonstration?""

The auditor thinks for a moment and said, ""Okay. Go ahead.""

Grandpa says, ""I'll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.""

The auditor thinks a moment and says, ""It's a bet.""

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor's jaw drops.

Grandpa says, ""Now, I'll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.""

Now the auditor can tell Grandpa isn't blind, so he takes the bet. Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye.

The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa's attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

""Want to go double or nothing?"" Grandpa asks. ""I'll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.""

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he ends up urinating all over the auditor's desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa's own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

""Are you okay?"" the auditor asks.

""Not really,"" says the attorney. ""This morning, when Grandpa told me he'd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you'd be happy about it!""",The IRS Decides to audit Grandpa,73

""I'll tell my story first,"" says one man.
""So, I'd been pretty certain lately that my wife had been cheating on me. I only didn't have any proof. I thought the best way to find out would be to catch her in the act. I devised a whole plan: I left the condo for work in the morning as normal, then I got in the elevator. Once I'd gone down to the lobby, I took the elevator back up and busted into my condo. There my wife was, sitting on the couch reading a magazine. Silly me, I thought, thinking my wife was cheating on me. Except I saw a pair of hands hanging on off the ledge of the balcony of my condo. So this is the man! Oh, I was so livid, I ran over to the ledge and started stomping on his hands. He still wasn't letting go. So I ran into my condo and grabbed a hammer and started banging on his knuckles. Finally, he let go and fell three stories and landed in a bush. Bruised up, but still okay. I wanted to end this thing so I ran into the kitchen, dragged the refrigerator and pushed it over the ledge onto the man, killing him instantly. After all that excitement, I had a heart attack right then and there and died.""

St. Peter said ""wow. That is a pitiful death. Okay, you can come in. Next?""

The second man said,
""Well, I was doing my daily workout routine on my balcony. While doing jumping jacks, I'm not sure how, but I lost my balance and fell off the balcony. Next thing I know, I'm holding on for dear life to the balcony on the level beneath my condo. This is the end, I thought. Except, just then a man stepped over to me. I'M SAVED, I thought. That was until he started stomping on my hands. I was terrified. When he realized I wasn't letting go, he ran inside and came back with a hammer. He hammered on my knuckles until I finally let go, falling three stories and landing in a bush, bruised but okay. As I reached for my phone to call for help, suddenly I see a refrigerator fall from the condo and smashing into me, killing me instantly.""

A young pirate captain was on his majestic ship, sailing across the vast ocean. 

His crew was happy, and they went on sailing for years, pillaging other ships that they would come across, overthrowing other sea captains, and often allowing the crew of the other ships to join theirs.

The pirate captain was happy.

One day, during an epic battle between the pirate crew and one of the biggest ships in the Queen's Navy, the pirate captain was in a sword fight with three enemy sailors.

He fought like a warrior straight out of a tale, his dual swords slicing through the air and cutting his enemies down with ease.

Suddenly, a young boy came out of one of the barracks, carrying a pistol, and aimed it in the direction of the pirate captain.

Just as the pirate captain slashed at the last man standing before him, he saw the young boy, as well as the pistol aiming in his direction.

The boy fired.

The pirate looked down, and felt no pain. 

Suddenly, he heard the thud of a body landing on the ground behind him. He turned around, and saw the Navy captain laying dead on the ground, his sword still in his hand, his outstretched arm above his head, his body frozen in the attempt of his ill-fated attack on the pirate captain.

The pirate captain was safe.

The pirate captain turned back to the boy who had saved his life. He stared at the boy, with his bright blue eyes open wide, giving away the fact that he had never once fired a pistol before, eyes which were partially covered by a lock of hair black as night. 

The young pirate captain tipped his three-pointed hat to the boy as he leaned over with a slight bow.

""What's ye name, me boy"", the pirate captain asked.

""Sebastian, sir"", the boy whispered.

""Aye, well Sebastian, me boy, a t'ousand t'anks and a t'ousand pieces o' silver me owes ya.""

The pirate captain whistled to one of his crew, and ordered them to leave the young boy on the ship with a small chest filled with silver coins.

Then the pirate crew jumped back onto their majestic ship, and sailed off into the sunset.

Many years went by, and the pirate captain grew old, having lived quite the successful life of a pirate, which was quite rare, as they were constantly hunted by all of society for their ignoble actions.

One day, as the pirate crew was at harbor to resupply their ship, the pirate captain met a beautiful woman who not only failed to judge him, but was rather quite enthralled by his stories from the sea. 

As they were sharing a bottle of rum, the pirate captain was reminiscing about his dual sword wielding days, which were no more, after having lost a hand to a stray cannonball many years prior, when the beautiful woman asked if he ever intended to settle down and have a family.

""Aye, me love, t'was always on the back of me mind, but me life has been wrought with adventure and chaos, and the thrills of a nomad pirate captain such as me'self were never too kindly looked upon by the fairer sex...""

The beautiful woman ran her hand across the pirate captain's beard, caressed his face, and as she leaned over, she whispered ""I always wanted to sail the sea... but I fear it was never in my stars, for I get seasick simply by stepping onto a ship. But your tales tell me that you have lived a mighty full life, and I fear I will never cease to dream of you after tonight...""

Then, the beautiful woman gently kissed the pirate captain on his lips.

For what seemed like an eternity, they stayed locked face to face, as the beautiful woman held the pirate captain's good hand in hers, as he began to shake at the knees, melting at her touch.

As they pulled apart, the pirate captain said, ""Bless the gods, me dear, I've never in me whole life felt the warm touch of an angel like that... just say the word, and I'll follow you to the ends of the world and back.""

The night went on, and when it came time to part ways and sail off with his crew, the pirate captain realized that he couldn't bring himself to go, for he did not want to leave behind the beautiful woman who had taken his breath away, and given in return a warm desire and fullness he had never felt before.

The pirate captain was in love.

He took his hat off, and handed it to his first mate, saying his farewells, wishing his crew the best of luck and long lives, and waved them away until they had sailed out of sight.

Again, many years went by. The pirate married the beautiful woman, they had a small army of children who grew up and set sail on their own adventures, and life went on.

The pirate captain was happy, but grew restless. Time had become a bitter enemy, causing his body to deteriorate even more and his mind to grow cloudy. His feet hurt from walking the solid land, and he missed his majestic ship, and his faithful crew. 

His wife saw these things, and tried many times to lift his spirits, but it was fruitless. 

The pirate had turned to drown his fears in his bottles of rum, and often could be heard hollering at the gravestones in the town cemetery, battling the ghosts of his past.

The locals had ceased to fear the once powerful and vibrant pirate captain, as he was now just an old shell of his former self. 

He had grown fat, had lost most of his hair, and his long flowing beard had grown gray and disheveled. The hook on his hand had been replaced by a wooden knob with a cutout perfect for holding a bottle, and nothing more.

The pirate captain was sad.

Despite all her efforts, the pirate's wife could not save him from himself. She grew tired and weak from all the fighting, until one day, she had had enough, and decided to leave him.

The pirate captain did not chase after her.

And so life went on, and the long days turned into long months, and the long months turned into longer years. The pirate was lost in a world he did not love, left alone with no friend to share a bottle with, and no enemy to swing a sword at.

The pirate captain was alone.

He grew older, and weaker. His swords began to rust, and grew dull. His bottles lay strewn about his home, and his body regretted his heart's decision.

One day, the pirate decided he would not end this way. He would go out as a pirate should. He would do whatever necessary to right the wrongs, or wrong the rights, in his case.

He would go down to the harbor, and steal a ship, and set sail into the sunset one last time.

Except, he could barely get out of bed. When he finally managed to, barely escaping a broken back in doing so, he barely made it to his door.

With a mighty tug, he opened the door, and what he saw outside his door almost made him fall to the floor.

There was a parade! 

The entire town had filled both ends of the street, with children sitting upon their father's shoulders, and women waving handkerchiefs at the performers in the street.

At first, the pirate was weary, and did not want to be surrounded by all of this joy, for he simply wanted his story to come to an end already, and dammit, these town citizens were getting in his way!

He shuffled along down the road, step by step, often having to put a hand against a wall or a fence post to stop and catch his breath.

His heart was beating a thousand times too fast, and his head ached with all the music being played in the street beside him.

Things began to grow dark in his vision, and sounds grew muffled.

He stopped to sit at a bench, wiping the sweat from his brow with his shirt sleeve. He looked around for a forgotten bottle of rum. Alas, there was none to be found.

He saw a young boy running back and forth, peeking between the legs of the adults to catch a glimpse of the parade through the throngs of people watching the festivities.

The old pirate asked the young boy, ""hey there, me lad..."" The old pirate took a few deep breaths between his words, ""would ye mind tellin' an old man what all this fuss might be about?""

The young boy looked the old pirate up and down, curious why this old man was sitting on a bench not ten feet from the parade, sweating like a dog and panting like a horse.

""It's the Queen's Royal Navy, sir! They're back! It took them 50 years, but they've finally killed all the pirates! The seas are free again!""

The old man chuckled at the idea that the sea was ever not free, but then took a sharp breath in as the boy's words sunk in.

With the last of his strength, he pushed himself off of the bench, and walked to the street, pushing the bystanders aside with a roughness in him that had long been idle.

He looked at the paraders, who upon further inspection, were in battle dress. It was the Queen's Royal Navy, indeed!

Then, standing on top of a box wagon, the old pirate saw what must have been the man in charge. 

The man was middle aged, in peak physical condition, with striking black hair and blue eyes as big as the sea.

But it was what was in the man's hand, as he waved it back and forth at the crowds, that caught the old pirate's eye.

It was his old leather three-pointed hat. 

This man, he was the one who had killed off the last of the pirates, and in doing so, had obviously killed the old pirate's former crew, including his last first mate.

As the old pirate stood there, wondering how he should feel, knowing that the life he had led and had dreamed of returning to could be no more, the man with the blue eyes turned towards him, looked at him, waving the hat, and continued to turn.

Stopping in mid-wave, the man turned back, and looked at the old pirate dead in his eyes. 

The old pirate knew, right then, who this man was. He knew it like he knew the sound of sails flapping in the wind on a cool, cloudless night.

This man, he knew, was Sebastian, the very boy who had not only saved his life, but had felled one of his own crew in order to do so.

This man, who had brought an end to the life the old pirate once cherished, who had ended the lives of so many that had relied on the old pirate, was the one person that had ever saved the old pirate's life.

The sudden epiphany took a hefty toll on the old pirate's soul. He felt like he had been struck in the chest with a cannonball. 

He almost lost his footing, falling back, reaching his hand out to find the bench behind him, with his wooden hand held to his chest to calm his heart. 

It was beating too fast.

The man from the Navy, Sebastian, was running up to the old man, pushing his way through the crowd.

As he arrived at the bench, he looked the old man up and down. 

The man, the boy, Sebastian, placed the hat gently on the bench beside the old pirate.

""I know you, old man. I once saved your life, and you repaid me with a ship and a thousand silver pieces. I have led my life in the hopes that I would cross paths with you again...""

The old man looked at the young man, and saw nothing but the young boy from that day so long ago, before him. He had dreamt of crossing paths with the young boy again as well, but his heart was hurting, and not in the heartbroken way he had become so used to over the years, but rather a physical pain, this time. It stopped him from being able to express the words in his lungs.

The boy with the blue eyes continued.

""...I lived every day of my life, and spent every last bit of silver I had because of you, trying to find you. When I ran out of money to fund my own ship and crew, I joined the Queen's Royal Navy in the hopes that it would bring me to you...""

The old pirate wanted nothing more than to reach out to the boy, to pat him on the shoulder, to thank him for finding him and giving him a last good memory to cherish on what was surely to be his last day on this earth. Perhaps he could ask the boy to send him out to sea, as a pirate should always be buried at sea...

Sebastian continued.

""For, you see, I did not intend on saving the life of a murderer that day, I did not even intend on leaving that ship alive... 

I did not want my last memories to be the vision of you and your despicable crew cutting down my friends, my crew... 

...and had I seen my father behind you, with his sword raised and ready to strike you down, I never would have tried to fire that shot into your heart. 

And I would have not missed, and killed my own father instead.""

The old pirate's face grew white, his skin, cold.  

The story he had shared countless times to his old crew and the land lovers at the pub, his favorite story of all of them... had all been a lie. 

All because this boy was a terrible shot. 

He had intended on killing him, and killed his father instead. And while the old pirate knew that his younger self would have reveled in this fact, his older self felt more guilty than he could have ever imagined feeling.

His entire life had been a farce.

He was not the least bit angry at Sebastian, nor did he doubt that he would pay for his actions today, likely at the gallows.

The boy continued.

""And so, here we are, having killed every last pirate sailing the ocean, and the one I have been hunting my entire life has been here in my hometown. Wasting away! A drunk and a fool, with no ship, no treasure, and a rusty pair of swords.""

""His wife left him!"", shouted one of the town members.

Sebastian looked back at the townsman, and looked back at the old pirate with a smug look on his face.

""And the old man had a wife, you say? It figures she would have left him! Who would want to lay by an old and dying pirate like this at night!""

The townspeople laughed and pointed their fingers, with mothers covering their children's ears, yet standing there with beaming smiles on their faces. 

Sebastian picked up one of the old pirate's swords, wielding it slowly and deliberately, feeling it's weight.

""This must have been a wicked tool of death back in your day, old pirate. But now...""

He rested the tip of the sword on the ground, and gave a swift stomp to the middle of the sword, shattering it in half.

""...but now, it's a piece of useless scrap. Now, tell me, old pirate, and do be kind, it's the least you can do before dying on me after I've searched for you for so long, and after I've asked ALL your friends for your whereabouts... 

WHAT, in almighty God's name, HAPPENED TO YOU to make you such a feeble, weak, pathetic old geezer wasting away as the town drunk on a dirty bench so far from the ocean? 

Please, tell me what caused this, and I might let you die quickly.""

The old pirate looked the boy up and down, realizing the boy was a man. A man that any mother would be proud of, and a boy any father would thank the heavens for carrying his name.

The old pirate coughed into his wooden hand, and saw blood which he wiped off onto his pants, and stretched to lean over with his good hand to pick up the hat Sebastian had placed beside him.

It took nearly all the energy he had in him, and as he righted himself, the world was spinning. His arm shot pains throughout his body as he raised his hat and placed it on his head.

He placed his good hand on the bench armrest, and pushed as hard as he could, raising himself from the bench to stand before the boy. A boy who was as tall, no, taller, than he was. But the old pirate had a bad back, and he was hunched over after spending so many years in his bed.

He stretched his back, and stood tall one last time. 

He raised his good hand to grab the tip of his hat, and gently tipped it towards the boy, and as he bowed slightly, he could feel his heart pumping the last pulse of blood through his body... his fingers and toes growing cold, his vision growing cloudy, and his head feeling light, he uttered his last few words with every bit of strength that his soul would spare before finally leaving him.

With a smirk so slight, the Heavenly Father could have missed it, he answered the boy's question.

""Sebastian, my boy...

""...long...""

""...time...""

""...no...""

Only a sheep and a sheepdog were washed-up with him.
After looking around, he realized that they were stranded on a deserted island.

After being there awhile, he got into the habit of taking his two animal companions to the beach every evening to watch the sunset. 

One particular evening, the sky was a fiery red with beautiful cirrus clouds, the breeze was warm and gentle - a perfect night for romance. 

As they sat there, the sheep started looking better and better to the lonely man. Soon, he leaned over to the sheep and put his arm around it. 
The sheepdog, ever-protective of the sheep, growled fiercely until the man took his arm from around the sheep. 

After that, the three of them continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but there was no more cuddling. 

A few weeks passed-by and, lo and behold, there was another shipwreck. The only survivor was Hillary Clinton. 

That evening, the man brought Hillary to the evening beach ritual. It was another beautiful evening - red sky, cirrus clouds, a warm and gentle breeze - perfect for a night of romance. 

Pretty soon, the man started to get those feelings again. He fought the urges as long as he could but
He finally gave-in and leaned over to Hillary and told her he hadn't had sex for months. 

Hillary batted her eyelashes and asked if there was anything she could do for him. 

He said, 'Take the dog for a walk.'",A man washed up on a beach after a shipwreck,140

Our army was being beaten from what I could tell, and were in full retreat from the invading Easterners. 

The Easterners, savage men according to all the adults in my village, and the man in the television. Beings who were rather more beasts than men, beasts that ate babies and burned children alive. My father would tell me stories of these Easterners, stories that made me terrified for my life. 
Some days at school during play-time, me and my friends would gather under a tree and wonder what an Easterner even looked like. 

*""Probably like bears!""*

*""No! like giant ugly wolfmen, with big teeth! Grrr!""*

*""Maybe big angry bulls! With horns!""* 

We were children, and we knew nothing of the horrors of the war that had been raging across the world for the past 5 years. 

*Curiously enough to the west of our village was a large forest, that no child was to ever enter. Just like the stories of the Eastern soldiers, our parents told us that there were horrible things in the forest, things that would love to eat a child.*

For a while things suddenly died down that is until Winter came.

On 1 snowy morning a column of tired looking men with torn clothes and covered in bandages marched into our village. These were soldiers of our Army? Far different from the textbooks and pictures I had seen years ago, when the war first started, these almost half awake men looked like a stiff breeze would blow them over. 

....


Papa told me that we would have to flee to the West, the Easterners were near, Nearer than anyone in the village could've even anticipated. 

*""But the soldiers will protect us Father!""* I begged as He and my mother frantically began packing our belongings onto a wagon, but he seemed to ignore me.

My infant brother cooed in his crib at all the commotion to which he was ignorant too. As I looked out the window I saw all our neighbors were already either packing or making their way on the main road which ran North and out of the town. 

*""Everyone is leaving Mama!""* 

**""And we will have to go too dear""** My mother replied tiredly 

*""Where?""*

My mother sighed as while she folded one of my dresses

**""I don't know..""**


The tired looking soldiers that came this morning had opted to leave as well, and were traveling along the same road North as the people from our Village. My Father picked me and my brother up and loaded us onto a wagon which he pulled himself. I took a last look through the window of our house and saw how bare and empty it was, before we trodded off Northward.

...


I was excited to leave the village, and get to see what was outside of it, but the sights I saw were less than exciting.

I saw trees and houses blackened by fire and shattered by bombs. There were dead dogs and horses covered in flies that lay at the side of the road, and my heart felt, sick. The earth was covered in frost and bare, parts of it were upturned and shallow graves filled them. 

I looked to the East of the road and saw the forest again, it's tall dark trees seemed to be untouched by the carnage that I saw. Father had drawn our wagon for hours, and I saw as the sun set in the horizon and nightfall came. We opted to make camp for the night with several other columns of people  from our village and soldiers, and wait until morning.

The night was silent and dark, there was no campfire, and there was no sound of crickets or birds. It seemed like we were the only living things left in the world.  

...


When I did fall I asleep, I was woken shortly afterwards by the sound of a man's scream 


I soon heard loud booms, and the popping of rifles. 

More screams and more booms.

*My father cried out to our mother before something cut him down.*

Shadowy men on horses yelped and screeched as they rode into our camp. 

Easterners

They yelled out in their horrible tongues as they cut down men and women alike

The world devolved into chaos as torches began to be thrown onto the wagons and tents, and fire consumed them.

*I looked around for my mother in the dim light, but she was nowhere to be seen*

In a panic, I grabbed my baby brother and fled to the shelter of the trees in the woods to our East.

The sound of hooves, guns, and screams was deafening, and my infant brother wailed in confusion from the carnage.

....


My lungs and feet burned, and my knees bled from scraping up against the foliage and bushes. I fled until the noise of the battle died down, and I was alone in the dark and dead silent forest.

*Silent, save for the distant sound of a what appeared to be crow's cry*


My brother by this time had somehow fallen silent and asleep, and I looked up to see that the moon was all but blocked off from the trees which looked taller now that I was actually in the Forest.

My fatigue hit me like a running horse all at once, and I found that I was incredibly drowsy. I carried my brother and myself over to a nearby tree where we fell asleep under its canopy. 


...

When morning came, I still felt tired, and barely any sunlight was able to make its way through the dense canopies of the trees. 

There were no sounds of chirping birds in the trees, and the wind seemed to be dead. The forest was dark and silent just like it was at night.

They seem to be getting on fantastically, and she's so beautiful everyone in the place is jealous.

Suddenly she stands up, throws her drink over the guy, slaps him HARD across the face and storms out.

The bartender comes over, says ""Dude, you were in there for sure, what the hell happened?""

""Well"", says the guy, ""I was telling her that I'm a scientist in a cryogenics lab, I earn tons of money, I freeze small mammals then thaw them out and examine them to see if they are OK"".

""I don't get it"", yells the bartender over the music. ""Why was she so pissed off?""

The guy replies ""Well she couldn't really hear what I was saying and asked me my job again, and to make it easier for her to understand, I said 'I'm a chilled mole tester'"".

He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he’d try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn’t much like the idea of her screwing someone else.  


So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around.  He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him.  He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter.  He explained his situation, the old man. “Well, I don’t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except …” said the old man, and then he stopped. “Except what?” asked the businessman. “Nothing, nothing,” said the old man. “C’mon, tell me! I need something!” protested the businessman. “Well, sir, I don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘voodoo dick,’” the old man said. “So what’s up with this voodoo dick?” the businessman asked.  The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols.  He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo.  The businessman laughed, and said, “Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!” The old man said, “But you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.” He pointed to a door and said “Voodoo dick, the door.” The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole.  The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle.  Before the door could split, the old man said, “Voodoo dick, get back in your box!” The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more. The businessman said, “I’ll take it!” The old man resisted and said it wasn’t for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. 

 The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, “Voodoo dick, my pussy.” He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.  


After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny.  She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said “Voodoo dick, my pussy!”  The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping.  It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting.  She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked.  Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off.  So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help.  She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo.  


 On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman.  He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink.  Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn’t been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn’t stop screwing. The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, “Yeah, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!”",There was a businessman,34

Each of them gave birth to 1 child. In the end, it turned out that 4 of those 5 children were ichukes(another gender). It is the tradition of Jopi, that only kukes can give birth to children, and that ichukes are completely useless. With their future generations in steady decline, the 5 strange kukes decided to name the one and only baby kuke as LUCKY, in hopes of keeping their species alive. When LUCKY grows up, it realizes the unfairness that ichukes have. One day, LUCKY sets off on a journey to help relieve the ichukes. The next day, one ichuke disappears, and LUCKY brings back a kuke. The 5 strange kukes are astonished, as their kind can only have one child. The next day, another ichuke disappears, and LUCKY brings back another kuke. By now, the 5 strange kukes are extremely grateful, but also curious about how LUCKY created kukes. The next day, another ichuke disappears, and LUCKY brings back another kuke. The 5 strange kukes realize that it has something to do with the disappearance of the ichukes and ask LUCKY how to create kukes. LUCKY responds by telling them the solution will reveal itself. Years pass, and the community is healthy and functioning. LUCKY still hasn't revealed the secret, but recently gets infected with a disease called BuBos. The 5 strange kukes are extremely old now, but are still curious about how LUCKY created so many kukes, so for the final time, they as LUCKY how it happened. LUCKY tells them that the solution will be revealed by itself if they let LUCKY go change more ichukes to kukes one more time. Because the 5 strange kukes really want to know, the let LUCKY go. LUCKY comes back, and the 5 strange kukes are eager to hear the answer. Then LUCKY dies of cancer",This is a decently long story.,0

""Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. I would like to inform you that one of our engines has stopped working. We can still safely fly on the 3 remaining engines, but our journey will be 1 hour longer as a result. Thank you""

A few passengers look at each other, but no one is overly concerned, trusting the captain.

Sometime later though, there is another rumble and another whine, followed by the pilots voice over the PA system.

""Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. I would like to inform you that we have lost another one our engines, but don't worry, we can still safely fly on the 2 remaining engines. However our journey will be 2 hours longer. Thank you""

A few passengers look worried, a few look annoyed but everyone settles down.

20 minutes later there is another familiar rumble, followed by a tell tale whine. The captains voice is once again on the PA system.

""Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. I'm afraid we have lost a third engine, but please do not panic, this plane is perfectly capable of flying on the one remaining engine. This does mean though, that our journey will be 4 hours longer than anticipated. Thank you""

The boy's father studies him for a moment before saying ""Go ask your mother, sister, and brother if they would have sex with a Ryan Reynolds for 1 million dollars. Then come back and tell me what they said.""

So the son goes off. He asks his mother, who replies ""If you're father would be OK with it I would."" His sister, who responded enthusiastically that she'd do it for free. And his brother who hesitantly says he would so long as nobody found out.

The boy runs back to his father and says ""Dad! They all said yes. What does that mean?""
