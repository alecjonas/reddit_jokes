The lawyer persists and explains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5, and visa-versa."" Again, he politely declines and tries to get some sleep.

This catches the engineer's attention and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless he plays, agrees to the game. 

The lawyer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"" The engineer doesn't say a word, reaches in to his pocket, pulls out a $5 bill and hands it to the lawyer. Now, it's the engineer's turn. He asks the lawyer: ""What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?"" The lawyer looks at him with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references. He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his coworkers and friends. All to no avail. 

After over an hour, he wakes the engineer and hands him $50. The engineer politely takes the $50 and turns away to get back to sleep.

A small group of tribe members cut him down and take him to the tribe leader that only speaks the sentence ""Ooly Booly, or chop your head"", without a single doubt the young man yells ""please Ooly Booly"" and gets mounted from behind by one of the tribe members.

With slight pain and a lot of regret he is released in the forest. Completely dissorrientated he runs away in a random direction  and again, SNAP he is hanging upside down.

Dragged in front of the chief he hears again ""Ooly Booly, or chop your head"". But this time there is 3 natives standing next to the chieften licking their tongues. Knowing what is about to happen but no other acceptable option he says ""Ooly Booly"" and turn for turn the 3 tribe members have a go at him. 

Hardly able to walk and completely humiliated he pushes himself through to forest trying to avoid any traps. Seeing the sea come closer, he feels that this time he will make it, but.. SNAP, again upside down. 

This time hearing the words ""Ooly Booly or chop your head"" and seeing a group of 10 natives licking their tongues, he knows he is done for. So he gathers enough courage to mumble the words ""chop my head"" to which the chief replays ""sure.. but first Ooly Booly!""",Ooly Booly,2

The wife ends up giving birth to twins, both boys. Eventually as the babies grow the couple notice that the two never face the same way. Wherever one of them looks the other is always facing the opposite direction, no matter what they do. The couple decide to name them Toward and Away.

The kids grow and have a happy childhood despite this strange behavior and when they turn 10 years old their father decides he wants to teach them to learn how to be fishermen like him. He teaches them all the tools of the trade, the right knots to tie, the proper way to care for the equipment, how to steer the boat and catch the wind in the sails, and all the other ins and outs of the trade.

One day the three head out on a fishing trip together. The mother kisses them goodbye, wishes them well, and watches as they sail off. Three week.s go by before the father, and only the father, returns, looking haggard and gaunt.

""What on Earth happened?!"" exclaims the wife upon his return. ""You were gone for so long that I had almost given up hope. Where are our sons?""

""My dear,"" says the man, ""I'm afraid they are dead. I only barely survived myself.""

""What happened to you?"" asks the wife.

""Well, the day we set sail we found a great school of fish and were catching many large fish to bring home. Suddenly an enormous fish, bigger than the boat, lept out of the water and capsized us with the wave that came from it. We were flung into the water where we clung to driftwood to stay afloat. As we tried to get back together the fish breached again, swallowing Toward in its great jaws.""

""Oh, my, that's terrible!""

""It is, but you should have seen the one that got Away!""",A woman gives birth to twins,9

Awkwardly, he replies, ""Actually yes, I did.""

""If you'd like some more, show up tomorrow at 1 pm and bring 100$.  You can like it a little more then."", she whispers to him.

He kindly agrees and the next day he shows up at 1 pm with 100$.  He hands her the money and they proceed to have at each other, in every conceivable way, for several hours.  After the deed is done, he leaves the house.

Slightly confused, the son heads over to the brothel with the duck and meets with one of the women there. The son explained the situation to the lady and told her that even though he has no money, he does have this duck. The woman thinks for a while, and decides to take the duck as payment since she knew a guy that could help her prepare the duck so that she could cook it for dinner.

So after they have sex, the woman is flabbergasted at just how magnificent the son was in bed. She even offered him a freebie but being the polite guy that he is, he refused. So the woman, desperate for another round, offered the duck back as payment, the son agrees and so they have sex again. 
Later, the son leaves the brothel with the duck. On their way back home a truck appears, seemingly out of nowhere, and hits the duck, killing it. Feeling bad, the driver offers to pay the son for the duck. Not knowing how much it was worth the son settles for $20. The driver happily obliges, pays him the $20, and they both go on their ways.

Finally the son gets home when his dad asks him ""So son, how was it?"" The son replies ""I dunno dad, you tell me."" ""Ok, so tell me what happened"" replied the dad. The son replied ""Well dad, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and 20 bucks for a fucked up duck.""",A memorable first time,13

post,5tafa6,2qh72,jokes,false,1486765873,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5tafa6/friends_dont_shave_your_asshair/,self.jokes,,"I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.

No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans (look it up) were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.

I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ""Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!"" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ""How many Indians could there be?"" said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!"" by JFK. ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!"" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occassionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know.

I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.

Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic shit-molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.

Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""

Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.

As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.

post,5tab1w,2qh72,jokes,false,1486764657,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5tab1w/a_catholic_priest_finds_a_job/,self.jokes,,"Dave the Catholic Priest needed a part time job. His salary was still quite low and he needed to save up while on vacation. So he got in contact with Francis, the Bishop, to get help in spreading word around local businesses that Dave was a good, honest chap ready to undertake work.

  In no time at all Dave got a break- fast food. 

  He showed up at 7 am for the first day. Jim, an old friend of Francis the Bishop, was sympathetic to Dave's cause and was happy in giving him a dozen hours a week. He was also aware of Dave's one flaw that Francis warned him about: Dave tended to daydream and become forgetful, aloof or even careless during monotonous tasks. This had led to him losing the Church keys on a few occasions. Leading Choir practice in the driving rain was not a pleasant experience.

 So Jim was on the lookout and intended to keep a keen eye on Dave's performance. 

  ""Dave mate. I haven't trained you in food safety yet. So for this week you're responsible for keeping the joint clean before, during, and after the chippy is open for service. Right. Any questions? Good man,""

  So Dave was handed reign of all cleaning supplies and tasks. Days 1 and 2 went okay. Dave just about managed to prep the front of shop for the opening, though struggled keeping count of all the bits and bobs in inventory. Day 3 was a struggle. Dave, used to working in leisurely pace found wiping down tables and clearing trash in time quite taxing. More than once he left spray bottles around benches and behind doors. Customers were befuddled and Jim left frustrated at this incompetence.

  Jim stopped Dave on the morning of day 4. Trash was found under tables, counters left too greasy after ineffective wiping, and the supplies were whittled away almost to nothing but a sponge after Dave's mismanagement.

  ""Jim, look I'm really sorry. But I'm getting the hang of this now! Please give me another role if you really don't me cleaning.""

  So Jim complied. The next day Dave turned up at 6.30 am as per instruction.

  ""Okay Dave. Fresh start. This job is a bit new and I'm sure you'll learn from it too. You need to collect the frozen supplies at the store. They've been paid for so don't worry. Just collect everything and race back in good time. If you know what I mean.""

  Dave thought he knew exactly what Jim meant. 

  ""So long as I drive quickly, I can take the rest of the day off!""

  Two hours later on what should have been a 15 minute trip, Dave entered the premises with a dejected expression.

  Ten minutes later Jim also wore the same expression, albeit with a scowl and high blood pressure to match; Dave had struck a streetlamp, mounted the sidewalk and blown out a tire in the process because he thought Jim wanted him to *race* back. With the company car out of service Jim was strained to keep things operational. Dave was becoming a liability.

  To the sheepish priest he said, ""Dave. Final chance. I hired you as a favor, not a burden. From tomorrow work in the back with Phil on food. He'll give you something to do.""

  Dave nodded vigorously, ""Thank you so much Jim! I swear to it- I won't be forgetful or careless. You can count on me!""

  ""Yeah. Good. Just don't burn this place down.""

  6.30 am, the next day. Dozens of customers filed in and out every few hours, bellies filled, vinegary lips smacked. Jim didn't see much of Dave. Naturally he was quite nervous. No complaints over the phone for mixed up orders, or hair in the mayo, or dismembered digits in the salad. Maybe he should have put Dave there in the first place. The next day came and went. Another suspiciously uneventful day. Almost too quiet. ""Don't fret too much"", Jim thought to himself later on that Thursday evening. ""Phil was happy with Dave's work and didn't mention any hiccups.""

  A week passed in this way. Jim was in a good mood to say the least. Sales and profit had nearly increased by 500%; customers were actually leaving feedback on their experience for the first time in months; The company car was back from repairs, costs much lower than anticipated; the takeaway was still not destroyed in a fire, and Phil reported no missing items or mishap in the kitchen. Even Dave was in a good mood, starting and leaving his shifts with a smile on his face and lively spring in his step, giving him an almost surreptitious look.  

  It was nearing the end of Dave's vacation. Jim had just handed the last overtime paycheck to his star employee when he thought to ask something on his mind for a while now, ""Dave, top job. You've done wonders to help this takeaway get back on its feet again. Everyone loves the food. Heck, even people from the next town over are calling in to order! So between us two men- how on earth do you cook so well? The battered fish is the talk of the town, so are the chicken wings- oh and the chips! They're so good they make you want to slap your mama! How have you done it!?""

  ""It's nothing, really Jim!""

  ""No, no! Please tell! You're one of us. Even if you're leaving, you can pop around to help any time you want at double your current wages. But please. How have you done it?""

  ""It's simple, Jim,"" Dave said as he moved to lean forward, closing the gap between his boss. Involuntarily, an excited croak left Jim's throat.

  ""Oh?"" sweat beaded on his forehead.

   ""Simple, Jim. I'm just a good friar.""",A Catholic Priest finds a job.,9

The doctor gives him a thorough examination and eventually makes the diagnosis. 

""Well, there's good news and there's bad news,"" she says.

""The bad news is that the muscles around your penis are deteriorating, and there is no cure.""

The guy, on the verge of panic, finally regains his composure. ""So what's the good news?"" he asks.

The doctor says, ""There is an experimental treatment available, but there are no guarantees. It involves transplanting the muscles from a  baby elephant's trunk into your penis. Would you like to try it?""

The guy thinks about it and finally says, ""Well, the thought of going through life without being able to have sex is just too much for me. What have I got to lose? Let's do it."" So the doctor performs the operation.

A few weeks later, the guy takes his girlfriend out to a nice restaurant to celebrate his new equipment. While sitting at the table, he feels a stirring between his legs; it gets progressively worse until it reaches a point of being painful.

Seeking relief, he reaches down and unzips his fly to relieve some of the pressure.  

Suddenly, his penis leaps free from his pants, slides over the tabletop and grabs a dinner roll, then returns to his pants again.

""Wow!"" says his girlfriend stunned, ""That was impressive! Can you do it again?""

Eyes watering and face flushed, he says, ""Probably... but I don't know if I can fit another dinner roll up my ass!""",There was a guy who was having chronic trouble getting an erection.,425

They had a great place on the vine, friends and enough Grape money in their savings. The only thing they wanted was a little grape to call their own. They tried and tried for weeks, making intimate grape love everynight with no success. One night they decided to take a break and go visit the circus that just pulled into the vineyard.  
  
The circus was amazing and they enjoyed a peaceful night not worrying about babies, as they were leaving they noticed a small tent off to the side and they entered it. An old wrinkly prune sat in front of a table and spoke to them ""I know what you seek, a child to call your own, I can help you but it comes at a price."" ""Anything"" Mrs Grape replied ""we have money, antiques, anything!"" ""No, no, no, drink this potion, in 6 nights you will give birth. He will not be handsome, he will not be timid, if you can not love him, you will return to us and he will live here in the circus, yes?"" The prune asked as she handed a small bottle to Mrs Grape. Knowing she would love him no matter what he was like, Mrs Grape drank the potion.  
 
True to the prunes word Mrs Grape fell pregnant, six nights later she gave birth, he was small, very dry, brown and shrivelled. Mr &amp; Mrs Grape tried to care for the little boy, they nurtured him, stayed awake with him, gave him everything they had but he never stopped crying and once he could move he never stopped trying to destroy their house. After several weeks they were exhausted. The little one never grew, he stayed dry, small and wrinkly, the stress was becoming too much.  
  
One day Mr Grape returned from work with a small cage, he convinced Mrs Grape they needed a nights sleep and to decide in the morning if they would return the child to the circus. They locked him in the cage and moved him to the furthest part of the vineyard. For the first time in weeks they held each other and slept. In the morning with a fresh outlook they knew something was not right with their child, they walked hand in hand to the cage, ready to take him to the Prune.  
  
Mr Grape spoke sadly ""I'm sorry buddy, we've tried, we are exhausted and I don't even think you understand us? We've given it our all but we are taking you to live with the circus. You're just not the child we planned on *raisin*.","Mr and Mrs Grape had it all, almost...",12

He calls his cousin who is more than happy to have him over since they haven't seen each other in years.
When the executive gets there he notices that not much has changed since the last time he was there, a long time ago. He is filled with nostalgia and starts feeling better already.
They have coffee and chat for a little bit and the executive says he wants to do some farm manual labor to take his head off work and forget about the city life for a while.
The farmer says there is plenty of work to do around the farm and the executive can help him. So the farmer tells him to wake up early the next day and meet him at the stable.
When the executive gets to the stable the next day the farmer shows him piles of bags and say:
- This is all the horse manure we collected for the past 3 months. Your job will will be to spread it over that empty field to fertilize the soil for the next season.
Two hours later the executive is done and goes to ask his cousin what else he can do.
The farmer is surprised. ""This usually takes us a whole day! I only planned work for you for tomorrow"".
So the farmer inspects the field and is astonished the executive did such a good job in so little time. So he tells him to take the rest of the day off and meet him at he chicken coop the next morning.
The next morning the farmer says: ""We got a big chicken order from one of our clients and we have to deliver it ready for processing. Your job will be to cut the chickens head off so we can send them out. Again, two hours later the executive is done and goes to ask his cousin what else he can do. The farmer is surprised now even more. He didn't think his city cousin could manage farm jobs so well.
""This usually takes us two days, this is impressive! Meet me at the orange plantation tomorrow morning.""
The next morning the farmer says: ""The orange harvesting wasn't very good this year. We only got this 10 boxes of oranges. Your job will be to separate them in 3 piles, big oranges, medium oranges and small oranges. If anyone is bad just discard it.""
To the farmers surprise, it's the end of the day and his executive cousin is still not back for dinner, so he goes to check on him. When he gets there is sees his cousin working out still on the first box, comparing sizes on two oranges, then picking a third one and changing it's original pile... The farmer is puzzled, screeching his head. ""what's the matter? I thought you would finish this in no time""
The executive looks at him and says: ""I'm an executive. We are really good at spreading shit and cutting heads. But we really struggle when it comes to making decisions""",The executive is overworked and decide to take some time off and visit his farmer cousins...,8

He gets up to the bar, and orders himself a drink, and casually listens into the conversations.

""Yes yes, but number 42.""  

""Number 42?  Two fifty eight.""  

""Are you kidding me?  Thirty three my friend.  Thirty three.""

The man looks at the bartender and asks, ""Hey what's with the numbers?""

""Oh they're just talking politics.  Same group, day in and day out.""

""But what's with the numbers?""

""Well, they got tired of re-hashing the same old arguments over and over.  So they just gave them a number.""

A man in back shouts, ""Fifty two, as always.""

Bartender says, ""See, fifty two means he's accusing the other guy of making an appeal to stone, which is a logical fallacy in which a statement is automatically dismissed as ridiculous without taking the evidence into consideration.""

""Wow, that's amazing.""

""Not really.  I've been listening to them for years.  Most of them don't even know what they're talking about.  I think you could just throw out random numbers and none of them would know it.""

Just then an elderly gentleman sits next to him.  The guy decides to give it a try, so he looks over and asks, ""So my friend.  Twenty eight.""

He replies, ""Twenty eight?  Bah!  A hundred and thirteen.""

""Fifty-two.""

""Fifty-two?"" The man raises his voice a little.  ""Seventy three!""

Not knowing what to say next, the man just spouts off random numbers.  ""Eight nine""

""Eight""

""Ninety six.""

""A hundred and four!""

The exchange continues back and forth.  Thirty-two.  Fifty Six.  Seventy nine.  One thirty three.  

The old man stops and with a huge grin, he says ""Ah ... very clever.  Very clever.  One thirty three.  But Sixteen.  You never considered sixteen. Checkmate.""

The guy, still clueless about what they just argued about, looks to the bartender, holds up his finger to motion for another drink and says, ""One.""

At that moment, the bar goes silent.  They all look to the man.  The elderly gentleman is furious.  Enraged.  He stands up, and with as strong a punch any octogenarian can muster, he hits the guy as hard as he can, and storms out.  

Stunned, the guy recomposes himself.  The bar goes back to their conversations, and he asks the bartender, ""What the hell just happened?""

""That was Saul Greenberg, and you just said he's no better than Hitler.""",A man walks into a bar (semi-original),51

post,5t5d9i,2qh72,jokes,false,1486702400,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5t5d9i/the_duel_extremely_long/,self.jokes,,"During the Yongle Emperor's reign in the Ming Dynasty, there was an imperial proclamation posted on the Quintuple Pailou of Front-Gate Street in Beijing. This proclamation gripped the attention of the entire city. The people of the three front gates gathered up like a storm. Monks, Taoists, Muslims, Confuscianists, Scholars of a hundred schools, farmers, artisans, merchants, and all the other professions in the world, along with officials, eunuchs, bowmen, arrowfolk, cart-pushers, pole carriers, coal sellers, charcoal sellers, needle and thread sellers, pie and noodle sellers, pot-fixers and garlic sellers, pancake and doughnut sellers, tea and egg sellers.... all these people! They don't know what happened with the country, and why there was a proclamation, so they gathered up to get a look.

At this time, from the north there came a dude, whose last name is Sun and first name is Delong and a butcher in the East Quaduple Pailou Butcher's Street, and knows how to catch and butcher pigs. He originally came from Dengzhou, Shandong, and is around 40 years old. He likes to drink. Today he just came from the butchery, and held his pig hook in his armpit, which is a white waxed pole as thick as a walnut, a meter and half in length, and two bronze hooks at the tip. If the pig runs away, he can hook it back with one pull. He held his purse in one hand and his ledger in his other armpit. He had a rope for a belt and pewter liquor bottle hanging on it. The bottle was polished so much it lit up like a lamp from the reflection of the sun. He wore a cotton cloth robe, but it's checkered pattern? Why? Because he wipes his knife on it after he cuts everything, meat, intestines, whatever. As the days gone by it went the same way as the razor sharpener in the salon.

So he just had the drink of his life from the liquor bar after work, and his legs were quaking as his words slurred, ""This wine may be sorghum water, but it conquers the legs first on a man, can't see anything in front of me, like I've been possessed by a ghost!"" He saw that there's a circle of people surrounding the proclamation? ""I gotta see what this is about"", so he forced his way in. He saw the proclamation, but he's illiterate, so he asks around. He taps another dude on the shoulder, 

""Yo! What's this shit?""

Other guy says, ""Slow down, man, careful you don't get a side stitch. This is an imperial proclamation!""

""The hell is an imperial proclamation?""

""Something the Emperor posted!""

""Can you read it for me?""

""Sure thing! Listen here, 'Blessed by the Mandate of Heaven the Emperor, his rescript reads as thus: In the seventh year of Chenghua, the Ryukyu Kingdom sends their tribute. In reality, however, they sent an old Taoist to test his power against us... ""

""All right stop! Don't read anymore. I don't understand any of this!?""

""Oh, so I did this for nothing?""

""So let me ask, what's the first two phrases?""

""Blessed by the Mandate of Heaven the Emperor, His rescript reads as thus?""

""The hell is 'His rescript reads as thus?'""

""If the Emperor speaks, it's 'his rescript reads as thus'""

""So what would be for me speaking?""

""Uh... I don't know what would be reading as thus.""

""Fine, continue""

This man however's already tired of it since he has to read and then explain. He figured he might as well just tell Sun what it means, ""So basically the Ryukyu's are a vassal state that sends tribute and their declaration as our servant every year, but this year they sent an old Taoist, who knows how to do 36 styles of silent debate, and can recite 70 volumes of the 'Diamond Sutra', he's coming to to test his power against us Chinese. If we beat him, then they'll continue their tribute and declaration every year. If we can't, or nobody takes up the challenge, then they the Ryukyus are now the lords, and we Great Ming are now the vassal states. The Emperor thus sends out a proclamation seeking able people, who knows how to silently debate and recite the Diamond Sutra, to take up the challenge. If they can beat that old Taoist, the Emperor will give them any amounts of money or as high of a court position as possible! But it's useless for you, you don't know how to silent debate or recite the Diamond Sutra.""

He just had to go there, because this Sun Delong has a name for being a ""jack of all trades"". If you say he's not capable of something, he's going to get mad, ""Stop! How do you know I don't know how to silent debate, or how to read the Diamond Sutra?""

""Oh? So you can?""

""If I don't, what do I have this head for?""

""Ah! Then that's great! Take the proclamation and go challenge the old Taoist!""

Sun was walking up to take the proclamation when the other guy thought that he should make absolutely sure, so he asked. ""The imperial proclamation says the old Taoist knows 36 styles of silent debate, do you?""

""How many styles?""

""36.""

""I know 72.""

""Wow! Twice the styles... The old Taoist can recite 70 volumes of the Diamond Sutra.""

""And the Diamond Sutra I can recite is endless!""

""Then take the proclamation.""

""I can't reach.""

""So what's that in your hand then?""

""My pig hook.""

""So use it to hook the proclamation then.""

""Right.""

He hooked the proclamation off the post. The soldiers who were guarding the proclamation saw that a drunk had taken the proclamation, so they took out their rope and tied him up, pushing him to see the official in charge.

The official in charge is the Imperial Secretary Xie. However, Sun refused to kneel and instead turned his face in disgust, ""So what's your last name?""

Minister Xie was baffled, ""So he's prosecuting me instead the other way around? or what?"" He thought. ""It's 'Xie'.""

""Minister Xie, do you have common sense?""

""What does that mean?""

""Am I supposed to take the old Taoist's challenge tied up?""

""Oh? So you're the sorcerer?""

Minister Xie immediately reprimands the two soldiers. ""You reprehensible idiots! How can you bring the sorcerer to me tied up!"" He personally unties Sun. There's only one seat in the office. ""Sorcerer, please sit."" Of course, it's supposed to be Minister Xie's seat, but Sun doesn't know that, so he sits right away. Not only does he sit, but he also annoyingly says, ""Oh, where would you sit then?""

Minister Xie has to reply, ""Then I'll stand.""

""So, Minister, where do we find this damned Taoist?""

""He's living in the Golden Terrace Institute in the Legation Quarter. That being said we must first go meet his majesty.""

""What's a majesty?""

""The Emperor""

""Oh great, long time no see for us bros."" Apparently, Sun's bros with the Emperor.

""So sorcerer, do you want to ride a horse or a litter to the palace?""

""Neither.""

""Neither? Then what sorcery will you use?""

""I want to ride an ass.""

""Ride an ass? Where do we find one for you?""

""No ass, no go.""

Minister Xie was flabbergasted, but he personally went to the Zhangyi Gate to rent a donkey foal so Sun could ride it to the Palace. He had Sun wait in the East Court in the Palace.

Minister Xie reports to the Emperor, and the Emperor was pleased. He orders an immediate audience. However, Minister Xie ponders a bit and decides that he can't let Sun see the Emperor, because Sun hasn't practiced the proper protocols in the Ministry of Rites, and he doesn't know what might come out of Sun's mouth. If Sun goes up to the Emperor and says something like ""Yo bro, long time no see"", then Minister Xie would certainly lose his head. Thus, Minister Xie immediately says, ""Your majesty, the sorcerer isn't a native of Beijing, and just came recently. He also hasn't practiced the propr protocols in the Ministry of Rites, so I fear he may offend your majesty with his improper behavior. If it were up to me, I would send him to take the challenge first, and have an audience after. If he defeats the old Taoist, then it's easier to forgive his transgressions in behavior.""

Thus, the Emperor agrees and sends for the old Taoist in the Golden Terrace Institute, telling him that China has in fact found someone to accept his challenge. The old Taoist orders two 10-meter platforms be built in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, and a table, incense burners, offerings, candelabrum, scroll paper, cinnabar brush, vegetables, grains, and a bowl or rainwater.

""Whatever your sorcerer wants, tell him to prepare himself."" The old Taoist says, but Minister Xie ponders and just orders the same things for Sun. The orders were fulfilled quickly. The old Taoist shook his robe, and a dark whirlwind blew, lifting him onto his platform. The officials in court were shocked.

The emperor sends his edict, ""Minister Xie, ask our sorcerer to take the challenge, and also ride the wind or cloud up to the platform."" Minister Xie immediately goes to the East Court to find the ""sorcerer"". He goes in and sees Xun sleeping on the floor. Minister Xie goes up and yells, ""Sorcerer! Wake up!""

""Quit disturbing me!""

""Who's disturbing you! Pull him up.""

Sun rubs his eyes, and looks around. This is inside the palace, and it's golden all over.

""Ay! Old Minister! Where the hell is this?""

""In the palace.""

""What am I doing here in the palace?""

""What? Did you forget? You're here to take the old Taoist's challenge. He's on the platform waiting for you. The Emperor also moved his throne outside to see you two duel.""

Sun was terrified, ""What?!"" He was, of course, completely drunk, and after sleeping for so long he had forgotten pretty much everything. After Minister Xie explains, he starts thinking: I've drank too much, and in my drunken stupor I took the imperial proclamation, I'm just a goddamn merchant, how the hell do I know how to duel with old Taoists? Besides, it appears that this guy is from another country, so he must have evil intentions. Now I've really done it! He immediately slaps himself in the face four times, ""I'm an idiot! an idiot!""

He kneels down to Minister Xie, ""Old minister, I've had too much to drink! It was the alcohol! I'm a butcher, please find someone else to duel! I can't do this at all! If this isn't enough for you, please slap me some more, and let me go with the wind like a kite!""

""Ah!?""

Minister Xie's rage boiled over and he shook, his hat quaking. He's both angry and scared, ""Oh? You had too much to drink? You're right, this is way too much! Can you still feel your head on your neck? Just slap you and let you go? You can say this to me, fine, if I tell the same to the Emperor, then I've deceived him and failed the country. Deceiving him might be no big deal, but the country will be in trouble. This old Taoist is already there, what is His Majesty going to say to him? How will the country handle the shame? Neither of us will keep our heads for this. You're the drunk idiot that pulled the proclamation and tricked the official in charge, I'm the one that failed in office and allowed idiots into the palace, and deceived the Emperor and failed the country. Even if we get our deserved death, what is the Emperor to do? He will lose face, and our China will lose face. The Ryukyu will be lord and Ming will be vassal, and the Empire will be destroyed and our people enslaved!""

Sun Delong hears this and also starts to panic, which brought the alcohol back into his bloodstream, so he jumps up.

""Old Minister, it's fine! If neither of us will live, then it's easy to deal with. If we're to die regardless of whether I duel the old Taoist or not, then let's just duel so at least we'll die with our wounds in front. Even if we lose our head, it's just going to be a scab the size of a bowl. Maybe I'm not as good at sorcery as he is, but it's not certain he can fight as well as me! Let's go find him.""

Minister Xie hears this and wonders, ""Does he know how to duel or not?"" 

""Just go!"" Minister Xie, out of options, leads him to the platforms and points to the one in the east, ""See? He's already meditating up there.""

Sun Delong takes a look and says, ""Then I'm going on the other one. If we go on the same one, we'd fight for that territory.""

""Just go!""

""How tall is it?""

""Ten meters!""

""Ten meters? Even if it's 30, that's no big deal, attendants!.""

""What for?""

""Get me a ladder.""

""Ladders are a no-go, the Emperor has already ordered that you ride the wind or clouds, because the old Taoist took the wind up.""

The old Taoist, in fact, did not ride the wind. It's a trick. Inside his sleeve is an iron cylinder with wolf manure, charcoal, and Mayflower gloryberry inside, lit up. When he needs it, he shakes his robes and the cylinder's cover falls off, black smoke then pours out of it from his sleeves and neckline. Wolf manure provides the constant burn, but it's the mayflower that provides the black smoke that looks like a dark whirlwind surrounding him. Thus, with that cover he simply climbs up using hooks worn on his arm and legs.

Sun Delong hears about wind and cloud, so he asks, ""What kind of wind?""

""Obviously, the Guiding Wind.""

""All I know is passing wind.""

""That won't do.""

""Fuck it then, I'm not going without a ladder.""

""Don't!""

Sun Delong again panics and paces in circles around the platform.

""Don't go there, the Emperor is there!""

""I need to sneak a peek""

Minister Xie was annoyed. Who peeks at the Emperor?

""Who's sitting there?"" Sun asks,

""The Emperor, obviously.""

""So who's the eight giants next to him?""

""That's the guards, The Golden Macemen.""

""What's that in their hands?""

""The Golden Maces""

""So bring the tallest one to me. I have something to discuss with him.""

Minister Xie goes and sees that it is in fact Hall of Supreme Harmony Guardsman of the First Class Bai Wenyuan.

""Lord Bai, here's a friend that wants to meet you, the sorcerer Sun who's here to duel. This is Hall of Supreme Harmony Guardsman of the First Class Lord Bai Wenyuan""

""Oh, Minister Bai, good tiding to you, please help me.""

""What do you need?""

""I need to get up there""

""What's that got to do with me?""

""Without you I can't get up there.""

""How so?""

""Think, this platform is ten meters tall, how tall are you?""

""Me? His majesty only picks the tallest for his guard. I'm in fact two meters seven.""

""What about the golden mace?""

""Handle is four meters two, three decimeters for the mace, total four meters five.""

""Ah, that's right. Four meters five plus two meters seven, that's seven meters two. It's only a bit from ten meters.""

What's he calculating? Bai Wenyuan wonders.

""So, just let me sit on the mace, and you catapult me up there..."" Sun says.

""What? I...'ve never heard of this!""

""If you don't, I'm leaving.""

Minister Xie immediately runs over, ""Lord Bai, please help him and just give it a try.""

Bai Wenyuan was shaking with anger. Just what the hell is this? But he complies anyway. He lets Sun climb onto the mace, and vaults. With his strength, Sun flies 14 meters into the air, way past the platform. It would seem like Sun is in trouble because of the fall, but he was actually okay. Remember he has that meter and half hook? He reached the hook out to the platform to break his fall, and slid down it once it reached. Not only was he not injured, but he actually arrived standing up.

The old Taoist was meditating with his eyes closed, so he didn't see what Sun Delong was doing at all. When he opened his eyes, all he saw was Sun descending from 14 meters in the air. He was frightened, ""Wow! There are indeed talented people in China! I only rode the whirlwind, they came straight from heaven!""

He then takes a look at Sun Delong and was even more frightened, ""This man has fortuitous clouds at his feet and golden light protecting his body!"" The reason is, of course, that Sun had kicked the incense pot over when he landed, and the incense ash poured out around him. As for the golden light, it's because of his oiled cotton clothes, which reflected brightly in the sunlight. Usually in battle, the side that loses their heart first loses, the old Taoist was shaking with fear. He warns himself to be careful, which only psyched himself out more. He holds out his hand and speaks.

""Amita!""

Even though he's short, his voice was like a bronze bell. The old Taoist has invoked his first chant, and Sun thinks to himself that he must return one.

""Good stuff!""

So the old Taoist says:

""Amitabha!""

And he hears that the old Taoist has added a syllable, so he adds a bunch.

""A bunch of junk stuff!""

The old Taoist was baffled. ""I don't have that much stuff!"" He thinks, ""Might as well silently debate then!"" He holds out a finger, which means:

""Don't underestimate me, I have The One Buddha saluting me!"" 

Sun of course, doesn't know that. He says he knew how to silently debate, but it's not the same thing. It's the kind of debate he has with customers in the butchery. He sees that the old Taoist has held out a finger, and was enraged, 

""What's this? He thinks he's one generation older than me? Fuck you!""

He holds out two fingers. What does he mean?

""You think you're my uncle? Your dad's two generations behind me!""

The old Taoist thought, ""Wow! My one finger is The One Buddha saluting me, so he counters with Two Saints shielding him!"" He then raises three fingers, which means ""The Three August ones rules the Earth"". Sun Delong doesn't know, but he thinks:

""This is a trick, he raises one so I give him two, he's going to give me three, but if I give him four he's giving me five, and I don't have six fingers to give back. Therefore, I'm taking the five first!""

The old Taoist was amazed, ""The Three August Ones rules the Earth"" is indeed countered by ""The Five Emperors are sovereign."" He then slaps his chest, meaning ""The One Buddha in my heart."" Sun was again enraged, ""So now you think you're my father-in-law?"" He slaps his head, which means ""You think you're my father-in-law? I'm slapping you and your daughter!"" The old Taoist again saw that his ""The One Buddha in my heart"" being countered by ""Heaven is above my head"".

The old Taoist had to evaluate his options - he couldn't win the silent debate, so he took the scroll paper and pulls his sword out. ""What? Is he going to slit his own throat?"" The Taoist cuts the paper into three pieces and drew a charm on each with the cinnabar brush. He lights the candelabrum and then the scroll with the candle. He starts chanting as he shakes his sword, and the scroll starts burning brighter, which he wants to use to burn Sun Delong. Sun Delong taunts him, ""Playing with fire? Aren't you a bit old for this? If you play with fire too much you'll piss your bed at night, and your mother will spank you!""

The old Taoist was incensed, so he continues to spin the fire, which grew from the size of a teacup to a plate. Why didn't it burn out the scroll? It's because the old Taoist has applied a special formula with the cinnabar to keep it burning. He threw the flaming scroll at the other platform, and it flew towards Sun's face. Sun dodges to the left and lets it pass, but his hair, which Ming Dynasty people usually wear in a bun on their head, caught fire, and half of his head was burnt off. Luckily for Sun, there was a bowl of rainwater on the platform, so he took it and put the fire out. The Old Taoist sees the charm has failed, so he starts burning the second one. Sun Delong sees this and was angered, ""Oh, so you're kicking me while I'm down? You want to burn the other half so I'd have to become a monk and go beg for food with you? Fuck that! I'm attacking first!"" He takes his hook and aims it at the old Taoist.

The old Taoist was still chanting with his eyes closed, which gave Sun enough time to aim. He throws the pig hook tail first towards the old Taoist ""Look at this stuff!"" If he didn't yell this he'd hit the old Taoist in the face, but since he yelled, the old Taoist opens his eyes and sees something flying towards him. ""Amita!"" He yells and dodges to the right. The pole of course missed, but the hooks behind it didn't, and cleaves two strands of flesh right off the old Taoist's cheek. ""Amitabhaaaaaaaaaaaa!"" The old Taoist screams. Sun Delong taunts again, ""Doesn't pay attention, take this stuff!"" 

The old Taoist examines the pig hook and doesn't know what it is, and becomes more frightened, ""Aya! I forgot he descended from heaven and has fortuitous clouds and golden light shielding him! This man is a true arhat and even has Gautama Buddha's Eight Treasures As-You-Will Purple Gold Hook!""

Sun Delong was delighted! ""Idiot! My hair can still grow back, what pot-fixer can repair your face?""

This only served to frighten the old Taoist more, as he also noticed Sun's purse and wine bottle hanging on his belt. In his panic he thought they were the hundred-treasure pouch and heaven-flipping seal. As he kept frightening himself, he finally decided to use the foremost stratagem of the thirty six - retreat!

""Amita! I'm going back to my country to report!""

""If you leave I'm using my power!""

""No, Don't! I'll report to your Emperor first!""

The old Taoist leaps off the platform and runs up to the Hall of Supreme Harmony, kowtowing again and again. ""Please forgive your vassal's transgressions! Please forgive your vassal's transgressions!""

Of course, the Emperor didn't understand any of it. He only heard the stuff about ""Amita"" and ""Good stuff"" and didn't get it. He then saw the old Taoist setting things on fire and then Sun Delong putting it out with water. ""Of course! Water beats fire!"" He then saw the old Taoist lighting fire again, and was annoyed, but then while he was staring at the fire, he saw that the Taoist's cheeks were then gashed. He clapped happily, ""We've won! Good! Good!"" He saw that the old Taoist has descended and knew that the old Taoist admitted defeat.

""What do you have to say?""

""Ah! Your majesty! Please forgive us! We admit defeat and will tribute and declare every year!""

""Of course! We must know, however, what is 'Amita'?""

""That's how we Taoists greet people.""

""What about his 'Good stuff'?""

""I don't know, what's good stuff?""

""What about 'Amitabha'?""

""It's also a greeting.""

""What about his 'A bunch of junk stuff!'?""

""He has too much stuff"" The old Taoist points to his cheek ""Look at this stuff I took!""

""Then what was that finger?""

""The One Buddha saluting me!"" 

""What about his two?""

""Two Saints shielding him!"" 

""What about your three?""

""'The Three August Ones rules the Earth', then your sorcerer counters with 'The Five Emperors are sovereign.' I slapped my chest meaning 'The One Buddha in my heart', and he counters with a slap on his head meaning 'Heaven is above my head'"".

""So what about that fire?""

""Please forgive me! I wanted to toss him off the platform.""

""For a man of mercy you sure are merciless! What about your face?""

""Eight Treasures As-You-Will Purple Gold Hook.""

So then he was dismissed and goes to await the Emperor's judgment.

The Emperor's attendant then looks on the platform ""Wait, why is our sorcerer still up there?"" Of course, Sun Delong couldn't get down, and he's pacing on the platform wondering if he had won or not. The Emperor sees and says, ""Our sorcerer must be wounded by that demon fire, have somebody help him down."" So immediately a ladder was raised and Sun Delong gets off the platform. Minister Xie walks over and says, ""The Emperor requires your audience, just kowtow and try not to speak."" Why? He's still afraid of that possible ""Hey bro, long time no see"". Sun Delong enters the Hall of Supreme Harmony and salutes the Emperor, ""Hey!"" 

Are you going to bite me? The Emperor wonders, but then Sun says.

""I am kowtowing to your majesty.""

Of course, since he won, the Emperor was happy, ""Raise your head.""

Normally, it's against protocol to raise your head and you're supposed to say, ""It's a crime to"" and the Emperor would then say, ""We pardon it"", but Sun Deleng doesn't know that and raises his head immediately to stare at the Emperor, ""What?""

The Emperor laughed, ""So did you win or not?""

Sun Delong is afraid of this, because he doesn't know if he won or not. He lowers his head. The Emperor asks again, ""Did you win or not?"" He turns his head and sees the old Taoist, so when the Emperor asks a third time, he answers, ""Your majesty, I can't answer that. If I say I won, then I'm boasting, but if I say I didn't win, what did I come here for? If you don't have the skills you don't get the kills.""

Minister Xie is annoyed, ""What's all this small talk?""

""Please don't ask me who won, you should ask him. If he says I lost then I lost, if I said I won then I won. Old Taoist! If you say I lost, then let's go back up there for round two!""

The old Taoist holds his cheek and says, ""Please no! He won!""

""What's the sorcerer's name?"" The Emperor asks.

""My name is Sun Delong and I live in the butchery street. The Delong Butchery is mine. I've never cheated a customer and you'll always get 16 ounces to your pound!""

Who asked him about that?

""So after you met, what's 'Amita'?"" The Emperor asks.

""Oh that's simple! I know him.""

The old Taoist was surprised. He knows me? I don't know him?

""This man is here to beg for money.""

""Why 'Amita'?""

""In my butchery, whenever someone comes to beg, if it's a monk they'll say 'Mitabha"", if it's a Taoist they'll say, ""Amita', both means 'Give me money.'""

""Then what's 'Good stuff'?""

""I said 'Good stuff' because I was thinking, 'How the hell is there another one when two already begged from me?""

The old Taoist starts to grimace.

""Then in the silent debate, what's that one finger?""

Sun Delong however started thinking: Maybe the Emperor is going to punish the old Taoist, and the worst punishment is the nine familial exterminations. If I tell the Emperor about that generation stuff, then even if it's four generations apart it's still not out of the nine. I need to say something else. This is where the old Taoist is finally mentally slain:

""Your majesty, we were discussing business.""

""How so? He sticks one out, you stick two, he then sticks three and you stick five. He slaps his chest and you slap your head. Isn't that silent debate?""

""No, your majesty, it's business""

""What kind of business?""

""He knows I'm a butcher, and in his temple there's going to be a feast, so he wants to buy a pig. I tell him go ahead, I even have two for you. He wants one that's at least three hundred pounds, I tell him I've got ones that's more than five hundred pounds, he asks if the heart, liver and lungs come with it, and I tell him that he can have the pig head too!""

tl'dr: Chinese xiangsheng piece parallel of the Muslim Ban joke that u/GaryV83_at_Work put up.

""Holy shit,"" the guy replies. ""You actually understood and answered me!""
    
""I got every word,"" says the parrot.” I happen to be a highly intelligent, thoroughly educated bird.""
    
""Oh yeah?"", the guy asks, ""Then answer this -- how do you hang onto your perch without any feet?""
    
""Well,"" the parrot says, ""this is very embarrassing but since you asked, I wrap my willie around this wooden bar like a little hook. You can't see it because of my feathers.""

""Wow"" says the guy, ""you really can understand and speak English, can't you!?""

""Actually, I speak both Spanish and English and I can converse with reasonable competence on almost any topic: politics, religion, sports, physics, philosophy. I'm especially good at ornithology. You really ought to buy me. I'd be a great companion.""

The guy looks at the $200 price tag.” Sorry, but I just can't afford that.""

""Pssssssst"" says the parrot, ""I'm defective, so the truth is, nobody wants me cause I don't have any feet. You can probably get me for $20, just make the guy an offer!""

The guy offers $20 and walks out with the parrot. Weeks go by. The parrot is sensational. He has a great sense of humour, he's interesting, he's a great pal, he understands everything, he sympathizes, and he's insightful.

The guy is delighted. One day the guy comes home from work and the parrot goes ""Psssssssssssst"" and motions him over with one wing. ""I don't know if I should tell you this or not, but it's about your wife and the postman.""

""What are you talking about?"" asks the guy.

""When the postman delivered today, your wife greeted him at the door in a sheer black nightie and kissed him passionately.""

""WHAT???"" the guy asks incredulously. ""THEN what happened?""

""Well, then the postman came into the house and lifted up her nightie and began petting her all over"" reported the parrot.

""My God!"" he exclaims. ""Then what?""

""Then he lifted up the nightie, got down on his knees and began to lick her all over, starting with her breasts and slowly going down...""

""WELL???"" demands the frantic guy, ""THEN WHAT HAPPENED?""

What had to happen happened, and they got caught by a warriors tribe. Everybody is killed except the missionaries and one native interpreter.  
The tribe chief tells the first missionary:  
""You have been considered by the mighty tribe of Koungata. Now you have to choose: Tounga, or death.  
- Well, said the missionary, I don't know Tounga but anything is better than death! I choose Tounga.  
- Very well! Tounga it is, then.""  
Then three huge warriors approach, bend the missionary over and have their way with him, brutally. The screams can be heard for a full hour.
Then it's the turn of the second missionary, who is deathly pale but still choose Tounga, and gets pounded by three new huge warriors.  
When it's the turn of the third missionary, he just can't take it and says:

""**Who disturbs my slumber**! I have been asleep for thousands of years, and *you* dare to wake ***me***? I should kill you where you stand!""

The archaeologist, whose name was Benjamin, cowered in terror as the genie fumed before him, hoping that the genie's rage might be sated without him ending up dead.

""Fine,"" the genie grumbled finally after a tense silence. ""I will let you live, with one condition. You must not shave or cut the hair on your head, for when you do, I will turn you into an urn just like the one from which I came. Remember! I will not forget.""


As Benjamin timidly removed his arm from his face, he saw a flash of light, and *poof* the genie was no more, and only the urn remained to remind him of the curse that had been placed upon him.


Finishing up his business at the dig site, he returned home to his job in artifact restoration at a museum in the city where he lived. The genie's urn he had left in the tomb where it lay, sealing the room shut when the expedition had left.


After many years had passed, Benjamin began to have difficulty dealing with his hair. A scraggly mustache and beard drooped down his chin to his chest, and his shoulder-length hair was a constant irritation whenever he looked in the mirror.

Finally, after a day of itching and scratching at his face and head, he gave up. 

""Surely the genie will not carry out the curse. Maybe if I just trimmed my beard a bit, he would let me alone.""


The next few minutes found Benjamin in his bathroom facing the mirror, scissors in hand. Taking a deep breath, he placed the scissors close to his chin to cut off the ends of his beard. His hand began to close, and just as the first few strands of hair were severed from his body---


""**FOOL!** You ignored my command, and for that, you shall *die*!"" shouted the genie, who appeared out of nowhere.


Suddenly, Benjamin was no more, and all that was left was an ancient-looking urn on the ground where his feet had been planted.

And that was the end of Benjamin.


Now, what can we learn from this sad, sad tale?

It is forbidden to be nude around others as a nun!"". The nuns were very disheartened, and were becoming emotional. The priest see's this and as he is a kind man he offers a compromise, ""You may remove your clothing but as long as you stay in your rooms, lock the doors, and allow no one in with your clothes off!"".

The nuns were extremely happy with this and ran off to their rooms as quickly as possible, and undressed. A couple hours later, one of the nuns hears a knock on the door, **knock** **knock** **knock**. She is surprised since there is supposed to be no one around besides the other none and priest. She calls out ""Who is it? What do you want?"", a mans voice replies with ""Its the blind man."" The nun is very relieved as she does not have to get dressed since the man is blind and can not obviously see her with no clothes on.

The Scotsman asks for a year's supply of whisky; it's given to him and he's locked away.

The Irishman asks for a year's supply of Guinness so he's locked up with several thousand bottles of it.

The Englishman asks for a year's supply of cigarettes and he's given a pile of cartons and the cell door is shut on him.

One year later, the doors are all unlocked.

The Scotsman staggers out and shouts, 'I'm free!' and then keels over dead from alcohol poisoning.

The Irishman is dragged out into the light, whereupon he promptly dies of liver failure.

When the door to the Englishman's cell is opened, everybody watches eagerly to see what sort of a wreck the man has made of himself.

To their surprise, he walks right out the door, sidles up to the first person he sees, and asks, 'I say you wouldn't happen to have a match, would you?'

You see, John is a fairly successful single man. He's got good looks, money, a luxurious loft apartment, and a convertible sports car. You can be sure that all of the ladies want him, but of all the things he has, there is one thing that he just wasn't happy with: the size of his penis. 

John decides he has enough money to get a penis enlargement. I mean, if a woman can get her barely an A mosquito bites exploded into bodacious DD tatas, then why can't he go from teenage Asian to Mandingo? 

So John makes an appointment to see a penis enlargement specialist. 

After waiting a few days he finally gets into his appointment he has been so anxious about. The surgeon asks: ""So what can I do for you today John?"" to which John replies ""Y'know doc, I'm just not too happy with the size of my penis. It's kind of... ^small."" The doctor thinks for a minute and then says: ""Well, John, unfortunately I'm fresh out of penises at the moment. We won't really be able to do anything for you until I get my next shipment in a couple months."" John seems devastated. He can't believe that he has to go on this date knowing this girl will laugh as soon as she catches a glimpse of his little Vienna sausage. He begs the doctor: ""Please! There has to be *something* you can do to help me. I'm begging you!"" The doctor responds: ""Hmm.. give me just a moment."" He walks out of the room, and returns a few minutes later. ""I have potential good news for you John, but I'm not sure if you're going to be up for it. You see, I'm fresh out of penises, but I *do* have this baby elephant trunk. I know it's a bit odd, but it will make Mandingo looks like a little school boy."" John thinks for a minute, and decides it isn't such a bad idea. ""Anything is better than what I'm packing right now."" John says.

John schedules the procedure, and ends up recovering a few days before his date. 

The big day comes, and John is more confident than ever. He picks her up in the roadster, makes undeniably confident eye contact, and is making her laugh all the way to the restaurant. Really, everything has been going beautifully. They arrive at a *fancy* restaurant, valet parks his car, and they are seated immediately. A minute later the waiter comes with a basket of bread rolls, places them on the table, and asks what they would like to drink. John orders them both the most expensive bottle of wine they had. The waiter leaves to retrieve the wine while John and his beautiful date look over the menu. John tells her that she can have *anything* she'd like. ""Don't even look at the pricing, money isn't an issue."" he says. The waiter returns with the wine, and they place their order. While waiting for their food they decide to dig into the rolls. They both get a roll, butter it, and begin eating. Everything seems dandy, and then out of **nowhere** a baby elephant trunk **SHOOTS** up from under the table, grabs a roll, and disappears. John's date was **amazed**. ""**WOAH!** Can you do that again?!"" she said. To which he replied:

""I can, but I don't think I could fit another roll up my ass.""

So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm.

3.Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.

11.The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,""

12.The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-

post,5t27xw,2qh72,jokes,false,1486668598,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5t27xw/norwegians_in_minnesota/,self.jokes,,"One dark night outside a small town in Minnesota, a fire started inside the local chemical plant and in a blink of an eye it exploded into massive flames. The alarm went out to all the fire departments for miles around.
When the volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the chemical company president rushed to the fire chief and said, ""All our secret formulas are in the vault in the centre of the plant. They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact.""

But the roaring flames held the fire fighters off.

Soon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000 to the fire department that could bring out the company's secret files.

From the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby Norwegian rural township volunteer fire company composed mainly of Norwegians over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the large newer fire trucks that were parked around the plant.

Without even slowing down, the old truck drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other fire
fighters watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire and fought it back on all sides. It was a performance and effort never seen before.

Within a short time, the Norske old timers had the fire well under control and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.

The local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film, asking their chief, ""What are you going to do with all that money?""

""Vell,"" said Ole Larsen, the 70-year-old fire chief, ""Da first thing ve gonna do is fix da brakes on dat focking truck!""",Norwegians in Minnesota,138

The pastor says, ""Well, as you may have heard, we take fasting pretty seriously here. And Lent is just around the corner. I'd like to ask you to do something that may seem strange, but it will really demonstrate that you're committed to this church and to our spiritual disciplines. I'd like you to give up all sexual contact with each other for the entire 40 days of Lent.""

The husband swallows hard. The wife audibly gasps. But they look at each other, and then to the pastor. The husband says, ""Okay. We'll give it a shot.""

A week into Lent, they show up at the pastor's office looking a bit shamefaced. The pastor welcomes them in, and they can't seem to make eye contact. He knows it's gone wrong and he folds his hands, leans forward and says, ""Tell me what happened.""

The young husband blurted out, ""We tried! We really tried. But the second day of Lent was our anniversary. We went out to dinner, had a bottle of wine, and when we got home, things just started to go, you know. Down a certain path."" The wife said, ""But nothing happened — we danced and kissed briefly and then I made him sleep on the couch.""

""The next night,"" the husband explained, ""We talked about it, and both felt pretty guilty. But as the evening wore on, I could tell that both of us were really wanting that physical intimacy. So I actually went to a friend's house and slept at his place.""

""Go on,"" said the pastor.

The husband said, ""And then yesterday evening, she was reaching up to grab a can of peas from the top shelf and, well, she just looked so beautiful — I mean, that's good, right? She's my wife! I'm supposed to find her arousing. She looked so good, I grabbed her, we kissed, and then we ripped off all of our clothes and had wild, passionate, loud, messy sex right there on the floor.""

The pastor stood up, shook his head in disgust and said with considerable exasperation as he motioned toward the door, ""I'm sorry. But you are no longer welcome here at this church.""

They got up to leave and the wife said, ""That's okay. We're not welcome at Kroger anymore either.""

And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.

For example… One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed.

Well, the passion started to heat up, but then she said ""I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.""

I said ""WHAT??!! What was that?!""

So she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...""You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.""

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, ""Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?""

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.

Let me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, ""That's fine, honey.""

She appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, ""I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.""

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No honey, I don't feel like it.""

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, ""WHAT?""

I then said ""Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.

You're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.""

And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?""

Apparently, no sex tonight either!

This joke is good not because of any inherent humor, but rather because of its failure to amuse. It serves, therefore, as a valuable cautionary tale.

The first flaw in the anecdote’s construction is in its gratuitous use of ethnicity as a crutch. To be sure, Jews serve as an invaluable comedy resource. Any joke involving miserliness of any kind can be improved by the addition of a Hebraic surname (or, in the alternative, by the addition of the prefix “Mac.”) But here, “Jewishness” does not improve the comedy one wit. Any ethnicity will scream when placed in an oven. You throw an Irishman into an oven, and see if he doesn’t cry out “Begosh and begorrah, I’ve been thrown into an oven!” So too the Mexican, whose refrain of “Ai yi yi, es mui caliente!” is equally plausible. Indeed, the only person who should ever be thrown into an oven in comedy is Sylvia Plath.

Many of you may object, “But what of the Holocaust? Surely that validates the choice of ‘Jew’ in the set-up?”

Far from it. One must be very careful when relying on history as validation. The Nazis threw very few screaming Jews into the oven. This is not Holocaust revisionism, it’s simply fact. The Germans are a very efficient people, and they killed almost all their victims before disposing of their bodies in factory-like furnaces. To do otherwise would slow their production lines of death down, and that would be intolerable to the German psyche. No, no. The corpses that were thrown into the ovens went in not unlike the aforementioned pizza – silently.

Thus, the fundamental logic of the joke is ruined. The difference does not hold up under historical scrutiny. 

So when you are asked to contemplate the difference between a Jew and a pizza, plausible answer is: “One is a human being with a human soul and a human mind and inherent human dignity, and the other is a molded dough product.” Or “You take the pizza out of the oven in one piece.”

The worker pointed to the latest and greatest ""magic dildo"". He told the business man ""all you need to do is tell it where you want it to go and it will magically go there"". 

The business man couldn't believe it so the worker said ""magic dildo to the door!"" The dildo jumped out of its box and flew to the door. The business man was so excited that he bought a boxed dildo right then and there. 

When he got home he was so excited and told his wife about the new present he bought her. She didn't love the idea but a few days later she was feeling lonely and pulled out the box to her magic dildo. 

She said ""magic dildo to my vagina!"" The dildo jumped out of the box and started pleasuring her. After finishing the wife tried pulling the dildo out but it wouldn't budge. 

She got really worried and her calls wouldn't go through to her husband so, she started driving to the hospital. On her way the dildo continued pleasuring her and with each orgasm she swerved her car. 

Soon after swerving, a cop pulled her over and asked why she was swerving. She told the cop the whole story about the magic dildo and how she couldn't get it out of her.

He climbed a nearby telephone pole, hooked in his test set, and dialed the subscriber's house. The phone didn't ring right away, but then the dog moaned loudly and the telephone began to ring.
Climbing down from the pole, the telephone repairman found:
1. The dog was tied to the telephone system's ground wire via a steel chain and collar. 
2. The wire connection to the ground rod was loose.
3. The dog was receiving 90 volts of signaling current when the phone number was called.
4. After a couple of such jolts, the dog would start moaning and then urinate on himself and the ground.
5. The wet ground would complete the circuit, thus causing the phone to ring.
