I seek God!"" -- As many of those who did not believe in God were standing around just then, he provoked much laughter. Has he got lost? asked one. Did he lose his way like a child? asked another. Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? emigrated? -- Thus they yelled and laughed.
The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. ""Whither is God?"" he cried; ""I will tell you. We have killed him -- you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how did we do this? How could we drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.

""How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it? There has never been a greater deed; and whoever is born after us -- for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto.""

Here the madman fell silent and looked again at his listeners; and they, too, were silent and stared at him in astonishment. At last he threw his lantern on the ground, and it broke into pieces and went out. ""I have come too early,"" he said then; ""my time is not yet. This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time; the light of the stars requires time; deeds, though done, still require time to be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than most distant stars -- and yet they have done it themselves.

It has been related further that on the same day the madman forced his way into several churches and there struck up his requiem aeternam deo. Led out and called to account, he is said always to have replied nothing but: ""What after all are these churches now if they are not the tombs and sepulchers of God?""",Have you heard the one about madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours?,0

John: Please, just tell me.. who are you and where are we? You at least least owe me that much if your'e not going to get it over with now!

**The rower, putting up with the fact that he now has to address this question for the third time, calmly responds:

Rower: John, cry me a river, and the end is almost near.

**Having nealry given up hope, John closes his eyes and begins to feel his life flash before them, remembering all the good and bad memories, successes and failures, love and heartbreak.

**Right as John comes to peace with his fate, the boat slows its pace before reaching a stop. He opens his eyes and looks up, at the rower. The rower looks back and with a smile says:

On the way home from the car lot, he receives a call from his girlfriend. 

“Don’t forget we have dinner at my parents tonight!”

So he wheels straight over to his girlfriends parents house where dinner is being held. As he reaches the porch his girlfriend comes out and stops him short of the door. 

“I forgot to tell you over the phone, don’t say ANYTHING over dinner, that is a rule my parents have. If you do, you have to do the dishes afterwards. No one has spoken at dinner in years.”

Thinking this is just his girlfriend acting weird, he just shrugged it off as he walked in. Upon entering the kitchen he realized that she wasn’t kidding; the dishes were EVERYWHERE. Stacked on the counters, above the refrigerator, microwave, island, you name it dishes were stuffed there. 

In awe, he continues to the dining room and sits down for dinner. Again, like his girlfriend warned him, no one spoke. Just very awkward smiles and nods for greetings. Pointing and shoulder tapping for food to be past along the dining table. 

After a while, the guy started getting restless, and wanted to see how far he could take the no talking rule. He stood up, picked his girlfriend up, set her on the table and started plowing her in front of her parents. The mom, furious because she’s the closest to them, and the father, who’s watching his daughter have the time of her life right before his eyes. But still, no one breaths a word. They finish up, sit back down and everyone goes back to eating. 

A little later the guy starts having some more defiling thoughts, and proceeds to grab his girlfriends mother, pulls her dress up and bends her over the table, giving her the same treatment he did his girlfriend. The girlfriend is pissed now, the father is about to lose it, and the mom, who seems a little less upset about the whole situation now. Again, they finish up and everything goes back to normal. 

Finally, after a nice home cooked meal, some dessert he didn’t even get to finish and he’s had his fun, the man starts contemplate how he is supposed to leave the dinner table after everything that has happened. When suddenly it starts to just POUR down rain outside. So the man gets up from the dinner table, reaches into his pocket and grabs his trusty jar of Vaseline and at this time the father gets up and screams “ALRIGHT!! I’LL DO THE FUCKING DISHES!!!”",(STORY JOKE) A man goes to buy a used motorcycle from a car lot,58

F: You know what would really be hot?

M: What?

F: You slapping my ass as you're busy driving me to poundtown.

The boyfriend was surprised by his partner's request as he always had regular sex with her. Having heard this, he was extremely aroused and did not hesitate to slap his partner's ass repeatedly. The sex continued until tomorrow morning; it was evident that the couple had a fetish toward this type of sex.

However, being curious, the girlfriend started to find suitable male candidates for her to peg while she slaps their ass repeatedly like her boyfriend does.

 One day, having found one, she pegged the guy and simultaneously slapped his ass like there was no tomorrow. She was addicted to it and wanted it more. However, she noticed that there would be a very red hand mark that's redder than her's  on the guy's thighs and she felt puzzled as she would only slap the ass and not the thighs.

When she finished her pegging session, she hurriedly went back home as she could not wait to get her ass slapped by her boyfriend.

F:Honey, I'm home! Let's have sex.

M: Yes, please.

As the couple almost completely strip themselves naked, the boyfriend starts to laugh...

So I looked all over the house for him but couldn't find him. 

Finally I walked out on the balcony, and there he was, hanging from my railing 10 stories above the ground, begging me to save him. 

I started kicking and beating him, but he held on, so I got a hammer and smashed his fingers. He fell 10 stories, but landed in a bush, still alive. 

So I went and got the fridge, and I dropped it on him. Unfortunately I died of a heart attack from all the effort, and here I am.

St Peter shakes his head and admits him into heaven and the second guy walks up.

He says; ""Check this out, Every day for years Ive done exercises on my balcony. Yesterday I was working out and fell. Luckily I was able to grab the 10th floor railing, but I was just hanging there thinking I was going to die. 

Then a man walks out on the balcony and I start begging him to help. Instead he starts kicking and beating me, but I hold on. 

He gets a hammer and smashes my fingers and I end up falling 10 floors into some bushes. Im laying there amazed at being alive when a refridgerator lands on me... and here I am!

'Check the oil!'

He checks the oil and the level is low. He tops it up and tries to start the engine. Sure enough it starts up.

He drives until he finds a country pub. He stops in there for a break. The bartender sees him and says

'I really do' says the man.

'Everything ok?' Asks the barkeep.

""What seems to be the problem?"" Asks the owner.

""I think it'd be better if this man explained it to you himself."" The clerk lady responds. 

So the man calmly looks at the owner and says:
""Hello there you idiot, I'll ask one more bloody time I want to open a fucking bank account at this bullshit bank!""

It's quiet for a moment and the owner of the bank starts to get visibly angry at the man for insulting his employee, his buisness and him, but before he can construct a response the man decides to add:

""I just won 30 million in the lottery and I can't keep it all under my fucking matress now can I!?""

His plot included a number of followers in the upper ranks of the army. However, his plot was uncovered, and the king threw him in jail. The king sentenced him to death without a trial.

However, from the jail he was able to secretly contact his followers to arrange to escape, meet his followers, and attack the king's palace at night. So the night before his scheduled execution, the general managed to escape from prison. He fled to a ziggurat several kilometers away, where his followers would meet him. However, the ziggurat was one of several in the area, and he wasn't sure if his cohorts would find the right ziggurat. By this time it was twilight, so he lit a small fire and sent smoke signals to indicate in which structure he was hiding.

However, the king's loyal soldiers saw the smoke coming from the ziggurat, and came to arrest him before he could meet his followers. He was executed later that day.

The moral of the story? WARNING: The searching general has determined that smoking ziggurats can be extremely hazardous to your stealth.",Important safety warning:,4

Suddenly she hears the doorbell ring, and sure enough, once she opens the door her husband's friend Bob is at the door. 

-Hello, is Tim home? -he says.

I'm afraid not.-She replies. Tim is at work. Did you have any important matter to talk to him about.

-Well yeah, -says Bob, I guess i'll drop by later.

""It would be rude to send him away like this"".-Ms. Smith thinks to herself.
Bob, would you like to come in for some coffe?

-Why yes thank you,-he replies.

Bob makes himself comfortable, and Ms Smith serves him some coffe and some treats. After a while of chatting up, Bob suddenly says:

-I have to admit Amanda, Tim is one lucky man.

Oh why would you say that?-Ms. Smith asks.

-Well for starters he has such a charming wife.-Bob replies.
I tell you what, if you would just show me a little bit of your cleavage, i would be ready to pay you $1000. Of course i will never tell Tim about this.

Ms. Smith is clearly shocked, but thinking it through she thinks to herself that with that kind of money, she could buy herself quite a few things. She agrees and shows Bob her luscious breasts.

-Oh damnit Amanda,-Bob goes off again, If you would be willing to show me your naked body, i would gladly pay you $2000 more. 

""Well, as long as Tim doesn't find out"",-she thinks to herself, and strips for Bob right then and there. 

Amanda, i would have one final request, your body has got me feeling all sorts of hot and bothered. Please have sex with me and i'll give you $3000 more. It's $6000 in total. What do you say?

Ms. Smith thinks it through and through and she decides that $6000 is a pretty good ammount of cash with which she can renew her wardrobe. She agrees and has sex with Bob. After being done, Bob gives her the $6000 and leaves. Later that evening, while having dinner with her husband she's feeling guilty and can't help but bring it up.

You know darling, -she says, your good friend Bob paid us a visit this afternoon.

While walking to their campsite, they get lost and wind up in the middle of the jungle where a native tribe finds them. The three men are captured and taken back to the tribes site. 

Miraculously, one of the tribesmen speaks the same language as the three captured men. He translates for his chief. ""If you three want to get out of here alive, you are to each go into the jungle and find 10 of one type of fruit. None of you can come back with the same thing. Don't think we won't know if you try to run. Our tribe is big and spans this whole jungle."" 

Bob gets his ten fruit first and returns to the tribe site with them. 

""You are to shove all of these fruits up your ass. If you make any expression while doing this, we will kill you."" states the tribesman. 

Bob can't even get the first fruit up his ass even remotely before grimacing, so he is executed and dragged off. 

Rob, managing to find grapes somehow, gets back and is told the same thing by the tribesman. Straightfaced, he manages to get 9 grapes up his ass before laughing. 

Now in Heaven, Rob sees Bob. Bob bursting with frustration at Rob exclaims ""Why did you start laughing?! You had one grape left!""

Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk.

He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.

For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, ""You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels."" The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night.

One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return.

Two o'clock and no hired hand.

Finally he returned a round two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him.

She quietly called him over to her..

""Unbutton my blouse and take it off,"" she said.

Trembling, he did as she directed. ""Now take off my boots.""

He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. ""Now take off my socks.""

He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots.

""Now take off my skirt.""

He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. ""Now take off my bra.."" Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.

Then she looked at him and said, ""If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.""",A rancher dies and leaves everything to his wife.,340

At some point Jim Mattis &amp; Rex Tillerson decide it's the right time to corner Mike Pence-

Tillerson: ""Mr. Vice President, we need to talk… a majority of us are ready to go forward with invoking Section 4 of the 25th amendment, removing Trump from office for being mentally unfit to discharge the powers and duties required of the president. He's gone off the deep end! He's tearing the country apart just for fun, he's destroyed relationships with our strongest allies, he's exacerbated feuds with our adversaries...""

Mattis: ""HE'S USED TWITTER TO BRING US TO THE BRINK OF NUCLEAR WAR FOR CHRIST'S SAKE""

Tillerson: ""We believe we have the two-thirds vote required of congress, but we can't move forward without your support, are you in or not?""

Pence: ""I hear you, I have been concerned for a long time, but **we don't want to set a dangerous precedent.** If we remove him, what's to stop people from calling for the same thing to happen in the future whenever they oppose a president. The American people knew exactly who he was when they elected him, to remove him would be a betrayal of the will of the voters.""

Mattis: ""But…""

Just then, guess who walks up but the human Cheeto himself, President Donald Trump.

Trump: ""Boys... What are we talking about?""

Pence looks around, thinking of something to say, and sees a beach volleyball court outside.

Pence: ""Oh… uh, we were just thinking of giving that volleyball court a spin. But it's a bit hot, maybe we'll just take a dip in the pool.""

Knowing lil Donny's complete aversion to any physical activity, he thought this was a surefire way to ditch him, but to his chagrin-

Trump: ""Volleyball is a great idea, we'll start playing and maybe we can convince those hot waitresses to join us. Nothing like some young, bouncing bikini boobs to brighten up your day!""

Resigned, they change into rich white guy exercise clothing and head outside. The teams are Trump and Mattis versus Pence and Tillerson. It's match point for Pence/Tilly, and the veep hits a soft shot over the net. The walking combover bump passes to Mattis, and then drives to the net, but instead of setting the ball for Trump, Mattis just tries to lob it back over the net. Pence jumps and blocks the shot, scoring the match winner. Trump explodes-

Trump: ""Dammit Jim, I was in perfect position to spike the shit out of that ball you fucking retard!""

Mattis: ""Sorry sir…""

Mattis goes to get some water, and Pence walks over.

Pence: ""He's right you know, he was in perfect position for the spike, why didn't you feed him the ball?""

Mattis: ""I probably should have, but I didn't want to set a dangerous president!""

twelve years went by after she had two girls and a boy. the mother decided not to tell them about the shooting incident so as not to worry them.

the very same incident happened with her second daughter about a week later. the mother consoled her daughter and told her not to tell her brother because it would really freak him out.

about a month goes by and the mother is in her living room reading a book. she glances over at the stairs and sees her son walking down ever so slowly, tears rolling down his pale horror-stricken face. the mother rushes over and asks frantically, ""whats wrong son did you pee out a bullet?"". the son answers, ""no, i was in my room masturbating and i shot the dog!"".",A woman pregnant with triplets was shot in a drive-by,16

Not a single airplane or ship ever came into view to give him the slightest hope of rescue. His only joy came through pleasuring himself, but, in time, he could no longer “rise to the occasion.”

One day the man, his beard now down to his navel, was collecting wood along the beach.   A dot on the horizon caught his eye.  He dropped the wood he had collected and held his hands up to block the sun.  To his pure, utter disbelief, the dot took the form of a cruise ship!!  The man immediately lit his signal fire and made sure it was sending up as much smoke as possible. He then ran back to the beach. 

The cruise ship slowed down and turned in his direction!!  He couldn’t believe his luck!!  He got thinking about his rescue.  A cruise ship would be full of single ladies out for a great time!  He would be a celebrity and wanted to make a good impression.  He’d take a long hot shower, visit the barber and then dress in new crisp clothing from the shops onboard. Once dressed, he’d have a fine meal with all of the foods he’d been craving - but he’d dine slowly and with class and reserve so as to not appear to be a savage.  After his meal, he’d stroll the deck in the moonlight and mingle with all of the gorgeous ladies aboard.  Being the celebrity, and well tanned - and frankly in the best shape of his life - he’d have his pick. He’d escort a nubile young lady back to her room and take things very, very, achingly slowly.  Kissing at great length before letting his hands wander to the curves of her body and slowly undressing her until he could feel every inch of her skin in his embrace....

As he pondered the evening and the time he’d spend in the willing arms of the beautiful nymph in her cabin, he noticed that - for the first time in a unimaginable time - he was getting an erection!  Grabbing his cock and vigorously stroking it he laughed, muttering, “There’s no fuckin’ ship!”",A man is stranded on a desert island...,0

He reaches over and fondles her breasts. Nobody says a word.

     Luckily for him, he was a avid watcher of all those “survival” shows and managed to situate himself comfortably.  After scouring the island, he had noticed that also stranded with him was a lonely sheep and a feral dog. 
     A couple months pass and he was already getting tired of the monotony of  surviving and the occasional  
self pleasuring “rituals” before bed. 
     The following morning, he spotted the sheep near his campsite. It may have been from the heat, but he started fantasizing about “getting it on” with the sheep. He thought to himself for a minute and decided to go for it. Already excited with a raging boner he slowly approached the sheep. As he was about to grab the sheep, the dog came charging out of the brush and chased the sheep away.   
     This continued for a week. Whenever he got close to the sheep the dog repeatedly chased the sheep away. 
     One morning, a faint moaning woke him. He jumped up, looked around, and saw a naked, gorgeous woman washed up on the beach. He helped her recover and settle in. Grateful for his help, she told him in a seductive voice, “I’ll do anything for you, I’ll do anything with you, just ask and it will be yours.”
The man got a instant boner.  He leaned in to her and whispered “go hold that fuckin dog while I go and fuck the sheep!”",CastAway,2

Atop of it all Husband 1.0 uninstalled most of my programs like Romance 9.9, but he installed some modules that I have no idea what they mean! Programs like NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0 while on the other hand Dialog 8.0 and House cleaning 2.6 simply crash the whole program! I tried to help the situation with program Nagging 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 but unfortunately I have accomplished nothing. 

Desperate
--------------- ---------------
Dear Desparate,

You did not notice the declaration. Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment system while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Please try to input the following commands &gt;C:/ I_THOUGHT_YOU_LOVE_ME and install programs Tears 6.2.  That should automatically start the program in Husband 1.0 called Guilt 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. Please remember that overuse of this program can cause Awkward silence 2.5 and Beer 6.1.  Beer 6.1 is a particularly tricky application! Do not install Mother in law 1.0 I do not try and reinstall any of the older versions of the program Boyfriend. Both applications are not supported and will crash the Husband 1.0 system. All in all it is not a bad program but it has a limited memory and it can’t learn new applications that fast. You should consider getting another software like Spicy food 5.3 or Sexy underwear 1.0. Be careful how you use the application Nagging because it can lead to a secret virus called Mistress 1.0 which can be deleted with Private detective 5.8 or Attorney 9.8. It is very hard to do because it can lead to the reset of Husband 1.0 which demands installation of Husband 2.0.

He leans over and kisses Sandra.

No one says a word.

He reaches over and fondles her breasts. Nobody says a word.

So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table 
and screws her, right there in front of her parents.

His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. She's got a great body too.

Joe grabs mom, bends her over the table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way but loose 
right there on the dinner table.

She has a big orgasm, &amp; Joe sits down.

His girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, &amp; Mom is beaming from ear to ear. But still ... . Total silence.

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.

Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.

Suddenly the father shouts.
I'll do the fuckin’ dishes!!",Joe wanted to buy a Harley motorcycle.,3129

Once at the bar,  he noticed that a few buddies of his was there, watching the football, and one beer led to another.

At about 2am he stumbles out of the pub and went back home.

The wife was furious, and went to bed as soon as the guests left, but at about 3am she hears a massive noise like breaking glass at the front door.

He unwrapped the plain hamburger and carefully cut it in half, placing one half in front of his wife.

He then carefully counted out the french fries, dividing them into two piles and neatly placed one pile in front of his wife.

He took a sip of the drink, his wife took a sip and then set the cup down between them.

As he began to eat his few bites of hamburger, the people around them were looking over and whispering.

Obviously, they were thinking, ""That poor old couple...all they can afford is one meal for the two of them.""

As the man began to eat his fries, a young man came to the table and politely offered to buy another meal for the old couple. 

The old man said, they were just fine, they were used to sharing everything.

People closer to the table noticed the little old lady hadn't eaten a bite. 

She sat there watching her husband eat and occasionally taking turns sipping the drink.

Again, the young man came over and begged them to let him buy another meal for them.

This time the old woman said, ""No, thank you, we are used to sharing everything.""

Finally, as the old man finished and was wiping his face neatly with the napkin, the young man again came over to the little old lady who had yet to eat a single bite of food and asked, ""What is it you are waiting for?""

She answered, ""THE TEETH!""","An old man placed an order for one hamburger, french fries and a drink...",11387

I said “WHAT??!! What was that?!”

So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear…
“You’re just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me
to satisfy your physical needs as a man”.
She responded to my puzzled look by saying, “Can’t you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?”

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store.
I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits.
She couldn’t decide which one to take so I told her we’d just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went onto the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.
Let me tell you…she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck.
I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn’t even know how to play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I said, “That’s fine, honey”.
She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.
Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, “I think this is all
dear, let’s go to the cashier”.

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, “No honey, I don’t feel
like it”.

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled
""WHAT?”.

I then said “honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You’re just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.”
And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, “Why can’t you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?”.

Apparently I’m not having sex tonight either.

The second man picks it up and takes a bite. ""Holy shit! It tastes just like tonic!"" ""Turn it around"" the bartender says. He does so and takes another bite. ""Fuck off, it tastes just like gin"". The two men are in complete awe. A dwarf enters the pub and joins the other two men at the bar. He asks them what they are so excited about, as they are causing something of a scene. They tell him about the apples and how he can order whatever he wants and the barman will have an apple for it. So the dwarf calls the bartender over. He says to the barman, ""these boys say you've got an apple that tastes like anything I want. So I want an apple that tastes like pussy."" So, the bartender walks away, and comes back a few moments later with an apple. The dwarf picks it up the apple, stares at the barman, and takes a bite.

The man was encouraged. As he walked away, he turned and asked, ""How do I stop the medicine from working?"" 

""Your partner must say '1-2-3-4,'"" the medicine man responded, ""but when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon."" 

The man was very eager to see if it worked so he went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom. When she came in, he quickly took off his clothes and said, ""1-2-3!"" Immediately, he was the manliest of men.
