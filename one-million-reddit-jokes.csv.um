The man said, 'You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.' They opened the door to let his wife out. 'Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home.'

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes, 'I tried, but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said, 'You don't have what it takes. Take your wife home.'

Finally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. The man said, 'No.' The agent said, 'Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home.'

I, therefore, have set up a test to see who deserves all of my money. Plus, if you pass this test, I will grant you one wish. I have ties at high places, so your wish is guaranteed to happen. 

Now, all you have to do to pass this test is swim across the pool and back again. Obviously, try not to get eaten by the alligators as if you are dead you will not be able to collect the reward.""

As soon as the old man finishes his speech, a splash is heard. Everyone turns and sees a man  swimming as fast as he can to the other end of the pool. The alligators also notice this and swim after him. The man gets to the end of the pool and turns back to swim to the other side.

But he notices, right in front of him, a big alligator who can't wait to get a tasty snack. The man swims *directly* towards it and right when it seems he's a goner, the man swims under the alligator, kicking off of the ground of the pool to gain a boost. The man swims for his life and gets out of the pool right before the alligator takes a huge bite at where the man's foot had just been.

The old rich man gives the winner a towel and says, ""Well, you dove straight into that one. Congratulations, you are now a multi-billionaire. But you get one final request. What is your wish?""

Both teams practiced long and hard to reach their peak performance before the race.
On the big day, the Japanese won by a mile. The North Americans, very discouraged and depressed, decided to investigate the reason for the crushing defeat.

A management team made up of senior management was formed to investigate and recommend appropriate action. Their conclusion was the Japanese had 8 people rowing and 1 person steering, while the North American team had 8 people steering and 1 person rowing. So, North American management hired a consulting company and paid them a large amount of money for a second opinion.

They advised that too many people were steering the boat, while not enough people were rowing.

To prevent another loss to the Japanese, the rowing team’s management structure was totally reorganized to 4 steering supervisors, 3 area steering superintendents and 1 assistant superintendent steering manager. They also implemented a new performance system that would give the 1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder.

It was called the”Rowing Team Quality First Program“, with meetings, dinners and free pens for the rower. There was discussion of getting new paddles, canoes and other equipment, extra vacation days for practices, and bonuses.

The next year the Japanese won by two miles. Humiliated, the North American management laid off the rower for poor performance, halted development of a new canoe, sold the paddles, and canceled all capital investments in new equipment. The money saved was distributed to the Senior Executives as bonuses and the next year’s racing team was outsourced to India.",The Problem With Corporate America,3

The lawyer thinks for a minute and says, 'First, did your research also show you that my mother is dying after a long, painful illness and she has huge medical bills that are far beyond her ability to pay?' 
 
Embarrassed, the United Way rep mumbles, 'Uh . . . No, I didn't know that.' 
 
'Secondly,' says the lawyer, 'did it show that my brother, a disabled veteran, is blind and confined to a wheelchair and is unable to support his wife and six children?' 
 
The stricken United Way rep begins to stammer an apology, but is cut off again. 
 
'Thirdly, did your research also show you that my sister's husband died in a dreadful car accident, leaving her penniless with a mortgage and three children, one of whom is disabled and another that has learning disabilities requiring an array of private tutors?' 
 
The humiliated United Way rep, completely beaten, says, 'I'm so sorry, I had no idea.' 
 
And the lawyer says, 'So . . . If I didn't give any money to them, what makes you think I'd give any to you.

Adam and Eve said, “Lord, when we were in the garden, you walked with us 
 every day. 

 Now we do not see you any more. We are lonesome here, and it is difficult 
 for us to remember how much you love us.” 

And God said, I will create a companion for you that will be with you and 
 who will be a reflection of my love for you, so that you will love me even when 
 you cannot see me. Regardless of how selfish or childish or unlovable you may be, 
 this new companion will accept you as you are and will love you as I do, in spite of 
 yourselves.” 

And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam and Eve. 

 And it was a good animal. 

 And God was pleased. 

 And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and Eve, and he wagged his 
 tail. 

 And Adam said, “Lord, I have already named all the animals in the Kingdom, 
 and I cannot think of a name for this new animal.” 

And God said, ” I have created this new animal to be a reflection of my 
 love for you, his name will be a reflection of my own name, and you will call him 
 DOG.” 
And Dog lived with Adam and Eve and was a companion to them and loved them. 

 And they were comforted. 

 And God was pleased. 

 And Dog was content and wagged his tail. 

 After a while, it came to pass that an angel came to the Lord and said, 
“Lord, Adam and Eve have become filled with pride. They strut and preen like peacocks 
 and they believe they are worthy of adoration. Dog has indeed taught them that 
 they are loved, but perhaps too well.” 

And God said, “I will create for them a companion who will be with them 
 and who will see them as they are. The companion will remind them of their limitations, 
 so they will know that they are not always worthy of adoration.” 

And God created CAT to be a companion to Adam and Eve. And Cat would not 
 obey them. And when Adam and Eve gazed into Cat’s eyes, they were reminded that they 
 were not the supreme beings. 

 And Adam and Eve learned humility. 

 And they were greatly improved. 

 And God was pleased. 

 And Dog was happy. 

 And Cat didn’t give a shit one way or the other.

The nun, surprised by the question, politely declines and gets off at the next stop. When the bus starts again, the bus driver says to the hippie, ""If you want, I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you.""

The hippie of course says that he'd love to know, so the bus driver tells him that every Tuesday evening at midnight the nun goes to the cemetery to pray to the lord. ""If you went dressed in robes and some glowing powder,"" says the bus driver, ""You could tell her you were God and command her to have sex with you.""

The hippie decides to try this out. That Tuesday, he goes to the cemetery and waits for the nun. Right on schedule, the nun shows up. While she's in the middle of praying, the hippie walks out from hiding, in robes and glowing with a mask of god. ""I am God, I have heard your prayers and I will answer them but you must have sex with me first,"" he says.

The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity. The hippie agrees to this and quickly sets about having sex with the nun.

After the hippie finishes, he rips off his mask and shouts out, ""Ha ha, I'm the hippie! ""

The nun replies by whipping off her mask and shouting, ""Ha ha, I'm the bus driver!""",A hippie gets onto a bus and sits next to a nun...,46

""Bob, we have pills and treatments and the like, but I have a trick you can try before we go down those routes.""

Bob replies ""Well Dick, I am all ears.""

""When ever you feel the urge to ejaculate, startle yourself."" Dick replies reassuringly.

Bob leaves the doctors feeling excited, what a brilliant plan he thought. On his way he started to brainstorm - what could reliably startle him? He was a pretty tough guy and wasn't scared of much.

He happened to pass a gun shop and then it clicked, a starter pistol! He loops around and pulls in, this was it he thought, his problems we're all over now. Bob picks up his new secret weapon on the spot, being a non lethal weapon it allowed him to pick it up right then and there.

Deciding to skip the second half of work Bob went straight home, it was time to make things right with his wife...

Surprising her with his early arrival, she was already naked and ready to go. They start going at it and before long they were 69ing and he felt the urge and fired the pistol!

The next day he went to the doctors and Dick asked ""Well, how did it go?""

post,3x6774,2qh72,jokes,false,1450325353,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3x6774/desperate_lumberjack/,self.jokes,,"A lumberjack gets a gig deep in the remote wilderness of the Great White North. He'll be gone for over five years but the pay is great so he thinks it's well worth it and manages to be upbeat during his trip.

When he gets to the small town, he unpacks his things at the lodge and then heads down to the mill for his first day of work.

After he's done for the day, he asks his supervisor if there's any kind of entertainment around town. He says, ""there's a tavern where all the men get together at the end of work. Can't miss it buddy.""

So he heads there. When he gets inside, he sees all the boys are having a good time, drinking up after a day's hard work. He goes to the bartender and orders one up for himself. He looks around: some men are playing billiards, others are watching the hockey game, and a few are playing cards. He thinks this is good and all, until it dawns on him: this is a fucking sausage fest. Not a single woman in sight. In fact, he's sure he's not seen a single piece of pussy since he got here. He begins to chat with the bartender about this.

""Hey there, it looks like you've been here for a long time. You wouldn't by any chance know how the men satisfy themselves around here, would you?""

Bartender looks at him and says, ""Oh you're the new guy eh? Don't worry friend, the guys have thought all this out a long time ago. Now listen up, I only wanna tell you this once. Every Tuesday at midnight, there's this big ass truck that comes around town for this very purpose. And you know what? Today is Tuesday and you're in luck!""

The guy is obviously excited. He hasn't had any since he got here. He looks at the clock and it's a couple hours away. He waits eagerly. When the clock strikes for midnight, he begins to get up, but is beaten soundly by a stampede of men making their way to the exit as the distant sound of a truck horn is heard. He finally heads out after everyone but the bartender have left.

Outside, upon seeing what is taking place, the lumberjack is suddenly overwhelmed by a deep sense of disgust. A big ass truck has arrived, but its cargo consists of moose - some bulls, some cows - and the men were fucking the living shit out of them. Clearly horrified by what he's seeing, the lumberjack blurts out, ""What the fuck is this? This is the most digusting shit I've ever seen in my life!"" but none of the men even pay attention to him.

The bartender tells him, ""You're new here, can't say I blame you. These ones haven't had any for just under a month now. You'll soon give up.""

Lumberjack looks at him, still mortified, ""You can't be serious! There's no way I'm fucking a moose!""

Bartender rolls his eyes and says, ""We shall see.""

So he heads back to his lodge. One day goes by; easy enough, he thinks to himself. Then a week goes by; he's starting to lose it, he's fapped so much that he ran out of paper to wipe his ass. On the second week, he's desperate and has come to terms that fucking a moose is acceptable given the predicament he's in. It's a Tuesday, so he heads to the tavern after work.

He goes up to the bartender and orders the strongest stuff available. Bartender looks at him and merely nods as their eyes meet. He waits like all the others. The lumberjack is no longer ashamed. When the clock hits midnight, the man has already made his way to the door, leaving all the others in the dust.

Outside, the lumberjack takes everything off and begins to smash the first piece of moose he happens to grab a hold of. He's pounding the fuck out of the moose, thrusting profusely in a confluence of rage and pleasure, the animal only able to stand idly by without flinching. Finally, he unloads, and it's the most satisfying hump of his life.

He begins to look around but sees that none of the others has joined in the act. Looking back, he notices that the rest of the men are just staring at him with perplexed looks. Lumberjack is worried he's done something wrong. But he remains cool, turns back and addresses the other:

""Hey, why aren't any of you up here fucking a moose? I've seen you all do it before, what's wrong?""

A voice in the crowd says, ""Buddy, that's the ugliest moose I've ever seen!""",Desperate lumberjack,1

So I then asked him if his psychiatrist makes him lie face down on the couch cause he's so ugly. He finished the second ticket and put it on the windshield with the first. Then he started writing a third ticket!

This went on until he had placed 5 tickets on the winshield... the more I insulted him, the more tickets he wrote. I didn't care. My car was parked around the corner.",Parking ticket,3

The pilot does so and pulls up at 200ft and explodes into a firey ball when he hits the ground.

The Marine general then yells out ""You...Marine...go stop that tank...WITH YOUR FACE!!"". The marine runs over to a tank driving by and smashes his face against the armor and is then crushed into a bloody mess under the treads. The general looks to the other two and explains, ""YOU SEE THAT....MARINES HAVE SUCH BIG BALLS THEY'LL TRY TO STOP A TANK WITH THEIR FACE.""

by Kevin Ahern

Two thousand pounds of Chinese soup
Will make a restaurant run

In Beijing, China order it
In units of Won ton


Religious leaders measure clout
From Nome to Amsterdam

By how much clout they have with God
The units - billi-grams


Is the ratio of circumference
To diameter my, my

Of homes in northern latitudes
Known as Eskimo pi?


Four fifty three graham crackers is
An awful lot to bake

Into dessert when prepping up
A really good pound cake


The units used for cleaning breath
Are very small, so cope

One millionth of a mouthwash is
A single microScope


I bet you didn’t know the floor 
Was there until it beckoned

You hit a peel and then went down
In one bananosecond


And when your mother’s mother goes
To phone you from her van

Speed dialing is the way she calls
That is one instragram


A nickel isn’t worth too much
In these inflated times

Put four of them together, though
To make a paradigms


Geometrically I’ll bet that you
Must get it all the time

But did you know the distance twixt
Two jokes is one straight line?


I hate it when my socks get wet
It’s not what I’d have chosen

A thousand milliliters of
Them make one literhosen


For mockingbirds two thousand is
A lot, please hear my words

But that’s what you will need to have
Two kilomockingbirds


And if you shuffle playing cards
Remember fifty two

Is what you have when someone hands
One decacard to you


A tiny trout, I just found out
Won’t make a tasty dish

Cuz one millionth of one of those
Is just a microfiche


And if you’re into monogramming
Listen to me, ma’am

A pair of them together gives
One single diagram


If you should lose your voice it might
Just leave you feeling sour

But think of it in better terms
You’ve now got more hoarse power",A verse of unit puns,4

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

""Just a minute."" she said, and walked to the door, and locked it.

Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside.
""Do these excite you?"" she asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was shake my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on.

As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her knickers and sat down at a desk.
""Well, come on,"" she said, ""we don't have much time.""

So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOW. I was done within a few minutes.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown, ""Did you put that condom on?"" she asked.

I said, ""I sure did."" and held up my thumb to show her.","I recall my first time with a condom, I must have been 16.",3104

As the cosmonauts recoil in horror, the alien commander reassures them that they will not be harmed. In exchange for their cooperation, they will each be allowed to make use of the aliens' advanced technology.

The American speaks up first. ""Deal. Get my ass to Mars, and I will claim it for my country. I have always wanted to assess how viable it is for humankind."" The aliens granted his wish, and he was on his way in a personal spacecraft traveling at near light-speed.

The British cosmonaut was next. Thinking himself clever, he made an even more outlandish request: ""I'd like to visit the closest Earth-like planet to Alpha Centauri."" This amused the aliens, who were more than happy to create a wormhole through which this was possible. And just like that, he was on his way - soon, yet another sun would never set on the British Empire.

He finally finds one for a great price, but it's missing a seal, so whenever it rains he has to smear vaseline over the spot where the seal should be.

Anyway, his girlfriend is having him over for dinner to meet her parents. He drives his new bike to her house, where she is outside waiting for him.

""No matter what happens at dinner tonight, don't say a word."" She tells him, ""Our family had a fight a while ago about doing dishes. We haven't done any since, but the first person to speak at dinner has to do them.""

Steve sits down for dinner and it is just how she described it. Dishes are piled up to the ceiling in the kitchen, and nobody is saying a word. So Steve decides to have a little fun.
He grabs his girlfriend, throws her on the table and has sex with her in front of her parents. His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

A few minutes later he grabs her mom, throws her on the table and does a repeat performance. Now his girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, and her mother is a little happier.
But still there is complete silence at the table.

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain. Steve remembers his motorcycle. He jumps up and grabs his jar of vaseline.

Upon witnessing this, his girlfriend's father backs away from the table and screams, ""OKAY, ENOUGH ALREADY, I'LL DO THE FUCKING DISHES""

Not wishing to cause any harm to the Native Americans by forcibly removing them, the engineers met with Chief Bowels of the Native American tribe in his teepee to try to convince him to move the tribe. 

“Sir, there is absolutely no other location we can lay this track. The mountains to the north and the river to the south both necessitate that we build the railroad exactly here, right through where you are currently living. We hope you understand and will move your tribe so there will be no bloodshed.” “Bowels no move,” replied the Chief. 

The engineers, although taken aback and disappointed, decided to return a week later to give the Chief time to reconsider his decision to not move his tribe and allow the railroad to be built. Meeting again at the Chief’s teepee, the engineers discussed with the Chief. 

“Sir, it has been a week since we last met. Have you changed your decision? Will you let us build our railroad here?” Having not changed his mind, the Chief again replied, “Bowels no move.” “Sir, we have orders from the President of the United States himself to build a railroad here” the engineers agitatedly replied.  “If you do not let us build the railroad through this land, we shall be required to forcibly move your tribe.” “Bowels. No. Move.” insisted the Chief. “Fine. We will give you one more week. And upon our return, if you do not agree to our demands that you move your tribe, we shall forcibly remove you from his land.”

Another week passes. The engineers, now desperate to have the Chief agree to their demands so as to fall no farther behind schedule, meet the Chief again at the fire in the middle of the teepee village. “Sir, another week has passed. We do not wish to use force, but we shall do so if necessary. Will you move your tribe and let us build our railroad here?” “Bowels move,” agreed the Chief. Overjoyed, the engineers inquired as to what changed the Chief’s mind. The Chief replied, “Bowels move,” and then paused. “Teepee full of poo-poo.”",Chief Bowels,1

Reluctantly, the pet store owner finally gives in. The man gets home and surprises the kids with the parrot. They are excited and the parrot begins to talk. At first he is just saying some simple phrases. But then he starts to curse at the children. The man tells the bird that's enough and not to say that kind of stuff in front of his children. So the parrot has a few choice words for the man. Then the man's wife walks in and the parrot begins to get very explicit and quite vulgar. At this point the man is furious. He grabs the parrot around the neck and looks around, trying to decide what to do. He sees the freezer in the kitchen. He opens it and throws the parrot in and he stands with his back against the door. The parrot makes all kinds of racket but after about five minutes it is totally silent. The man starts feeling guilty. He only wanted to teach the parrot a lesson, not kill it. He hurriedly opens the freezer door and sees the parrot shivering and holding himself with his wings.

He finds fruit, catches fish and builds himself a shelter. Slowly he begins to adjust to his new life and situation and regain his strength. 
However after three weeks he suddenly gets the horn, a burning raging horn inside him and he knows he needs to release himself.  
He looked at the dog, ""Nah i don't fancy the dog,"" he said. He looked at the pig and said ""Yeah I fancy the pig, I could fuck the pig!"" 
However when he approaches the pig the dog jumps in his way snarling and snapping at him, blocking him from getting close to the pig.
""Damn it,"" says the man and he retreats to his shelter, his lust defeated. 
Life goes on as normal for a while, he climbs trees, breaks cocunuts and swims in the sea. Then a few weeks later the man gets the horn again.
He looks at the dog, ""nah I don't fancy the dog,"" he says. He looks at the pig and ""Yeah, I fancy the pig, I could do the pig!"" He tries again to fuck the pig.
But again the dog jumps to the pigs defense, snarling and biting,  not letting the man near the pig.
""Fuck it, bloody dog,"" says the man and retires to his shelter, his lust defeated.
He goes on for a few weeks  much as before living the simple life, he creates fire, improves his shelter and smashes rocks for fun. Then once again comes the unstoppable urge. 
The man looks at the dog ""Nah I don't fancy the dog,"" he says.
He looks at the pig, ""yes I fancy the pig, i could do the pig,"" he says, and once again he tries to fuck the pig.
However again the dog jumps to the defense of the pig, gnashing and snarling and the man is beaten and returns to his shelter his lust defeated. 
A few days later he's walking along the beach when to his surprise he discovers the body of a young woman. He pulls her out of the sea and carries her to his shelter.She's unconscious at first but he feeds her and gives her water and after a week she is nursed back to health.
""You know you really helped me,"" says the woman.
""Really?"" said the man.
""Yes, without you I would have died on that beach,"" she said.
""So infact I owe you my life.""
Then.... suggestively touching her swimsuit she says ""You've been stuck on this island a time right? It must get lonely here? Is there any thing I can do for you?""
""Well,""says the man after some consideration. "" There is one thing............

Apparently the teamsters have dog-sledded their way to the north pole and are unionizing Santa's helpers!

 From what can be gleaned, despite conflicting reports coming from Santa Inc.(which is to be expected given the extensive and established control the state has over the arctic media), the reindeer are upset with a claus in their contract preventing arbitration and recourse in the event of unsatisfactory work conditions, which according to my source has been an ongoing problem for some years.

 ""Poor leadership and unsatisfactory work conditions have created an environment of mistrust and the resulting reluctance of Santa's reindeer to complete their tasks this holiday season seriously threatens Christmas"" says Yuself Tinse, head reindeer keeper and sitting president of the newly formed UNPW(Union of North Pole Workers).

 Apparently Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer(Comrade Rudolph as he likes to style himself) has been not informing the other reindeer when he's applying the brakes, turning all the others into brown-nosed reindeer.

 ""This sort of immature power play has no place at the headquarters of Christmas and the powers that be don't seem to care"", says Prancer, one of the reindeer to suffer most heavily from this brown stain on the Christmas spirit.

 There's also been rumors of talks going on regarding a weight limit for each reindeer to shoulder, calling into question the issue of the unfettered milk and cookie consumption of one who we won't name here(I certainly don't want any coal in MY stocking).

 A request for comment to Santa Inc. from The Onion has been met with a coal response.

 Updates regarding this ongoing issue will be issued as they become available.",Important Holiday news alert!!!,0

When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where. More stress.

The when He began to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys. So, frustrated Santa went back inside the house for apple cider and a shot of rum.

When he went to the cupboard,he discovered that the elves had hidden the liquor and there was nothing to drink . In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider pot and it broke into hundred of pieces over the kitchen floor.

He went to get the broom and found out that mice had eaten the straw end of the broom.

Just then the doorbell rang and irritable Santa trudged to the door.
He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas Tree.

I'm writing this slow because I know you can't read fast. We don't live where we did when you left home. Your daddy read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 10 miles from your home, so we moved. I won't be able to send you the address because the last family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so that they wouldn't have to change their address.

This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works so well though. Last week I put a load of clothes in and pulled the chain... We haven't seen them since. The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second time for four days.

About that coat you wanted me to send you, your Uncle Jebediah said it would be too heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets. Johnny locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your daddy out.

Your sister had a baby this morning, but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if you're an aunt or an uncle. The baby looks just like your brother. Uncle Ted fell in a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off playfully and drowned. We had him cremated and he burned for three days.

Three of your friends went off a bridge in a pickup truck. Cleatus was driving. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. Your other two friends were in back. They drowned because they couldn't get the tailgate down. There isn't much more news at this time. Nothing much out of the normal has happened.

Love,

Mom

The Canadian is shocked. ""What the hell?!"" he asks. ""You just wasted some perfectly good booze!""

The American shrugs. ""We've got plenty of bourbon down south.""

The Frenchman, not to be outdone, produces a bottle of Champagne. He removes the cork and takes a sip before heaving the bottle upward and shooting it out of the sky.

The Canadian is outraged. ""Now what did you do that for?"" But the Frenchman dismisses him with a wave of his hand. ""Do not worry. We have plenty of Champagne in France.""

The Canadian gives the two of them a long, hard look before pulling out a can of Molson. Not one to let anything go to waste, he chugs the entire can before asking to borrow the American's pistol. Gun in hand, he runs the empty can to the nearest recycling bin before returning to the group and shooting the Frenchman.

The American is horrified. ""What the hell?!"" he screams.

The Canadian shrugs as he calmly returns the gun. ""Easy, bud. We've got plenty of those in Canada.""","An American, a Frenchman, and a Canadian are walking along...",1
