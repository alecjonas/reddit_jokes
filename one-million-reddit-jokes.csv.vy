The engineer said “I think I’ve got a few spanners in the back. I’ll take a look and see if I can work out what’s wrong”.
The programmer said “Why don’t we get going again and see if it’s reproducible?”

He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer dial to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. 

But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and bump it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. 

At this point they decided to try for 50%. 

The husband continued to feel quite well. Since it was obviously helping out his wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain. 

She and her husband were ecstatic. When they got home, the mailman was dead on their porch.",A married couple goes to the hospital to have their baby delivered.,13

The brown haired man laughes it off as a crazy idea, and they continue to drink. However after another half hour of heavy drinking both men are sufficiently plastered, and the blacked haired man leans in again to slur out,
""Really though man, i bet you ten bucks i can jump off that cliff and fly back to the top!""
The brown haired man is just drunk enough now to become interested, so skeptically he follows him outside. 
""Here's what I'm gonna do,"" the black haired man exclaims between burps and sways "" I'm gonna jump off that cliff, catch the air, and I'm gonna fly back up here!""
And without missing a beat, he sprints towards the edge and throws himself off as the the brown haired man looks on, horrified. Not seconds after, despite all odds, the black haired man soars back onto the cliff, coat billowing in the strong wind. 
Shocked and amazed, the brown haired man asks him to do it again, and a third time, sure enough he always ends up flying safely back to the bar.
""My god I've got to try this my self!"" screams the brown haired man, as he runs to the cliff, throws himself off, and plummets 200 feet to his death. Just as the splat is heard, the bartender comes out shaking his head at the black haired man, and says

As the dust in the air settled, they suddenly could view a mosque ahead. They became very hopeful. But then John said ''Muslims are there. They might help us if we say we are Muslim.'' Then Mike said ''No way, I won't say I'm Muslim, I'm gonna be honest''.

So John and Mike went to the Mosque ahead and were greeted by an Arab Muslim, who asked what their names were.

John thought of a Muslim name and said, 'My name is Muhammad'. And Mike said 'My name is Mike'.

The Arab man said 'Hello Mike.' And told these other men to take Mike and give him food and drink.

Then he turned to John and said, 'Salaam Muhammad. Ramadan Mubarak! (Hello Muhammad, Happy Ramadan)",Classic joke for our Muslim friends today,9502

post,3a7fae,2qh72,jokes,false,1434573372,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3a7fae/when_i_was_10/,self.jokes,,"Around age 10 my dad got me one of those little badass compound bow beginner kits. Of course, the first month I went around our land sticking arrows in anything that could get stuck by an arrow. Did you know that a 1955 40 horse Farmall tractor tire will take 6 rounds before it goes down? Tough sumbich.

   That got boring, so being the 10 yr. old Dukes of Hazard fan that I was, I quickly advanced to taking strips of cut up T-shirt doused in chainsaw gas tied around the end and was sending flaming arrows all over the place.

   One summer afternoon, I was shooting flaming arrows into a large rotten oak stump in our backyard. I looked over under the carport and see a shiny brand new can of starting fluid (Ether). The light bulb went off in my head.

   I grabbed the can and set it on the stump. I thought that it would probably just spray out in a disappointing manner. Lets face it, to a 10 yr old mouth-breather like myself, (Ether), really doesn't ""sound"" flammable.

  So, I went back into the house and got a 1 pound can of pyrodex (black powder for muzzle loader rifles).

   At this point, I set the can of ether on the stump and opened up the can of black powder. My intentions were to sprinkle a little bit around the (Ether) can but it all sorta dumped out on me. No biggie, a 1 lb. pyrodex and 16 oz (Ether) should make a loud pop, kinda like a firecracker you know?   You know what? Screw that I'm going back in the house for the other can.

   Yes, I got a second can of pyrodex and dumped it too. Now we're cookin'.  I stepped back about 15 ft and lit the 2 stroke arrow. I drew the nock to my cheek and took aim. As I released I heard a clunk as the arrow launched from my bow. In a slow motion time frame, I turned to see my dad getting out of the truck... OH SHOOT! He just got home from work. So help me God it took 10 minutes for that arrow to go from my bow to the can. My dad was walking towards me in slow motion with a WTF look in his eyes. I turned back towards my target just in time to see the arrow pierce the starting fluid can right at the bottom. Right through the main pile of pyrodex and into the can. Oh shoot.

  When the shock wave hit it knocked me off my feet. I don't know if it was the actual compression wave that threw me back or just reflex jerk back from 235 fricking decibels of sound. I caught a half a millisecond glimpse of the violence during the initial explosion and I will tell you there was dust, grass, and bugs all hovering 1 ft above the ground as far as I could see. It was like a little low to the ground layer of dust fog full of grasshoppers, spiders, and a worm or two.

   The daylight turned purple. Let me repeat this... THE FRICKING DAYLIGHT TURNED PURPLE.

  There was a big sweetgum tree out by the gate going into the pasture. Notice I said ""was"". That son-of-a-bitch got up and ran off.

   So here I am, on the ground blown completely out of my shoes with my thundercats T-Shirt shredded, my dad is on the other side of the carport having what I can only assume is a Vietnam flashback: ECHO BRAVO CHARLIE YOU'RE BRINGIN' EM IN TOO CLOSE!! CEASE FIRE. DAMN IT CEASE FIRE!!!!!

   His hat has blown off and is 30 ft behind him in the driveway. All windows on the north side of the house are blown out and there is a slow rolling mushroom cloud about 2000 ft. over our backyard. There is a Honda 185 3 wheeler parked on the other side of the yard and the fenders are drooped down and are now touching the tires.

   I wish I knew what I said to my dad at this moment. I don't know - I know I said something. I couldn't hear. I couldn't hear inside my own head. I don't think he heard me either... not that it would really matter. I don't remember much from this point on. I said something, felt a sharp pain, and then woke up later. I felt a sharp pain, blacked out, woke later....repeat this process for an hour or so and you get the idea. I remember at one point my mom had to give me CPR. and Dad screaming ""Bring him back to life so I can kill him again"". Thanks Mom.

   One thing is for sure... I never had to mow around that stump again, Mom had been bitching about that thing for years and dad never did anything about it. I stepped up to the plate and handled business.

   Dad sold his muzzle loader a week or so later. I still have some sort of bone growth abnormality, either from the blast or the beating, or both.

   I guess what I'm trying to say is, get your kids into archery. It's good discipline and will teach them skills they can use later on in life.

Much of their relationship is based on pragmatism rather than real friendship or personal affection.

He gets the shock of his life when he sees his own obituary in the column.
 He realizes that the query for info on him by the local newspaper several months earlier, was in preparation for this event. He correctly surmises that it is a mistaken entry from their database, premature and erroneous.

It still excites and rankles him, so he calls Jake up. ""Jake, are you up yet?""

Jake sleepily answers, ""Yeah, but I'm only now starting my coffee.""

""Jake. open the newspaper to page 31.""

""Why, what's in the paper?""

""Jake, get the paper and open it to page 31 NOW!""

""Ok, Ok, I've got the paper here, so what's in page 31?""

There was this guy who had a huge dick, and all the girls loved him. But there was only one problem. He spoke in a high pitched voice. So he goes to the doctor and tells him.

*Hey doc, how can I get my voice to sound normal?*

The doc says, ""That's easy. All I have to do is cut off a few inches of your dick and you'll be good.""

The guy thinks about it for a minute, then says *Fuck it, let's go*.

Once he gets out of surgery and starts talking, he hears that his voice is normal.

""Thanks doc! I sound normal now!""

So, a few months go by, and he notices that all the girls who once fell head over heels for him are no longer interested. His friend goes to him and tells him, ""Look, just go back to the doctor and tell him to undo that surgery, then the girls will all come back."" 

He does just that, asking the doctor, ""I want you do make me how I was before.""

The doc shakes his head and responds, ""*It's impossible, once you've had the surgery, you can't go back.*""",The cost of a little extra.,26

“Roberto, how did you get those black eyes?”


“Well Juan, you know how I’ve been attending that new church?  Two Sundays ago I went to service and there was a beautiful behemoth of a woman sitting in the pew in front of me wearing a very nice sun dress.  Everything was going normally. The pastor told us to stand up, we stood up.  He told us to sit down, we sat down.  After 20 minutes he told us to stand up and I noticed that the women’s dress had worked its way into her ass crack.  Being the thoughtful guy I am, I casually reached over and plucked her dress from the crevasse it had become lodged in.  As soon as she felt her dress move, the woman turned around and punched me right in the eye!”


“Ouch!” said Juan. “That must have hurt! But how did you come by the second black eye?”


“Well Juan, the very next Sunday I returned to church.  This time I took my cousin Manny with me.  Sure enough, the same woman was sitting directly in front of us.  I promised myself that no matter what happened I was not going to let last week’s incident happen again.  The pastor told us to stand up, we stood up.  He told us to sit down, we sat down.  After some time he told us to stand up and sure enough that women’s dress had migrated back into her ass crack.  Before I could say anything my cousin Manny reached up and plucked the dress from its prison!  Quick as lightning I extended my hand and shoved that dress right back where it came from, shouting ‘Put it back in!’”


“Roberto, I need to find a new church. I’m not allowed back there anymore.”

I pray for a man who's not a creep,

One who thinks before he speaks,

I pray he's rich and self-employed,
And when I spend, won't be annoyed.
Pull out my chair and hold my hand..
Massage my feet and help me stand.
Oh send a king to make me queen.
A man who loves to cook and clean.
I pray this man will love no other.
And relish visits with my mother.

So one day in a small Arkansas town, the Town Hall caught fire. Everyone in town was grabbing buckets of water and trying to put it out, but it was to far gone.

After almost giving up the townsfolk heard the sound of a fire truck! They jumped for joy as they saw it flashing its lights and driving fast down a hill. When the fire truck reached the Town Hall it crashed straight into the building, and they started to put the fire out from the inside.

After about 10 minutes they had done it, the fire was out. The mayor of the town congratulated the firemen and awarded them the key to the city and $10,000. The mayor then asked ""what are you going to do with your money"" and the fire chief replied ""well, the first thing we're gonna do it buy some new breaks for this stupid truck!""",The Arkansas Fire Department.,1

It's the bear's second turn for a wish. ""Well, I wish that all the bears in the next forest are female as well."" 

The rabbit asked for a motorcycle and immediately hopped on it and roared the engine. The bear is shocked that the rabbit is asking for such idiotic items, because after all, he could have asked for money and bought the bike.

The bear snarls, “Did you just shoot at me?”
   
“Uhhh, yeah.”
    
“Alright, now you gotta blow me.”
    
What can Ivan do? It’s suck bear cock or be ripped apart and devoured. So, he holds his breath and blows the bear. He licks and sucks for what feels like hours. At last, the bear grunts, spooges all over Ivan’s face, taps him on the shoulder appreciatively, and ambles away contented.
    
The next week, Ivan goes to the black market, buys a Kalashnikov assault rifle, and goes hunting again. Soon he comes across enormous bear tracks. He follows them for a couple of hours till he comes across the same brobdingnagian bear. He switches the selector to full auto, takes careful aim, and pulls the trigger.

“Uhhh, yeah.”

At long last, he grunts, spooges all over Ivan’s backside, taps him on the shoulder appreciatively, and ambles away contented.
    
Now, Ivan is really mad. The next week, he travels to an obscure ex-Soviet republic and buys himself a shoulder-mounted SAM-20 missile. He’s going to kill that infamous bear once and for all, no matter what it takes. He returns to the woods and tracks the bear. He aims the missile and launches it at the ursine degenerate.
    
**BOOOOOOOM!!!** The bear drops. Ivan sprints towards it… no bear. A tap on his shoulder. Yep, it’s the bear.
    
The bear sticks his paw in his mouth and blows a shrill whistle. At once, four other bears converge upon the hapless hunter. They pant and grunt as they amble towards him. Their beady eyes radiate with a lewd glare. Their monstrous leader stares at Ivan and drawls,

Zade was always last for everything due to his name.  Everything always seemed to run out before Zade received his portion.  Schoolbooks, supplies, food rations.  Disappointed, Zade joined the military out of high school thinking that he would be treated equally by the armed forces.  


Once he arrived at basic training things did not go as planned. He went to the rifle range on his first day.  His drill sergeant told him, “Sorry Zazinski, we’ve run out of rifles. You’ll just have to pretend out there.” Since Zade had so much practice at making due with what he had, he went with it.  Zade stepped up to the firing line, held an imaginary rifle up and said, “Bang. Bang. Bang.”   The next day he received a certificate for good marksmanship.


The following day’s training consisted of learning how to use a bayonet.  Again, the drill sergeant said, “Sorry Zazinski. We’ve run out of bayonets, you’ll just have to pretend.”  So again, Zade stepped up to the hanging dummy and screamed “Stab. Stab. Stab.” The next day he received commendations for good bayonetsmanship.


On the third day the group headed to the grenade range.  Again the drill sergeant said, “Zazinski, we have no more grenades. You’ll just have to pretend out there.”  So Zade threw imaginary grenades while making explosion sounds, “Brooosh. Kerpow. Shblaam.” The next day he received high honors for good grenade throwing.


Soon after, Zade was deployed to war.  With the honors he received at basic, Zazinski hoped he would be the dependable soldier they needed on the warfront.  Deep down he knew it would happen, but Zazinski was still disappointed to learn that there was not enough equipment to go around.  Again he was told to just pretend.  


Zade is sent to the front lines.  He sees the enemy soldiers in the distance.  Grabbing his rifle, Zade took aim and said, “Bang. Bang. Bang.” Three enemy soldiers fell over dead.  


As they advanced further, Zade pulled the fake pins from his faux grenades and lobbed them at the enemy saying, “Broosh. Kerpow. Shblaam.” Giant explosions tore through the enemy, killing at least 20 combatants.  


Soon the enemy was close enough to require close combat.  Once again, Zade reacted by attaching his bayonet and screaming, “Stab. Stab. Stab.”  Anyone who got close fell with knife wounds in their bodies.


Zade continued to use his fake weaponry to decimate the battlefield.  Shouts of “Bang, Stab, Broosh,” echoed across the wasteland that was the warzone.  Enemy soldiers fell left and right.  It seemed that no one was safe from the onslaught of Zazinski.  Casualties piled up until finally, there were only two people left; Zazinski, and an enemy soldier who marched directly at him.


“Bang. Bang. Bang.” said Zade, but nothing happened.



“Broosh. Kerpow. Shblaam.” Again, nothing.



Soon the enemy was within bayonet range.



“Stab. Stab. Stab.” 



Nothing.



With a look of disbelief Zazinski fell underneath the relentless forward march of the enemy soldier.



Zade had just enough time to look the soldier over, noticing the name tag reading ‘Zembrowski,’ and to hear the final words of his life spoken by the enemy:


“Tank. Tank. Tank.”

One day, God decides to look down on Hell to see how his grand design is working out and notices that everyone is happy and enjoying umbrella drinks. He asks the Devil what's up?

The Devil says, ""Things are great down here since you sent us an engineer.""

""What?"" says God. ""An engineer? I didn't send you one of those. That must have been a mistake. Send him upstairs immediately.""

The Devil responds, ""No way. We want to keep our engineer. We like him.""

God demands, ""If you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue!""

He strikes up a conversation and eventually asks the hooker; “How much do you charge?”

“It starts at $500 for a hand-job,” replies the hooker.

“$500 dollars? For a hand-job?” says the guy “No hand-job is worth that kind of money!”

So the hooker says, “Do you see that Denny’s on the corner?”

“Yes.”

“Do you see the Denny’s about a block further down?”

“Yes.”

“And beyond that, do you see that third Denny’s?”

“Yes.”

“Well,” says the hooker, smiling invitingly, “I own those. And, I own them because I give a hand-job that’s worth $500.”

The guy thinks to himself, “What the hell? You only live once. I’ll give it a try.” and accepts the hooker’s offer. They retire to a nearby motel. A short time later, the guy is sitting on the bed realising that he just experienced the hand-job of a lifetime, worth every bit of $500. He is so amazed, he says, “I suppose a blow-job is $1,000?”

“$1,500″ says the hooker

“I wouldn’t pay that for a blow-job!” he says

The hooker replies, “Step over here to the window, big boy. Do you see that casino just across the street? I own that casino outright. And I own it because I give a blow-job that’s worth every cent of $1,500.”

The guy, basking in the afterglow of that terrific hand-job, decides to put off the new car for another year or so, and says, “OK Sign me up.”

Ten minutes later, he is sitting on the bed more amazed than before. He can scarcely believe it, but he feels he truly got his money’s worth. He decides to dip into the retirement savings for one glorious and unforgettable experience. He asks the hooker, “How much for some pussy?”

The hooker says, “Come over here to the window, I want to show you something. Do you see how the whole city of Las Vegas is laid out before us, all those beautiful lights, gambling palaces, and showplaces?”

“Damn!” the guy says, in awe, “You own the whole city?”

“Nope,” says the hooker, “but I would if I had a pussy.”

Clerk: Well, sir, that all depends on quite a lot of things.

Customer: Can you give me a guess? Is there an average price?

Clerk: Our lowest price is $12 a gallon, and we have 60 differentprices up to $200 a gallon.

Customer: What's the difference in the paint?

Clerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint.

Customer: Well, then I'd like some of that $12 paint.

Clerk: When do you intend to use the paint?

Customer: I want to paint tomorrow. It's my day off.

Clerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint.

Customer: When would I have to paint to get the $12 paint?

Clerk: You would have to start very late at night in about 3weeks. But you will have to agree to start painting before Friday of thatweek and continue painting until at least Sunday.

Customer: You've got to be *...%^#@* kidding!

Clerk: I'll check and see if we have any paint available.

Customer: You have shelves FULL of paint! I can see it!

Clerk: But it doesn't mean that we have paint available. We sellonly a certain number of gallons on any given weekend. Oh, and by theway, the price per gallon just went to $16. We don't have any more $12paint.

Customer: The price went up as we were talking?

Clerk: Yes, sir. We change the prices and rules hundreds oftimes a day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with yourpaint yet, we just decided to change. I suggest you purchase your paint assoon as possible. How many gallons do you want?

Customer: Well, maybe five gallons. Make that six, so I'll haveenough.

Clerk: Oh no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy paint and don'tuse it, there are penalties and possible confiscation of the paint youalready have.

Customer: WHAT?

Clerk: We can sell enough paint to do your kitchen, bathroom,hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you do thebedroom, you will lose your remaining gallons of paint.

Customer: What does it matter whether I use all the paint? IAlready paid you for it!

Clerk: We make plans based upon the idea thatall our paint is used, every drop. If you don't, it causes us all sorts ofproblems.

Customer: This is crazy!! I suppose something terrible happensif I don't keep painting until after Saturday night!

Clerk: Oh yes! Every gallonyou bought automatically becomes the $200 paint.

Customer: But what are all these ""Paint on sale from $10 alitre"" signs?

Clerk: Well that's for our budget paint. It only comes in half-gallons. One $5 half-gallon will do half a room. The second half-gallon tocomplete the room is $20. None of the cans have labels,some are empty and there are norefunds, even on the empty cans.

Customer: I can't believe this! I'll buy what I need somewhereelse!

Clerk: I don't think so, sir. You may be able to buy paint forYour bathroom and bedrooms, and your kitchen and dining room fromsomeone else, but you won't be able to paint your connecting hall and stairwayfrom anyone but us. And I should point out, sir, that if you paint in onlyone direction, it will be $300 a gallon.

Customer: I thought your most expensive paint was $200!

Clerk: That's if you paint around the room to the point at whichYou started. A hallway is different.

Customer: And if I buy $200 paint for the hall, but only paintin one direction, you'll confiscate the remaining paint.

Clerk: No, we'll charge you an extra use fee plus the differenceon your next gallon of paint. But I believe you're getting it now, sir.

Customer: You're insane!

Clerk: Thanks for painting with United.",If airlines sold paint (from Car Talk),197

One picks up his coffee and says ""I'm getting so old I can barely lift my arm to pick up my coffee""

Someone sitting next to him says, ""My cataracts is so bad I can barely see my coffee.""

Someone behind them then says, ""I can't even turn my head anymore"" and everyone in the room nods in agreement.

The optimist among them then says, ""Hey its not so bad, at least we all still have our drivers license.""

Extra backstory: I went to Church with my grandparents today, and my grandpa wanted to drive. He is 77 years old and an awful driver. It takes both my grandparents to drive. My grandpa steers and my grandma sits in the back to tell him when he can switch lanes, back up, anything like that (because he can't turn his head). He also doesn't observe speed limit signs. He doesn't drive fast, its just whatever the speed limit is he cruises around 25mph. The road to my church has a speed limit of 40. His response while driving? ""Hm looks like we're holding up traffic a bit, Granny! can I get over?"" *merges before she answers* Needless to say, God was with us on the drive there and back.",My Pastor told me this one and it really hit home...,11

An American, a Canadian and a Scotsman get into a car accident... and they all fuckin die. Just like that. BOOM. Dead. No survivors.
Seeing as they all died at the exact same moment, they all arrive at the Pearly Gates together.
They all walk up to St. Peter to see what deal is on getting into heaven... St. Peter sayeth unto them, ""I can tell by the looks of yas that you're all sinners... but we seem to be having some sort of malfunction with our registry, so for 50 units of each of your currency respectively, we'll just let you in.""
The American, knowing a good deal when he hears it, opens his wallet and hands a crisp $50 bill to St. Peter without hesitation. St. Peter thanks the man and pulls the lever to let him through the gates.
The American can't believe his luck. He's struttin through Heaven with a big shit-eating grin on his face, waiving at all the angels and familiar faces... and after several minutes, he realizes his friends who died with him are nowhere to be found. Concerned, he inquires to an angel about his friend's whereabouts.
""The last I heard,"" sayeth the angel unto him, ""the Canadian was trying to get his government to pay his fee, and the Scotsman was still hagglin the price.""

Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs.

She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids . 

'That's nice', she thinks, 'but I want more.'

So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.

'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'

Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.

The first floor has wives that love sex.

When Bill and Hillary first got married Bill said, ""I put a box under the bed. Promise me you will never to look in it."" In all their 30 years of marriage, Hillary never looked. On the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In it were 3 empty beer cans and $81,874.25 in cash. 

  
She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there was such a box and with those contents. That evening, they were out for a special anniversary dinner. After dinner, Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, “I'm so sorry, Bill. For all these years, I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know, why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?” 
  

Bill thought for a while and said, ""I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you, I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.” Hillary was shocked, but thought, ""Hmmm, Jennifer, Paula and Monica. And since I know he is addicted to sex, three times is not too bad.” 

 
She said, ”OK Bill, I guess I can forgive you.” Bill thanked her for being so understanding. They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Hillary asked Bill, ""So why do you have all that money in the box?” 
  

He answered, ""Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the recycling center.""

	""Crunch bird, desk!"" the salesman says, pointing at a nearby desk. Once again, the bird aims straight for it, and turns it to dust in a matter of seconds.  
	""I'll take him!"" the woman says.   
	He tells her it's not for sale, but she begs and tells him money is no object. Finally put in a corner, he accepts her offer, and she takes the bird home.

John decides to rent a big hall and invite the entire group.  
To break the ice, and to get the therapy started, John decides to ask a show of hands how often the attendees had sex. He first asks for a show of hands of all the people who had sex almost every night. A modest number of hands were raised. He then asks, how many had sex once a week? This time a larger number of hands were raised. John then asks how many had sex once or twice a month? Again a few hands were raised.  
After John polled his group several more times he noticed one guy sitting off to the side with this huge beaming grin on his face. John noticed that the guy never raised his hand, so he asked him how often he had sex. The guy said, “Once a year!” To John's dismay, he responds, “Why are you so happy getting sex only once a year?”  

The grinning guy responds, ""Tonight’s the night!""",John just graduated from clinical psychology,0
post,39pacw,2qh72,jokes,false,1434199814,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/39pacw/the_longest_joke_once_again/,self.jokes,,"In occasional fits of self-evaluation, John used to take pride in living a very boring life. That, to him back then, was a good thing -- after all, the Chinese wish interesting lives on others as a curse. A boring life meant that everything proceeded the way that he liked. No accidents, no oddities, no distractions. No fun, but that's the cost of safety and security.
 
As a child, John never got in a serious accident as a child (except for that time he fell off slide the wrong way, but he landed on a soft spot so that doesn't count). His adolescence was pretty temperate. He even managed not to embarrass himself scarringly in public. After that, he went to a state college, from which he graduated after four years. Then, he got a job offer from a pretty standard company where Dilbert was popular. If this went on for longer, he would have found a lovely (but not -too- lovely) lady to marry and then die surrounded by grandchildren.
 
One day, though, John felt like going to the desert.
 
The idea just struck him on a rather unspecific Friday. On the way to work, John thought to himself, ""After work, I should get an SUV so I can go off-roading."" At work, John thought about the dunes and the winds. On the way from work, John thought about how he has never seen a real desert before. That was very frustrating, so it made buying the most desert-like SUV he could find on a whim easier.
 
John woke up early the next morning. He had a light meal of cereal and strawberries for breakfast. Then he hopped on his new SUV and drove east. Just... east. The highway should take him to a desert in the east, John thought. He fiddled with the audio system a little and tried to find a radio station to listen to. But, no -- the music only distracted him from the excitement he was fermenting in right now. This was an emotion of rare intensity (considering how plaid his life has been), so logically he should savor it to the fullest.
 
With the sun at its zenith, John began to notice the dunes in the distance and the clear, blue sky above them. All inhibition was gone -- he pressed on the gas pedal and the SUV ran at very slightly above the speed limit. He just... had to get there, and feel his car wade through the sand and rocks. There must be so many sights in the wastes to see. He might even run across a saguaro. Ah, damn, he should have brought a camera and someone to take a picture of him next to the tallest saguaro he could find. And before John even realized it himself, he was off the road for the first time.
 
He had a blast. The desert was so different from the city or the beach. Everything felt pure and rarefied there, as if all the dross had been burnt away by the sun's heat. Speaking of which, the sun was blazing hot. Even with the AC at full power, John could feel the desert heat, and the tan that the sun through the window was giving. Anyways, it was probably the first time John went ""crazy"". The sensation of losing control just by a little bit overwhelmed him. The rough terrain rocked him uncomfortably, but he far preferred it to the certain comfort of the office chair. Every once in a he worried if the SUV was going to flip -- but then, it didn't. It gave him a jolt like nothing else. He has never done any hard drugs before, but it must be nothing like off-roading in the desert. Exploring virgin, untrodden sand felt like a series of small conquests. Venturing where no man has gone before, freely going wherever he wan----
 
And then, a blink and a beep.
 
Out of gas.
 
...
 
With a plastic bottle in each hand, John waded through the sand trying to swallow him whole. It was so hard to maintain balance, with the ground shifting and sinking with each footstep. The scorching evening sun didn't help, either. The desert sun at noon must have been more painful, but at least it didn't get in your eye. John had been following the sun for a few hours now. At first, he tried to backtrack, but the tracks had already been erased by the desert wind. ""The desert is to the east,"" John thought, ""so I should go west.""
 
John had already drunk half the bottle of water by the time the sun set. This was pretty bad, because when he got out of the car he expected for the bottle to last at least until tomorrow late afternoon. ""It will be even hotter at noon tomorrow,"" John thought to himself again. ""I'm fucked.""
 
The night cold of the desert gave such a hateful contrast to the day heat. He had heard that it's cold at night in deserts, but John didn't think it would be -this- cold. He was freezing, for God's sake. And it's so arid. John hugged himself even tighter to keep himself warm, next to the tallest saguaro he has ever seen. He thought about getting into the sand to protect himself from the cold, but then sand would get in all of his clothes and he would be annoyed to death tomorrow. He also thought about crying, but he fell unconscious before he could make the decision.
 
The next morning, John once again considered crying, because he must have lost the good bottle over the night. Either the wind took it or it sank into the sand somewhere. Maybe the devil took it, he doesn't know. John looked at the only bottle he has left now -- the bottle with pale blue liquid in it. He has heard that they use water and denatured ethanol in windshield washer fluids and, while it would burn, it would at least quench the thirst. It will probably taste like the worst thing ever, but that's preferable to being mummified alive.
 
The sun was at its zenith when John worked up the courage to try drinking the windshield washer. He kept seeing an oasis in a distance, but it kept running away -- so he concluded that he has begun hallucinating from the heat and the thirst. Might as well try this out anyway, and... Jesus Christ, it tasted like murder. The fluid stabbed at John's dry throat and burned it, like vodka distilled from hate. The pain faded away after a few seconds. Thankfully, his throat wasn't as dry anymore. John resumed to soldier forth.
 
...
 
Why did he listen to the horse? He should have walked -away- from the morning sun, because the sun rises from the east. Thanks to the stupid animal, John was walking the wrong way for half a day. But most importantly -- where did this horse come from?
 
...
 
The sun was setting. John had trouble understanding his own gibberish anymore. It also might have been getting dark faster than is usual for summer, because everything was so hard to see. He drank the last gulp of the windwasher fluid and tossed the bottle away (John would usually not litter). Then he collapsed onto his knees, sinking a little bit into the dune. It's so hard to walk anymore, but crawling was really easy. John fondly regarded his childhood. As the sand cooked his hands and legs, John's life began to play out in his hazy mind like a VHS tape that's been too close to a magnet. ""Life was pretty boring, wasn't it?,"" John's brain stringed together some words. ""Getting into a fight once might have been fun."" All the things he couldn't do, all the regret came in like a tsunami and swept away all hopes for escape. He decided to cry, but he couldn't. He tried wailing, but only dry gasp came out of his throat.
 
John became afraid of death, but then he felt the cold marble floor beneath him.
 
""You look like death,"" a voice said. John looked up, but he could only see black and red spots against a field of dark brown felt. ""You should find help before the cold kills you.""
 
Even in his delirium, John could tell that this must not be real. For one, the voice was too beautiful. Had angels been real, the voice must have belonged to one. But no matter, he just didn't want to die.
 
""I don't want to die.""
 
""Is that a wish?"" the voice replied, now with a tone of definite curiosity. ""I mean, I can help you with that if you so wish. But you have to pay a price. With this contract you mus--""
 
""Just help me.""
 
""Okay, we have a deal,"" said the voice. And then John felt a pair of fangs spear into his throat.
 
...
 
There were so many stars in the night sky. One usually thinks that night is dark, but with so many stars, the night sky was actually bright. Lying with his back against the marble floor (surprisingly comfortable, actually), John tried to trace as many constellations as he could from memory for a few minutes.
 
""Are you feeling better now?,"" a sort-of familiar voice was heard from outside the vision, with concern. ""I broke a few rules, but, you know, I just didn't want to deal with someone dying right in front of me.""
 
John bolted up to see what the fuck just happened right there. He surprised himself -- it was so easy. Not compared to how he was near death, but to how he usually is. Not only that, he felt wonderful.
 
He turned around to see a snake with red eyes. A very large snake with burning red eyes.
 
It took a few seconds for John to assess the situation. And then he said -- ""Thank you... for saving my life.""
 
The snake slithered across the air to get close to John, its tongue feeling the air to smell how he was now. ""No need to thank me, it's all a part of work. Anyways, are you feeling better now?"" 
 
""Yeah. Better than ever, actually."" John tried to figure out exactly what made him feel better. Whatever happened, he now felt more... vigorous, energetic and... unburdened? As if a life-long chain has been lifted. ""What did you do?""
 
""Oh, you know. Granted a wish and all that."" John could have sworn that the snake grinned widely. ""When you came here, you were dying from methanol poisoning. So I detox'd you. You were also very thirsty, so I took care of that. But most importantly, there was a small cancer growing in your liver.""
 
The snake uncoiled itself from a... stick, that emerged from at the center of a very ornately engraved circular white marble floor. As it slithered around the perimeter, the spilt sand was swept away. Apparently it was cleaning the floor. It also showed that the snake must have been at least fifteen yards in length. ""Though, to clarify: you asked for not to die, but that wish is against the rules. So... I gave it a liberal interpretation. So you will not die -for a while-. I made you very healthy, so you probably won't have trouble living to be 120 years old."" The snake nodded its head. ""As long as you don't get yourself killed, you know. It seems like you do stuff like this often.""
 
John shook his head in denial. ""No, this is my first time. And... rules?,"" he questioned. ""Are you some kind of a genie? Or are you the Devil?""
 
The snake made some kind of sound that probably equated to snakes laughing. ""Oh, it never gets old. No, I'm not a genie and I'm not the Devil. I'm just a fallen angel."" It coiled itself against the stick and looked right into John's eyes. The fiery eyes flared like twin suns and rays of starlight descended from the sky to shine in the shape of ephemeral wings on the back. The voice, it suffocated the sound of desert silence and quaked the very space itself. ""I am Nathaniel, the seraph.""
 
""I am John,"" the mortal introduced himself. ""...the office drone.""
 
The fires died out, the lights turned to normal and the rolling sound of silence returned. ""So, yeah. No need to be scared or anything,"" Nathaniel seemed to grin as he spoke. ""I'm just... here doing my job. Speaking of which.""
 
The angel cleared his throat before elaborating on the ""rules"": ""Ok, God sent me here to hire someone for a task. It's a very important and difficult job, so the compensation for it is pretty good. Those who accept the job are given three wishes. These wishes can be anything, as long as you really, actually and truly want it and as long as it doesn't trespass God's authority. And, no, I'm not one of those asshole spirits that twist the wishes or give them literally. God's the one doing the work, so I don't need to be stringent or anything. Your first wish has been fulfilled. You have two wishes left. Be very careful and deliberate for those two, because they have to compensate for the duty you've been given.""
 
""What's my duty?"" John asked, dumbstruck and unable to believe.
 
Nathaniel looked away a little, as if he felt uncomfortable breaking the news. ""Well, ok. John. I'll put this very simply this time. Your duty is to end the world.""
 
Awkward silence followed. Nathaniel seemed to brace for an inevitable tirade. John, to the contrary, was at complete loss for words. The mortal occasionally opened his mouth to say something, perhaps in protest or in confusion, but then he closed it again. He would try again when he felt he had processed the situation sufficiently, but no -- he was wrong. At least for a few minutes.
 
And, eventually. ""So... My job is to end the world.""
 
""Yes.""
 
""Why? And how? And when?""
 
""Well, ok. It's kinda convoluted. And you are handling this very maturely right now, by the way."" Nathaniel coughed softly before continuing. ""As for why... Hm. Imagine that you are making a perpetual motion machine. Once you get it going, it keeps going. Maybe it goes faster and faster if you are good enough at making machines, I don't know. Anyways, when it goes too fast, it's dangerous to stop it from outside. It would hurt if your finger got jammed between the gears, right? So... God made a self-termination switch."" Nathaniel unwound himself from the stick. ""This right here is the switch. God put it here so someone can stop the world from the inside if it becomes necessary.
 
""And now, as for how... It's simple. You -- and only you -- can move this staff. If you push it, pull it, or in any other way disturb it, everything dies. Nothing gets left behind. Nada. Nil. Zilch. Once you do it, it's done."" Nathaniel gestured his tail across his throat. ""It's really easy, but it's total and it's irreversible. That's why it's so hard.""
 
John listened attentively, though he took it only three-quarters-seriously. After all, a talking snake?
 
""Hm. Ok, last question. When... is up to you."" Had Nathaniel been human, a look of doubt and fear would have come across his face. Sadly, he was still a snake. ""It's your job to determine when the world will end. Now that you have been chosen, I can't stop you from deciding when. Even if you try to pull the plug on the world because you got dumped by your girl... well, they say 'significant other' now, don't they? Well, by your significant other, I'm not allowed to stop you in any way or spirit. But I can ask you to be very deliberate. Please, please be very deliberate."" The snake gazed at the human intently. ""There is so much to this world that I haven't seen yet and I would like to learn more about it before it ends.""
 
Nathaniel stopped to speak for a short while. Assuming that he has finished explaining, John brought his right hand to his chin to help him consider the situation. It all was very confusing. Before this day, John didn't believe in God. And, if anything, he wasn't believing in God more at this point. Why would God do this sort of thing? It's all very absurd.
 
But, from the deep of his soul, John could feel that he was given a very, very serious duty.
 
""Why was I chosen?""
 
""You... uh... found me."" Nathaniel shifted his focus away from John, as if he was taken by a sense of inadequacy. ""Long before I had criteria for selecting people for this job, but they were all lousy at it. After a while, I decided to not have any at all."" The snake sighed. ""I think it's been working out greatly. Somehow random people are more emotionally stable than prophesied legendary heroes.""
 
""What if I don't want to do it?""
 
""It's too late.""
 
""Can I wish not to have to do this?""
 
Nathaniel sighed. ""No, that's infringing on God's authority, so it's against the rules. You -have- to do it, John. And I'm pretty sure you will be good at it.""
 
""How do you know that?"" John accused the angel of empty words of comfort.
 
""I have been talking to you for a good while now, haven't I?"" The snake's facial muscles did their best to smile. ""After a few billion years, you learn how to read people.""
 
It seemed that John wanted to argue with that, but only silence followed for a moment.
 
""This is a stupid job.""
 
""It pays well.""
 
...
 
On the circle, the night air felt cool rather than cold. Waiting for dawn's light, John watched the stars trace the globe of the sky once he ran out of things to ask Nathaniel about. Well, he was curious if he was actually an angel and, if he was, what it is like to be an angel.
 
But that all felt improper.
 
John found the morning star when the skirt of the sky began to grow yellow, pink and red. In minutes, it would be bright again. He would have to find a way to get back home from here. Perhaps continuing going west is the best course of action--
 
""If you walk south from here for about three hours, you will find a highway. Go eastbound and there will be a small town. If you tell them that you got lost while off-roading, they will help you out,"" Nathaniel interrupted John's train of thought. ""And you must be hungry, right? Here, have something to eat before you head out.""
 
A plate consisting of a loaf of bread, a chunk of cheese and a mug of wine sat on the marble floor.
 
""Thanks, but where did you get this?""
 
""Heaven.""
 
...
 
John dusted his pants one more time. As he stepped outside the border of the marble circle, he could feel the sun grow a thousand times more fierce.
 
""Uh, hey, Nate,"" John said hesitantly. ""Do you mind if I come back later for the other two wishes? I can't think of anything good right now.""
 
""Call me Nathaniel. And it's ok, that's what most people do when they don't feel like asking for money.""
 
""People seriously ask for money?"" John asked in surprise at the banality.
 
""Well, I know what you mean. I think it's odd when people ask for money over... true love, or peace, or anything like that. I asked a few why.""
 
""What did they say?""
 
""'You are too young to understand'. Which is kind of funny, because, you know, billions of years old,"" the snake seemed to smirk. ""But they probably meant that I'm not close enough to death to understand.""
 
John seemed clearly unsatisfied at the answer or the extrapolation. ""I still don't get it. It'd be nice to understand what they meant. Perhaps I'll ask for that when I come back later. To understand what other people are saying.""
 
Nathaniel's tongue licked the air a few times. ""That would be interesting. I don't think anyone has asked for that before. Do you want that wish granted now?""
 
John hesitated for a moment.
 
""Nah. I need a reason to come back here for.""
 
With that, John smiled brightly at Nathaniel, and walked south.
 
...
 
After that weekend, John's life seemed to return to normal. The snake stopped appearing in his dreams after a week or so and he eventually forgot that he doesn't need health check-ups anymore in three months' time. It was boring again. Very stable, but boring.
 
A year since meeting Nathaniel, John got mugged.
 
""Give me all you got, bitch, or I'll blow up your head,"" the barrel of the gun said.
 
John reached for his back pocket and produced an old, light brown wallet. Calmly, he handed it to the mugger, wondering: ""Why do you want this?""
 
The barrel dropped. The dumbfounded face behind it asked if John was fucking serious.
 
After that encounter, John remembered that wish he wanted granted.
 
...
 
This time, John drew a map. He learned from the Internet how to prepare for desert exploration. Over a period of a month, he gathered the tools and gears needed to save him the pain. Learning how to locate himself using the stars would have been useful, but that's too much work; he'll just bet on his luck on that. With a rental SUV, he drove his way to the small village to the southeast and, from there, carefully trekked up north with a pair of binoculars. He started his search in the morning and found Nathaniel by mid-afternoon.
 
""What's up?"" the angel asked.
 
""I got mugged,"" John answered.
 
""Ah, damn. Did you get hurt?"" A tone of worry and concern colored Nathaniel's voice.
 
""No, but it helped me remember something."" John spoke very evenly. Perhaps he wanted to come off unconcerned?
 
""Nearly dying once?""
 
""Huh."" John amusedly reviewed the situation, now and back then. ""Maybe. I should hire a psychoanalyst.""
 
""Freudians are a bunch of quacks. And they are very expensive,"" dismissed Nathaniel.
 
John replied with a smile. ""It's fun, though.""
 
The conversation broke for about ten seconds; a period during which desert gust blew across the landscape.
 
""Hey, Nate.""
 
""Call me Nathaniel. And time to pull the plug?"" The angel put on a very as-a-matter-of-factly attitude.
 
""Um."" John put his right hand on his chin to help him consider the proposition, but: ""No, not today.""
 
Nathaniel breathed a sigh of relief.
 
""I actually came back for my second wish.""
 
""I would have preferred if you came for friendship.""
 
It broke for another time; during this period, a desert creature cried out in the far back.
 
""You think of me as a friend?"" John asked with honest awe.
 
""Anybody's your friend when your neighbors are rocks and cacti."" The snake clicked his tongue. ""I don't have that many people to talk to, being bound here and all.""
 
""Really? You can't leave?""
 
""Well."" Nathaniel hesitated. ""I can leave... I think. Well, probably not. Anyways, if I do I might not see you come here and pull the lever. Then I won't be able to plug my ears.""
 
""I thought everyone just... died. Nothing loud.""
 
""Well, everyone just dies, yeah. In very big explosions.""
 
""You can't plug your ears. You don't have arms.""
 
""I can try.""
 
The sound of sands rolling down the dunes punctuated the conversation.
 
""I want you to grant me my second wish."" John demanded.
 
Excited to find out what John has in mind, Nathaniel eagerly questioned. ""Oh? What will it be this time?""
 
""I want to be able to understand people.""
 
The snake paused for a second, perhaps to discern whether it would be a good wish for John or not. In the end, he said: ""That is a very difficult wish to live with, you know that?""
 
""I figured so.""
 
""Well, no regrets.""
 
Nathaniel bit John.
 
...
 
When John woke up, the sun was setting. Stars could be faintly seen through the still-pale blue sky, and a pregnant moon was floating about as well. A shooting star burnt through the atmosphere, leaving a short trail, far away from John's focus when a curious voice was heard.
 
""Are you feeling better now?""
 
""Um. Yeah."" John reoriented himself. ""Thanks, Nate.""
 
""Call me Nathaniel.""
 
""Now that I think about it, do I annoy you when I call you Nate?"" John asked the angel, with sincerity.
 
""Well,"" Nathaniel considered the question. ""A little?""
 
""But that's how a friend would call you. Nathaniel is a mouthful.""
 
""Agreed on that. But, you know."" The angel paused for a second.
 
""What is it?""
 
Nathaniel slowly uncoiled himself from the switch and slithered toward the perimeter, dutifully. ""God gave me this name.""
 
The sound of Nathaniel's scales against the marble floor and the sand grains on it filled the air.
 
""I think I can understand that."" John admitted. ""I still don't believe in God, but I think I can understand that.""
 
The snake giggled. ""Is that because you learned how to understand me?""
 
""No. Actually, no, I don't think so."" John gripped his chin. ""At least, this isn't what I asked for.""
 
Nathaniel laughed.
 
...
 
John didn't bother sitting up that night. He just laid comfortably on his back and watched the stars, while chatting with Nathaniel about, in sum, everything about the world.
 
""Hey, you said you can't leave the circle, right? But you seem pretty up to date,"" John asked.
 
""Doves,"" answered Nathaniel. ""They drop by every once in a while.""
 
John finally asked the angel about whether he was really an angel or not. The answer was very elaborate -- Nathaniel was apparently very proud of the time before he fell. He explained what it is like to be in Heaven and in presence of God. It all sounded like some fantasy novel to John, but even then, it was the most interesting fantasy novel. Perhaps because it was being told in person, and by a very excited character?
 
""Hey, Nathaniel, I hope you don't mind me asking, but..."" John considered the true worth of bringing this up. ""Why did you fall""?
 
""Um. How do I put this?"" Nathaniel pondered for a second or so. ""I wanted to explore the world that God made more closely.""
 
""That's it?""
 
""I accidentally ended the dinosaurs.""
 
""Oh.""
 
Nathaniel asked if John liked to travel. John didn't, so he said no. When it was apparent that Nathaniel was disappointed (perhaps he wanted to hear travel stories), John explained that he wasn't a very adventurous person. He has never done anything out of ordinary in his life and he has grown too comfortable with it. Travelling explicitly means leaving one's comfort zone. John could never do that.
 
""But you came here,"" wondered Nathaniel.
 
""You are right.""
 
""Maybe this could be a first step.""
 
""I'll think about it.""
 
And then it was morning.
 
...
 
John promised to return soon when he left Nathaniel this time. He meant it -- after all, this might be a good way to break out of his routine. Furthermore, Nathaniel so badly wants to travel and explore but can't. To linger in the comfort zone forever would be an insult to a good friend.
 
And so John quit his office job and began to travel around the world, for a few years.
 
First, he went to India. Then Tibet, followed by Maghreb. He went to Europe, but did not go to Britain. Hungary was very enjoyable, even though he ran out of money there. John washed dishes and kicked people out of clubs for a few months -- he met many interesting people doing so. Once he's gathered enough money, he hopped on a boat back to America. Over the Atlantic, John finished his plans on walking across and around North America.
 
...
 
""I brought you books.""
 
""I thought you died.""
 
""Can you read?""
 
""You lied when you'd return soon.""
 
""Well.""
 
...
 
Back in his apartment, John tried to figure out his next course of action. He learned a lot in the last five years from all that travel and all that talk, he thought. Perhaps writing about the lessons might be a good idea.
 
...
 
""I brought you books.""
 
""Ooh! Did you bring yours, too?""
 
""What? Why would you need self-help books?""
 
""I have a lot of time to improve myself.""
 
""You've been like that for a few billion years.""
 
""Well.""
 
...
 
Sixty years since meeting Nathaniel, John got mugged.
 
""Give me all you got, bitch, or I'll blow up your head,"" the barrel of the gun said.
 
John reached for his back pocket and produced an old, light brown notepad. Calmly, he handed it to the mugger, saying: ""All I have is names and directions.""
 
The barrel dropped. The dumbfounded face behind it asked if John was fucking serious.
 
John remembered the last wish.
 
...
 
When John climbed the last dune to the marble circle, he noticed that Nathaniel brought someone for their monthly meeting. It was quite out of the ordinary, but no matter -- if a good friend wants to introduce him to them, then it must be good.
 
""What's up?"" The angel asked.
 
""I got mugged,"" John answered.
 
""Again?""
 
John shrugged, as if at a loss for a proper response. ""Well, this is the second time. At least that I remember.""
 
""Hm,"" Nathaniel reconsidered. ""It feels like yesterday for me.""
 
""So..."" John eyed the new guest.
 
""Ah, yes."" The big snake encircled the little snake and tightened in, probably affectionately. ""This is my daughter, John. I want you to meet her.""
 
The words brought a smile to John's face. He leaned down to be closer to the child. ""Hi. What's your name?""
 
""Call me Sarai.""
 
""My name is John."" Saying his, he offered his hand. ""It's very nice to meet you.""
 
The girl extended her tail and gripped onto the index finger. Will do for a handshake.
 
""Now that I've met such an adorable young girl,"" John mused, ""I can't pull the lever in front of her anymore.""
 
""Speaking of which...""
 
The unusual heaviness of Nathaniel's voice made John uncomfortable, and maybe a little queasy.
 
""Before that happens, old friend. Could you grant me a wish this time?""
 
...
 
First, they were going to ride across Canada and America. After that they will head down south, driving around South America by the Pacific and the Atlantic. It would be very nice if they could head to the Amazon, too, but it was doubtful that it had accommodations for an RV.
 
Sarai sat on John's right shoulder as they traveled. She would be so excited to see anything that isn't made of sand and rocks. It reminded John of himself back long ago, when he first came to the desert. It was so different. It might have been meaningless to someone who has always been there, but to outsiders, it's exotic and special. Perhaps this is why Nathaniel is so curious about the world -- he is an outsider to all but the tiny little circle in the desert. Everything is exotic and special to him.
 
The best he could do for him was to show the world to his child. When they have seen every thing there is to see in this world, Sarai will go home and tell her father all about it. Nathaniel might not be able to leave until the day he dies, but at least he would have explored the world vicariously. Little satisfactions.
 
...
 
""Hey, John, what should we tell him first about?"" Sarai asked John, on their way to the desert.
 
""I don't know, Sarai. What was the most fun for you?""
 
""Mmm."" The girl pondered. ""I liked the mountains. They were like the dunes, except really big and really tall.""
 
""Which mountains? We saw many of them, didn't we?""
 
""Ehhh. I can't remember them all.""
 
It's been six months since Nathaniel asked John to show Sarai the world. Before leaving for Africa, she wanted to see her father again. John agreed -- it might be years they might be spending there, this time. Furthermore, he couldn't wait for his third wish.
 
The road and the desert seemed different this time. Almost... like the first time. Sense of excitement and wonder. Was it because they couldn't wait to share their experience with Nathaniel? In any case, they had to see him as quickly as possible.
 
The RV crawled up the dunes rather slowly. It seemed to do so well everywhere else... But this was the last time they will be riding this thing. On the other hand, it was somewhat nostalgic for John. The imbalance on the sand. The uncomfortable rocking. The loss of control.
 
The loss of control.
 
""DADDY!!!"" The moment she spotted him down the dune, Sarai screamed from John's shoulder. He must have pressed either the brake or the gas pedal too hard. The wheels spun out of control in the sand. The weight of the RV slowly dragged it down the slope, gradually but surely accelerating as it goes. John tried to regain control, but it seemed too late.
 
And it was heading right onto the circle.
 
Nathaniel had already uncoiled himself from the lever, to see what's going on with the RV sliding down the dune. And then he realized -- it is John who is driving that thing... and it is in crash course with the switch that will end the world.
 
John noticed the very large snake bunch up between the falling vehicle and the switch. At the rate it's going, the RV will hit Nathaniel and flip. That surely would kill Nathaniel, but the alternative is the lever behind him. But can John live with himself after killing his oldest friend like this? If he can't live with that, then maybe it's better to swerve, so the lever instead of Nathaniel will be hit. Either way, John's world will have come to end.
 
And to think that John's last wish was for Nathaniel to be free from his duty so he can explore the world with them.
 
A mere second before impact.
 
John had to choose.

After walking several miles, the man comes upon a farm house with the lights on. He knocks on the door, and a man clad in dirty overalls answers. The man explains his situation, and asks if it would be possible to stay the night with the farmer until he could get his car fixed in the morning. The farmer explains that the town has but one auto shop, which will not be open again until Monday. He offers to let the stranger spend the weekend, under one condition: "" You are welcome to spend the weekend here. All I ask is that you keep your hands off my two daughters, Nelly and Venus"". The stranger agrees. The next night, Nelly comes to her father and asks permission to go on a date with the stranger. ""I suppose it will be okay"", the farmer says. ""You can use my truck, but no funny business"". That night, the man and Nelly load up in the farmers old beat up truck, drive a few miles down the road to a secluded spot, where he proceeds to bang her brains out. When they finished, they returned to the farm house and went to bed as if nothing had happened. The following night, Venus approaches her father with the same request, and the farmer gives her the same answer. ""I suppose its okay. You can use my truck, but no funny business"". That night, Venus and the stranger take off to the same secluded spot where he had taken Nelly the night before, where he proceeded to bang her brains out. Monday morning comes. The man gets his car fixed and returns to his home in the city. Once he arrives home, he decides to send the farmer some money to show his appreciation, so he writes a check and mails it to him. A couple of months go by, and the man receives an unexpected letter from the farmers address. Inside the envelope he finds a poem, which read as follows: ""Are you the one that done the pushin', and left those stains upon my cushion, and your footprints on my dashboard upside down? Cause since you dated my daughter Nelly, she's had some swelling in her belly. I think you'd better come on back to town"". The man was stunned, and unsure of what to do or how to respond. After some thought on the matter, he decides to try his own hand at poetry, so he mails the farmer the following poem: ""Yes I'm the one that did the pushin', and left the stains upon your cushion, and my footprints on your dashboard upside down. But since I dated your daughter Venus, I've had some burning in my penis, so I guess we're 50/50 all around.",The farmers daughters,2

 The day was really quite beautiful,

 Is giving birth more painful than getting kicked in the nuts?

 Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful 
 than a guy getting kicked in the nuts.


 Well, after another soda, and some heavy deductive thinking, 
 I have come up with the answer to that question.

 Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby; 
 and here is the reason for my conclusion.

 A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, 
 ""It might be nice to have another child.""

 On the other hand, you never hear a guy say, 
 ""You know, I think I would like another kick in the nuts.""
