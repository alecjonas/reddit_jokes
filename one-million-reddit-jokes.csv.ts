and plays golf every Saturday. 
His wife thinks he's pushing himself too hard, so for his birthday she takes him to a local strip club. 
The doorman at the club greets them and says, 'Hey, Bob! How ya doin?' 
His wife is puzzled and asks if he's been to this club before. 
'Oh no,' says Bob. 'He's in my bowling league. 

When they are seated, a waitress asks Bob if he'd like his usual and brings over a Budweiser. 
His wife is becoming increasingly uncomfortable and says, 
'How did she know that you drink Budweiser?'
'I recognize her, she's the waitress from the golf club. 
I always have a Bud at the end of the 1st nine, honey.' 

A stripper then comes over to their table, throws her arms around Bob, starts to rub herself all over him and says, 'Hi Bobby. Want your usual table dance, big boy?' 

Bob's wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club. 
Bob follows and spots her getting into a cab. 
Before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her. 
Bob tries desperately to explain how the stripper must have mistaken him for someone else, 
but his wife is having none of it. 
She is screaming at him at the top of her lungs, calling him every 4 letter word in the book. 

The cabby turns around and says, 
'Geez Bob, you picked up a real bitch this time.' 

EDIT: By request

Other times, he will walk away with a beautiful woman, both smiling.

One day the homeless man asks him what his secret is.  The man replies, ""Simple.  When I see a woman I like I say 'Tickle your ass with a feather?' If she is shocked and offended I'll claim to have said 'Typical nasty weather' and move on.  If she smiles and doesn't object, off we go""

The homeless man is amazed at this plan and insists on trying it out.  He waits for a nice looking young woman to stand at the corner, casually stumbles over to her and very loudly says ""Stick a feather up your ass?""  The woman is shocked and recoils from him ""WHAT?!?"" she says.  The homeless man replies ""Raining like a bitch, ain't it?""",It's all in the delivery.,2

Hi Bob,
This is Alan next door.
I’m sorry buddy, but I have a confession to make to you.
I've been riddled with guilt these past few months and have been trying to pluck up
the courage to tell you to your face, but I am at least now telling in text as I can’t live
with myself a moment longer without you knowing.
The truth is, I have been sharing your wife, day and night when you're not around.
In fact, probably more than you, particularly in the mornings after you've left for work.
I haven’t been getting it at home recently, but that's no excuse I know.
The temptation was just too much....
I can no longer live with the guilt and I hope you will accept my sincere apologies and forgive me.
I promise that it won't happen again.
Regards, Alan.

THE REACTION.
Bob, anguished and betrayed, immediately went into his bedroom, took out his gun,
and without a word, shot his wife twice, killing her instantly.
He then returned to the lounge, poured himself a stiff drink and sat down on the sofa.
He took out his phone to reply to his neighbour's text and saw he had another message.

THE SECOND TEXT MESSAGE .
Hi Bob,
This is Alan next door again.
Sorry about the slight typo on my last text, I expect you worked it out anyway, but as I’m sure you
noticed, my predictive text changed ‘WiFi’ To ‘Wife’.
Technology hey?!?
Hope you saw the funny side of that.

Regards, Alan.

He walk around until it becomes apparent he is alone on an island except for a pig and a dog, both of which are strangely domesticated. Oh well, time to Robinson Crusoe the shit out of this island. 

He starts a fire. Builds himself a hut. Starts a sizeable garden so he won't have to eat Ms. Oinky. 

Time passes. He starts ""getting lonely."" Manual release stops being quite so gratifying. Ms. Oinky starts to look a lot more attractive. He resists because it's wrong. It's disgusting. But in the end he couldn't resist. He walked up behind Ms. Oinky, feeling terrible about himself. He lowered his tattered pants...all of a sudden the dog went batshit crazy. It charged right at him barking and snapping. It was inches away from biting his dick. The guy runs away and the dog immediately calms back down. The guy damn near has a heart attack and decides to get back to the whole island survival thing. 

He makes some crude tools out of rocks. Digs an irrigation ditch for his garden. Starts work on a rudimentary still. 

But soon, he starts to feel urges again. His hands are rough and calloused, sore from long days of hard labor (and a lot of masturbation). Ms. Oinky starts looking good again. 

This time he plans it. He walks to the far side of the island with the dog. They play fetch for an hour. The dog finally collapses on the beach, having a happy dog nap. The man sneaks away back to where he left Ms. Oinky. He steps behind her. Lowers his pants. Closes his eyes and tries to remember what boobs look like. 

Then out of fucking nowhere that damn dog EXPLODES out of the bushes, barking his damn head off. The guy sets a new world record for pulling up pants. What the fuck is up with that dog?

The next day a plane crashes off the shore. It hit pretty hard, and none of the doors opened so the guy assumed there were no survivors. He decides to swim out to it and see if he can find anything worthwhile to salvage. Inside it's kind of dark, but somehow he stumbles onto an unconscious survivor. He swims them back to shore, and in the middle of CPR he notices the survivor is a woman, and she is HOT. Not just hot like any woman would be hot to a guy who's been trapped on a deserted island for months would be hot, like objectively gorgeous.

The babe coughs a couple of times and looks around. She grasps the situation pretty quickly and says some of the usual damsel in distress stuff, ""Oh my hero! you saved my life! I'll do anything to repay you."" 

The guy was kind of zoning out while staring at her --I mean, it's been awhile since he's seen anyone, let alone anyone so gorgeous-- but that last sentence snaps him back to reality. ""Wait,"" he replied, ""you'd do *anything*?""

She looks back at him seductively (well, as seductively and someone who was just damn near drowned could...which in her case was still pretty fucking seductive) and said ""Anything.""

He gave her another good long look. Then said, ""Great! Do me a favor and hold that dog!"" ",A man washes up on a deserted beach...,125

The male penguins then gather in a circle around the grave and sing:

As far as special equipment goes... well, it'll become obvious as you read.

Step zero is deciding upon a safeword. Or several, just in case.

1. Tie your partner/sub to a chair. Firmly, but be sure not to cut off bloodstream. Soft rope, long pieces of cloth or velcro restraints all work. Just keep scissors at hand to cut through the restraint if it is needed.

2. Gag their mouth. Clean cloth or actual ball-gag, doesn't matter.

3. Start smooth jazz and begin some gentle foreplay. 

4. After several minutes, take a break from that, grab their laptop and put it in front of them.

5. Start installing Windows Vista.

6. When the installation is finished, install McAfee Free Antivirus.

And that's all, folks!",A short guide to extreme BDSM,90

As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope
and listened to the duck's chest.


After a moment or two, the vet shook his head sadly and said, “I’m sorry, your duck Cuddles, has passed away.”

The distressed woman wailed, “Are you sure?”

“Yes, I am sure. The duck is dead,” replied the Vet.

“How can you be so sure?” she protested. “I mean you haven’t done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.”

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room.

He returned a few minutes later with a Labrador.

As the duck’s owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room.

A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, “I’m sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.”

The Vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.

The duck’s owner, still in shock, took the bill. “$3000!” she cried, “$3000 just to tell me my duck is dead!”

The vet shrugged, “I’m sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $100, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it’s now $3000.""",A woman brought a very limp duck...,324

Three Eskimos are arguing over who's igloo is coldest in the deepest part of winter.

The auditor said, ""Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I'm not sure the IRS finds that believable.""

""I'm a great gambler, and I can prove it,"" says Grandpa. ""How about a demonstration?""

The auditor thinks for a moment and said, ""Okay. Go ahead.""

Grandpa says, ""I'll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.""

The auditor thinks a moment and says, ""It's a bet.""

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor's jaw drops.

Grandpa says, ""Now, I'll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.""

Now the auditor can tell Grandpa isn't blind, so he takes the bet. Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye.

The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa's attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

""Want to go double or nothing?"" Grandpa asks. ""I'll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.""

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he ends up urinating all over the auditor's desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa's own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

""Are you okay?"" the auditor asks.

""Not really,"" says the attorney. ""This morning, when Grandpa told me he'd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you'd be happy about it!""",The IRS decides to audit Grandpa...,7

One day after a very long mass, the two priests decided to hit the showers, halfway through there showers the priests realized that there was no soap.

So, father Ray says to Father dick ""I have extra soap in my room, I'll go get some"".

So he leaves to fetch the soap and doesn't bother to get dressed because who would still be in the church at such a late hour? 
So he comes back from his room with two bars of soap and is walking down the hall when suddenly he hears voices coming around the corner, so with his quick thinking he froze to the wall, stiff as a statue.

The voices turned out to be that of three nuns, who, when saw him standing there like a statue stopped to look at and admire him complimenting at how realistic he looks and what a nice body he has.

When suddenly one of the nuns reaches out and grabbed his penis.

Startled, he dropped a bar of soap, with this the nun said ""Oh look, a soap dispenser""! 
Wanting to test the first nuns theory,the second nun reaches out and also grabs his penis, again he drops a bar of soap.

With this the nun says ""Yes it's true, it is a soap dispencer"".

Wanting to get her share of soap and excitement too, the third nun reaches out and grabs his penis.

But nothing happended for he was all out of soap, so she goes on yanking and pulling his penis for the next few minutes until, to her delight, she squeals ""Oh! Look, handcream!""",What's going on in the Vatican?,11

He eventually built a cabin, had a functioning automatic potable water supply, and all sorts of little clever commodities, all done to make her life easier... it was the most effort any man had ever done for her, and all the hard work made him fit, she noticed this...

One night after some wildlife attacked and he defended her succesfully, getting a few cuts in the process, she threw herself at him and they made love, after that, they where for all intents and purposes a couple with an above regular sex life.

But for some reason he started drifting away, something was bothering him. And she noticed... ""Whats wrong?"" Scarlett Johansson asked, ""Nothing..."" the guy would say...

She pestered him for a while eventually saying she would do ANYTHING he needed or wanted to make him feel good again, just because she really cared for him a lot, and even if he wasnt asking, she felt it was the least she owed it to him...

    ""Really?, youll do anything id like?""

    ""yes"" she said ""anything!""

    ""now put this shirt on please, but first, ""tape"" your boobs so they are flat""

    ""wha... ok, id say id do anything"" she said lovingly.

    ""ok, now, take this hat and wear it, but tuck your hair under it""

she was kinda confused, but non the less, she wanted to make him happy, so she tuck her hair under the hat.

    ""Now id like for you to grab this piece of soot and paint yourself a beard and a mustache""

    ""ok... if this is what you want..."" she muttered.

    ""now, please, put on these sunglasses, and start walking down the beach ill catch up to you in a bit"" he said a bit excited...

After the wedding festivities Anne prepares herself for bed and the expected 'knock' on the door. Sure enough the knock comes, the door opens and there is Wally, her 85 year old groom, ready for action...

She is set to go to sleep again, but, aha, you guessed it..... Wally is back again, rapping on the door, and is as fresh as a 25-year-old, ready for more 'action.'

A 'heads up' for those men who may be regular Home Depot customers. This one caught me by surprise. 

Over the last month I became a victim of a clever scam while out shopping. Simply going out to get supplies has turned out to be quite traumatic. Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't happen to you or your friends. Here's how the scam works: 

Two seriously good-looking 20-21 year-old girls come over to your car as you are packing your shopping into the trunk. They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. 

It is impossible not to look. 

When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say 'No' and instead ask you for a ride to McDonalds. 

You agree and they get into the back seat. On the way, they start undressing. Then one of them climbs over into the front seat and starts crawling all over you, while the other one steals your wallet. 

I had my wallet stolen January 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, 17th, 20th, 24th &amp; 29th. Also February 1st &amp; 4th, Twice on the 8th, 16th, 23rd, 26th &amp; 30th, three times last Monday and very likely again this upcoming weekend. 

So tell your friends to be careful. 

P.S. Wal-Mart has wallets on sale for 2.99 each. I found cheaper ones for $1.99 at K-Mart and bought them out. Also, you never will get to eat at McDonalds. I've already lost 11 pounds just running back and forth to Home Depot.",PSA: BE CAREFUL SHOPPING AT HOME DEPOT,8

Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit. He had to bail out

gun and machete. He drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't
break and then he landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops. He
killed seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of

Harry answered, ""I'm too smart for the 1st grade.
My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is!
I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!""
Ms. Brooks had enough.

She took Harry to the principal's office.

While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was.

The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test.
If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave.
She agreed.

Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test.

Principal: ""What is 3 x 3?""

Harry: ""9.""

Principal: ""What is 6 x 6?""

Harry: ""36.""

And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know.

The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, ""I think Harry can go to the 3rd grade.""

Ms. Brooks says to the principal, ""Let me ask him some questions.""
The principal and Harry both agreed.

Ms. Brooks asks, ""What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?""

Harry, after a moment: ""Legs.""

Ms Brooks: ""What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?""

The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!
Harry replied: ""Pockets.""
Ms. Brooks: ""What does a dog do that a man steps into?""

Harry: ""Pants.""

The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open.

Ms. Brooks: ""What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?""

The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer,

Harry replied, ""Bubble gum.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?""

Harry: ""Shake hands.""

The principal was trembling.

Ms. Brooks: ""What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?""

Harry: ""Firetruck.""

The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the
teacher, ""Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last six questions wrong...","A first-grade teacher, Ms Brooks, was having trouble with one of her students...",144

After dinner, Vajpayee says to Sharif: ""Well, Nawaz Sahab, I don't know what you think of the members of your Cabinet, but mine are all bright and brilliant.""

""How do you know?"" asks Sharif.

""Oh well, it's simple', says Vajpayee. ""They all have to take special tests before they can be a minister. Wait a second.... He calls Advani over and says to him, ""Tell me, Advaniji, who is the child of your father and of your  mother, who is not your brother and is not your sister?""

""Ah, that's simple"", says Advani, ""It is me!"".

""Well done, Advaniji"", says Vajpayee. 

Sharif  is very impressed. He returns to Islamabad and wonders about the  intelligence of the members of his Cabinet. He calls in his Cabinet  Secretary, recounts the dinner table conversation that he had with the Indian Prime Minister, and asks him to test the IQ of a particular  minister.

The Cabinet Secretary calls in the minister and says: ""The Prime Minister has asked me to ask you to answer the following question: 'Who is the child of your father and of your mother, who is not your brother and is not your sister?'

The minister thinks and  thinks and doesn't know the answer. ""I'll have to think about it further. Please tell Prime Minister sahab that I'll let him know  tomorrow?"" ""Of Course"", says the Cabinet Secretary, ""You've got twenty-four hours."" The minister goes away, thinks as hard as he can, calls in his chief secretaries and joint secretaries, but no one knows the answer. Twenty hours later, the minister is very worried because he still had no answer and only four hours were left.

Eventually, the minister says to himself: ""I'll ask Benazir. She's clever, she'll  know the answer."" He calls Beanzir. ""Mohtarma"", he says, ""tell me who is  the child of your father and of your mother, who is not your brother  and is not your sister?""

""Very simple"", says Benazir, ""It's me!""

""Of course"", exclaims the minister and rings up the Cabinet Secretary. 

""I've got the answer: it's Benazir Bhutto.""

""No, minister sahab"", says the Cabinet Secretary, ""you'll lose your job if  you give this wrong answer. The right answer is: Advani!""","This is from L K Advani's Autobiography ""My country my life""",0
