Priest promptly removes his hand, apologies and mentions how his desires are stronger than his restraint.

In which he found :
""Friend, move up to a better place""

I myself am paralyzed from the waist down and so I need to use a wheelchair. Since my friends and I have these disorders, we formed a group of friends around those similarities. It's great to have people that you can relate to, but we also get bullied a lot because of our 'quirks'. Today was no different.

I notice our usual bully coming up behind us and I brace myself for what's going to happen. He pushes Megan down before she even sees it coming. Abby gasps. He yells some insults at us and then runs away, leaving Alex speechless. I look at them and then at Hayley, and I can see she's gone completely pale. I notice that James is shaking with anger, and I'm furious too. How could I let my friend get hurt? I never stand up for them; I'm a terrible friend. I decide that I've had enough. Just because I'm crippled, our bully thinks I won't fight back? Wheel see about that.

Fast-forward 10 minutes, we're in the Office reporting the bullying to the principal. We're sitting in the chairs around his desk. He asks us what the problem is, but nobody answers. James is really shaken up, and Alex doesn't want to talk about what happened. I can tell that my friends are upset about this. Abby is trying to take deep breaths to calm down. Megan just stares at the principal. Finally, she says something.

Megan: ""I don't see why that bully is still in school! It looks to me like he's caused nothing but trouble as far as the eye can see. This isn't the first time we've seen something like this happen; he's bullying kids all the time. Let's just try to see eye to eye and agree that he needs to be expelled.""

Principal: ""I see what you mean. I occasionally catch him doing bad things, but I hadn't realized it was as bad as it is. Alex, do you have anything to say about this? Anything to add?""


Alex brings out the paper he uses to communicate with people. He writes on it and hands it to me to read to the principal. The paper says:

""That's what I'm saying! He does unspeakable things, yet the teachers just keep quiet and don't punish him. I just wanna tell them what's really happening, but they don't listen to me. That's exactly what I'm talking about. No action is being taken against him, I say!""

Principal: ""Okay, okay. You've spoken your mind. James, tell me your side of the story.""

James: ""That bully is a horrible person. I've seen him pick on kids over and over, and it makes me so mad. It feels like I can't control my actions when I'm around him. My eyes twitch, my breaths become shaky, my fists curl up. I just want to scream out at him!""

Principal: ""That's enough James! You need to learn to control yourself. Abby, your turn to speak.""

Abby: ~Sigh.~ Where do I begin? Sometimes he scares me so hard that I can't breathe. It blows me away how he gets away with the stuff that he does. I frequently have to excuse myself from class just to take a breather away from him because the teachers don't stop him. I feel like I'm being suffocated; he's always breathing down my neck. He needs to be expelled. It would be a breath of fresh air to come to school without having to worry about him for a change.""

Principal: ""That's horrible, Abby. I'm sorry you have to go through that. It must suck the life out of you.""

He asks me for my side next. 

Me: ""I can't stand him. I've seen him jump people before and then walk away. Every bystander looks shocked for a second, but they always end up ignoring it soon after. I end up kicking myself later. I want to stand up for the people he bullies but, as it stands, I am in no position to. I simply don't stand a chance again him. I just want to run away from this school. Principal, you need to put your foot down and punish him. Do I really have to jog your memory of the times he's broken the rules?""

Principal: ""No, that won't be necessary. You've all convinced me. Starting now, I'm going to stand by the students of this school. If I see him do or say anything that I don't approve of, I'll talk to him about it. My ideas are pretty pale at the moment, but I trust that I'll figure out something to shake these bad habits out of him.""

He skipped over Hayley, which is understandable. The bullying must be traumatic for her because she was completely white-faced the whole time. I wouldn't expect her to want to talk about it.

The man wonders if he might have a *mental sickness*, so he goes to the clinic to see *a specialist*.  While he checks in at the counter, the receptionist warns him, ""The specialist has a **thick accent**, but don't worry - *his diagnosis is always correct!*""  The receptionist then sends the man into the specialist's office.

""Herro sir,"" *the specialist says congenially*, ""preese to meet you.  What is probrem?""

""Well,"" says the man, ""I'm having *problems attracting women, but I'm not sure why*.  I think I am good at conversation and I have a positive outlook on life.  I also exercise daily, take care of my personal hygiene, and eat healthy food.""

""Hrrmm,"" says the specialist, ""You need to *take test*, but... think I know probrem.""

The man is *amazed* that the specialist has already figured out the problem that has eluded him for so long, so he immediately agrees to take the test.

""First... remove arr croze,"" says the specialist, so the man removes all of his clothing.  ""Next... get down on arr four, and craw across froor!""  *Feeling a little embarrassed*, the naked man crawls across the room on his hands and knees, while *the specialist watches him closely*, nodding his head.  Then the specialist says, ""O-kay… Turn and craw back!""  The naked man turns and crawls back, while the specialist watches, nodding his head some more.  

The specialist nods his head one final time and says, ""O-kay… put croze on - I diagnose!  You have A. Zachary's Disease.""

Alarmed, the man asks the specialist, ""What is A. Zachary's Disease?""

The specialist replies, ""It when your head rooks A. Zachary rike your ass!""

After hiking for around half an hour, the travelers spot a beautiful oasis at the bottom of the hill. They all make a mad dash towards it, eager to cool down. They dive in without hesitation and bathe there. 

Suddenly, the trio heard rustling in the bushes. A large group of natives emerged and pointed their spears at the men. ""You have corrupted our sacred grounds,"" they said. ""You will come to our chief."" The men escorted the three to a lush jungle where the leader of the native tribe was awaiting. 

""You have dirtied the most sacred site in our religion. This is a crime punishable by death."" The tribe whooped and hollered, eager to see blood shed in the name of their god. ""We will slowly kill you and then make canoes out of your bones and skin in order to forewarn other travelers not to enter our holy sites."" However, before the killing, the Chief offered each man a wish of his own. 

The first one asked was the Japanese man. ""I will have a knife,"" he said. So the Chief granted his wish and brought him a sharp knife. ""I will not die by the hand of you tribemen, I will die by my own hand."" He then slices his throat and falls dead to the ground, blood spraying from his jugular. 

Next was the French man. ""I will also have a knife,"" he said. So the chief granted his wish and brought him an even sharper knife. ""I also choose to die by my own hand and not to you filthy tribesmen."" He then also slices his throat in the same fashion and falls dead to the ground, blood spraying from his jugular. 

Lastly, it was the aussie's turn to choose his wish. After thinking carefully, he says: ""I will have a fork."" His wish was granted thus and he grabbed the fork and repeatedly stabbed himself with the fork until there were holes all across his body and he was too hurt to go on. 

His lungs punctured, his blood loss high, he gestures for the Chief to come close. The Chief leans over gently as the aussie, with his final breath, whispers to him...

""Fuck your canoe.""",3 navigators land on a foreign island in the middle of the ocean.,120

""I saw the sign outside, I've played the piano my entire life, and I need a job. Can I audition?""

The manager says, ""Sure, play me a song.""

So the man starts to play. The song is a catchy tune, and the manager starts to clap his hands and tap his feet. As the song ends,the managers says, ""I loved it! What's the name of that song?""

The man says, ""I call that one, 'Your sister is a whore!""

The manager is startled, but he asks the man to play another. This time, he plays a song so beautiful, that the manager is wiping tears from his eyes by the end. He then asks, 

""What's that song called?"" 

The man replies, ""That one's called, 'I'm going to fuck your ass until your hemorrhoids bleed!""

The manager, shocked, says, ""Look sir, these songs are beautiful, but if you're going to play in my pub, you cannot tell the patrons the names of your songs.""

""That's fair,"" the man replies.

So later that night, pub is full. Everybody is drinking and dancing to the songs on the piano, having a great time. Eventually, the pianist gets a five minute break, so he rushes to the bathroom to have a pee. In his rush to get back to the stage, he forgets to zip up his zipper.

As he makes his way across the stage, a patron in the first row stops him, saying, ""Sir! Do you know your fucking dick is hanging out of your pants?!?!?""

The man smiles, and says, ""Know it? I wrote it!!""

Monday:


Now home from honeymoon and settled in our new home.

It's fun to cook for Tim. Today I made an angel food cake and the recipe said, ""Beat 12 eggs separately.""
Well, I didn't have enough bowls to do that, so I had to borrow 12 bowls to beat the eggs in. The cake turned out fine though.


Tuesday:


We wanted a fruit salad for supper. The recipe said, ""Serve without dressing.""


So I didn't dress. But Tim happened to bring a friend home for supper that night. They both looked so startled when I served them, I think it was the salad.



Wednesday:


I decided to serve rice and found a recipe which said, `Wash thoroughly before steaming the rice.""


So I heated some water and took a bath before steaming the rice. Sounded kind of silly in the middle of the day. I can't say it improved the rice anyhow.



Thursday:


Today Tim asked for salad again. I tried a new recipe. It said, ""Prepare ingredients, and then toss on a bed of lettuce one hour before serving.""


I hunted all over the place for a garden and when I got one, I tossed my salad into the bed of lettuce and stood over there for over one hour so the dog would not take it. Tim came over and asked if I felt all right. I wonder why? He must be stressed at work; I'll try to be supportive.



Friday:


Today I found an easy recipe for cookies. It said, ""Put all ingredients in a bowl and beat it.""


Beat it I did, to my mum's place. There must have been something wrong with the recipe, because when I came back home again; it looked the same as when I left it.


Saturday:


Tim went shopping today and brought home a chicken. He asked me to dress it for Sunday. I'm sure I don't know how hens dress for Sunday. I never noticed back on the farm, but I found an old doll dress and its little cute shoes. I thought the hen looked really cute. When Tim saw it, he started counting to ten. Either he was really stressed because of his work, or he wanted the chicken to dance.


When I asked him what was wrong he started crying and shouting out, ""Why me? Why me?""",Diary of a young wife,5

I blow up faster than anybody and shrink faster too. All the other functions suck.""

Lost in his own egomania, he collides with the constant function 3, who is running in terror in the opposite direction.
""What's wrong with you? Why don't you look where you're going?"" demands e^x. He then sees the fear in 3's eyes and says ""You look terrified!""

""I am!"" says the panicky 3. ""There's a differential operator just around the corner. If he differentiates me, I'll be reduced to nothing! I've got to get away!"" With that, 3 continues to dash off.
""Stupid constant,"" thinks e^x. ""I've got nothing to fear from a differential operator. He can keep differentiating me as long as he wants, and I'll still be there.""

So he scouts off to find the operator and gloat in his smooth glory. He rounds the corner and defiantly introduces himself to the operator. ""Hi. I'm e^x.""

Most of the time, at least. There was one time that he was eating at Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken that ended up being quite extraordinary. Elvis had ordered the chicken tenders, and the meal had been provided posthaste, as he was Elvis. After inhaling the majority of the tenders with alarming speed, Elvis paused to look at the remaining piece of meat. In that very instant he fell madly in love with it. He attempted to speak to the food, but it could not respond. This, however, would not deter Elvis. He went on for hours pleading with the chicken to love him back, just to give him a chance. He would never let it go. It made his life complete. It fulfilled all his dreams. Of course, the deceased poultry couldn't ever say yes or no, even if it wanted to. As he became more desperate, Elvis made more outlandish promises. He'd be with the the tender 'till the end of time. They would never part. Happiness would follow it wherever it goes, so long as it, at last, made his dreams come true. Faced once more with silence, Elvis's mounting frustration began to manifest. Veins popped out on his forehead. He began to tremble with rage. His hand closed like a vise around the chicken. Finally, he let out a tremendous roar, forming a single phrase with a voice as loud as a jet engine. His words? ""Love me tender"".",Elvis's Dinner Fiasco [Long],0

post,60xdd8,2qh72,jokes,false,1490216159,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/60xdd8/a_wonderful_homemade_pun_very_long/,self.jokes,,"I decided not to add a TL;DR. If you've ever read the longest joke in the world, I'm guessing this might be right up near it, and might have the same effect. To get the full effect, I strongly reccomend you read the entire thing. Well, enough yapping, let's get started!

So there’s this guy, walking around somewhere in India. He looks about sixty, his hair is just starting to gray. He’s walking down this really dirty street, with trash and mud everywhere. Here’s his story.

His name is Abuk Chandrasekhar, but you can just call him Abuk. He is on his way home from a long, hard day at work. He’s about five minutes away from his tiny apartment. It is pouring down rain, the streets are nearly impossible to traverse across. After some struggle, Abuk is able to make it home safely. He takes off his dripping coat and muddy boots, then leans in close to his dingy kerosene heater. It’s no dinner again for the second night in a row; he’s about fed up with this hard life. But what can he do? If only he could somehow get to America, maybe life would be better.

Abuk decides to sing away his troubles. Ever since he was a little boy, his mother and father encouraged him to sing. After twenty years of practice every night, he finally could sing beautifully, at least in his opinion. He has improved even more in the years after, and uses nearly all of his spare time to practice. Abuk falls asleep hours later, with dreams of singing in the far off land of America.

The next morning, the weather clears up. He goes on his way to work as happy as can be. Up ahead, he sees disturbance in the street. a billboard. It’s brightly colored with very crisp edges just beginning to peel off. It says “AMERICAN IDOL - COMING TO NEW YORK CITY” in bold, thick text. Abuk’s face lights up right away. It must be a sign. He now knows where his life is going! Abuk turns around, rushes home, goes to his room, and grabs the small envelope that holds his entire life savings. He finds his phone, and dials the number for the local airport.
    “Hello, you’ve reached the Chennai International Airport, how may I help you?” the operator says in Hindi.
    “Hello, I was wondering how much a flight to New York would cost me.”
    “Our next flight to New York leaves in three days, and the price is...
Hold on, let me check.... Fifty thousand rupees.”
    “Thank you” Abuk returns in English, hanging up the phone.
Abuk counts his money. He has more than enough.
    “I’m going to America!” he exclaims ecstatically.




Two days later, at the Chennai International Airport
0’600 hours

Abuk steps out of the taxi, and pays the driver a generous tip. He hops out, grabs his bags, and happily jogs to the entrance. He quickly makes it through the light security, and heads directly for the plane. He tells everyone he can about his upcoming adventure to America. Most people keep walking without turning their heads, but at the gate Abuk meets someone who actually acknowledges him. The man who listens introduces himself as Aarav. He is traveling to America to meet his wife and child who flew up a few months earlier. He says he is the owner of a Jazz club, and invites Abuk to sing.
    “Oh, that sounds wonderful!” Abuk says, “After I finish the competition I will certainly come by to see you!”
    “Yes, very good, very good! I will see you later! May i have your phone number to call you?”
    “Sure, here.” Aarav pulls out his phone to write down the number. “91-365-447-3283.”
    “Thanks!” says Aarav.

    There is a buzz over the intercom, and the flight attendant starts announcing the first section. Abuk waves goodbye to his new acquaintance, and boards the plane. Abuk sits down right in the front of the plane so he can be the first one off. He stores his carry-on, and reclines his seat for the long, tiring flight ahead. Tomorrow he will be in America!




The next day, in New York City.
Noon

    Abuk strolls down the sidewalk, looking for the address listed on the billboard. The Al Hirschfeld theater. It isn’t hard to find, there’s a gigantic line of people out front. Camera crews walk up and down the crowds, people fighting for a shot in the camera. The auditions have already started! Abuk sprints to the back of the line. It takes nearly three hours of watching cars zoom past, planes fly overhead, lights flash, and the other hustling and bustling of the city before he makes it to the front. The bouncer calls his name, and he steps inside. Sitting in front of him are three judges: Steven Tyler, Simon Cowell, and Jennifer Lopez.
“Oh, oh my gods! It is an honor to meet you!” Abuk says. I flew in all the way from india, and I’m here!
“Oh, India! How wonderful!” Jennifer Lopez says, “I visited India many years ago. You have a beautiful country.”
“Thank you, thank you!” Abuk says, “Today I will be singing Respect by Aretha Franklin. It is one of my favorites!”
“Mine too, let’s hear it!” Steven Tyler returns.
Abuk sings a wonderful solo, and gets all three votes to pass. He is going to Hollywood! Abuk runs out of the theater onto the streets, fist pumping and jumping for joy. In just two weeks, he will be appearing live on television in front of a huge studio audience! It seems his dream is going to come true!
During the next few weeks, Abuk transfers his rupees to dollars,  catches a transfer flight to Hollywood, and makes it to the theater with time to spare. He smashes his first performance, and makes it onto the semi finals unanimously. He goes around Hollywood, seeing everything he can, and just taking in the overwhelming rush of joy. He catches ANOTHER plane to the semifinals, and rocks Never Gonna Give You Up by rick Astley. After a few more weeks, he’s sitting at the finals, with two other people he’s competing against. His turn comes up faster than he would believe, and he attempts to sing the hardest song he’s ever had. Although he’s been practicing since the semifinals, he still doesn’t know if he can pull it off. His cover of Take on Me by A-Ha may be his biggest challenge yet. He dances to the techno music at the beginning, awing the crowd with his great moves. When the first line comes however, he misses his mark. He’s off by two seconds. His voice cracks, and his face turns bright red with embarrassment. He asks them to restart the track, but it’s too late. His final challenge is ruined. He failed. Tears stream down his face as he looked around the room, the audience dead silent. He slowly walks off stage.
The next night, Abuk walks into the theater. The announcer comes on, and the three contestants line up.
“The winner of American idol is... going to be announced after a quick commercial break.” The audience breaks out in laughter.
Five minutes later, it happens for real.
“America has voted. THE WINNER OF AMERICAN IDOL IS: ...  ...   ...  ...
ABUK CHANDRASEKHAR!!!”
Abuk’s face is sad, he knows he’s lost. But after a few seconds his brain registers something. Did the announcer just say his name? HIS name? Abuk walks up to the front of the stage as confetti rains down from the ceiling. Tears stream down his face, but these are from joy, not sadness. He won the million dollars. America loved his other performances, and his mistake must have not been that bad! Yes!


It just goes to show you, you never judge Abuk by his cover.

Here's how the scam works:

Two very good-looking 20-21 year-old girls of eastern European origin come over to your car as you are packing your shopping into the boot. They both start cleaning your windscreen, their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T- shirts. When you thank them and offer them a tip, they'll say 'No' and instead they ask you for a lift to another supermarket. You agree and they both get in the back seat.

On the way there, they start undressing, until both are completely naked. Then, when you pull over to remonstrate, one of them climbs over into the front seat and starts crawling all over your lap, kissing you, touching you intimately and thrusting herself against you, while the other one steals your wallet!

I had my wallet stolen on September 4th, 9th,10th, twice on the 15th, 17th, 20th, 24th and 29th. Also on October 1st, 4th, 6th, 9th and 10th and twice yesterday.So please warn all the older men you know to be on the lookout for this scam.

The best times seem to be just before lunch and about 4:30 in the afternoon.",Be Warned! Scammers about!,20

Putin quickly replies ""You're on!""

Putin sends for his most highly trained and best equipped soldier and sends him over the mountain. The sounds of a small battle echo from behind the mountain and silence eventually falls.

Trump, being Trump, boasts ""Since your man has not returned, clearly my soldier is superior. In fact, he is so superior, he can defeat 10 of your best soldiers without breaking a sweat!""

Putin, hoping to redeem himself, quickly sends his best 10 soldiers over the mountain. The sounds of battle erupt, much more ferociously than the first time. Several minutes of gunfire fill the air, and then all falls silent.

Trump, being Trump, tells Putin ""I am telling you Vlad, I have the best soldiers, the absolute best. As a matter of fact, my soldier on the far side of the mountain can defeat 100 of your best soldiers without even trying. 

Putin is infuriated and completely embarresed. Think there is no way 1 American soldier can defeat 100 of his, he tells Trump ""You got a deal!"" and sends his best 100 soldiers over the mountain.

For hours, the sounds of a raging battle echo from behind the mounain. There are explosions, constant gunfire, and screams of death. Finally, the battle dies down and all is silent.

One of Putin's soldiers come crawling down the mountain, severely wounded, covered in soot and blood, barely surviving. Putin runs to his soldier and demands ""what is going on back there?? how is one soldier able to defeat so many??""

The wounded soldier replies between gasps of air, ""Comrade Putin, sir... we had been lied to! ...we fell into a terrible trap! There is not just one American soldier on the far side of the mountain, there are two!!""

The Allergists were in favor of scratching it, but the Dermatologists advised not to make any rash moves.
 
The Gastroenterologists had sort of a gut feeling about it, but the Neurologists thought the Administration had a lot of nerve.
 
Meanwhile, Obstetricians felt certain everyone was laboring under a misconception, while the Ophthalmologists considered the idea shortsighted.
 
Pathologists yelled, ""Over my dead body!"" while the Pediatricians said, ""Oh, grow up!""
 
The Psychiatrists thought the whole idea was madness, while the Radiologists could see right through it.
 
Surgeons decided to wash their hands of the whole thing and the Internists claimed it would indeed be a bitter pill to swallow.
 
The Plastic Surgeons opined that this proposal would ""put a whole new face on the matter.""
 
The Podiatrists thought it was a step forward, but the Urologists were pissed off at the whole idea.
 
Anesthesiologists thought the whole idea was a gas, and those lofty Cardiologists didn't have the heart to say no.

One dark and stormy night he was traveling back to his hotel when his car died. He got out of the car and opened the hood. He checked everything he could think of and couldn't find what was wrong. He pulled out his phone and discovered he had no service. He looked around and noticed an old monastery nestled in a valley between two mountains. He decided it was his best shot and walked up and knocked on the big front door.
A monk opened the door and asked ""Yes my child?"" the man proceeded to explain that his car broke down and wondered if the monk could help. The monk explained to the man that there were 2 monks at the monastery who used to be mechanics, the monk then told the man to come in and eat dinner with them while the monks worked on his car. The man agreed and ate wonderful homemade soup and homemade bread with the monks. The head monk came to the man at the end of dinner and told him that his car wouldn't be ready till morning, but they had a free room that he could sleep him. The man agreed and after a few moments, the head monk lead the man to his room.
The man laid in the most comfortable bed he had ever been in and quickly fell asleep. In the middle of the night he awoke to the most beautiful noise he had ever heard. He couldn't identify what the noise was. The noise eventually stopped and the man laid back down and went quickly back to sleep. In the morning the head monk tapped on his door and told the man that his car was ready. The man thanked him and asked ""What was that beautiful noise I heard last night?"" the head monk apologized to the man and explained ""I am sorry, but I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk."" the man tried again but the monk told him once again that he could not tell him. The man was disappointed but moved on with his life and went home.
10 years later he decided that he had such a great time in the mountains of Eastern Europe he would go back.
Then, one dark and stormy night the man was traveling back to his hotel when his car died. He got out of the car and opened the hood. He checked everything he could think of and couldn't find what was wrong. He pulled out his phone and discovered he had no service. He looked around and noticed the old monastery nestled in the valley between two mountains. The man realized that he had been here before. He decided that the monks had helped him before, maybe they'd help him again.
A monk opened the door and asked ""Yes my child?"" the man proceeded to tell the monk that he had been there 10 years previous and his car died then, and his car died again and asked if the monk could help. The monk invited the man in for dinner while the former mechanics looked at his car. The man agreed and ate the wonderful homemade soup and the wonderful homemade bread with the monks once again. The head monk came to the man at the end of dinner and told him that his car wouldn't be ready till morning, but they had a free room that he could sleep him. The man agreed and the head monk lead the man to his room.
The man opened the door and realized it was the same room. The man laid in the most comfortable bed he had laid in for ten years and quickly fell asleep. In the middle of the night he awoke once again to the most beautiful noise he had ever heard. He couldn't identify what the noise was. The noise eventually stopped and the man laid back down and went back to sleep. In the morning the head monk tapped on his door and told the man that his car was ready. The man thanked him and asked ""I'm sorry but I have to ask, what was that beautiful noise I heard last night?"" the head monk apologized to the man and explained once again ""I am sorry, but I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk."" the man tried again and again but the monk told him once again that he could not tell him. The man was disappointed and slightly angered but moved on with his life and went home.
Ten years later he decided to go back to Eastern Europe once again.
Then, on the last dark and stormy night the man was there, he was traveling back to his hotel when his car died once again. He got out of the car and opened the hood. He checked everything he could think of and couldn't find what was wrong. He pulled out his phone and discovered he had no service. He looked around and noticed the old monastery nestled in the valley between two mountains. The man realized that he had been here before. He decided that the monks had helped him before, maybe they'd help him again.
A monk opened the door and asked ""Yes my child?"" the man proceeded to tell the monk that he had been there 10 years previous and 20 years previous and his car died then, and his car died again and asked if the monk could help. The monk invited the man in for dinner while the former mechanics looked at his car. The man agreed and ate the wonderful homemade soup and the wonderful homemade bread with the monks once again. The head monk came to the man at the end of dinner and told him that his car wouldn't be ready till morning, but they had a free room that he could sleep him. The man agreed and the head monk lead the man to his room.
The man opened the door and realized it was the same room. The man laid in the most comfortable bed he had laid in for ten years and quickly fell asleep. In the middle of the night he awoke once again to the most beautiful noise he had ever heard. He couldn't identify what the noise was.

The man was disappointed and slightly angered but moved on with his life and decided to go home. As the man opened his car door he turned around and knocked on the door again.
The head monk answered ""Yes my child?"" and the man said that he had to know what the noise was. The monk explained once again ""I'm sorry but I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk."" The man would not take no for an answer this time and asked the head monk what it would take to become a monk. The head monk told the man to go out and count every blade of grass on earth. And the man looked at the head monk and decided it was worth it.
For 10 long years the man traveled the world counting every blade of grass. He counted in yards, he looked in fields, and he even found some in laboratories. Sometimes the wind would blow and he'd have to start all over again and sometimes people would be mowing the grass and he'd get confused by the clippings. The man eventually found what he was sure was the correct number of blades of grass on Earth.
The man returned to the monastery and knocked on the door, the head monk answered the door ""Yes my child?"" the man handed the monk the count of the blades of grass and the monk looked over it and said ""Yes my child, you are correct."" The man jumped for joy and asked ""So I'm a monk now?"" and the monk said ""No my child, I am sorry but you are not yet a monk, first you must count every grain of sand on Earth.""
For 10 long years the man traveled the world counting every grain of sand. He counted in sandboxes, he looked in the vast deserts, and he even looked at the golf courses. Sometimes the wind would blow and he'd have to start all over again and sometimes the water would wash away the sand at the beaches. The man eventually found what he was sure was the correct number of grains of sand on Earth.
The man returned to the monastery and knocked on the door, the head monk answered the door ""Yes my child?"" the man handed the monk the count of the grains of sand and the monk looked over it and said ""Yes my child, you are correct."" The man jumped for joy and asked ""So I'm a monk now?"" and the monk said ""No my child, I am sorry but you are not yet a monk, first you must count all the stars in the sky."" The man was angry, but decided it was worth it.
For 10 long years the man traveled the world counting every star in the sky. He counted every night. Sometimes he would lose track and sometimes he'd fall asleep. The man eventually found what he was sure was the correct number of stars in the sky.
The man returned to the monastery and knocked on the door, the head monk answered the door ""Yes my child?"" the man handed the monk the count of the blades of grass and the monk looked over it and said ""Yes my child, you are correct."" The man jumped for joy and asked ""So I'm a monk now?"" and the monk said ""Yes my child."" The man asked ""Well what is the beautiful noise?"" the monk told him that the noise is behind the large wooden door in the main hall.
The man went to the door and pulled on the door for hours, then the door popped slightly open. The man continued to pull on the door for 3 days and then the wooden door opened.
He looked inside and saw a larger bronze door. He began pulling on the bronze door and after the man pulled on the door for a week it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for a month at the end of the month the door was open enough for him to slip through.
He looked inside and saw an even larger silver door. He began pulling on the silver door and after the man pulled on the door for a month and it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for a year at the end of the year the door was open enough for him to slip through.
He looked inside and saw a still larger gold steel door. He began pulling on the steel door and after the man pulled on the door for a year it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for years and years at the end of the decade the door was open enough for him to slip through.
He looked inside and saw an incredibly large golden door. He began pulling on the gold door and after the man pulled on the door for a decade it creaked open slightly, after all of this a crowd began to form, wanting to see the man pulling on the door forever. He kept pulling on the door for 20 long years and eventually door was open enough for him to get through and it swung smoothly out the rest of the way.
And then he saw what was making the beautiful noise.
Oh, I guess you want me to tell you what made the beautiful noise.
