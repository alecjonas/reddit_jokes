The same goes for the second night.

On the third day, a little irritated, the wife decides to ask someone for advice. She sees one of their neighbours, and asks him what she could do to stop her husband from snoring. The man tells her that if she spreads her husband's legs while he is sleeping, he will stop snoring.

When night comes, the couple go to bed as usual. The husband once again starts snoring. His wife decides to take the neighbour's advice and spreads her husband's legs. He immediately stops snoring.
She wonders how this works and decides to ask the neighbour the next day.

When she sees the man, she asks him why spreading someone's legs prevents them from snoring.

The man tells her: ""I've been a chimney sweep for 30 years. When you spread a man's legs, his balls drop to his asshole and block the air from going in and out.""",A couple moves into a new apartment.,1

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Everyone knows Dave,18

The next day the magician performs his newest illusion and makes three trained dogs appear on the stage. The parrot inmediately says how it was done.

The days go by and he says to the now silent parrot:

""Don't you have anything to say now!?""

The driver, a young man in an Armani suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and Versace tie, leaned out the window and asked the farmer, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?""

Bill looks at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, why not?""

The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.

The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany.

Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response. Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer, turns to the farmer and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.""

""That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,"" says Bill.

He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the boot of his car.

Then Bill says to the young man, ""Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?""
The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ""Okay, why not?""

""You're a Member of the European Parliament"", says Bill.

""Wow! That's correct,"" says the yuppie, ""but how did you guess that?""

""No guessing required."" answered the farmer. ""You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of pounds worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter.

In the months leading up to their expedition, the Apollo 11 astronauts trained in a remote moon-like desert in the western United States. The area is home to several Native American communities, and there is a story – or legend – describing an encounter between the astronauts and one of the locals.

One day as they were training, the astronauts came across an old Native American. The man asked them what they were doing there. They replied that they were part of a research expedition that would shortly travel to explore the moon. When the old man heard that, he fell silent for a few moments, and then asked the astronauts if they could do him a favor.

‘What do you want?’ they asked. ‘Well,’ said the old man, ‘the people of my tribe believe that holy spirits live on the moon. I was wondering if you could pass an important message to them from my people.’ ‘What’s the message?’ asked the astronauts.
The man uttered something in his tribal language, and then asked the astronauts to repeat it again and again until they had memorized it correctly.

‘What does it mean?’ asked the astronauts. ‘Oh, I cannot tell you. It’s a secret that only our tribe and the moon spirits are allowed to know.’

When they returned to their base, the astronauts searched and searched until they found someone who could speak the tribal language, and asked him to translate the secret message. When they repeated what they had memorized, the translator started to laugh uproariously. When he calmed down, the astronauts asked him what it meant. The man explained that the sentence they had memorized so carefully said, ‘Don’t believe a single word these people are telling you. They have come to steal your lands.’

The man's wish is granted and a woman appears, the man runs off with his wish and starts making out with his new girlfriend. An hour passes and as the other two travelers think of their wishes, the man returns in an angrily fashion.

""WHAT GIVES, WHY'D YOU RUIN A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN YOU TWISTED FUCK?!?!""

""What's wrong?"" replies the second traveler.

""My girlfriend, is actually a transgender boyfriend!""

The genie responds with a disappointed look, ""look bro, you could've been more specific on your wish, it's 2016 and anyone can identify as a woman.""

Using this new knowledge of wishes; the second traveler, a young woman in her 30s, asks for a white, strong, republican male, with the most beautiful glare. She's given a Jar of Mayonaise, and stares at the genie in confusion. ""Pretty sure Mayonaise isn't a gender"".

""Yeah but Tumblr says otherwise,"" replied the genie.

The last traveler, a young-man in his 20s, thinks carefully. He walks up to the genie and says, ""I wish for a tall beautiful woman, she has to be born as 100% female, has to find me extremely attractive, and is not a jar of mayonaise. I wish to find her in my bed, waiting to make love to me tonight"".

The next day and the traveler angrily runs up to the genie and screams at him. The two travelers ask the genie what the catch to his wish was, and the genie rolls his eyes and sighs.

“Hello, I would like to buy some livestock, preferably a sturdy ass to plow my fields and some chickens, to produce eggs to sell and eat.” 
“Sure thing! I only have a male ass though, no chickens. It’ll cost you 600 gold.”
The boy agrees, and hands over the money. As the farmer hands over the donkey, he gives the boy a reminder.
“Remember, this fine animal is trained to keep walking when scratched. If it stops for no reason, just give’r a good scratch.”


The boy walks on, until he comes to a second farm. This time, a maid opens the door. 
“Hello, I would like to buy some livestock, preferably some chickens, to produce eggs to sell and eat.” 
The maid looks at him in pity.
“Sorry, but I only work for the owners of this farm. However, I do worry for your safety, travelling all alone with no companion. Allow me to accompany you along this journey.”
The boy agrees, and so the maid follows him in search for his chickens.


As daylight breaks, the boy comes to a third farm. A very fat lady answers. 
“Hello, I would like to buy some livestock, preferably some chickens, to produce eggs to sell and eat.”
The lady peers at him, studying him with suspicion.
“Aye, I have exactly one cock* and one pullet*. They should produce enough eggs to last awhile. It’ll cost you 120 gold each.”
The boy agrees, and hands over the money. The boy and the maid walk on, with the donkey and two chickens. 


On his way home, suddenly the boy’s donkey stopped walking. He looks at it in confusion, but remembers the old farmer’s wise words. His hands are full, carrying a chicken in each arm, so he turns to the maid:

He breaks into a house to look for money and guns. Inside, he finds a young couple in bed. He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair. 

While tying the homeowner's wife to the bed, the convict gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. 

While he's in there, the husband whispers over to his wife: ""Listen, this guy is an escaped convict. Look at his clothes! He's probably spent a lot of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck. If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain... do whatever he tells you. 

Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is obviously very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us both. Be strong, honey. I love you!"" 

His wife responds: ""He wasn't kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear. He told me that he's gay, thinks you're cute, and asked if we had any Vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you, too!""",A man escapes from a prison,10

Sullen, the son sits down on the chair next to his father's bedside to try and comfort him. As the son situates in the chair however the father suddenly glares wide-eyed and grabs his arm as if trying to say something he's been holding in all this time. The father maintains his grip but then reaches for a pen and paper on the table by the bed and begins scribbling wildly a message before giving it to his son before passing on into the great beyond. Out of respect and love, the son pockets the note without reading it thinking his father left him a will.

Of course, the wife promptly hacked her first shot right through the window of the biggest house adjacent to the course.
The husband cringed, 'I warned you to be careful! Now we'll have to go up there, find the owner, apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us.'
So the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. A warm voice said, 'Come on in.'
When they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the pieces of window glass.
A man reclining on the couch asked, 'Are you the people that broke my window?'
'Uh...yeah! , sir. We're sure sorry about that,' the husband replied.
'Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you.. You see, I'm a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for my self.'
Wow, that's great!' the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, 'I'd like a million dollars a year for the rest of my life.'
'No problem,' said the genie 'You've got it, it's the least I can do.. And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!'
'And now you, young lady, what do you want?' the genie asked.
'I'd like to own a gorgeous home in every country in the world complete with servants,' she said.
'Consider it done,' the genie said. 'And your homes will always be safe from fire, burglary and natural disasters!'
'And now,' the couple asked in unison, 'what's your wish, genie?'
'Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle, and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have sex with your wife.'
The husband looked at his wife and said, 'Gee, honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?'
She mulled it over for a few moments and said, 'You know, you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?'
You know I love you sweetheart,' said the husband. I'd do the same for you!'
So the genie and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying each other.
The genie was insatiable. After about three hours of non-stop sex, the genie rolled over and looked directly into her eyes and asked, How old are you and your husband?'
'Why, we're both 35,' she responded breathlessly.
'No Kidding,' he said.
'Thirty-five years old and you both still believe in genies?'",Husband and wife accidentally discover a genie,174

Eventually, talk turns to sex and there are some laughs and sly whispers. Except Ethel starts silently crying.

Her girlfriends ask what is wrong.

""I haven't had sex in more than three years!"", Ethel sobs.

One of her friends quickly pipes up, ""You need to see Dr. Zhang! He is the best and he really helped me when I was going through a dry spell and lost my confidence.""

The other girls agreed that this Dr. Zhang, with his Eastern approach to medicine, is quite remarkable.

So, Ethel vowed to make an appointment with this Dr. as soon as she could.

Five anxious weeks later (as Dr. Zhang is VERY popular), Ethel finds herself in his office. Women of all ethnicities, ages, and sizes pack his office so that it's standing room only.

After 45 minutes, Ethel finally is called to wait in one of the examination rooms.

After another 5 minutes, Dr. Zhang hurriedly rushed in.

He pores over Ethel's medical history. Finally, looking up over his thick glasses, he blurts out, ""So, why are you here?""

""Well, you see, I haven't been intimate with a man in over three years and I want to know what's wrong with me."", Ethel timidly said.

""Ah, I see. So, you aren't having any sex and you want me to help fix your probrem?"" Dr. Zhang inquired.

Ethel nodded.

""I don't see anything in your medicar records. I need to examine you and you need to trust me. Even if what I ask is strange.""

""Okay."", Ethel nodded apprehensively.

""Good! Prease take off your crothes.""

Ethel shyly disrobed until she only had her bra and panties on.

""No! Arr your crothes!""

With some reluctance, Ethel removed all of her underwear so she was standing there completely naked.

Dr. Zhang looked Ethel over very intently from the top of her head to her toes. ""Hmm..."" he murmured.

""I don't know, I don't know. What I need you to do is get down on your hands and knees, facing me.""

Ethel is now wondering what the hell kind of doctor is this. She was becoming quite anxious, but she had come this far and he did have a great reputation. So, very gingerly, she got down on her hands and knees, looking up at Dr. Zhang.

The Doctor squinted through his thick glasses but looked very concerned.

""Ok! Now, crawr rearry fast towards me!"", he commanded.

Ethel had the image of her girlfriends laughing at her immediately pop up. If this Doctor is a quack, then why was his waiting room packed with so many women? She promised herself that she'd NEVER tell anyone what he was putting her through as she followed his orders and crawled very fast towards him.

""Now, crawr rearry fast away from me!"" he barked.

Ethel, with almost no dignity left, turned around and scurried away to the corner of the examination room as fast as she could.

""Aha!! Aha!! I see what your problem is!"" Dr. Zhang exclaimed.

Ethel, forgetting her nakedness, jumped up and excitedly asked, ""What is it? What is wrong with me?!""

""Oh, you have Ed Zachary disease. Very bad, very, very bad. Worst case I ever see.""

Crestfallen, Ethel meekly asked, ""What is Ed Zachary disease?""

Dr. Zhang said, triumphantly, ""Oh, that's when your face rooks edzachary rike your ass!""",A woman hasnt had sex in a long time (LONG),5

When she gets there she gets the six eggs and a bottle of tomato sauce and gives the man her money. It's a nice day so Esmeralda is skipping along, on her way home with the eggs and tomato sauce in a plastic bag, but just as she nearly gets home the bag breaks, spilling the eggs and tomato sauce and breaking everything on the concrete footpath. Poor little Esmeralda is distraught, first she starts to whimper, then she starts bawling loudly and hysterically. 
Old Bill is having a beer on his front porch and witnesses this whole unfortunate event transpire, and he gets up off of his old chair and walks over to Esmeralda, who is still crying uncontrollably.

post,5e6hy2,2qh72,jokes,false,1479762006,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5e6hy2/imagine_if_everything_was_free/,self.jokes,,"Free food, free living, free friendship, free love, free time to pursue the work that interests their mind, free help with anything, free energy, FREE LIFE. Because we started from nothing, things are not perfect. Perfect minds of their time found the logical remedy to problems as they presented themselves over time, which is still happening today. Your time is the only thing that holds true value. Your time is the potential change within the world. The larger our population of conscious minds grows the more collective potential change we have. As technology advances, we utilize more of the energy present around us. Eventually there should be no need for money. There should be enough energy for everyone to have without wanting or needing. I cannot believe that you people let your equals go hungry, and thirsty. And you feel good about yourselves? How can you eat without feeling like you should give some part of what you have to someone who doesn't have until everyone has what they need. And how can we have gone through so many generations of consciousness without you lot collectively fixing this. It seems logical that every concious being should be given a home, food, and clothing. I mean this when I say: If I had the means to, I would feed, clothe, and house each and every one of you. I don't want to exist around the kind of evil I experience in this world. Physical things should not be something that you have to spend your time to attain. Spend your time exploring the depths of your concious mind. I think all physical things should be freely attainable for any being. It's realistic to say that if the species continues existing for enough time, there could come a time when the average conscious mind controls (utilizes the energy of) their own planet. But why stop at merely owning one planet? Why not have 5? Why not an entire galaxy. Because there's no reason to anything so what's the fucking point. 
All I want from you is: 
To be your friend,
To exchange knowledge back and forth,
To learn from you,
To teach you,
To help you now and forever,
And to receive help from you in due time. ",Imagine if everything was free..,0

Italian,
French,
German,
Greek,
Chinese,
English,
Polish,
Japanese,
Australian,
Irish, and
American

One month later, the following things have occurred....

One Italian man killed the other Italian man for the Italian woman.
 
The two French men and the French woman are living happily together, having loads of sex. 

The two German men have a strict weekly schedule of when they alternate with the German woman. 

The two Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them. 

The two Chinese men have opened up a laundromat and are taking turns trying to impregnate the Chinese woman to supply workers and customers.

The two English men are waiting for someone to introduce them to the English woman. 

The Polish men took a long look at the endless ocean and one look at the Polish woman and they started swimming. 

The two Japanese men have faxed Tokyo and are waiting for instructions. 

The two Australian men beat each other senseless fighting over the Australian woman, who called them both “bloody wankers” and is checking out all the other men.

Both New Zealand men are searching the island for sheep. 

The Irish began by dividing the island into North and South and setting up a distillery. They do not remember if sex is in the picture because it gets sort of foggy after the first few liters of coconut whiskey, but they are satisfied in that at least the English are not getting any.

The American woman keeps on bitching about her body being her own, the true nature of feminism, how she can do everything that they can do, about the necessity of fulfillment, the equal division of household chores, how her last boyfriend respected her opinions and treated her much nicer and how her relationship with her mother is improving.

Saint Peter explains to the three that heaven is getting overcrowded, and he is only letting people with horrible deaths to pass. The first man, confident in his story, goes first.

""I was suspecting my wife has been cheating on me for awhile, so I decided that I would come home early to prove my wife's innocence or catch her doing the dirty. When I came home, I immediately found my wife in our room, panting and naked. I looked around franticly for the other person, yelling at her at the same time. When I finally gave up, I decided to go onto my balcony , on the twelfth floor of my apartment, for a smoke to calm my nerves. I was admiring the city scenery when I looked down and low and behold a naked man was hanging from my balcony. I stepped on his fingers, one by one, until he was only holding on my his right index finger, in which I burned his finger with my cigarette. He fell, and that lucky bastard landed in the decorative bushes in front of the apartment. In all of my rage, I picked up my kitchen refrigerator and through it at the guy. Unfortunately, the wire cord was curled around my leg, and I followed my fridge down, and now I'm here.""

Saint Peter, taken aback by the cruel murderous way he handled his situation, yet feeling bad for the mans situation and entertained by the obviously interesting story, let him through. He then motioned the second guy over, and the he starts telling his story.

""I was doing my daily naked yoga on my thirteenth story balcony, when the bars became loose, I wasn't with my peaceful self, and I fell of the balcony. Luckily, I was able to grab the balcony below me. Suddenly, a man came out for a smoke. I tried yelling for him to help, but the city noises drowned me out. When he finally found me, he got stomping mad. And I mean he was stomping my fingers, one by one, until he put his cigarette out on my last finger. I fell of, said a small prayer, and I landed in a bush. Because of my miraculous circumstances, I gave one more prayer in thanks, and when I look back up, and a large white mass comes crashing down on me. And now I'm in front of you.""

Saint Peter was very sympathetic, noticing the similarities between the first and second man, and decides to let him pass for injustice. Saint Peter beckoned the third guy over, when he says, ""Oh, I almost didn't recognize you!

Hi Dave!""",Three men die and go to heaven.,0
