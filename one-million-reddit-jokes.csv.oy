The barber puts a dollar bill in one hand and two quarters in the other, then calls the boy over and asks, “Which do you want, son?”

The boy takes the quarters and leaves the dollar.

“What did I tell you?” said the barber. “That kid never learns!”

Later, the customer leaves, and sees the same young boy coming out of the ice cream store. He asks. “Hey, son! May I ask you a question? Why did you take the quarters instead of the dollar bill?”

The boy licked his cone and replied, “Because the day I take the dollar, the game’s over!”

The cannibal chief, showing mercy, decided to give them a chance to survive.

The men listened eagerly.

""In the middle of the island is a jungle that is filled with every fruit in the world. You must venture in there and pick ten pieces of your favourite fruit and come before me. If you can shove the ten pieces of fruit up your ass without making a single expression, I will let you live.""

The first man walks into the jungle and comes back with ten apples. He shoves the first one, then the second one in, but the third one is too much and he makes a funny face. He is killed brutally.

The second man walks into the jungle and comes back with ten grapes. He shoves the first, the second, all the way until the ninth grape. Just as he is about to insert the tenth one in, suddenly he lets out one of the loudest laughs known to humanity. The chief of the tribe is surprised, but kills him too.

Then she would proceed to yell and scream at him, for his constant nights out and always coming home in a drunken state. But Merle just continued his nightly routine.
 One day, the wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior and was particularly distraught by it all.
 The friend listened and said, ""Why don't you treat him a little differently when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words and welcome him home with a kiss? Then he might change his ways.""
 The wife thought that this might be a good idea.
 That night, Merle took off again after dinner. And at about midnight, he arrived home in his usual condition.
 His wife heard him at the door. She quickly opened it and let Merle in.
 Instead of berating him as she had always done, this time she took his arm and led him into the living room. She sat Merle down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the ottoman and took his shoes off. Then she went behind him and started to cuddle him a little.

post,60nasf,2qh72,jokes,false,1490099508,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/60nasf/mahatma_gandhis_sass/,self.jokes,,"When Gandhi was studying law at the University College of London, a white professor, whose last name was Peters, disliked him intensely and always displayed prejudice and animosity towards him. Also, because Gandhi never lowered his head when addressing him, as he expected…. there were always “arguments” and confrontations.

One day, Mr Peters was having lunch at the dining room of the University, and Gandhi came along with his tray and sat next to the professor. The professor said, “Mr Gandhi, you do not understand. A pig and a bird do not sit together to eat.”
Gandhi looked at him as a parent would a rude child and calmly replied, “You do not worry professor. I’ll fly away,” and he went and sat at another table.

Mr Peters, reddened with rage, decided to take revenge on the next test paper, but Gandhi responded brilliantly to all questions. Mr Peters, unhappy and frustrated, asked him the following question. “Mr Gandhi, if you were walking down the street and found a package, and within was a bag of wisdom and another bag with a lot of money, which one would you take?”

Without hesitating, Gandhi responded, “The one with the money, of course.”

Mr Peters, smiling sarcastically said, “I, in your place, would have taken the wisdom, don’t you think?”

Gandhi shrugged indifferently and responded, “Each one takes what he doesn’t have.”

Mr Peters, by this time, was fit to be tied. So great was his anger that he wrote on Gandhi’s exam sheet the word “idiot” and gave it to Gandhi. Gandhi took the exam sheet and sat down at his desk trying very hard to remain calm while he contemplated his next move.

A few minutes later, Gandhi got up, went to the professor and said to him in a dignified but sarcastically polite tone, “Mr Peters, you signed the sheet, but you did not give me the grade.”",Mahatma Gandhi's sass,1625

It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" 

The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. 

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating. The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.

First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. 

Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. 

First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" 

Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed."" 

Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

One day, his dad gets a new job, so his family has to move to a new city. Johnny's dad thinks, ""I'll get a head start on Johnny's gambling."" He calls the teacher and says, ""My son Johnny will be starting your class tomorrow, but he likes to gamble, so you'll have to keep an eye on him."" The teacher says, ""Okay,"" because she can handle it.

The next day, Johnny walks into class and hands the teacher an apple and says, ""Hi, my name is Johnny."" She says, ""Yes, I know who you are."" Johnny smiles and says, ""I bet you $10 you've got a mole on your butt."" The teacher thinks that she will break his little gambling problem, so she takes him up on the bet. She pulls her pants down, shows him her butt, and there is no mole.

That afternoon, Johnny goes home and tells his dad that he lost $10 to the teacher and explains why. His dad calls the teacher and says, ""Johnny said that he bet you that you had a mole on your butt and he lost."" The teacher says, ""Yeah, and I think I broke his gambling problem."" Johnny's dad laughs and says, ""No you didn't, he bet me $100 this morning that he'd see your ass before the day was over.""

Being an amphibian of modest means, he had nothing to offer as collateral except for a family heirloom: a small, bejeweled trinket that had adorned his family's curio cabinet for generations.  Freddy took it down, brushed off the dust, shined it up real nice, and, after wrapping the ornament carefully, headed to the bank.  

He met with the loan officer at the bank, one Patty Black.  Freddy could tell from the way she looked at him that she was simply not sympathetic to his situation; either that or she just didn't like frogs - a real shame to have such dated views in today's progressive society.  Freddy explained that he had brought collateral that should be more than sufficient to cover the amount he was requesting, but the loan officer wouldn't give him the time of day.  Dejected, Freddy nearly walked out the door, but instead steeled his nerve and demanded to speak with the bank manager.  

The manager came and met with the frog and the loan officer, and Freddy explained the situation, saying he had sufficient collateral, and he saw no reason except sheer discrimination that he should be denied a loan.  The manager asked Freddy just what he had brought for collateral.  Freddy unwrapped his sparkling bauble and held it out for the loan officer and manager to see.  The manager's eyes grew wide at the beauty of the trinket, and he looked at the loan officer and snapped,

The surgeon, with a sympathetic look on his face, informed the foodie that, due to a congenital genetic defect, his hard palate was slowly eroding and would require immediate surgery.  ""Not to worry, though, my good sir, as I use only state-of-the-art techniques, and the best metal palate prostheses available!"" the surgeon informed the man.  Having no choice, the man agreed and the surgery was a complete success!  

This particular foodie, however, happened to be the world's preeminent authority on hollandaise sauce, and he consumed large quantities of it every day.  As a result, the high acidity from the lemon juice in the sauce quickly began to corrode his new metal plate.  He returned to the oral surgeon, and explained the situation.  ""Fear not!"" the surgeon said.  ""Why just this week, a new type of plate was made available to us!  It's made of chrome and won't corrode!  You could eat all the hollandaise sauce you want!"" The foodie agreed to undergo the additional procedure and it again was a complete success.  

Several months later, the man returned to the surgeon and reported that he had no problems with his new chrome palate, and he could carry out his tasting and critiquing to his heart's content.  As he left, he smiled at the surgeon and said,

However, the homeless man is shaking his head. He says, ""I memorized every digit in pi.""

The mathematician says, ""you can't have, it's impossible. Tell me all the digits then.""

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. 

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!
With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

A couple minutes later, everything starts to seem vibrant and oddly colorful.

He starts to hallucinate.

He follows what appears to be a trail and runs into a French chameleon. 

The chameleon says ""bonjour monsieur!"". 

The traveler smiles with wide eyes having never felt this kind of high. 

He couldn't speak french, so he moves on a bit baffled without responding. 

A couple minutes down to trail, the traveler starts feeling dizzy and develops and slight stomach ache. 

A Spanish salamander appears.

The salamander says ""Hola señor! Todo bien?""

The traveler says ""hola"" in response, but did not know any Spanish beyond that. 

He continued on his way.

The dizziness and stomach pains quickly become unbearable. 

The traveler vomits and collapses under a tree. 

His breathing is heavy.

The thought of death starts looming in his nauseous mind. 

He is trying his best to keep his teary eyes open, hoping it will keep him alive until the high wears off.  

Out of nowhere, A British gecko appears. 

The gecko says ""So sorry old chap, you had some poisonous mushrooms, you'll be gone in a short bit, but I do have good news though.""

With a weak breathe, the traveler mutters ""whats the good news?""

The Gecko says 

""I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico.""

After unpacking, and a good nights rest, little Jonny was awakened pretty early in the morning, by a loud voice coming from the church next door. He peered out his window to see the preacher walking around the outside of the church constantly yelling, ""Open your doors, open them wide, let the good lord come inside."" Little Jonny was annoyed, but thought, ""Maybe it's just a random one time thing."" The next morning, little Jonny was woken up early again. The preacher yelling, ""Open your doors, open them wide, let the good lord come inside. Little Jonny was pretty frustrated by this point, but figured, ""Surly there's no way this old fart does this every day."" Sure enough the next morning, little Jonny was woken up early yet again. ""Open your doors, open them wide, let the good lord come inside"", yelled the preacher. Little Jonny, now very angry, opens his window, and tells the preacher, ""Why don't you just shut the hell up, I'm trying to sleep!"" The preacher then says to little Jonny, ""Son, the good lord doesn't like it when you use language like that, and he says there are better ways to solve life's problems."" Little Jonny thought about what the preacher said that day. The next morning the preacher strolled around the church again and began to shout, ""Open your doors, Open them wide""... suddenly POW...... Moments later, ""Close your doors, Close em Quick, some Son-of-a-Bitch done hit me with a brick.""

The second passenger, Malcolm Turnbull said, “I am the Prime Minister of Australia and I am the smartest man in Australian history, so Australia’s people don’t want me to die.”

He took the second parachute and jumped out of the plane.
The third passenger, John Kerry said, “I’m a Senator and a decorated war hero from the Army of the United States of America.”

He grabbed the parachute next to him and jumped.
The fourth passenger, ex-President George W Bush said to the fifth passenger, a 10 year old schoolgirl:

“I have lived a full life and served my country the best I could. I will sacrifice my life and let you have the last parachute.”

With each slap of his forehead, his member grew until it was quite 
impressively long. ""Well"", she said. ""That's quite impressive, but it's still 
pretty narrow."" 

""No problem,"" he said again and started pulling his ears. With each pull 
his member grew wider and wider until the entire measurement was 
extremely exciting to the woman.

love. The next day the couples rejoined their normal partners and went

""I came home early and found my wife lying naked in bed.  She claimed she had just got out of the shower.  Well, her hair was dry and I checked the shower and it was completely dry too.  I knew she was into some hanky-panky and I began to look for her lover.  I went onto the balcony of our 9th floor apartment and found the bugger clinging to the rail by his fingertips.  I was so mad that I bashed his fingers with a flower pot. He let go and fell, but some awnings and bushes broke his fall.  On seeing he was still alive I found some super human strength to drag our antique cedar chest to the balcony and throw it over.  It hit the man and killed him. At this point the stress got to me and I suffered a heart attack and died.""  

Saint Peter thanked him and sent him on to the waiting room.  The second applicant said that his last day was his worst.  

""I was on the roof of an apartment building working on the AC equipment.  I stumbled over my tools and toppled off the building.  I managed to grab onto the balcony rail of a 9th floor apartment but some idiot came running out on there and bashed my hands with a flower pot.  I fell, hit some awnings and bushes and survived, but as I looked up I saw a huge chest falling toward me.  I tried to crawl out of the way but couldn't and was hit and killed.""  

Saint Peter couldn't help but chuckle as he directs the man to the waiting room.  Saint Peter is still giggling when his third customer of the day enters.  He apologizes and says  

""I doubt that your last day was as interesting as the two fellows that arrived here just before you.""

One day one of the female flies decides she wants to get out of the jar. She goes up to the other female fly and says, ""Hey how do you get out of the jar?""

So the female fly goes up to the male fly and asks, ""Hey, how do you get out of this jar?""

The male fly says, "" I can tell you but you have to fuck me first.""
And flies....they aren't very smart. So they do it and the male fly tells the female fly, ""You start from the bottom of the jar and fly as fast you can to the top of the jar and Boom, you'll pop right out.""

So the female fly does just that. Flies from the bottom of the jar to the top of the jar as fast as she can. SPLAT. Dies. 

Later on the surviving female fly decides she wants to get out of the jar. So she goes up to the male fly and asks, ""Hey, how do you get out of this jar?""

The male fly says, "" I can tell you but you have to fuck me first.""
And flies....they aren't very smart. So they do it and the male fly tells the female fly, ""You start from the bottom of the jar and fly as fast you can to the top of the jar and Boom, you'll pop right out.""

""I'm very happy to be here with the fine people of NASA today. Very happy. As you know, during my campaign I promised the people that I would Make America Great Again. We had a great campaign, didn't we? The best. The very best. Marvelous. Anyway, you folks here at NASA have accomplished some amazing things over the years. The moon landing: great! The Mars robot car thing, just great. But to be honest, that's old news. Old news. I know you're working on projects to go back to the moon and mars, but today I'm here to announce that we're scrapping all that. Let Europe or China do all that. They can have it. It's boring. We need a bold, new vision to show our greatness to the world once again. So, today, I'm directing NASA to begin a new American space project:""

The President continued to stare at him.

""...uh, that is to say, it's hot, sir. The sun is very, very hot. Any ship we sent would melt long before it could reach the sun. Sir.""

Trump furrowed his brow, and said ""Huh. Hadn't thought of that. Let me make a few calls. I know some smart guys. Very smart. Give me an hour and I'll get back to you.""

An hour later, Trump re-entered the room, and once again stepped to the lectern.

""Ok, we got it. It was actually Dr. Ben Carson who came up with this. Great guy. Did you know that he's black? The blacks, they just love me. They really do.

The little guy, however, is a complete jerk.  He spends the night tripping waiters, knocking people's drinks over, and laughing a mean little laugh.

""Why are you hanging out with the little guy?  he's a jerk to everyone.""

The rich man sighs, and explains.  ""Years ago, I found a genie, and I was given three wishes.  The first wish was for all the money I could ever want.  The second wish for to be surrounded by beautiful women all my life.""

There once was a woman named June
Who was born about nine months too soon
She didn't have the luck
To be born by a fuck
She was scraped off the sheets with a spoon

There once was a fellow named Mike
Who used to love riding his bike
Till one day on some ruts
He lost his seat and his nuts
And now he's built like a dyke

There once was a girl named Monique
Who was an anal sex freak
She did it so often
That when she'd start coughin'
Her overworked asshole would leak

There once was a fellow named Larry
Who searched for a virgin to marry
He hooked up with Eileen
Who was barely thirteen 
But his heart stopped as he popped her cherry

I should tell you more 'bout Eileen
Because she's finally turning eighteen
Her second husband Barry
Met the same fate as Larry
And nine other guys in between

There once was a guy named Luigi
Who claimed that he was from Fiji
But I swear that he's Greek
'Cuz I saw him last week
Fuck himself in the ass with a squeegee

There once was a woman named Trish
Whose twat always smelled like dead fish
She asked for a fuck
I said no such luck
Ain't no one granting that wish

There once was a guy named Tyrese
Who loved getting blow jobs from geese
Their necks are so long
That they'd swallow his schlong
Just deep enough for his release 

There once was a fellow named Joe
Who couldn't get his cock to grow
With one mighty pinch
He'd have half an inch
But that's all he had to show

There once was a woman named Jane
Whose husband thought she was insane
She'd bathe in dog shit
Then nibble her tit
While fucking her ass with a cane

There once was a fellow named Chuck
Who said after screwing a duck,
""I told him to blow me
But I didn't know he
Was only looking to fuck!""

There once was a woman named Jenny
Who offered her twat for a penny
She made thousands of bucks
From all of those fucks
But she never could say just how many

There once was a fellow named Ken
Who gave up on women and men
After taking a horse 
Balls-deep, of course,
No human could fuck him again.

There once was a woman named Joan
Who loved to have sex on the phone
But she'd get so loud
That quite a large crowd
Would gather to hear the girl moan

There once was a guy named Ahmed
Who really enjoyed getting head
Till his father's prized goat
Got a load down her throat
If daddy finds out, he'll be dead

There once was a fellow named Tony
Who claimed to be hung like a pony
But the truth was revealed
When one young girl squealed
""His crotch is stuffed with bologna!""

There once was a woman named Kate
Who thought that small dicks were great
Till her twat turned all wonky
After she fucked a donkey
And came for twelve hours straight

There once was a fellow named Pete
Who'd blow random guys on the street
Deep throating was a cinch
And at five bucks an inch
He was never lacking fresh meat

There once was a woman named Ann
Who wanted to become a man
She found a cheap doctor
Who numbed her and cocked her
Now he fucks himself all that she can

There once was a fellow named Daniel
Who was hung like a cocker spaniel
Asked a blind girl down south
While fucking her mouth,
""Can't see it coming, can y'all?""

There once was a fellow named Paul
Who was cursed with only one ball
He lost the other
While fucking his brother
In a jail cell beneath city hall

There once was a fellow named Mark
Who loved to jerk off in the park
When he'd whip it out
The kids would all shout
""Come again once it gets dark!""

There once was a woman named Bridget
Who, in a bar, hit on a midget
But his cock was so small
She barely felt it at all
Even though it was totally rigid",23 Limericks,15
