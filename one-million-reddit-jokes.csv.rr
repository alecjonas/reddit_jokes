The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk",The strange sound,305

After several weeks, he notices that none of the sheep are getting pregnant, and phones a vet for help.
The vet tells him that he should try artificial insemination.
The farmer doesn't have the slightest idea what this means but, not wanting to display his ignorance, only asks the vet how he will know when the sheep are pregnant. The vet tells him that they will stop standing around and instead will lie down and wallow in grass when they are pregnant. The man hangs up and gives it some thought. He comes to the conclusion that artificial insemination means he has to impregnate the sheep himself. So, he loads the sheep into his Land Rover, drives them out into the woods, has sex with them all, brings them back, and goes to bed.
Next morning, he wakes and looks out at the sheep. Seeing that they are all still standing around, he deduces that the first try didn't take, and loads them in the Land Rover again. He drives them out to the woods, bangs each sheep twice for good measure, brings them back, and goes to bed exhausted.
Next morning, he wakes to find the sheep still just standing round. ""Try again"" he tells himself, and proceeds to load them up, and drive them out to the woods. He spends all day banging the sheep and upon returning home, falls listlessly into bed.
The next morning, he cannot even raise himself from the bed to look out of the window. He asks his wife to look, and tell him if the sheep are lying in the grass.
""No,"" she says, ""They're all in the piggin Land Rover, and one of them is beeping the horn.""",Artificial Insemination,20

He walks inside and the lady at the front desk immediately stops him and says ""I'm sorry son but you are too young to receive any of the services that we offer here.  Are you lost?  Would you like me to help you find your parents?"" 

He flashes her a few hundred dollar bills and she says ""Well okay then, how can I help you?""

""I would like to sleep with the nastiest woman that you have here.  I want the woman with the most stds."" He says.

""Well that is certainly odd request,"" she replies, ""but we can most definitely help you with that.""  

So the boy goes off and sleeps with the most disgusting prostitute of them all and just before he leaves the lady at the front desk stops him.

""Excuse me, I'm sorry but I have to ask.  Of all the beautiful women we have here, why did you want to sleep with her?""

He pauses for a moment then responds, ""Ok I will only answer because you let me in here.  Well when I go home tonight my parents are going to go out to dinner, so they are going to need a baby sitter.  Well I am going to fuck the baby sitter and she is going to contract all of the stds I got from that nasty beast I just slept with.  When my parents finally return from their night out, my baby sitter is going to need a ride home.  So my dad will go and drop her off at her house.  But before that happens, my dad is going to convince her to sleep with him as well and then he will receive all of the stds.  When my dad gets back he is still going to be a little horny, so he is going to go upstairs and have sex with my mom and all the stds will be transferred to her.  Well the next morning after my dad leaves for work and I'm at school, the milkman is going to stop by and drop off the day's milk.  Well my mom is going to sleep with the milkman and he is going to contract all the stds that she has, and that's the son of a bitch who ran over my frog.""",A twelve year old boy is walking along the side of a road...,706

You'd like to just drop it and pretend you didn't even say anything, but people are being polite. Everyone is just waiting on you to finish right now. It is clear to you and everyone around you that nothing good will come out of it anyway. So you want to rush it to the end and be done with it, but maybe, just maybe you can pull it off? Maybe you do something unexpected, maybe you improvise and it turns out to be a good joke? Then you try and you've just dug the hole deeper. No one expected anything anymore and you managed to ruin even that. So you seriously consider apologizing to everyone and just leave, you know?

Well, Jimmy isn't thrilled with the idea of getting tied up, spanked and sticking a pickle up his behind. But agrees to get a Classic Vlasic Ass-Lick, since all his buddies said it was incredible.

So she strips him down, ties him up, bends him over and starts spanking him with various toys.  Jimmy is rather surprised how much he likes it, but still pretty nervous about the pickle insertion, so he asks her to please be gentle when she sticks it in his butt.

She tells him not to worry, grabs a large pickle and a paddle, and pounds it deep inside Jimmy's rear end, until the pickle disapears with a ""pop!"" Then proceeds to give him the most amazing, multiple orgasm inducing, rim job of his life.

When finished, Jimmy exclaims, ""That was incredible!  But how exactly do i get the pickle out now?""

However, he is stopped by a white, male TSA Agent. The agent scans his passport, but it is not acceped. The businessman is surprised, as he was able to come to New York without problem. He demands to speak to a supervisor. 

The supervisor, a Muslim male that grew up in Italy, examines the passport. It was all well. 

He then sees that the scanner isn't working properly. Since the man didn't look like much of a threat, the supervisor exclaimed that he's okay to pass. 

The TSA Agent starts arguing, that this man shouldn't be allowed to pass just based on looks. The supervisor and the Agent start arguing, that his passport checks out, even if the scanner doesn't say so. Fed up, the supervisor exclaims ""ALLOW A-KABAAR!""

As he waits, he can hear the sound of her tight panties rolling down her long legs and imagines what is being exposed. Unable to contain his animal thoughts a moment longer, he reaches through a gap in the foliage, and his hand touches her leg. 

He quickly brings his hand further up her thigh until suddenly, and with great astonishment, he finds himself gripping a long, thick appendage that's hanging between her legs. 

He shouts in horror, ""My God, Claudette, I had no idea you were actually a man!""

Sad little jail cells really, with only a solitary, tiny window to peek into the outside. So they pass the time as best they can by telling each other jokes.

One day, Jack asks , ""Got any new jokes, Joe?""

""Sorry"" Joe says. ""I told you every joke I know months ago.  You got anymore new jokes?""

Jack thinks for a moment and says, ""Well... I do have one more joke.  But it's one of those jokes you gotta write down.  It's not funny when you say it out loud. Gotta draw a picture and stuff.""

Joe suggests, ""Why don't write it on a piece of paper, and throw it over here?""

Jack agrees, and spends all week collecting the perfect materials, rewriting the perfect joke, drawing the perfect accommodating picture, and shaping that joke into a perfectly aerodynamic and balanced paper plane.

On Friday evening, when the lights go out, and the guards are changing shifts, Jack tells Joe, ""Ok! Here comes the joke!""

He tosses the paper plane, it sails  across the prison hallway, slips between the prison cell bars, and glides directly towards Joe's awaiting hands.

Just as Joe is about to grab the paper plane, it gets caught in an updraft.  It bounces again the ceiling once, and then glides out the tiny cell window.

""Did you get the joke?"" Jack asks.

""No, sorry!"" Joe responds. ""It went right over my head.""

A priest comes by, stops and watches throngs of people giving money to the beggar behind the cross, but none give to the beggar behind the Star of David. Finally, the priest goes over to the beggar behind the Star of David and says, ""My poor fellow, don't you understand? This is a Catholic country; this city is the seat of Catholicism. People aren't going to give you money if you sit there with a Star of David in front of you, especially when you're sitting beside a beggar who has a cross. In fact, they would probably give to him just out of spite."" The beggar behind the Star of David listened to the priest, turned to the other beggar with the cross and said: ""Moishe, look who's trying to teach the Goldstein brothers about marketing.""

The gay bartender asks, ""First time here? What can i get you, buddy?"" 

The guy says, ""I'm not a buddy, Homo Henry. You insightful and handsome barkeep!"" And punches the bartender in the face. 

A black man in a wheelchair rolls up and says, ""Hey! Who do you think you are?  No need to hit people, pal."" 

The guy says, ""My name is not pal, Wheelchair Willy. You physically challenged, yet inspiring person!"" And punches him in the face. 

A transsexual notices the commotion and says ""Whoa! Please stop! You are obviously new here. This is a tolerant bar. Why are you punching everyone, dude?"" 

The guy responds, ""The name is not dude, Trans Terry.  You charming and talented individual! How's the new album coming along?""  And  punches him/her in the face.

This goes on for a few minutes. Mike the Jewish Muslim, ""perceptive and articulate"". POW! 

Frank the Furry, ""artistic genius, great TED talk"". POW! 

Breastfeeding Betty and her Albino Baby, ""empowering and courageous, really enjoyed the blog."" POW! POW! 

Kind Old Colorblind Carl, ""pretty chill, and just all around cool guy."" POW! 

Finally an attractive white feminist walks up says, ""Hey! Stop that! What's with all the face punching, guy?"" 

""Finally! Someone remembers my name!"" 

""What's your name!? "" She asks.

""My name is Guy! But I prefer to be called Face Punching Guy now. I came here a few weeks ago, and met all of you. I can't believe everyone here forgot me. I remembered all of you, and your cool nicknames! You're Feminist Franny. I bought you and the whole bar a few rounds.""

She asks, ""So, Guy, you just been punching all these people because they forgot who you are? That's not very tolerant!""  

To which he replies, ""No, no! It's all a big misunderstanding!  I've always identified as a face puncher. I just never had the courage to do it until recently.  I'm sure I told everyone here I was transitioning. That's why I bought the drinks last time!""

Face Punching Guy continues, ""I guess I figured if I face punched a few people tonight, maybe they would remember me.  I apologize if I offended anyone. But if you can't accept me for who I am, it's ok, I'll just be on my way, and try to find a more tolerant establishment...""

Well, the regular patrons called a meeting to discuss the situation. 

Everyone in the bar felt awful that they forgot the face punching guy.  

And they all noted that he had said some pretty nice and accurate things before face punching them. 

Besides, this was the most tolerant bar in the world, so they agreed to accept him for who he was.

So, Feminist Franny goes back and tells him, ""We all just want to express how sorry we are for forgetting you. And we accept you for who you are. And we really appreciate that you remembered all those personal details about each and everyone of us. You are obviously a very observant and nice guy.""

""Thanks!"" He replies. ""I'm so glad you understand, Franny. You stuck up bitch who gave me a fake phone number.""  And punches her in the face.

Destination-Timbuktu.

She again replied, ""Why, yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster. He's lazy, bigoted, and has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone  and his law practice is one of the worst in the state. Not to  mention he cheated on his wife with three different women.

She immediately throws the boy out of her class and tells him to wait outside for the rest of the class. She throws the test paper on his face too.

The boy is then spotted by the headmistress.
Shes asks the boy why he is outside and not in class. He tells her the teacher kicked him out of the class because he got 9 out of 10 in his spelling test. The headmistress is puzzled. She asks for the spelling test to make sure and on noticing the misspelled word, she grabs the boy harshly and directs him to her office without a word.
The boy is now crying and very confused.

The headmistress calls the boy's mother and informs her that her son no longer has a place in her school.
The boy's mother is furious and demands a reason why. On finding out, the mother apologizes to the headmistress, and says that she no longer has a son.
The boy is now devastated. He never expected his mother to react like this and he still couldn't understand why misspelling the word Russia was such a big deal.
The school has kicked him out to the streets. He is scared to go home. He has no idea what he can do. He settles on crying on the pavement.

Coincidentally, his uncle was riding his bicycle and spotted his nephew crying. The boy's uncle himself was an illiterate and didnt have any education.
He asks his nephew why he was crying and why he was not in school.
The boy replies (crying while he did) "" I got 9 out of 10 in my spelling test. So my Teacher kicked me out. The headmistress saw me outside the class, and asked what i was doing and so i told her what the teacher did. She dragged me to her office and called my mother and told her that i will be expelled from the school. Then my mother said that i am.."" (starts crying and cant speak)

His uncle had heard enough. He hugged the boy and bought him ice cream. He told the boy that everything would be fine. The uncle started cheering up the boy with silly jokes. 
His uncle was taking him to his house on the bicycle. 
Someway along the way, He asked the boy ""By the way, what was the word you misspelled that everybody is having such a problem with?""
The boy had purposely not told his uncle this bit of the story fearing a similar reaction from him. The boy murmurs ""Russia""
His uncle frantically stops his bike, and slaps the boy to the tar road. He continues riding his bike.

The boy is again left devastated. He cannot understand why this is such a problem with everybody.
He goes to the nearby Port where he knows his father must be working.
He sees his father and runs at him for a hug. He is crying. His father is caught completely by surprise, and asks what he was doing here of all places.

The boy decided to tell his father a white lie. He told his father that school had ended early today and that mother had given permission to leave the house.

His father actually is happy to see his son as he doesnt get much time with him due to his job. So he decides to take his son for fishing in the ocean. He readies a boat to take and all the necessary equipment. He is suspicious of his sons story and wants to get to the bottom of it.

They start riding but before they reach the spot, his father looks at his son seriously and says ""Look i know what you told me is not true or atleast not the complete truth. I know your mother would never let you outside this far, so tell me the truth""

The boy almost starts crying. ""Before i tell you, promise you wont be mad?""
""I'll be more angry if you lie to me and dont tell me the truth""

Tho boy lets out a huge sigh and starts ""I had a spelling test today. I got 9 out of 10. Because of that my teacher threw me out of the class. Then the headmistress saw me outside class, and when i told her what the teacher had done, she took me to the office and rung up mom. She told mom that i will be expelled from school. And mom said i was no longer her son. Then when they kicked me out of the school, your brother showed up, and when i told him what had happened he slapped and left me too.""

His father thought his son was trying to play some kind of joke. ""Listen, i know what you're trying to do. You told me this stupid story so that i overreact. and then you tell me that you were kidding and then tell me the real thing. I know that trick. it wont fool me. So tell me what happened really""

The boy insisted that he is telling the truth. His father is confused now. He knows for sure his son is lying, but doesnt know why he wont admit it. 

The boy talks about every detail again and again. Soon enough his father is convinced. He says ""Okay son, i believe you. But tell me what the word you misspelled was?

The boy tries to bargain ""Does that even matter? 9 out of 10 are good marks. Nothing makes sense!""

His father asks again and the boy tells him ""Russia""

His father is outraged. He throws the boy out of the boat with nothing but a floating device.

***
Luckily, the boy drifts to shore. He is noticed by a passersby and is given assistance. 
The boy decides to never tell anyone ever about the events of his morning. He gets up and just walks away. He is in an unfamiliar town. From a little distance across the street, he notices a bakery with the Russian Flag on it. He decides to finally get to the bottom of this and find out the correct spelling.

He is filled with so many emotions as he runs to the bakery. He's finally going to know the spelling. He'll finally know why everything is so strange today.
And just at that moment, a speeding car collides with the boy and he immediately dies.

""We were greeted with a bright flash of light, which our eyebands instantly analyzed,"" replies another, ""and you must be living in-"" and he instantly pulls up a 3D visualization of the Bay Area through his eyeband.

Tim is stunned. He looks around - there are grand skyscrapers, pods moving through transparent curved pipes and people on hoverboards all over, and on the ground he sees a big park with lush greenery. ""Which city is this?"" he exclaims. ""We're in Bakersfield, California. If you intended to travel to San Francisco, you entered the coordinates slightly wrong. It's okay, we can travel there in 5 minutes."" They look at Tim, who is just plain speechless.

One of them, a man with a beard, steps forward and says, ""You seem famished, I can take you someplace to eat."" After discussing with the others, the man says, ""Alright, let's go to Xox, it's right around the corner."" Tim reluctantly agrees. They go to Xox, where the bearded man gets two shots of a thick grey liquid. ""Bon appetit!"" and he drinks one up. Tim eyes it suspiciously, then drinks his shot as well. ""So what are we eating?"" he asks, and the man laughs, saying ""Wait for a few seconds. For $49.99 I've got to say it's pretty filling, worth its money."" 

After a minute, Tim becomes extremely full, like Thanksgiving-dinner-full. A minute later, he asks, ""Where's the restroom?""

After some research, they narrow their suspects down to 3 of their newest recruits.

In an effort to determine which of them is the spy, they concoct a test.

They let it slip to the first recruit that they will be moving storage of explosives and ammunition to the local hospital.

The second recruit is told that they will be transferring a massive oil shipment from a cargo area in the south of town for sale in Turkey in the morning.

The third recruit and final suspect is told that all the senior commanders will be holding a meeting at an abandoned building in the center of town at midnight.

The commanders, confident that they will be able to determine which recruit is the Russian spy, all decide to go to sleep somewhere in the east of town - far from any of the targets they just designated.

The Russians got wind from their spy that the local hospital is being used to store munitions and explosives. They then carpet bombed the entire town. There were no survivors.",ISIS has suspicions that one of their town's members is a Russian spy,8

'I work just as long and hard as you do but how is it that you bring home a suitcase full of £10 notes every day?'

Ali says, 'Look at your sign, what does it say'?

Habib's sign reads
'I have no work, a wife and 6 kids to support'.

Ali  says No wonder you only get £2- £3

Habib says... 'So what does your sign say'?

Ali shows Habib his sign....

“What are those for?” he asked.

“I’ve been called to see the king. I thought it would be best to bring some kind of present.”

“You’re bringing him turnips? But turnips are peasant food! He’s a king! You should bring him something more appropriate, like grapes.”

Nasruddin agreed, and came to the king carrying a bunch of grapes. The king was not amused. “You’re giving me grapes? But I’m a king! This is ridiculous. Take this idiot out and teach him some manners! Throw each and every one of the grapes at him and then kick him out of the palace.”

The emperor’s guards dragged Nasruddin into a side room and began pelting him with grapes. As they did so, he fell on his knees and began crying, “Thank you, thank you God, for your infinite mercy!”

“Why are you thanking God?” they asked. “You’re being totally humiliated!”

Nasruddin replied, “Oh, I was just thinking, ‘Thank God I didn’t bring the turnips!’ ”

Good old Steve-o was a nice enough looking bloke, good personality, smooth with the ladies, the kinda lad you'd love to go grab brekkie with the next morning. But he had one flaw-- he was missing an eye, and had it replaced with a timber one. It was a nice enough replacement, but he still looked a bit off because of it, and it hurt his style. 

One night, Steve-o is out drinking and he sees a gorgeous woman, but her mouth is on sideways. He thinks to himself, ""this is perfect! She's just like me, beautiful except for this one flaw!""

He buys her a VB (like a true gentleman) and starts talking with her. They hit it off, and things go great. As the night starts winding down, he asks, ""would you like to come back to my flat?""

She says, ""oh, would I!""

The Frenchman and the Afghani man think giving things to their countries is a wonderful idea. They set course for France where the Frenchman wants to drop an item to bring joy to people.

While over France, the Frenchman picks up a case of wine, and before dropping it over the edge of the basket, he says ‘I hope that this will be found by some countrymen who have fallen on hard times, and that drinking it and sharing it with friends and family will boost their spirits.’

On their last stop, Afghanistan, the Irishman and French man are curious what the Afghani man will toss over the edge, as his country is in such peril. Rather than something to bring happiness, the Afghani man picks up a bomb, tossing it out of the basket while cackling. He reveals to his companions that he is a terrorist, and says ‘I hope this brings misery and suffering!’

At the end of their balloon voyage (which was probably pretty awkward after Afghanistan), the three men go back to their home countries, hoping to see the difference the items they threw overboard made.

When the Irishman arrived in Dublin, he was horrified to see a large group of orphans begging for change and food scraps outside of the boarded up orphanage where up until recently, they lived. When he asked why the orphanage closed, one of the beggars explained that the kindly woman who ran the orphanage was on her way to pay their rent and pick up food, when a sack of potatoes fell from the sky and crushed her, leaving them homeless and starving.

Meanwhile in Paris, the Frenchmen was horrified when he opened up a newspaper and read about a freak accident at an outdoor wedding. A large case of wine fell from out of the sky, causing the tent the wedding was taking place under to collapse on all the guests and the many lit candles adorning the tables. The tent went up in flames, killing everyone trapped beneath it.

In Kabul, the Afghani terrorist was prowling the streets, looking for the place his bomb had fallen. He soon came to the smouldering wreckage of a building and looked around expectantly for sobbing people and grieving families. Instead, an unpleasant odour filled the air, and he saw a group of people near the blast, covering their noses and laughing hysterically. None were laughing harder than a man in the centre of their group, who had tears running down his face from laughing so hard.

The terrorist was enraged, and asked the man what was so funny. Why weren’t they wailing in grief? Still laughing, and wiping away tears, the man looked at the terrorist and said ‘I farted, and the building behind me exploded.’","An Irishman, a Frenchman, and an Afghani man are riding around the world in a balloon...",3
