She quickly picked it up, but they didn't know what to do with it, so they took it home. There, she counted the money - it was $50,000!
The husband said: ""We've got to give it back"". She said, ""Finders keepers"" and put the money back in the bag and hid it up in their attic.
The next day, two FBI men who were going from door-to-door in the neighborhood looking for the money showed up at their home. One knocked on the door and said: ""Pardon me, but did either of you find any money that fell out of an armored car yesterday?"" She said: ""No.""

It was Spring and he wanted to dig his tomato garden, as he had done every year, but it was very hard work for the aging man as the ground was hard. His only son, Vincent, who used to help him, was currently in prison. The old man wrote a letter to his son and described his predicament:

*""Dear Vincent,
I am feeling pretty bad because it looks like I won't be able to plant my tomato garden this year. I'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. If only you were here my troubles would be over. I know you would dig the plot for me. Love Dad""*

A few days later he received a letter from his son:

*""Dear Dad,
Not for nothing, but don't dig up that garden. That's where I buried the BODIES.
Love Vinnie""*

At 4 a.m. the next morning, FBI agents and local police arrived at the old man's house and dug up the entire area. However, they didn't find any bodies, so they apologized to the old man and left.

That same day the old man received another letter from his son.

*""Dear Dad,
Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now. That's the best I could do under the circumstances.

One night, she confided in him that she was pregnant. Not wanting to ruin his reputation or his marriage, he promised that he would pay her a large sum of money if she would go to Italy to secretly have the child. Furthermore, if she stayed in Italy to raise the child, he would also provide child support until the child turned 18. She agreed, but she asked how he would know when the baby was born. To keep it discreet, he advised her to simply mail him a post card, and write 'Spaghetti' on the back. He would then arrange for the child support payments to begin. One day, about nine months later, he came home to his confused wife. 

""Honey"", she said, ""You received a very strange postcard today."" 

""Oh, just give it to me and I'll explain it later,"" he replied. 

The wife obeyed, and watched her husband as he read the card. He turned white and fainted. On the card was written: “Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti. Three with meatballs. Two without.”

Two hippies are in a van, smoking weed and listening to the radio, because the city got nuked or some shit like that, so they don't have spotify. Suddenly an ad comes on, saying that for only 100 million dollars, anyone can book a flight to the moon for a one month vacation! The hippies are amazed, and immediately declare they’re going to buy some of these faaaar out tickets. Of course the problem was, they're fucking hippies, so they have no where near 100 million dollars..

 One of the hippies, named Dave , says,

 ""Hey we should hold up a bank"". 

The other hippy, whose name is Patrick, calls him a fucking idiot.

 ""We gotta start selling drugs, that's where the money is."" 

After an hour or so of arguing they split up to do their own thing and see how they go. 

Dave tries to rob a bank, but a worker there notices that his gun is actually a dildo, and tackles him. He goes to jail, makes some friends in the mafia, and when he gets out he becomes a street-level dealer, pushing mainly weed and crack before moving up the ranks to become the leader of his side of town after crippling his former leader. Unfortunately for him, one of his compatriots nicknamed Peg-Legged Pete wants his territory, and so he ambushes Dave, shooting him and leaving him for dead. However, Dave is no quitter, and he manages to get a hospital, recover, and reform his army.

Patrick, meanwhile, tries to start dealing drugs, and actually gets pretty far, ending up in Dave's cartel, although neither of them knew it. They never do end up finding out, as Patrick gets arrested After a few years, he is released, and launches a series of half-assed robberies that lead to him controlling a large criminal army. However, during one of these robberies, he gets car bombed, and during his recovery plots out an elaborate trap on the culprit that he executes after rising to the helm of a new gang.

After a few weeks of fighting, Patrick and Dave face off in the middle of a parking lot, finally realizing that they’d been fighting each other the whole time. Laughing, they meet in the middle, listening to the radio station that started it all, looking at the moon, thousands of miles away.

""Dude,” the hippies say.

At this point, I've grown tired of games, so I reach for my hat, but she takes it off her head and hides it behind her back (obviously taking into account that my arms can't match that circumference). She then says ""if you want it back, why don't you just give me your number?"". I say to her ""why don't you just give me back my hat, Mrs. Piggy?"". She looks at me defiantly, and says "" you can have your hat only if you're going to give me your number."" So I soften my face, smile, and say ""okay"".

After stumbling along the course for an hour he starts to get the hang of it and drives a long ball onto the green. He finally putts the ball into the hole when a few other golfers waiting at the same hole start yelling:

**""Mauvais trou!!! Mauvais trou!!!""**

The American smiles at the French golfer's compliments and yells back ""Thank you, I appreciate it!!""  He then heads back to his hotel, feeling satisfied with his golf performance.

That night he heads down to the hotel bar and starts chatting up a French girl who's grabbing a drink by herself. After a few drinks together they head back upstairs to his room and start fooling around. Things progress quickly and soon enough they're in bed together.

Wanting to impress his new French hookup the American is doing his best to pleasure her. It seems to be working as she starts yelling:

**""Mauvais trou!!! Mauvais trou!!!""**

Hearing this for the second time that day he keeps going, faster and faster! The French girl pushes him off suddenly and gives him a weird look.

Puzzled, the American says: ""What's wrong? I thought you were loving it! You kept yelling and moaning that phrase in French! Doesn't it mean something like good job??""

The teacher asked Mr.Trump if he would like to lead the discussion on the word 'tragedy.' So our illustrious POTUS asked the class for an example of a 'tragedy'.

One little boy stood up and offered: ""If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs him over and kills him, that would be a tragedy.""

""No,"" said Trump, ""that would be an accident.""
A little girl raised her hand: ""If a school bus carrying 50 children drove off a cliff, killing everyone, that would be a tragedy.""

""I'm afraid not,"" explained Trump. ""That's what we would call great loss.""
The room went silent. No other child volunteered. Trump searched the room.

""Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?""
Finally at the back of the room, Little Johnny raised his hand. The teacher held her breath.
In a quiet voice he said: ""If the plane carrying you was struck by a 'friendly fire' missile and blown to smithereens that would be a tragedy.""

""Fantastic!"" exclaimed Trump, ""That's right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?""
""Well,"" says Johnny, ""It has to be a tragedy, because it sure as hell wouldn't be a great loss... and you can bet your sweet ass it wouldn't be an accident either!""

The teacher left the room.",Donald Trump on tragedy,111

I paid with cash and was on my way, led up the small set of creaky stairs, coated by a thick layer of smog from cigarette smoke... or so I hope.

Awaiting in the topmost room was a beautiful whore, legs splayed to a 75-degree angle of pure sexuality. The only thing on my mind was lust. 

I removed my pants, my erection springing free into the open air. Each step took towards the bed creaked the floorboards incessantly. By now, my fuck-rod was just inches from her gaping hole, a cavernous thing no doubt already having hundreds of men like me enter her before.

Squish.

Drooping layers of white liquid gushed from her vaginal cavity; yet it was not mine. How was I supposed to get off to such a disgusting act? Taking the opportunity, I moved up to her sacred fourth hole. Not her mouth, not her shit-shute, no: I'm talking about her piss-hole. My penis wedged in-between her pussy lips.

And I fucked her urethra. 

It was quite clear no other customer had dared explore the upper genital regions, no doubt afraid by any STIs they might contract. After I had finished, I took notice of how most- if not all- of her orfices have been completely obliterated by my engorged member. A splooge-like substance covered everything.

God-damnit, I thought. I can't leave her like this.

So I zipped up my jeans, clicked my belt back into place, and walked once more down the small set of stairs. On the way out, I leaned over to the house's pimp, and whispered...

""Hey, John, the dead one's full again.""

That evening here comes little Johnny back up the road and the old man can’t believe his eyes, little Johnny’s got 20 ducks stuck to the tape.


The next morning here comes Johnny dragging a fence behind him so the old man calls out “Whatcha got there Johnny?” Little Johnny says “I got some chicken wire, I’m gonna catch me some chickens.” The old man laughs “Have fun boy everybody knows you can’t catch chickens with chicken wire.” Sure enough that evening he sees Johnny headed up the road dragging 30 chickens tangled in the wire behind him.


The next morning, he sees Johnny passing by dragging a bunch of plants behind him so the old man yells out “Whatcha got there little Johnny?” and little Johnny yelled back “pussy willows.” The old man yells out “hold on let me get my hat!”

down the middle and the ball rolled through. The ball finnally stopped 
about 5 ft from the hole. 
Jesus looked at Moses and said ""Good shot Moses."" 
Jesus was up next. He swung and it was a beautiful shot but it was 
also heading directly for the water puddle. So Jesus opened his eyes very 
wide and the golf ball sprouted legs and walked on the water. The ball 
finnally stopped about 3 ft from the hole. 
Moses looked at Jesus and said ""Good shot Jesus."" 
Finnally, it was the older man's turn. He swung and being a weak old 
man he only hit the ball about 15 ft. but before the ball stopped a gofer 
picks the ball up and begins to run away, then an eagle swoops down and 
grabs the gofer and begins to fly away with it, then a bolt of lightning 
strikes the eagle, the eagle drops the gofer, the gofer hits the ground, the 
ball flies out of its mouth and into the hole.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.  

 Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.  

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.  

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.  

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living,55

This gold kingdom is the most wealthy of the three.

One of the kingdoms is modestly wealthy, each house built to last and the castle a beautiful structure. This kingdom possessed of an army of well trained, powerful knights, and was the second most wealthy of the three.

The last kingdom, however, was poor. Each man, woman, and child struggled to get through each day, each house barely stood steady, and the castle was barely a castle at all, rather just a slightly more solid structure. And the army, well, there was hardly an army.

Eventually, each of the three kingdoms decided that it wanted possession of the lake. It was the greatest resource of the area. The gold kingdom was used to getting what it wanted, and it wanted the lake. The silver kingdom felt that it could better compete with its wealthier neighbor, if only it had sole control of the fishing industry. And the poor kingdom, well, they had nothing to lose.

And so, the golden kingdom amassed 100 of its most well-trained knights, each in possession of a dedicated squire to attend to his every want.
The silver kingdom could not quite afford 100 knights, but could bring about 50, but each knight had 2 squires to attend to his whims.
The silver kingdom roused its sole knight. This was a man of great experience, but withering and weak with years. This man had a single squire, an old friend, just as wise, who had faithfully served him since before the hairs on his head shone gray.

The night before the battle, all the knights of the gold kingdom spent all of their coin in taverns, drinking to their hearts' content. After all, if the night was to be their last, they wanted it to be a good one.

The knights of the silver kingdom could not quite afford so much drink, but the other citizens of the kingdom got together to throw a massive party through the entire night, wishing them luck and good fortune in the battle the following morning.

But the old man and his friend from the poor kingdom could not celebrate quite so fervently. Despite their lack of coin, however, the squire was able to bring his friend an old pot from home, and together they made a stew, which they hung high over a fire from a noose tied to a tree. And there they say all night, enjoying the food and each other's company until weariness brought them both to sleep.

The following morning, all the knights of the golden kingdom were hungover, and they could not wake up. The knights of the silver kingdom were exhausted, and they could not stand. The withered old knight of the poor kingdom was too sore to move, as the night of sleeping on the hard ground had stiffened his joints.

And so all the squires had to carry out the battle for their masters. As they were all of similar training, the squires of the gold kingdom and the squires of the silver kingdom wiped each other out, not a single man standing by the end of it. However, the old man's squire was wise, and waited out the battle.

As the squire of the old withered knight was the last man standing, the lake went to the poor kingdom, and it was not long before the poor kingdom was not quite so poor as before.

And so it just goes to show, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.","There are three kingdoms, one on each side of a roughly triangular lake...",60

It is a beautiful day and love is in the air, so Marie leans over to Pierre and says: ""Pierre, kiss me"".

So our hero grabs a bottle of red wine and splashes it on Marie's lips.

""What are you doing, Pierre?"" shrieks Marie.

""Well, my name is Pierre, the French fighter pilot, and when I have red meat I like to have red wine!""

His answer is good enough for Marie and things begin to heat up. So she says: ""Pierre,
kiss me lower.""

Our hero rips off her blouse, grabs a bottle of white wine and starts pouring it all over her bosom.

""Pierre, what are you doing"" she says.

""My name is Pierre, the French fighter pilot, and when I have white meat I like to have white wine!""

They resume their passionate interlude and things really steam up. Marie leans over once more and softly whispers into Pierre's ear...""Pierre, kiss me lower.""

Pierre tears off her underwear, grabs a bottle of Cognac and sprinkles it all over her private region. He then grabs a match and lights it on fire.

Patting the flames out furiously, Marie screams, ""PIERRE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!?""

Bases will fuck your skin up because they break down lipids, which make up the cell membranes of your skin cells. We were using the sodium bicarbonate to neutralize some HCl, hydrochloric acid (really potent shit).

I went up and got the Sodium Bicarbonate and was carrying it back to the group table when someone spilled some water (one of the products of a neutralization reaction). I didn't see them spill it and I don't think they did either because they didn't say anything. Anyway, here I am with some high-powered solution in my hand and I step in the water.

As he sat puking in the bushes, he suddenly heard a distinct pssssttt... Afraid that a MSNBC journalist might catch him in this state, he wheeled around when he heard the pssssstttt again. It appeared to be coming from the Rochambeau statue. Sean approached the statue cautiously and asked what is it? And the statue replied: ""I am tired of standing here for years, pointing at nothing. I need to rest my back. Old Andrew Jackson over there has a horse to sit on. At least get me a horse."" 

Sean considered this request, found it reasonable and promised to do something about it. 

The next morning, Sean was at the Oval Office pleading with the Donald to get a horse for Rochambeau. Donald heard his story, switched to Fox, saw no mention of horse or Rochambeau and refused to believe him. But Sean kept at it, begging and pleading. Finally the Donald relented. He agreed to go down to the statue with Sean and verify the facts of the matter himself. 

So for ten minutes, the POTUS, the Secret Service and Sean stood in front of Rochambeau waiting for it to speak. But nothing. Finally the Donald admonished Sean in the harshest possible words (but under 140 characters) for wasting his time and left with his retinue. Poor Sean kept standing there, feeling very foolish. 

And just then he heard the familiar pssssttt from the state and Rochambeau whispered: ""You imbecile. I asked you for a horse and you got me an ass."" ",Drunk Sean Spicer,22

Quickly, the new ""gorilla"" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo. People from all over are coming to see the ""Human-like"" gorilla.

Once upon a time, a small boy named Basheer lived in a tiny Moroccan village.

All his classmates hated him for his stupidity especially his teacher who always yelled at him saying ""you are driving me crazy, Basheer"".

One day his mother went to check how he was doing at school and the teacher told her honestly that her son is a disaster, getting very low marks and that she had never seen a dumb boy like Basheer in her whole career.

The mother could not accept such a feedback and she took her son out from that school and she even shifted to another city.
25 years later, that teacher got a cardio disorder and all the doctors advised her to go for an open heart operation which only one surgeon could perform in another city.

Left with no other choice she did it and the surgery was successful, when she opened her eyes, she saw a handsome doctor smiling at her. Being under the anesthesia effect, she wanted to thank him but could not talk. In turn, the doctor was staring at her face which started turning blue. She was raising her hand trying to tell him something but in vain and eventually she died.

The doctor was shocked and was trying to understand what just happened, till he turned back and saw Basheer working as a cleaner in that hospital who unplugged the ventilator to connect his vacuum cleaner.

If you were thinking that Basheer became a doctor, it's because you have been watching too many movies, serials or have read too many motivational forwarded messages.😂

Basheer is still Basheer😆",what happened to the boy named Basheer ?,5

The man, without skipping a beat, quickly says, ""But this is no ordinary dog! This is a special dog, he can speak.""

The bartender then says, ""I'll be the judge of that.""

So the bar tender looks at the dog and says, ""If you can really speak, you'll be able to answer these three questions I have for you."" The bar tender pointed up and said, ""what's above the ceiling?""

The dog barked the response, ""*ROOF*""

The bar tender said, ""alright, that was an easy one."" He then stated his second question, ""what does sand paper feel like?""

The dog quickly yapped, ""*RUFF*""

The bar tender sighed and said, ""that was another easy one, I'll give you one more. Who's your favorite baseball player?""

The dog woofed, ""*RUTH*""

Seeing that all the dog's responses were variations of common dog sounds, the bar tender asked both the man and his dog to leave the bar immediately.

They left the bar, and started walking down the side walk when the dog turned to the man and said, ""should I have said DiMaggio?""",A man and his dog walk into a bar,2

The boy continues home and passes a pharmacy which says ‘Condoms for sale inside’. The boy goes in and asks what a condom is. Again, trying to find a euphemism, the clerk says “um….it's a type of hat.”

The boy gets home. As the family is expecting visitors his Mum is putting makeup on. She smudges a bit and says “Shit!” The child asks what that means. Realising her mistake, the Mum hastily says “Oh it's….another name for makeup”.

The boy’s father is cooking a chicken for the guests, and he accidentally burns himself. He shouts “Fuck!” Again the boy asks what that word means. The father says “well…it means to cook”.

Anyway, the guests have arrived and as his parents are busy, the young boy opens the door and says:

“Hello dicks and pussies, let me take your condoms. My Mum is upstairs putting shit all over herself and my Dad is fucking the chicken.”

 “It’s usually in your wallet,” replied the officer. After fumbling for a few minutes, the driver managed to find it.

“Now may I see your registration?” asked the cop.

“Registration….. what’s that….?” asked the blonde.

 “I’ll be back in a minute.” said the cop and walked back to his car.The officer called in to the dispatch to run a check on the woman’s license and registration.

“What? I can’t do that. It’s inappropriate!” exclaimed the cop.

“Trust me. Just do it.” said the dispatcher.

post,68lrof,2qh72,jokes,false,1493643045,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/68lrof/an_hr_manager_dies/,self.jokes,,"One day while walking downtown, a Human Resources woman 

was hit by a bus and was tragically killed. Her soul 

arrived up in heaven where she was met at the Pearly 

Gates by St. Peter himself.

""Welcome to Heaven,"" said St. Peter. ""Before you get 

settled in though, it seems we have a problem. You see, 

strangely enough, we've never once had an HR manager 

make it this far and we're really not sure what to do 

with you.""

""No problem, just let me in,"" said the woman.

""Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What 

we're going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a 

day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you 

want to spend an eternity in,"" the Saint replied.

""Actually, I think I've made up my mind... I prefer to 

stay in Heaven.""

""Sorry, we have our rules...""

And with that St. Peter put the HR manager in an 

elevator and it went down-down-down to Hell. The doors 

opened and the HR manager found herself stepping out 

onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In 

the distance was a country club and standing in front 

of her were all her friends - fellow HR professionals 

that she had worked with. They were all dressed in 

evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up and 

kissed her on both cheeks and they talked about old 

times. They played an excellent round of golf and at 

night went to the country club where she enjoyed an 

excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil 

who was actually a really nice guy (kinda cute) and she 

had a great time telling jokes and dancing. The HR 

manager was having such a good time that before she 

knew it, it was time to leave. Everybody shook her hand 

and waved goodbye as she got on the elevator. The 

elevator went up-up-up and opened back up at the Pearly 

Gates where St. Peter was waiting for her.

""Now it's time to spend a day in Heaven"" he said. So 

the HR manager spent the next 24 hours lounging around 

on the clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had 

a great time and before she knew it, her 24 hours were 

up and St. Peter came and got her.

""So, you've spent a day in Hell and you've spent a day 

in Heaven. Now you must choose your eternity,"" he said.

The HR manager paused for a second and then replied, 

""Well, I never thought I'd say this. I mean, Heaven has 

been really great and all, but I think I had a better 

time in Hell.""

So, St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again 

the HR manager went down-down-down back to Hell.

When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself 

standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and 

filth. She saw her friends were dressed in rags and 

were picking up garbage and putting it in sacks for the 

evening meal. The Devil came up to her and put his arm 

around her and laughed at her.

""I don't understand,"" stammered the HR manager. 

""Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a 

country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had a 

great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and 

all my friends look miserable.""

The Devil looked at her and grinned: ""That's because 

yesterday we were recruiting you... but today you're 

staff.""",An HR manager dies ....,642

As she sits at the bar by herself a very drunk gentleman approaches and starts to flirt with her. It is clear the man wants to have sex with her. However, she really does not want to be with this guy as he is so blackout drunk and she is on her period. She just wants to enjoy the night out.

As the night continues, she also starts to get a little tipsy and finally decides to go home with this guy. “He is so drunk, he won’t notice that I am on my period.” she thought to herself.

As they arrive at the guy’s apartment they immediately “get down to business”. As soon as they are finished the guy falls asleep and starts to snore loudly. The woman, feeling a little bit of shame, decides to leave his apartment and goes back home.

The next morning the guy wakes up in his bed. He tries to remember what happened the night before. He vaguely remembers picking up a chick and brining her home with him. “Alright!” he thinks and looks to the other side of the bed. The woman was not there anymore. However, he suddenly notices that the whole bed is covered in blood.

He jumps up from the bed in horror. “Oh my god….oh my god….did I kill this poor women while I was blackout drunk?”. He starts to panic and paces around like a madman in his apartment. “How did I kill her? Where is the body?”

He runs into the kitchen to check his knifes and cleavers. All of them were clean. “ So I did not stab her or chop her up…” he thought to himself.

Then he runs to his gun cabinet to see if he used any of the guns and ammo. “I also did not shoot her…” he said to himself.

Panic rising more and more in his chest, he also looks into his toolbox to see If he might have used one of his hammers to kill her. “No, none of my tools were used” he whispered.

Desperate on finding out how he killed this poor woman he slouched into the bathroom to freshen up a little. He lifts his head to look at himself in the mirror. Then he says: “Shit, I ate her.”

One day a local scientist named Steve was sent a mysterious email. The email read:

Steve I know who you are, and where you live. My name must remain anonymous, so as of now you may refer to me as ""Somebody"". Steve I contact you because my independent studies have discovered a massive earthquake heading your way. You, your research center, your city, and half of your State are in for the mother of all earthquakes. My advanced Richter scale is reading an earthquake with a magnitude of 13! That's an extremely dangerous magnitude as you should know, your state will literally vibrate, do the wave, roll itself out, in other words you will die if you don't act now. You have exactly 25 hours to evacuate everyone and take any important instruments or research devices that cannot be lost or replaced, to safety. By my calculations you'll pick up the oncoming earthquake in 4 hours, but if every city and town doesn't start evacuating in 8 hours, it may be too late to save everyone.

Steve panicked, he didn't want to risk anything so he packed all of his important instruments first into a van and pulled out his laptop. He needed to make sure that this was a confirmed earthquake and not some hoax. So he did, he waited the four hours and sure enough it was real. He quickly speed dialed the mayor, who had always been a good friend of his.

""Steve, you caught me at a rough time what do you need?""

""Mayor you need to evacuate half of the state, we're all in danger!""

""Woah! Woah! Steve, are you okay? What's going on?""

Then man replies ""Well with my first wish, I wished I could make any woman in the world sleep with me."" Bartender nods and says ""Righto, that seems like a fair enough wish. What was your second one?""

The man replies ""With my second wish, I wished for an infinite supply of money."" Again, the bartender nods and says ""That seems reasonable. But what about your third wish? How did you end up turning half your head into an orange?"".

The man replies ""Oh. It's kinda stupid. I don't really wanna talk about it."" But the bartender is too curious to let up and insists ""No come on, tell me! What was your third wish?!""

He asks the bartender, ""What is that big vase of hundreds for?"" ""Oh that's for our challenge, but nobody can complete it."" replies the bar keep. Naturally, the man is curious and asks, ""So what do you have to do to win the money."" 

""Well there are 3 levels to the challenge. First you have to take a double shot of our worst tasting whiskey straight faced without throwing up."" ""Sounds easy so far."" Comments the potential contestant.

""Not many get passed that, but for round two we have a guerilla caged up in the back with a bad tooth. All you gotta do is go pull it out for us."" Explains the bartender. The man, now a little worried says, ""Ok and round 3?""

""Nobody has gotten passed round 2 yet, but round 3 is easy. We have a 97 year old lady who does not want to die a virgin. So all you have to do for round 3 is fuck her."" 

The man says to the bar keep, ""I am going to go home and mentally prepare and I will be back tomorrow to take on the challenge.""

The man walks into the bar the next day and slaps a crisp hundo on the counter and is met with a double shot of Uncle Trevor's Ass Whiskey. The man takes the shot and stares at the bartender to make sure he shows not even the slightest grimace. ""Well done."" said the bartender. ""Now here are the keys to the guerrillas cage, you know what you gotta do."" The man gives a nod to the bar keep and says, ""I'm a warrior and I won't go down without a fight."" 

From the bar, the bartender and customers can hear a lot of loud noises, banging, screaming, roaring, and more coming from the back where the cage is. Thinking that he might need to go check on the man, suddenly the man comes out. He looks like he just finished a boxing match, black eyes, cuts, bruises. ""Oh God are you OK?!"" asked the worried bartender.

On the phone was a lady who was screaming that an officer had just broken into their house and searched around. Confused by this the dispatcher tried to calm the lady down, which was unsuccessful, and she eventually hung up the phone. Not sure what to do they disregarded the call as either a prank or someone with a prejudice. 

However, as the weeks continued, they received more and more calls from various homes and companies all saying the same thing. An officer came in and searched the premise without any justification. 

Finally, they managed to ID this officer and sat him down to ask him some questions. First they asked him if he had been breaking into these different places, to which the officer replied, ""Yes.""

Aghast and confused by this they asked him why. The officer looked back and forth at them, then said, ""Well I read it in the training manual. It said I had the ability to search any premise just 'cause.""",The new officer,0
