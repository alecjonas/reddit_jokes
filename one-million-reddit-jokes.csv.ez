Do you think I could stay the night?""The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""   

Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""The man sets about his task.  
 
After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering and says  

 *""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""*
        

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",A man who was driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery...,4

Nevertheless, to be on the safe side,he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect wood to be prepared.
But also being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea.He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, 
""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""
""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,"" the Meteorologist at the weather service responded.
So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

One week later he called the National Weather Service again.""Is it going to be a very cold winter?"" he asked.
""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied,""it's going to be a very cold winter.""
The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.
Two weeks later he called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""
""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It looks like it's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""

So we both lived in this little apartment whilst in uni. I also had a girlfriend at the time as well. Joe was an...interesting guy. Funny, helpful, respectful. But he never told me where he was born or grew up. Anyway, one day im out with my girlfriend at a restaurant when suddenly I get a text from Joe. Apparently he has tripped over and he has got a stick or stone through his eye. I rush home to see Joe sat on the sofa covering his eye with a blood soaked hand. My girlfriend gives Joe some of her cotton makeup pads and he holds it over his eye whilst I look for some bandages in the bathroom. I come out of the bathroom, and both are gone...and now I'm wondering. Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from Cotton eye Joe?",My friend,14

Her eyes lit up as she asked, ""Where would you like to start?""  
""Well, ma'am, how about a suit?""  
""Yes, sir. What size?""  
""Size 53 tall, ma'am.""

""Size 15 double D.""

""No, ma'am , I reckon that will be all.""

As the sweet young thing tallied up his bill and as the Texan counted his money, she blushed and asked, ""Sir, could I ask you a question?""

A few days later, he heard knocking at his door and investigated. A delivery man offered him 12 bags of carrots, congratulated him on his winnings, and left.

This continued to happen on a weekly basis, with dozens after dozens of bags slowly piling up in his living room.

He began to realize he could never keep up with the flow of carrots entering his home every week and had to think of a solution... He had it! He could distribute the bags around his neighbourhood; to his friends, family, colleagues and coworkers! 

For the next month, he gave away as many bags as he could, desperately trying to rid his home of carrots as he had already grown tired of consuming them. His love for the orange vegetable had been entirely broken by this, now unfortunate, situation.

As his close friends and family members slowly began to decline his weekly gifts, he had another plan in mind. Every Sunday, he would go onto the busiest street in the area and give away free bags of carrots to random strangers.

Unsurprisingly, the plan worked... or at least, it did for a while. Though he managed to keep his inventory clear for the next few weeks, he feared he would soon get into trouble for his hebdomadal handouts. “You need a permit to do this here!”, he would often hear.

Not wishing to get in trouble, and having no other place to transfer his snack stash to, he admitted defeat. He would have to let them pile up once more, until his home was ultimately filled to the brim.

He had one final hope however; to cancel the lifetime supply by contacting the head of production himself. Though the guidelines clearly stated that the winnings were non returnable, and that the lifetime supply was non-cancellable, this was in-fact his only valid plan. It needed to work!

He called up the company headquarters through the telephone number he happened to have found online and anxiously waited on the other side of the line. Finally, as the head of productions picked up the phone, the man exclaimed;

“Please, sir! I cannot live with all these carrots in my home! I need this lifetime supply cancelled!”

The businessman scoffed at his plea, promptly refuting with:

“You knew the rules when you chose to participate in our contest and, frankly, I do not carrot all.”","A man wins a lifetime supply of carrots,",4

The season starts and Bob drives his friend, Dave, to the land where Dave would kill his first deer.  


They had the whole weekend, but after almost two days at it, they hadn't seen heads nor tails of the their prey, and they were losing sunlight fast.  


Bob tells Dave ""Look, I promised you a good time and your first deer, and well shoot, there just don't seem to be any round these parts. Now we're losing sunlight, but, if we are move quickly, there some other land near here where I \_ALWAYS\_ find me some good hunting. I know the old guy that owns the land, and he never minds me hunting there so long as I ask him first, and respect his property. Whattd'ya say?""  


Dave gets excited at the chance to have better luck with this venture and readily agrees and they start trekking back to their truck as fast as they can, so they can get to the old man's place to ask if they can hunt on his land.  


A short drive later and they arrive and Bob tells Dave to wait in the car while he goes and talks to the old man.  


Bob walks up the drive, approaches the house, and knocks on their door. The old man opens it and invites Bob inside.  


Inside they exchange quick pleasantries and Bob quickly gets to the point, asking if he and Dave can hunt on the old guy's land.  


The old guy says ""Sure you can, you have always been respectful and I've seen plenty of deer out there the past month, so you shouldn't have any issues on that front. But say- could you do me a favor?""  


""Of course!"" Bob says. ""What is it I can do for ya?""  


The old guys says ""Well I've got this donkey. Damnit I love her but she's old and in pain, and well, it's time. But I can't bring myself to do it. Would you put her down for me? She's out back, hell, you wouldn't even have to get out of your truck, just drive round back and..."" He trails off for a second, sadness in his voice, then continues. ""Just pull the trigger. I'll do the rest. I'll bury her. I just can't bring myself to pull the trigger.""  


Bob respond ""Well hell, old man, you bet I will. I owe ya for always letting me hunt on your property. I will do you this favor.""  


The exchange thanks and goodbyes and Bob leaves shutting the front door behind him and when he looks up and sees Dave looking in his direction, he gets an idea about messing with his friend.  


So Bob puts on a show, huffing and puffing as he marches, anger on his face, back to the car. He gets in, slams the door, rolls down the window and spits, and Dave can tell something went wrong...  


""What happened?"" he asks.  


Bob tells him ""That old man yelled at me, accusing me of disrespecting his property last time I was out here and told me to get the hell off his land and never come back. Well I never did no disrespect and I think I oughta teach him a lesson. I'm gonna drive round back and kill his beloved donkey.""  


Dave is shocked by this but Bob drives around back and gets his gun ready and Dave realizes its going down.  


Bob point his rifle at the donkey, pulls the trigger... \_BANG\_, shoots her dead. Before he can turn around to see the look of shock on Dave's face he hears \_BANG BANG\_ and Dave shouts ""Quick, I got his horses!

I was riding my horse through the desert when I saw him: Pancho Villa. From a mile away I knew him. He wore a pair of leather chaparejos on his legs. On his head he wore a sombrero big enough to stretch from Oaxaca to Aguascalientes and back. But what caught my eye most of all is what he had in his hands: the big guns, both of them pointing right at me.

Pancho Villa called out to me. ""Señor!"" he called out. ""Come down from your horse!""

I looked him in the eye and replied, ""I come down from my horse for no man.""

But what could I do? What could I say? When he had the big guns. So I came down from my horse.

Then Pancho Villa said to me: ""Now, señor, drop the pantalones.""

I said to him, ""I drop the pantalones for no man. Do you know what the desert sand will do to your bare ass?”

But what could I do? What could I say? He had the big guns. So I dropped the pantalones.

Then Pancho Villa say to me, ""Now, señor, you take a shit.""

I say, ""I take a shit for no man."" But what could I do? What could I say? He had the big guns. So I took a shit like Pancho Villa said.

Then Pancho Villa said to me, ""Now, señor, you will eat your shit."" I answered, ""I eat my shit for no man."" But what could I do? What could I say? He had the big guns. So I began to eat my shit.

Then Pancho Villa let out a very big laugh. He let out a laugh so big and so loud that he frightened his horse. The horse reared up on two legs and Pancho Villa dropped the big guns. I ran to grab them, and suddenly I was the one who had the big guns.

For a long moment, Pancho Villa and I stared at one another, saying not a word.

Then I called out to Pancho Villa. ""Pancho Villa!"" I called out. ""You come down from your horse!""

Pancho Villa gave me a stare that was colder than the snows of Orizaba. In a voice that was slow but determined, he snarled, ""I come down from my horse for no man.""

But what could he do? What could he say? I had the big guns. So Pancho Villa came down from his horse.

Then I said to him, ""Pancho Villa, drop the pantalones.""

He gave me a menacing look and said, ""I drop the pantalones for no man."" But what could he do? What could he say? when I had the big guns. So he dropped his pantalones.

Then I said to Pancho Villa, ""Pancho Villa, now take a shit."" He said, ""I take a shit for no man."" But what could he do? What could he say? I had the big guns. So Pancho Villa squatted down to take a shit.

So, my friend. You ask me, have I met Pancho Villa? Yes, one time we had lunch together.","You ask me, have I met Pancho Villa?",5

They set up camp on the beach planning to build a fire when all three of them pass out.  When they come to, they are hogtied and being carried off by a strange tribe.  

Upon arriving at the center of a huge tribe of people, a man that is apparently the chief of the tribe comes up and says to the first man, ""For trespassing on my island, you have two choices, Roo Roo or death!""   

The first guy is like, ""Well I don't know what the hell Roo Roo is but its got to be better than dying so Roo Roo.""  Chief yells, ""Roo Roo!""  The whole tribe yells, ""Roo Roo!"" and the chief takes the man and fucks him up the ass. 

He comes back to the next man and says, ""For trespassing on my island, you have two choices, Roo Roo or death!""  The guy thinks for a minute, ""Well, I don't want to get fucked in the ass, but I certainly don't want to die, I guess I'll take Roo Roo?""  Chief yells, ""Roo Roo!""  The whole tribe yells, ""Roo Roo!"" and the chief takes him and fucks him up the ass.  

He comes back to the last man and says, ""For trespassing on my island, you have two choices, Roo Roo or death!""

I'm socially awkward, even my only other co-worker fucking hates my guts. I have repressed lust for one of my best friends too; she's athletic, smart and a gorgeous southern bell. I love her. You know what it's like; I've been friend zoned real hard. She's my only real friend, besides this one kid, who I'm pretty sure is only hanging around me because he is mentally challenged.

So one of the ladies approached Linda very discreetly about the problem, and told her to mash up some green astringent persimmons and rub them on her nipples and over her breasts, which should cause them to shrink in size.

But she warned Linda not to taste any of the green persimmons because they are so sour they would make her mouth pucker up, and she wouldn't be able to talk properly for a while.

 His wife died as soon as she gave birth to the second son. Because of this, the farmer always blamed his second son for his mother's death. But he did not fail in his responsibilities as a father. The farmer was poor but he worked really hard to get his two sons in grad school. They didn't do well enough to get jobs. They stayed at home with their dad but the farmer never complained since his sons are all the family he had. He tried to explain to them that he was not going to be there to take care of them all the time as he was getting really old and insisted they try and find whatever jobs they could so they could support themselves. The sons agreed and started working towards getting a job. Finally after a while, the first son got a job as a librarian in the Public Library and the second son got a job as a train conductor. The farmer was very happy now that his two sons are working and he could rest in peace. One fine day, a new family moved in next to their house. The neighboring house had always been empty the whole time they were there. The new neighbors had a beautiful daughter. The two sons were immediately attracted to her. They would do her chores, get her gifts, constantly visit her family in the pursuit of getting her attention. On fine day, the elder son went to her and told her how he really felt about her and that he would take care of her for the rest of her life. But the girl was not interested in him, so to let him off easily, she said she had feelings for his younger brother and that nothing can ever happen between them. The elder son understood and wished her all the best and left. The same evening, the younger son went to her and told her how he felt about her. She told him she liked his elder brother and that nothing could ever happen between them. The younger son did not take this well. He was furious with his brother and felt he had betrayed him. He went home to confront him about this and the two brothers got into an argument. The elder one denied that he betrayed him and called him a fool for even thinking that. The argument got heated up so bad that they ended up fighting. In the spur of the moment, the younger one pushed his brother and accidentally killed him. He did not know what to do. His father already blames him for his mother's death. But later that evening, the farmer returned home and found his elder son dead on the floor, the younger one just sitting there cold. He could not believe this had happened. He did not show any anger towards his younger son but decided in his mind that he would put an end to all this misery. They buried the elder one in secrecy and told the neighbors he had gone abroad. After a few days, the farmer prepared a nice meal and drugged it, and asked his son to join him. His son, unsuspecting of anything, joined him for supper and had the meal and within a few minutes, was out-cold. The farmer dragged him to the basement, tied him up to a chair, connected some wires to him and let him there after switching it on, hoping he would be electrocuted and dead. But the next morning, the farmer heard his son shouting for help. So he went down and was shocked to see nothing had happened. The son cried to his father and begged for forgiveness. The farmer did not want to forgive him, but was past the rage episode so he did not want to kill him anymore. He asked his son to get out of his sight and never wanted to see him again. The son obliged and promised he would never return home and left. The son moved to another place. He had all the time to think about what he had done and regretted it. Over the next few months, he changed into a completely different human being. He became kind, calm, composed and very helpful to others. One day when he was walking down the street, he noticed a homeless person begging for food. He was moved and he got him some food and asked the homeless person to have it. While the homeless person was eating, the son noticed there was a fly on his cheek. So he tried to swat it, accidentally slapping him. The farmer who was also walking by that street saw this and thought his son hadn't changed a bit and now he is a danger to society. He decided he would finish the job once and for all. He called his son and invited him back home saying he wanted to spend the rest of his dying days with his family. The son was very happy. He went home and stayed with his father. The farmer prepared a sumptuous meal for them and again drugged his son's meal. Like earlier, the son went out-cold in a few minutes. The farmer dragged him to the basement, tied him up to a chair, connected some wires to him, and switched it on. This time, the son got electrocuted and died instantly. Do you know why? Because the first time, he was a bad conductor, but now he is a good conductor.",There was a farmer who had two sons,5

Would be great if within the comments some native speakers might improve it so it is even better for the people to follow ;) I will update the joke after some time! Thanks!! And now Let’s start!

——— JOKE STARTS HERE ——-

There is guy who had not had sex for a veeeeery long time. As he is single and some dates went against his expectations he wants to go to a brothel to have a nice time.

He takes a cab and after a short ride and a grinning face of the cab driver he arrived at his destination. At the entry he is asked by the bawd what his preferences are.

„Nothing special. I just want to have a good time. Can you recommend someone or something?“ „Uhhh...there is someone really special now for few days in this location!“ „Whats so special about her?“ the guy asked quite interested. „Simple. She is giving you a blowjob and whilst doing this will sing a beautiful song!“ „How the fuck is this possible???“ „No idea. You have to try! Last floor. 3rd door!“

The guy puts his money on the table and runs upstairs standing in front of the said door. Slowly opening there is a beautiful woman sitting in a room on her bed.

The guy jumps in with a lot of anticipation immediately getting nude and asking the woman she shall start with what the bawd had told. The woman is looking at him smiling: „Wow. Someone can’t wait anymore. But first you have to play my rules!“ „Huh!?!“, the guy replied bewildered. „The rules are clear: You sit on my bed. Getting nude - that’s what you already have done this time. I will shut down the lights, entering the bathroom enclosed to this room. Will come back after I have prepared few things and will start with the show!“ „Ok.“ the guy responded confused, but yet willing to follow what she has said.

And there it goes. Lights go out. She walks into the bathroom. Comes back. And the show starts with an oral explosion. And if this might be enough the woman sings the most beautiful version of “somewhere over the rainbows” he ever heard. After 30 secs he cums grabbing the hairs of the woman. The woman stops. And asks the guy to just wait for a moment and puts the light on! The guy is just completely impressed and gets back home.

Laying home in his bed he is still thinking about this awkward blowjob and tries to figure out how the fuck this woman can give the best and tightest blowjob he ever received, but yet is singing like a goddess. “How the fuck is this possible?”, he thinks and swears to find out the next day paying attention to every detail.

Next day. Next evening. The guy is standing in front of the bawd again. Throwing once again his money on the table and yelling “The singing woman again!”. The bawd just grins and opens the door to the stairs.

Last floor. Third door. The woman recognizes him and tells him he has to follow the rules! So he sits down on the bed getting nude. Light are turned off. The woman goes to the bathroom. Comes back in darkness and starts to blow and sing. The orgasm is awesome and the song is brilliant. Evening and adventure ends.

So he is laying in his bed again at home and still has no fucking clue what happened. “Tomorrow i will find out. There must be a rational solution to all of this!” And so he decides to visit the brothel ONE more time the next evening.

The bawd laughs. “Once again our special blowjob??” “Yes!”. So he runs upstairs and he fucking swears to find out the secret today! The woman awaits him. And reminds him to follow the rules otherwise he will be kicked out with no cash back!! “I do!! I do!!!”

So the lights been shut down. He sits in the bed and this time...instead of getting nude...he decides to turn on the light. So he triggers the switch. Enlightening the room. And as the guy inspects the room. He sees a glass eye on the night stand next to the bed.",Do you find out the secret of the whore?,420

It occurred to the explorer that he could be the first person ever to touch the great ape and so tentatively he inched towards the cage. Since King Kong appeared quite passive, the explorer thought he would take a chance and reach through the bars to touch him. But as soon as he made contact with the gorilla’s fur, King Kong went berserk. He immediately rose to his feet, began beating his chest and with an awesome display of strength, burst through the bars of his cage.


As the explorer ran for his life, King Kong set off in hot pursuit. Instinctively the explorer headed for the heart of the jungle, hoping that he might be able to hide from his manic pursuer, but wherever he tried to conceal himself, King Kong always managed to find him.


As night began to fall, the explorer prayed that he would be able to lose the gorilla in the darkness but no matter how fast he ran, the sound of King Kong’s pounding footsteps was only ever about fifty yards behind.


For three long days and nights, the explorer ran through Africa with King Kong always close behind, occasionally letting out a menacing roar from his vast throat. Eventually the explorer reached the west coast. There were no ships in sight for an easy escape, so he realized the only option was to dive into the sea and hope that King Kong couldn’t swim. But to his horror, the gorilla jumped in straight after him and demonstrated an excellent front crawl.


On and on they swam across the Atlantic – rarely separated by more than thirty yards – until four months later the weary explorer arrived in Brazil. He scrambled ashore with as much energy as he could muster, only to see the mighty King Kong right behind him, still beating his chest ferociously and with steam billowing from his nostrils. Through the streets of Rio they stumbled, explorer and ape equally exhausted, until the explorer took a wrong turn and ended up down a dead end, his escape barred by a twenty-foot-high wall.


With nowhere left to run, he sank to his knees in despair and pleaded to King Kong: ‘Do whatever you want with me. Kill me, eat me, do what you like, but make it quick. Just put me out of my misery.’


King Kong slowly stalked over to the cowering explorer, prodded him with a giant paw and bellowed with a terrifying roar: ‘You’re it!’",An explorer in the African jungle heard about a plan to capture the legendary King Kong.,27

post,bc8zvv,2qh72,jokes,false,1555039693,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bc8zvv/i_hate_my_job/,self.jokes,,"My job is so fucking unbelievable. 

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe. 

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",I hate my job.,8963

One day, his girlfriend asks him over for dinner to meet her parents. He drives his new bike to her house, where she is outside waiting for him.
“No matter what happens at dinner tonight, don’t say a word.” She tells him, “Our family had a fight a while ago about doing dishes. We haven’t done any since, but the first person to speak at dinner has to do them.”


Brandon sits down for dinner and it is just how she described it. Dishes are piled up to the ceiling in the kitchen, and nobody is saying a word. So Brandon decides to have a little fun. He grabs his girlfriend, throws her on the table and has sex with her in front of her parents.


His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word. A few minutes later he grabs her mom, throws her on the table and does a repeat performance. Now his girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, and her mother is a little happier. But still there is complete silence at the table. All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain. Brandon remembers his motorcycle. He jumps up and grabs his jar of Vaseline.


Upon witnessing this, his girlfriend’s father backs away from the table and screams, “OKAY, ENOUGH! I’LL DO THE DISHES.”",Brandon is shopping for a used motorcycle.,75

On her way home, she stops at a news stand to buy a newspaper. Before leaving, she says to the clerk, ‘I hope you don’t mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?”.

‘About 32,’ is the reply.’

‘Nope! I’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily.

A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.

The girl replies, ‘I’d guess about 29.’ The woman replies with a big smile, ‘Nope, I’m 50.’

Now she’s feeling really good about herself. She stops at a candy shop on her way down the street.

She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.

The clerk responds, ‘Oh, I’d say 30.’

Again she proudly responds, ‘I’m 50, but thank you!’

While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.

He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going. Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

Stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘That was incredible, how could you tell?’

‘I was behind you at McDonalds’.",Funny and long (semi-dirty),58

Tommy decides he wants one too, so night after night he listens outside his parents’ bedroom for any strange noises and, sure enough, eventually he hears some banging and groaning from the other side of the door. He walks in and catches his parents in the act, so his dad offers him anything he wants to keep quiet about the whole affair.


Tommy immediately says, “I want a watch.”

Flynn looked at the man with a look of both pain and peace. ""Well, Danny... I had a dog once.""

Daniel sympathetically responded. ""What happened?""

Flynn let out a quiet sigh. ""It's a long story.""

Daniel replied with a soft smile. ""I got time.""

Flynn let out another sigh, and then began his story.

""I found him when he was just a puppy.""

Flynn chuckled softly.

""Yeah... right outside the Sears that closed down last year.""

Daniel nodded in acknowledgement. Flynn continued.

""Brought that little ball of fur home, washed him up, fed him...""

Flynn smiled, a tear forming in his eye.

""...fell in love with him.""

He lifted his hand to wipe the tear before it fell.

""Found my best friend that night. We did everything together. Got him a flashy blue collar, taught him tricks, took him hiking with me, went on food adventures together...""

As Flynn was talking, he walked over to his desk and opened a drawer. He walked back to Daniel, holding a faded, worn out tennis ball.

""...but I think his favorite out of everything was this ball. Yeah.... it was his favoritest thing, running for the ball, bringing it back to me. He always treated it like it was more than a game. Always ran for it with a sense of urgency, duty... like he didn't want to let me down.""

Flynn fought back the teardrops that were begging to be revealed.

""I... I threw the ball a little too hard one day. It went over the fence, rolled into the street, and-""

Daniel, sympathetic, but with a knowing face interrupted him. ""Wow... that's tough, man. Having your dog run over can't be-""

""No.""

Flynn cut off Daniel.

""The ball rolled... right into the storm drain.""

Tiny dark splotches began to appear on Flynn's shirt.

""I told him he was a good boy, that it was okay. We'd get a new ball. It was okay, it was okay...""

Daniel laid a confused, but still sympathetic hand of consolation on Flynn's trembling shoulder.

Flynn's voice trembled like the rest of his body.

""When I woke up that next morning, he was gone...... gone.....""

Flynn paused, struggling not to break down entirely.

""I looked for ages... never found him, never heard anything.... until one day, seven years later, a foreigner showed up at my door, holding a box.""

Daniel, intrigued, leaned forward a little in his seat.

""He told me that he was part of a research team, gathering data in the Himalayas. On their fourth week, near the peak of Mt. Everest, he told me...""

Flynn paused again, and continued after a couple minutes passed.

""He told me that he spotted a bright blue collar, half buried in the snow...""

Daniel raised both eyebrows. Flynn continued.

""And he told me that just beneath the collar, he found this tennis ball. He gave me the box with the collar and the ball, and told me something I'll never forget. 'Of a truth, you are the master of a most noble and loyal creature.'""

Flynn, wiping away the tears, concluded so quietly, it was almost a whisper.

""And that's the story of the best, most loyal friend I ever had.""

Daniel stood up.

""Nope. Never happened.""

Flynn, mildly shocked, looked at Daniel.

""What I told you actually happened, I'm not making any of this up!""

Daniel shook his head, and chuckled.

""Nope, never happened my man. I don't believe you.""

Flynn, full of righteous indignation, questioned him.

""Why not?!""

Daniel, still shaking his head, responded.

""I don't know man.... it all just seems a little too far-fetched.""",Two guys were talking about pets,6

He approached her and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know me?' She responded, 'Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'

The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?'

She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'

The defense attorney nearly died.

At the end of a long day, the President comes out in a foul mood, walks back to his bedroom and goes right to sleep.

Early the next morning, he is back at the office. “No calls. No interruptions.”, he calls out before entering the office and slamming the door behind him.

The behavior repeats itself but after a few days, it is midnight and Trump still hasn’t come out of his office. Unsure what to do, they decide that Chief of Staff John Kelley should knock on the door. “Mr. President. Are you okay?”

“I said NO INTERRUPTIONS and I meant it!”, they hear Trump scream through the door.

Two more days pass without a word from the president and then the secretary’s phone rings. It is Trump. “Get me Sarah Sanders immediately!”

The secret service is dispatched and in 15 minutes, a breathless Sarah Sanders is knocking on the door to the Oval office.

“Come in.”

Sanders open the door slowly and finds a disheveled unshaven Trump sitting at his desk with a big grin on his face. On top of his desk is a completed 30 piece puzzle of the New York skyline.

Sanders doesn’t know what to make of it.

Trump leans back triumphantly in his chair and says. “I’ve got something for your next press conference…”. Sarah takes out her notebook.

“You see that puzzle?”, Trump asks pointing at his desk. “Well, the box says ‘3 to 7 years’ and me, I finished it in JUST 6 DAYS!”",Donald Trump,3

Her breasts were so large that they bounced and jiggled while she played the organ. Unfortunately, this distracted the congregation considerably.
 
The very proper church ladies were appalled.

They said something had to be done about this or they would have to get another organist.

So one of the ladies approached Linda very discreetly about the problem, and told her to mash up some green astringent persimmons and rub them on her nipples and over her breasts, which should cause them to shrink in size.

But she warned Linda not to taste any of the green persimmons because they are so sour they would make her mouth pucker up, and she wouldn't be able to talk properly for a while.
 
The voluptuous organist reluctantly agreed to try it.
 
The following Sunday morning the priest climbed into the pulpit and said,
 
""Dew to thircumsthanthis bewond my contwol, we will not hab a thermon tewday""",A small church had a very attractive.. .,66

He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",A man wakes up in a dingy slum,12

Jack walked into a sports bar around 9:58 pm. He sat down next to this blonde at the bar and stared up at the TV as the 10:00 news came on. The news crew was covering a story of a man on a ledge of a large building preparing to jump.

The blonde looked at Jack and said, ""Do you think he'll jump?""

Jack says, ""You know what, I bet he will."" The blonde replied, ""Well, I bet he won't."" Jack placed $30 on the bar and said, ""You're on!""

Just as the blonde placed her money on the bar, the guy did a swan dive off of the building, falling to his death. The blonde was very upset and handed her $30 to Jack, saying, ""Fair's fair... Here's your money.""

Jack replied, ""I can't take your money, I saw this earlier on the 5 o'clock news and knew he would jump.""

The blonde replies, ""I did too; I just didn't think he'd do it again.""
