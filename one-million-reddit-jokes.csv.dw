She didn't respond vocally, but signalled that she was hard of hearing and to go straight.

Following the road, the guy then comes to a stop at T-junction, which had a lake behind it. Since he didn't know any sign language, he mouthed to her ""up or down?""
The lady then took off her panties and ferociously made love to the man. After they were done, the lady jumped out the car, and the man was on his way.

The next day, the man saw the lady again, offered her a lift, and at the same T-junction by the lake, he asked her again ""up or down?""
Again, the lady took off her panties and made love to the man... 

Three days later, the man saw the lady again, and she had a hearing aid on. On the way to the lake - the guy hoping that they'd make love again - he asks her where she lived. She told him she lived upwards of the lake, and she asked him to take her there directly. They passed the lake, and reached her home, with no sex.

At her gate, the man asked her ""when you didn't have your hearing aids, and I asked you 'up or down', why did you make love to me when we stopped by the lake?""

The lady said ""my lip reading isn't fantastic, so I thought you were saying 'Fuck or drown.'""",#372: A man sees a beautiful woman trying to hitch a lift.,22

So Shubham started talking to them and they bonded over football, and they seemed like decent fellows who were really fun and nice to talk to. 
They asked Shubham if he wanted to join them, since they were all going the same way. He agreed, and they all got in the car, and went on their merry way.

Now Shubham is sitting in the back seat of this SUV, and there's a huge sack filled with something, just sitting there beside him. He gets curious, but doesn't say anything.

After a while, his curiosity gets the better of him and he asks the guy sitting in front of him, 'What's in the sack?', 'Let me fuck your ass and I'll tell you' comes the reply.

Shubham feels a little weird but takes it as a joke and ignores his curiosity.

After a while, he can't stop himself, and asks one of the other guys, 'What's in the sack?', 'Let me fuck your ass and I'll tell you' comes the reply.

By now Shubham is super creeped out. He texts his friends, who're waiting to greet him where he's going to be dropped off, that the people he's travelling with are either murderers or some kind of crooks. Shubham asks the friends to wait for him at the stop and be ready for whatever happens.

Right before Shubham's stop (which is just a couple of kilometres away) the traveller buddies decide to take a leak. The area that they stop at is deserted, with just a few bushes and trees on the side of the road. Shubham is going ballistic at this point, and asks his friends to arrive fast and take him with them, or he's gonna get killed.

His friends arrive as quickly as they can, and while the travelling buddies are taking a leak, Shubham and his friends, without thinking, pick that sack up and run away with it as fast as they can.","So my friend Shubham was travelling to Jaipur, the last stop of his countrywide tour.",1

He is sentenced to death by electric chair. 

On death row he is asked for his last meal, for which he requests a banana. He is given his banana and he eats it shortly before being strapped into the electric chair. Enough electricity is pumped through him to kill an elephant, but when the switch is turned off, he remained alive. By law he was released to walk the streets. 

Due to his lifetime of employment as a train conductor, he is accepted back to his original job. After three days, he derails another train, belligerently drunk, and is again arrested, trialed, and sentenced to death by electric chair for multiple dozen more lives he brought to an end. 

This time on death row when they asked him for his final meal, he requests two bananas. The guards become suspicious, but they give him two bananas and watch closely to ensure no fowl play as he eats them. He is strapped to the chair, electrocuted, but still survives. The guards are in awe, yet by law, or perhaps by some force of god at this point, they let him free to walk the streets again. 

Against all odds, the alcoholic conductor is again reinstated to his previous job. His first day back he derails a final train, killing hundreds more yet again, and believe it or not he was drunk, and sentenced to death by electric chair. 

Finding himself on death row yet again, being asked for his third final meal, the conductor requests three bananas. With suspicion growing the guards decide not to appease the mans final request, saying screw that conductor and his bananas. 

They strap him to the electric chair, turn the voltage up all they way, and flip the switch. Sparks fly, and lights flicker for minutes, much longer than it should take to kill a man, yet when the power finally gives, the conductor is still sitting there alive and well. 

In awe at how a man could withstand such electricity on several occasions, one guard turns to the other and says:

she insisted I take her to the local shopping centre every day.

Like most men, I found shopping boring and preferred to get in and out.

She's like most women - loves to browse &amp; leaves me with endless time to fulfill.

Yesterday my dear wife received the following letter, from the local Shopping centre:

Dear Mrs. Harris:

Over the past six months, your husband has caused quite a commotion, in our store.

We cannot tolerate this behavior and have been forced to, ban both of you from the store.

Our complaints against your husband, Mr. Harris, are listed below and are documented by our video surveillance cameras:

June 15: He took 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in other people's carts when they weren't looking.

July 2: Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5-minute intervals.

July 7: He made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the women's restroom.

July 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an official voice, 'Code 3 in House wares. Get on it right away'. This caused the employee to leave her assigned station and receive a reprimand from her Supervisor that in turn resulted with a union grievance, causing management to lose time; and costing the company money. We don't have a Code 3.

August 4: Went to the Service Desk and tried to put a bag of M&amp;Ms on layaway.

August 14: Moved a, 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area.

August 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told the children shoppers he'd invite them in if they would bring pillows and blankets from the bedding department to which twenty children obliged.

August 23: When a clerk asked if they could help him he began crying and screamed, 'Why can't you people just leave me alone?' EMTs were called.

September 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose.

September 10: While handling guns in the hunting department, he asked the clerk where the antidepressants were.

October 3: Darted around the store suspiciously while, loudly humming the, 'Mission Impossible' theme.

October 6: In the auto department, he practiced his, 'Madonna Look' using different sizes of funnels.

October 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed through, yelled 'PICK ME! PICK ME!'

October 22: When an announcement came over the loud speaker, he assumed a fetal position and screamed;

'OH NO! IT'S THOSE VOICES AGAIN!'

Took a box of condoms to the checkout clerk and asked where is the fitting room?

And last, but not least:

October 23: Went into a fitting room, shut the door, waited awhile; then yelled very loudly, 'Hey! There's no toilet paper in here.' One of the clerks passed out.

After a few minutes of flirting, she placed her hand on his arm and said, ""Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming.""

He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely. Now nude, she purred at him, ""What would you say is my best feature?""

Flustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, ""It has to be your ears.""

Astounded, and a little hurt she asked, ""My ears? Look at these breasts; they are a full 38 inches and 100 percent natural. I work out every day and my ass is firm and solid. I have a 28 inch waist.

One day - after generations and generations of prosper at the foot of the mountain a monster appears at the top and tosses boulders down at the village - causing death, destruction and bewildering the Tribs. 

The Trib hold a council meeting to discuss this new problem. After much deliberation they decide to send a Trib - one of the Trib's religious followers to speak to the monster that has taken hold of their mountain top.

The Trib that committed to the dire task climbs the mountain to confront the monster. He asks: ""Good sir Monster, why do you trouble us so much?! We are but humble""--- And the monster kicks the Trib right in the face. The Trib falls down to the village - ruined, injured and embarrassed. 

The council immediately holds a meeting. They realize that the Trib they sent was not qualified to represent the Tribs and they decide sending an elder of the Tribs is the right way to go. 

The Elder Trib makes his way, unsupported to the mountain top - and finally begins to speak: ""Monster of the Mountai---"" The Trib is immediately kicked - square in the fucking face - down the mountain by the Monster. 

Bewildered by the audacity of the Monster - the council decides they're fed up and will send their Rabbi up the mountain to confront the Monster. The Rabbi fearlessly climbs - huffing and puffing quickly to the top to confront the Monster. 

The Rabbi makes it to the Monster's lair and begins a conversation with him. After quite a while of normal conversation, the Rabbi becomes suspicious - wondering why he hasn't been kicked right in the face - straight down the mountain. 

And so the Rabbi asks: ""Mr. Monster, why haven't you kicked me down the mountain yet?""

The bartender offers him a drink. The fisherman says he does not have money to pay, so instead he offers a trade-- if he can get the bartender to laugh at his joke, then the bartender should provide a drink for free. The bartender, a smug, old pirate of a man accepts. After all, he is a moderator of /r/jokes, so he has become very accustomed to not laughing.

The fisherman begins his tale. ""Years ago, I set out on a whaling expedition, when a fellow sailor told me about the mystical golden fishing rod.""

""Let me stop you right there"" says the bartender. I can see where this is going. Golden rod. This is a sex joke. I've heard it before.""

""No. It's not a sex joke"" says the fisherman.

The bartender, fascinated, realizes that this may actually be OC.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""There once was a mystical golden fishing rod that was said to be so powerful that anyone using it could catch any fish.""

""Wait a minute"" says the bartender. ""I think you're in the wrong place. This sounds like the tale of Darth Plagueis. You want /r/prequelmemes down the street"".

""No. It's not a prequel meme"" says the fisherman.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""One day, a little boy found the rod and used it to catch a lion fish. Neptune, god of the sea appeared. He was furious because the lion fish was his best friend. In retaliation, Neptune broke the rod into pieces, separating the rod and the reel. The little boy said 'Now I am sad'.

""Oh, come on!"" said the bartender. ""Hey, Sad. I'm neptune! You want /r/dadjokes. Don't waste my time"".

""No. It's not a dadjoke"" says the fisherman.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""The boy took the pieces home, but they never worked again. Eventually, the rod was sold at a flea market, and the reel became the subject of many jokes.""

The fisherman then asks ""So, what did you think?""

The bartender, confused, looks up. ""What? That's it?""

The fisherman nods.

The bartender, now, is very confused. It's OC, sure, but it doesn't make any sense.

He scratches his head and asks a question ""What do you mean about the reel becoming the subject of many jokes?""

The fisherman says ""I can't answer that here"".

The bartender asks ""Why not?""

The fisherman replies ""The reel joke is always in the comments""",A fisherman walks into r/jokes,61

Mbeki would spend days watching the animals on the plain, learning and studying their behaviors.

Twice a year during the great animal migration from their summer to their winter feeding grounds and back, the villagers would gather their meagre belongings and hide in caves in the hills above their village. When they returned, they would find that their village had been ravaged by marauding elephants that would strip the straw and logs from their mud huts for food.

After one devastating year when the village was almost completely destroyed, Mbeki vowed to learn as much as he could about elephants to help his village. 

One day as he sat hidden in the tall grass he saw an old bull elephant with a broken tusk that appeared to be in distress. As Mbeki crawlled closer to observe, he noticed that the elephant was holding one foot off the ground. Mbeki crawed closer still and saw there was blood on the elephant's foot. 

Mbeki stood and approached the elephant nervously and saw a large thorn stuck beneath the elephant's foot. Screwing up his courage Mbeki held the elephant's foot in one hand and pulled at the thorn with all his might with his other hand. The thorn came loose at last, Mbeki gave a shout of triumph and the elephant gave a loud trumpet. 

Suddenly the elephant wrapped his trunk around Mbeki and lifted him high off the ground and Mbeki and the elephant looked at each other. Mbeki saw joy and thankfulness in the elephant's wise old eyes. After a long while the elephant gently placed Mbeki on the ground and stamped his front foot on the ground three times and slowly turned and walked away. 

After that day Mbeki vowed to double his efforts to learn all he could about the elephants. Soon he became famous for his knowledge throughout the land and was invited by neighbouring villages and cities and countries to talk about his experiences. 

Many years later, Mbeki now an old man after a long career travelling the world as the world's foremost expert on elephants finds himself back in the village he had lived as a child. But oh how it had grown, no longer a small dusty village of mud tracks and mud huts it was a modern city filled with all the trappings of modernity and a million people. It even had it's own zoo. Mbeki decides to visit. Mbeki walked around the animal enclosures smiling, remembering his life as a boy when suddenlh behind him he heard an elephant blow his trumpet. 

Mbeki turn and there, in front of him, an elephant with a broken task with it's trunk raised. They looked at each other, the elephant stamped it's feet on the ground three times. Mbeki could not believe it, his heart was filled with joy. 

Mbeki hobbled closer to the elephant, they looked at each other. Mbeki raised his hands and hugged the elephant. The elephant wrapped his trunk around Mbeki and lifted him off the ground and once again Mbeki could stare into those wise old elephant eyea. 

Suddenly the elephant threw Mbeki hard onto the ground and stamped on Mbeki's head three time killing him.

When i was about 17 or 18, I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.
First of all, - just for some background: My Mum died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.

Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.

I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).

Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.

My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.

After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.

My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.

Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.

But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.

A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised. But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.

It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.",I dont have any regrets for what I did last year....,11

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggles to their feet and put their clothes back on.

The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

So there was this professional assassin that charged $10,000 per bullet

A guy comes up to him in the bar one day and says, ‚ÄúAre you the guy who charges $10,000 a bullet?‚Äù

‚ÄúYup‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if you miss?‚Äù

He looks at the man, deadly serious. ‚ÄúThen I shoot another bullet and don‚Äôt charge for that one because I make customer satisfaction a priority.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat makes sense because bullets aren‚Äôt really a super expensive thing and I‚Äôd be unlikely to leave you a positive google review if you tried to charge me double than our original agreement for the job.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I find that the small losses I absorb on jobs that end up taking me multiple attempts are generally worth it in the long run in keeping a steady stream of business coming through which funds my sometimes lavish lifestyle.‚Äù

‚ÄúA fine outlook, for sure. So anyways, I have $20,000. I just found out my wife is having an affair with my best friend. They‚Äôre at the motel together right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, so that‚Äôs great. Are you paying with cash or will you Venmo me?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I only have the Cash app and I‚Äôm running low on storage on my phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is just fine. I do have the Cash app as well. I just haven‚Äôt logged in for some time now. Just give me a moment to make sure I can still receive money there or if I need to make a new account.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok that this is taking a few more minutes than expected. The pretense of this situation is not contingent on us leaving this bar within a particular timeframe. Think of the world outside of this bar as basically stuck, completely unmoving until you and I leave. Without this convenient aspect, I might be upset that we wouldn‚Äôt have much time to complete this job and get my revenge.‚Äù

‚ÄúI failed my password 18 times so it locked me out. I‚Äôve created a new account with the name ‚ÄòTheGuyWhoCharges$10,001PerBullet‚Äô. Just send the payment there once the job is complete.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is unexpected. Why did you choose that name?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf the feds see that you paid someone with that name on Cash app, they will know that it can‚Äôt be me who did the job since I charge 0.00009999% less than the name on the account does, thus leaving the trail cold.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, a clever maneuver indeed. Let‚Äôs head to the motel.‚Äù

So they drive to a store across the street from the motel and climb up on the roof. The assassin takes out his rifle and attaches the scope.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in Room 21. I want you to shoot her in the head and I want you to blow his dick off.‚Äù

The assassin looks through his scope. He keeps staring for several minutes, not taking the shot.

‚ÄúWell, what are you waiting for?‚Äù the husband asks.

‚ÄúThere is a serendipitous circumstance of sorts. I might just be capable of achieving this feat in one attempt due to the position of your wife‚Äôs head and your best friend‚Äôs penis.‚Äù

‚ÄúCertainly a fortuitous happenstance, but also a bit depressing considering my reason for revenge. Would I be able to save $10,000 on this transaction given the possibility of only using one bullet?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell as I touched on earlier, I don‚Äôt necessarily charge for each bullet fired. Also, due to the sometimes unpredictable pattern of the movements which change the length of penis within the mouth of your wife, it would take a bit of guesswork and since I cannot guarantee the completion of this job in one shot, I would only feel comfortable charging $15,000 if I can do this with one bullet just given the complexity of said shot but still the agreed upon $20,000 if it does require me a second bullet to exact your revenge. This is just something that we did not foresee during the initial phase of this job. I feel that this compromise allows me to be compensated fairly for accomplishing this difficult exploit, but also gives you, the customer, an unexpected savings which I do not advertise given how unusual these circumstances are.‚Äù

‚ÄúI judge this as acceptable. If you are able to make this shot with one bullet, then I end up saving some money, which I had not planned. I also have an even better review to leave for your services online. And even if it does take another bullet, I‚Äôm not going to be charged any more than I had previously budgeted for this contract.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerfect! Then I will certainly give this a go! It‚Äôs a real shame that we met as service provider and client rather than as two gentleman. I feel that we could have a most adequate friendship given our reasonableness.‚Äù

‚ÄúI must agree, but I still believe we could be at least acquaintances after this event, provided the feds don‚Äôt make a connection between both of us and this crime.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is an important observation. I do think it would be ok to have some level of contact after a few weeks. A long acquaintanceship surely awaits us after a relatively modest time has passed.‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed!‚Äù","RE-RE-RE-REMIX - So there was this professional assassin that charged $10,000 per bullet...",5

He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community...

If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.

I was getting ready to call the police when all of a sudden the one guys mom comes running and screaming. She pulls him away by his ear. The other two guys just fell down laughing.

While it was pretty funny, I had seen too many fights, and I honestly didnt feel safe where I was. At that point I pretty much decided I had had it with the east coast. I decided to pick up everything and move out to the west coast that day, and become a cabbie out there.

Believe it or not, on the first day of my job on the west coast, the first person to get in my cab was the same dude who's mom pulled him out of the fight.

The family had two twins who were both seniors in my class, Ving and Ling. Ving and his sister Ling were quiet to start off with, but eventually I made good friends with Ving. After talking to him for a few weeks he revealed to me that he absolutely abhored his name, and that he'd do almost anything to figure out how to get it changed. I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said

""lee, like bruce lee or some shit.""

I was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework. Ling overheard us and chimed in,

""If you do that, father will disown you as our child. That name has been in our family line for generations.""

Ving never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan. The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall. After we arrived, he had gotten the name-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change. I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice. Tears began to stream down his face. He finally decided that he was gonna have to cancel his request, and Ling looked relieved. The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancelation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her. Suddenly, A short asian man with neon shorts, ray-bans, and an american flag t-shirt bursted into the room. Ving turned in awe and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks.

""D-D-Dad?""

With a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son.

""Don't stop, be Lee, Ving.

Hold on the that fee, Ling""

Practical Joke 1: Stand in a circle. Be sure to have your hood on. You may have one person stand in the middle of the circle. Have as many people as possible. It will look like a cult ritual.

Practical Joke 2: When a teacher or person is pulling out something from a gym or media center, clear the path and salute as if they are pulling out a military weapon. Use as many people as possible.

Practical Joke 3: When you are at an amusement park such as Disneyland (it will work best there) say to a person ‚Äúwe are not here to have fun.‚Äù It is to weird out the people in line.

Practical Joke 4: Put a sticker under a mouse or just unplug it. It works best if the person using the mouse goes to find help. When they are looking for help, remove the sticker or plug in the mouse. 

Practical Joke 5: You need a long line of fishing line and underwear. Works best at night. Have two people hold up the underwear and high enough so your target can‚Äôt hit it. If you are doing this at the road, hold up the underwear as a car comes by. 

Practical Joke 6: You will need some sort of creepy costume, a drone strong enough to support the weight (dji mavic recommended), and fishing line. It works better if the drone is quieter or at high altitude. Attaching fishing line to the drone will make it less obvious that a drone is holding up the costume, but directly attaching the drone to the costume will give it more maneuverability. Have one person experienced enough to fly the drone, and check the FAA regulations before flying. We don‚Äôt want the police to put a 9x19 bullet in our drone.

He sits down and rests his head against the wall of a building and passes out.

Moments later, he wakes up and sees that he‚Äôs clearly being carried in a wheelbarrow. He freaks out and starts yelling at the man, ‚Äúwhat the hell! Where are you taking me!?

The man carrying him in the wheelbarrow suddenly dumps him off and replies back to him as he runs away, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not taking you anywhere, I‚Äôm already bringing you back!

Over the years she had asked with him to stop, or at least wait till he got to the toilet, but no matter how much she pleaded with him, he still refused to change his ways.

Finally she decided to teach him a lesson. 

One evening, when he had fallen asleep, she slipped a couple of meters of uncooked sausage into his underpants. The next morning he woke up, and just like every morning he let lose a hellish fart. Instantly he got an anxious look on his face, and holding his hands over his butt, he ran to the bathroom.

The wife, containing her laughter, got up and went about her business. 

After she had finished breakfast, she got a bit worried and went to knock on the bathroom door.
After a few minutes he came out, sweat running down his face, and exclaimed:

‚ÄúHoney. You‚Äôre not gonna believe this, but as I farted this morning, I actually farted out what must have been most of my lover intestines!

Devil: All right! You're gonna love Tuesdays. We get the finest cigars from around the world and smoke our friggin' lungs out. If you get cancer, it's okay -- you're already dead.

But to be fair, she hardly seemed to let it affect her. She would still join in with all the kids' horsin' around and runnin' about the farm. But then you'd look back, and there'd be Sam, strugglin' to keep up and breathin' harder than she should. Poor kid didn't deserve it. First we lost Pa last year when he slipped off the roof and now this tiny creature who'd never done harm to no one was made to suffer like the rest of us. It just wasn't fair.

After Pa died, Ma just couldn't hold the place together on her own. She'd sit on the porch and stare out into the fields like she was lookin' for something.  And then, to make things worse, the truck gone and fuckin' died on us. And with all the dust comin' in off the fields, little Sam's breathin' was gettin' worse and worse. We still had a bit of her medication left, but it was gonna run out eventually and the town was too far off to go on foot and leave Ma and the little ones by themselves. Without that truck I didn't know how we were gonna make it through.

I walked out into the field the night the truck died and started cursing the sky and throwin' everything I could get my hands on. If God thought it fit to punish us by takin' Pa, what was the damn point in takin' the truck too? Don't that bastard know I got a family to look after. ""And what about Sam, you rotten bastard?! You think a little girl deserves to live her whole life strugglin' for a single breath?! ""

And that's when I heard it. It wasn't a voice, really. But damned if it was the wind, either. ""Dig the hole. Set the post. Build the car. Save the girl."" It was like it was comin' from every direction at once and was louder than a thunder clap. I ran outta that field as fast as I could and went right the fuck to bed. I couldn't sleep that night. All I could think about was what that voice said. Was that rotten bastard God tryin' to tell me somethin'? Was this my damn ark? To build a damn fence?

Next mornin' I still hadn't gotten the voice outta my head. Sam was up and sittin' on the porch with Ma while the other kids were busy chasin' the hens around the yard. I'd gave Sam some of her meds and wandered down to the barn to see what lumber we had left sittin' around. Looked to be enough for a fence and the old one was pretty wore out anyway. I went to it. I dug up the old post and set a new one in. I packed the dirt around it and tied the new struts in. And on and on it went that day. Sun beatin' down and the dust kickin' up with each new hole.

That night I went to sleep thinkin' I must've been outta my damn mind. What fuckin' good was buildin' a fence when I ain't got a car to get to town and a whole damn family to look after? Maybe I was losin' my mind out here in all this dust. But if God really did have some sort of ""plan,"" who the Hell was I to question it. A tired sumbitch, but that was about it.

I got up before the rest of 'em the next day and walked down to where I'd left off at the fence the day before. And that's when I saw 'em. Sittin' on top of each fence post was a shiny new piece of metal. One post had a bolt, another a nut, and another a spring. Hell, one of 'em had a whole damn fender sittin' on it. If I was losin' my fuckin' mind, it was one helluva way to lose it. God had spoken to me and I'd been given my damn ark. 

From sunup to sundown I spent every day that week out there settin' posts and buildin' that fence in every direction I could. I'd get up the next mornin' and there'd be another piece of a car sittin' on top of the post lookin' as fresh and new as the day is bright. I'd take 'em all out to the barn and piece by piece I'd start replacin' the pieces of the old truck. Course the only thing bad on the truck was the damn engine, but if I was gettin' new pieces now, it had to some point get to the engine, right? A shiny new fender here, a new strut there. Eventually God was gonna come through, even if he was a rotten bastard.

Eventually I ran outta fence to build. I'd wrapped my damn self all the way around the house and the animal pens, but I still didn't have what I needed to get the truck runnin'. Sure I could start buildin' the fence out in different directions, but if my family thought I was crazy before replacin' a fence that wasn't even that old, what were they gonna say when I started buildin' it out into the sunset? So, I started sayin' things about how them posts just don't look straight to me. And down I'd go, dig up the post I'd set just a few days before, redig the hole, and set the post in all over again. And wouldn't you know, but I guess it worked cuz the parts kept showin' up.

But then things got bad. Hell, they was already bad. But this was real bad. I was so damn close to finishin' up that damn car when the worst dust storm we'd seen in years tore through the county. It was like the earth took one giant breath and heaved up all the dirt it kept hidden deep in its lungs. Poor little Sam could hardly breathe. She'd sit up in the kitchen with a wet towel over her head tryin' to keep the dust at bay. She was damn near out of her meds now and if this storm didn't stop, that little girl wasn't gonna make it. 

I wrapped my face up in a shirt and walked out into that storm determined to beat it and get the parts we needed. ""Dig up the post. Set the post. Get the part. Build the car."" That's all I could think or do. With the wind whippin' in every direction and so much dust in my eyes I couldn't see but a foot in front of me. ""Dig the hole. Replace the post. Get the car."" The dust was everywhere. The dust was fillin' up my ears so bad I couldn't even hear the wind howlin' anymore. All day and all night I went on through the dust. When the sun came up I walked back along each post I'd set and there were the parts. But there was still one missin'. I needed that damn spark plug if this thing was gonna start.

So back out into the dust. ""Dig hole. Replace post. Get car."" Over and over with each hole I dug I kept sayin' it in my head. Sam needed her meds. We needed that damn truck. This dust wasn't gonna stop me. I dug so many damn holes and replaced every damn post I could find. That little girl wasn't gonna die just because I was tired. Hell, no. If I had to dig up every post a hundred times to get that damn spark plug I'd do it. All through the night I went until my hands were bleedin' and I couldn't see straight. All the life was drained outta me. The dust musta stopped swirlin' sometime in the night, but I hadn't even noticed. Then I saw it. Sittin' on top of one of the posts was a fresh spark plug. The last piece I needed.

I grabbed it and started runnin' back towards the house. Ma was sittin' out front in her chair as usual and Sam beside her, towel over her head and fightin' for each little breath. I was almost up the steps when it all caught up to me. My vision went out and it sounded like someone was shovin' cotton down my ears and whistlin' at the same time. I knew I was tired but I didn't think my body'd give out on me like that. I slowly came to at the top of the steps with little Sam sittin' over me holdin' up the spark plug. And Ma, for the first time in ages since Pa died, looked over at me. Apparently I was mumblin' while layin' there passed out. ""What's that your brother's sayin', Sam?"" she asked. Sam leaned in close to hear what I was mumblin' in my delirious state. She shook her head all confused and looked up at Ma and strugglin' with her breaths, ""I...don't know...Ma. He's....not....makin'....any sense....Ma. Somethin'....about.....Re....post....get.....car....Ma...""",I didn't know how I was going to get my sister's medication,4

Two weeks later, the man returns and repays the $5,000, plus interest, which is $15.41.

We had proved that 420=6. Now, we know that the devil's number is 666.  But as we recall, the devil was once an angel. And everyone knows angels are saviours. And who is the greatest saviour of all time?

Every now and then, the duck wanders around, and sometimes crosses the fence into the neighbor's land.

The neighbor, Mr. Wilson, is a bitter, mean old man who always yells at the children for letting their duck cross onto his property.  

One Saturday, the family is outside having a BBQ together, just enjoying their day.  While the kids are eating, the duck flies up and goes over the fence.

Mr. Wilson is in particularly bad mood this day, and he decides that this is the last time. He goes inside, gets his gun, and shoots the duck dead right in front of the family.

The children are crying, the mother is angry, so the father goes over to the fence and says to Mr. Wilson, ""Please give me back the duck so we can bury him.""

""No way,"" replies Mr. Wilson. ""It's on my property, it belongs to me. I'm going to have it for dinner.""

The two argue about the duck for a while, the children still crying about their pet. Finally, the father is frustrated and says to Mr. Wilson, ""Fine, let's settle this like men. We'll have a below the belt contest.  Last man standing can have the duck.""

Mr. Wilson agrees, and since the father made the challenge, he goes first.  The father backs up to the other side of the property, runs across his field, jumps the picnic table, runs across the yard, leaps over the fence, and kicks Mr. Wilson squarely in the dick as hard as he can.

Mr. Wilson rolls around on the ground, swearing and gasping with tears in his eyes. He gets up and his head is spinning and his ears are ringing.  He takes a couple minutes to fully get back to his feet.  He is determined now to win and keep the duck, if nothing else then just on principle.

""Alright, my turn!"" Says Mr. Wilson to his neighbor.

One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out  of sight, and began dividing the nuts.  ‚ÄúOne for you, one for me, one for you, one for me,‚Äù  said one boy. Several of the nuts dropped and rolled down toward the fence.
As they were dividing the nuts, another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery.  He slowed down to investigate.  Sure enough, he heard, ‚ÄúOne for you, one for me, one for you, one for me.‚Äù  In an instant he just knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and raced to find someone to tell about what he had heard..
Just around the bend he met an old man with a  cane, hobbling along.  ‚ÄúCome here quick,‚Äù said the boy, ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt  believe what I heard! The devil and God are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!‚Äù   The man said, ‚ÄúBeat it kid, can‚Äôt you see it‚Äôs hard for me to walk.‚Äù  When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery.
Standing by the fence they heard, ‚ÄúOne for you, one for  me. One for you, One for me.‚Äù  The old man whispered, ‚ÄúBoy, you‚Äôve been telling me the truth. Let‚Äôs see if we can see God.‚Äù  Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of God.  At last they heard, ‚ÄúOne for you, one for me.
