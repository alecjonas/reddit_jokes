Little Lucy went next. 

""My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.""

Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.

Lucy replied, ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch.""

Next up was little Johnny. 

""My uncle Ted fought in the Iraq war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 enemy soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""

The teacher looked a little shocked. 

After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.

Johnny replied, ""Don't fuck with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.""

He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

*Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, Ding-dong.*

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter.  Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk.  “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”

The hippie is positively smitten with her and thinks she is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. As it happens she sits right across the aisle from him.

The hippie can't contain himself. He leans over and tells her ""you are very beautiful, and I would love to fuck you.""

The nun gets quite flustered and gets off the bus at the next stop.

Later, as the hippie is getting off the bus, the driver says to him. ""Hey, I saw you talking to that beautiful nun. And I notice she got off the bus a few stops early. What did you say?""

The hippie confesses that he told her he wanted to fuck her.

The bus driver says ""I totally understand. Here is the thing. She is a regular on my bus. I happen to know that every night around 10:00pm she goes to the cemetery and prays near a large statue of the Virgin Mary. Maybe if you saw her there, she might react differently.""

The hippie goes home and thinks it over. He realizes that there is no way this nun will ever fuck him as he is. So, he concocts a plan. He finds a mask and wig that look like a wise old man. He puts them on, along with a robe and heads to the cemetery.

Sure enough, at 10:00pm he sees her there, kneeling in prayer. He comes up behind her and says, ""My child. I am the Lord and I have come to have sex with you.""

The nun answers, ""My Lord, I am yours for the taking, but I do ask that you take me in the ass, as I want to remain a virgin for life, just like my role model, the Virgin Mary.""

The hippie is down with that, so he bends her over, lifts her habit, and proceeds to absolutely pound her in the ass. 

After he comes, he tears off the mask and yells ""HA HA! It is me, the hippie from the bus!""

And the nun tears off her masks and yells

""HA HA! It is me! The Bus Driver!""",Stoned out hippy on a bus,18

Now, Rick loved to ride his motorcycle, but was tired of driving up and down the same roads, day after day.

One morning, he woke up, and decided to travel the world. So he saved up some money, got on a plane, along with his trusty Harley, and set out to explore the globe.

For the next few weeks, Rick spent his days riding to and through some of the most popular European cities like Paris, London, and Rome.

After seeing all Europe had to offer, he moved on to explore the rest of the world. Over the next few months, he rode through the African savannas, the deserts of Egypt, and even made it to the top of Mount Everest.

He was having the time of his life until he reached a small town in China. Unexpectedly, and out of nowhere, a beautiful Chinese maiden crossed his path, causing him to fly off and crash his motorcycle. Apologizing, the maiden offered Rick to pay for the repairs and a place to stay while they fixed his bike. “My name is Yu! It’s an honor to meet you!” the beautiful maiden introduced herself to Rick.

It turned out she was the daughter of a rich magistrate, so he spent the night in a small palace in the center of town. However, due to the scarcity of motorcycle parts, Rick had to spend several days in the palace, in the presence of Yu. Over the next few days, she took a liking to him and his strange American ways. As expected, Rick took a liking to her, too.

The two quickly became inseparable, but Yu’s father did not approve, for Rick was an outsider. By the time the motorcycle was finally up and running, Rick had fallen madly in love with Yu and refused to leave. Yu begged her father to let him stay, but instead, the Magistrate had Rick banished from the town. He warned him if he ever came back, he would have him beheaded.

Rick was devastated, he had no motivation to continue on the rest of his journey. It seemed as though there was nothing left for him in the world, if he didn’t have his beloved Chinese maiden.

So he did the only thing any other sane guy would do….

Rick rolled back into town screaming,

Back in 1995, we lived in rural Texas. One day two men arrived with their young boy Javier. They had left Mexico to escape persecution. You see they were a gay couple, and those things weren’t tolerated in Mexico at that time. And things weren’t much better in Texas then either as once the authorities found out the parents were taken into custody and Javi was taken in to care. 

As a family that emigrated from Mexico, we were asked to help, so we took him in as foster carers and we soon found out that his parents did an excellent job of taking care of him, and that it was only because they were gay that they were taken away from him.

We wrote to Ross Perot, a prominent politician in our area, who thankfully took on the task.  Within a day he took the argument to the CPS and local law enforcement, and successfully got the boys fathers released.

And that is why, around this time of year Spanish speaking families sing this song to celebrate the family being reunited;  
 Release Javi’s Dads,

Release Javi’s Dads!

Ross Perot argued, to release his Daddies.","Back in 1995, we lived in rural Texas. (Long) (OC)",3

He turned to see a little girl struggling in the broken ice in the middle of the lake. She'd been skating and had fallen into the icy water. Without a moment's hesitation the tramp ran onto the ice and slipped and slided over to the little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and he carried her back to the road.

He took off his coat and wrapped the little girl in it and began looking for a car to flag down. A few moments later a huge chauffeur-driven limo pulled up, and who stepped out but the little girl's father - the mayor of the nearby town and a multi-millionaire.

""How can I ever thank you sir?"" says the father after putting his daughterinto the warmth of the limo.

""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ahem, well ..."" stammered the tramp ""...eh I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out""

""Certainly"" says the girl's father and he pulls out his wallet.

""Oh dear"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten dollars - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten dollars is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that will be plenty"".

""Well, if you insist"" says the father - ""now what will you do with your money?""

""Oh that's easy"" says the tramp ""I've not had a rest in 20 years. I think I'll buy myself a holiday""

""Well good luck"" says the father, and he gets into the car and signals his chauffeur to drive home.

""Ten Dollars"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"", and off he goes to the town, to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk.

""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind"" replied the tramp.

""Well how much money does sir have to spend on sir's holiday?""

""Oh lots - anything up to ten dollars""

""TEN DOLLARS!! You'll never get a holiday for ten dollars"" says the girl incredulously.

""Oh dear"" said the tramp, ""and I was so looking forward to a holiday - I'll probably never get another chance - isn't there anything you can do?""

""Well I don't think so sir, but hold on and I'll check""

The girl goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop.

""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten dollars""

""Yippee"", exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it""

The tramp takes the tickets and, shouldering his dirty old pack, he heads out the door to hitch-hike to the port where the ship is waiting.

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Amazed at his luck and good fortune, he slings his pack over his shoulder, and marches up the gangplank.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""Super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

Hardly believeing his eyes, the captain examines the ticket and admits that our man the tramp is correct.

""Ahem, well O.K."", says the captain, ""But you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst"", says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship! The tramp had never in his wildest dreams imagined luxury like this.

First they went doen through the first class level:

Oriental carpets - 6"" pile.

A genuine Rembrahndt on every wall.

Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair.

24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class:

As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep.

and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class,

down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with, a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing...""

""Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived....

...and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple. Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Eh, well I've never actually dived before"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen ....""

He broke off.

""Hey, I've an idea"", he started again.

""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man.

For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Then one morning the captain came to talk.

""O.K. I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""O.K."" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck.

Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Then the tramp turned to regard the diving board. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well tramp"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do.""

And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie.

And the tramp began to climb....

up and up ...

up and up ...

higher and higher ...

below him the ship grew smaller ...

up and up ...

on and on ...

past a solitary albatross ...

and still higher, till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below ...

still further, till the ocean grew dim, and the earth itself began to shrink...

and higher, ever higher ...

on and on ....

higher, and higher, and on and on towards the diving board,

He climbed on top and radioed the captain .... and then...

he jumped .

slowly at first

but speeding up

faster, and faster

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance,

the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster...

past the albatross,

faster

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

DOWN!

THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!

THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL..........

SMASH! into into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping....

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

HERO! WONDERFUL! AMAZING! BLOODY GOOD SHOW WHAT!

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most STUPENDOUS piece of diving I have ever seen""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on:

""But tell me; most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly:

""Well you see I'm a poor tramp so you must understand...

I've been through many a hardship in my life”","On a cold winter’s morning, a tramp was walking along a country road...",19

Two more whiskeys later he is belligerent in his demand. ""Barman! What the hell is in that box?"" The bartender, seeing the man is not going to let this go replies, ""It's a little guy. He plays the piano."" 

""I've gotta see it!"" the man yells and the bartender acquiesces. He opens the box, pulls out a small piano, a small bench and a man, less than a foot tall dressed in a tuxedo. He straightens his tails, flexes his fingers, sits on the bench and begins to play the piano. The patron is astounded. 

""Wherever did you find such an amazing man?"" He asks. 

The bartender replies, ""I found a lamp in the alley out back when I was taking out the trash earlier. I bent down and cleaned it up a little when a genie popped out and said he'd grant me one wish. This is what I got.""

""What did you do with the lamp?"" asked the slightly inebriated man. 

""I left it in the alley. I bet it's still there.""

The man is up in a flash, out the back door, into the alley. A few moments pass when suddenly a tremendous storm of live ducks comes raging through the bar. They are knocking bottles off the wall, blowing out the windows, crushing through the doors. The rush continues for almost twenty minutes. Finally, a bedraggled, beaten and dirty man stumbles in from the alley and regards the bartender with a look of amazement and disappointment.

'Yeah,' he said ' I really need a push.'
'Its the middle of the night, mate.' I yelled, ' you can fuck right off.' And I slammed the door in his face before climbing the stairs and getting back into bed. After a minute, the wife asked 'who was it?'

'He wanted a push.'
'Well, did you give him one?'

Their son, Bilbo, is going to bed one day. Bilbo says, ""Night night Mummy. Night night Daddy. Night night Granny. Goodbye Grandpa.""

The parents thought this strange, but anyway, the lives go on.

Until a week later, when Grandpa dies.

This is all very sad, so the family keeps comfort of Granny, so they stay at her house for another month. Then one night, Bilbo says,""Night night Mummy. Night night Daddy. Goodbye, Granny.""

And again, they think nothing of it, since Grandpa was very old.

But then a week later, Granny dies.

The family feels horrified and rush back down to their house and console what's happened. The husband and wife are fearing their lives, until one night Bilbo says, ""Night night Mummy. Goodbye, Daddy.""

And obviously the husband was super freaked out and knew what would happen if he didn't do something within a week, so he came up with an idea: he would work late next week so he knew he was alive, and he would come back very very early the next morning.

And so he executes his plan, and he comes home.

He's alive!

He gets in, and goes into the living room where the wife is, and the wife is furious. The husband apologises for a long day at work and the wife retorts,

""You think you've had a bad day!! I bet it's nothing - the postman dropped dead on the doormat just yesterday morning!""

""Three years! Wow. I\`ve been floating in this barrel for six weeks. I\`ll bet after three years you could go for a nice steak dinner.""

When they are done, the woman says, ""I\`ll bet after three years you could go for some champagne.""

""Champagne!"" says the guy.

So the woman reaches into the barrel and pulls out a bottle of champagne and two fluted glasses. She pops the cork and they enjoy some champagne.

Now the bubbles are starting to go to her head, and she says to the guy, ""Three years, huh? What do you think ... do you want to play around?""

The bartender notices this, and comes up with a plan to help the cops. “Here’s what you have to do,” he says. “Just give them each one of these drinks, and they’ll stop bothering you.”

So the cops give the drinks to the group, and watch events unfold. 

First, everything seems unchanged. Then, they suddenly become much quieter—almost like they’re stoned, with some occasionally laughing at nothing. 

Next, they start shivering as if it’s incredibly cold. 

Lastly, they start looking around as if they’re scared. “Everything’s going dark, they say. We should get out of here.” And they do, but not before one of them (in their increasing clumsiness) drops a $100 bill by accident.

“That was amazing! What were those drinks?” the cops ask.

“It was my own recipe,” the bartender replies. “One part whiskey, one part marijuana concentrate, one part liquid nitrogen, and one part bleach. In other words...”

“One drink to fool them all, one drink to fine them. One drink to cool them all, and in the darkness blind them.”","Two cops are sitting in a bar when a group of loud, rude assholes start arguing behind them.",3

When they land, they start walking along the road back to base. They encounter a house, and a small boy sat outside crying. They ask him why he's crying, to which he explains ""I was playing in my garden and a radio hit me on the head."" The soldiers chuckle nervously and decide to keep walking.

They come across another house with a boy crying outside. They ask him why *he's* crying, to which he answers ""I was playing in my garden and a machine gun hit me in the foot."" The soldiers look at each other nervously before marching onward.

Finally, they come across a boy absolutely dying of laughter, rolling around on the floor. They ask him what's so funny and, after several seconds of trying to regain his composure he tells them ""I farted and my house blew up!""","An army plane is crashing, and three soldiers are on board",363

A little context. My Mum loves Disney, and by extention Disneyland. A few years ago we went, and while I, a late teenager, hated it, my Mum, child at heart she is l, loved it. 

So I came home from Uni to celebrate Christmas and New Years. My family were watching the countdown here in the UK,  and as we entered the New Year with a grand fireworks display.

My Mum, after the family had spend a few seconds watching the fireworks, said aloud ""The ones at Disney were better"", to which I defensively responded ""Oh, shut your gob"".

A moment passes before I started laughing,  and when I pointed out the first words I spoke to my Mum in 2019 was an offhand insult she began laughing with me.

Just incase anyone misunderstands, this is all just familial banter; we speak to one another in this manner all the time, so u wasn't just being a dick.

She slides them down behind him, hops out of bed, and runs to the bathroom, barely able to contain her laughter. Soon enough, she hears it, and waits impatiently for his yell.
Several minutes go by and she starts thinking he missed them, so she peeks out and sees him sitting on the edge of the bed, pale as a ghost. He looks up at her and says “It finally happened. I shit my guts out.”

""Also, I've had some issues with making a few racial comments about the other people around us.""

The friend recommends a sensitivity training book for her to skim through before going on the date and keep reviewing things in her head before saying out loud. The woman says that she won't censor herself just so others fell better about themselves and their flaws.

""Not to mention, because I don't shampoo my hair so I can build a balance of natural oils, guys can't bear to get close to me from the smell.""

""I'm also very old fashioned, which tends to turn guys off. He always has to pay for the meal in full and I absolutely refuse to put out until the fifteenth date, no exceptions.""

Her friend hands her $100 to pay for the meal so that she's not technically paying, and tells her that an arbitrary number of dates isn't helping her find love. The woman is insulted and claims that it's about the principal, not the money, throwing the $100 into the wind.

""I was one of their most valuable spies for almost ten years. 

I was on top of the world. Women wanted me. Men wanted to be me. I got tail everywhere i went and have pups all over""

"" but the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.""

""Five dollars,"" the guy says.

""Five dollars? This dog is amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheap??""

Stealing is a dream from her youth. He wants to go fast to a bus. The tragedy, someday, is very serious and has become a disaster. He was outdoors, but one man died. Yes, he is a plainteacher, he has been in court for this act. He was wrong, and he was sentenced to death by the choice. At the end of the day of destruction, it will test one as well as the last gear. After treating the aroma, he was diagnosed in the lungs. The rain was running, the lights were lighted, and the smoke was covered with air - but nothing was found. The man was good.


At that time, an ancient Bulgarian law was a sign of contradiction, so the man was discharged. Although he had gained his old career after steering on the train. As a result of his coaching in his teaching, he was quickly revisited by steering wheelchair. Again, he has been a target of injuries, now killing two people. Much of the trial is like the first one, the result of the correlation. Last night, the man asked for a two-pronged burial. After managing the banana, he was logged into the airline. The knob was knocked down, and it was flying, the house was covered with smoke - and the man was injured again.


The fruit is the fruit of its yield. And again, he was able to release his first job. It is a matter of fact that one has been beaten by another and killed three people. And therefore he is again empowered to punish death. On the day of his execution, he asked for the last fish: three warriors.


""What's the matter?"" It says the killer. ""I have gotten you a little cheat and went out with a mistake, and I'm not going to give you something to eat, we're just trying to do this."" Instead, the protocol was opposed, but the person was arrested in the radio with the final dietary shortages. The buckler was pulled down, the lights were lighted, and the room was filled with smoke - a failure to release the man. The lawyer did not hesitate.


The man looked at the headline and said, ""No, there is nothing about the cat, I'm the only one who is a bad guy.""","So, in Bulgarian, he is the driver of a lifetime.",3

“It’s certainly not a ship,” he thinks to himself.

As the speck gets closer and closer the man starts to rule out the possibility that it’s a small boat or even a raft.

Suddenly, emerging from the surf, is a beautiful blonde woman wearing scuba gear and a wet suit.

She approaches the man, who can’t believe his eyes.

“Tell me, how long has it been since you’ve had a cigarette?” she asks the man.

“It’s been 10 years,” he replies.

With that, the woman reaches over and unzips a waterproof pocket on her left sleeve and pulls out a packet of cigarettes.

The man takes one, lights it and takes a long drag.

“Man, that is good!” he says.

“And how long has it been since you’ve had a sip of bourbon?” the woman asks.

Trembling, the castaway explains that it’s also been 10 years.

Sure enough, the woman reaches over, unzips her right sleeve and pulls out a flask.

The man opens it and takes a swig.

“This is the best day of my life,” he says.

The woman starts unzipping her long zipper that runs down the front of her wet suit and looks at the man seductively.

“How long has it been since you’ve had some real fun?” she cheekily asks.

With tears in his eyes, the man falls to his knees and sobs.

Hing immediately went back to the university. Having boned up on ornithology and traditional Chinese medicine, he decided that the answer was a prescription of gum-tree leaf tea. He gathered bushels of the tea leaves, brewed gallons of the tea, and poured it into the chicken for the two months.

Meanwhile, Ming traveled all around China, praying at the shrines of his ancestors. One night he had a dream. His ancestors appeared and told him to feed the chicken tea made from gum-tree leaves!!!

Ming, aware of his brother’s lack of success, decided that the problem was quantity. He gathered whole CARTLOADS of leaves, and brewed BARRELS of the tea, and poured them into the chicken for the two months. At the end of the time, the poor chicken was still as naked as a bowling ball.

But the apprentice turned out to be a terrible shaman. Within a week, the chief could not take it anymore, and left to search for the old shaman. He found him and begged, ""Please come back to tribe.""

The shaman asked, ""Why should I come back?""

The chief tried bribery. ""If you come back, I feed you belly full.""

The shaman agreed, so they both went back, and the chief gave the shaman a big meal.

When the apprentice saw his mentor had returned, he asked, ""Why back so soon?""

The old shaman explained, ""Full me once, shaman you. Full me twice, shaman me.""

One day, as Joe is walking home from work, viola in hand, he stumbles across a peculiar looking lamp. Being utterly dissatisfied with his life, Joe rubs the lamp, and a genie appears.

""Waddya want?"" the genie asks in a Jersey accent. Joe thinks for a moment, then replies, ""Genie, I want to be the best violist in the Kansas Radio Symphony!"" The genie snaps his fingers. ""Then it is done.""

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, Joe goes to work and he's the principal violist of the Kansas Radio Symphony. But Joe isn't satisfied. After a long day of playing, Joe goes back to the Genie and says, ""Genie, for my second wish, I want to be the best violist in the country!"" The genie snaps his fingers. ""If that's what you want, man, then it is done.""

&amp;#x200B;

The following morning, Joe heads to work and he's the principal violist of the New York Philharmonic! *What an honor,* Joe thinks. But it still isn't enough. After rehearsal, Joe returns to the genie a third time and makes his final wish: ""Genie, I wish to be the best violist in the entire world!"" The genie snaps his fingers. ""Then it is done.""

Frantic and worried that he will be recognized, the bit of string hatches an idea for a disguise. 

He starts by rolling around on the ground, to the point he becomes dirty and tattered. 
Next, he ties himself up like a pretzel; resembling the laces of an old pair of dirty tennis shoes. 

Satisfied with his appearance, the string approaches the checkpoint with great caution, where he is met by a police officer who stops him and begins an interrogation. 

Nervous but well disguised, the bit of string answers all of the questions thrown at him by the policeman; praying that each question will be the last. Finally the cop begins to wrap up... 

“Alright, one last thing I need to ask before letting you go on your way.” 

‘By all means’ replies the fugitive. 

“You wouldn’t happen to be a piece of string would you?” 

‘Sorry, frayed knot’.
