What the mouse did not know was there was a cat watching the mouse watching the hunter’s sandwich watching the hunter watching the bear watching the bear watching the fish watching the fly.

The officer shrugged and, considering the rest of the neighborhood he still needed to alert, continued on his way.

Later that evening, the woman watched from her second-story bedroom window as the flood waters rose up over her porch and poured into the first floor of her house. The local fire-rescue team pulled up to her house in a boat and, seeing her in the window, called up to her.

""Ma'am, the river hasn't crested yet, and these waters are gettin' mighty dangerous. You have to come with us now and we'll take you to safety.""

Still calm, the woman called back, ""I'm not worried. I place my faith in God, and I know he will deliver me from danger.""

The rescuers looked at each other and shrugged. The situation was getting too dangerous to waste time arguing, so they continued on their way.

Around midnight, sitting on the roof of her house as the flood waters worked their way ever higher, the woman watched the searchlight of a helicopter dart from roof to roof until it landed on hers. As the helicopter hovered overhead, a rescue swimmer was lowered on a winch and held out a hand to the woman.

""Please, you must come with us. If you stay here you'll surely drown!""

But the woman waved him off. ""I'm not worried. I place my faith in God, and I know he will deliver me from danger.""

An hour later, the woman drowned.

As her spirit floated up to heaven, God welcomed her and said, ""Welcome, my child, and be at peace."" But God could tell that something was troubling the woman. ""What is it my child? What is troubling you?""

""Well..."" the woman began. ""My entire life I was very religious. I attended church every Sunday and prayed to you many times each and every day. I placed all my faith in you, even as the flood took my home and all my worldly belongings. Why..."" she stammered a bit, ""why didn't you deliver me from danger?""

God looked her square in the face. ""I sent a police officer, a boat, and a helicopter. What more did you want?""",Praying for salvation...,82

After Mrs. Jacobs found out her husband was sterile, the couple decided to hire a proxy father to start their family. On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Jacobs kissed his wife and said 'I'm off to work, Lydia. The guy should be here soon.'

Wouldn't you know it, a door-to-door baby photographer came by half an hour later, hoping to make a sale. Mrs. Jacobs answered the door. 'Good morning, ma'am. You don't know me, but I've come to...' 'Oh yes, I know why you're here. Harry told me you'd be coming soon.' 'He did? But I...' 'Come right in! No use wasting time .' 'Very well, then.'

The photographer took out his briefcase and sat down. 'As you may already know, I've made a specialty of babies.' 'Good, I'm glad,' said Mrs. Jacobs. 'That's just what Harry and I were looking for.'

'I usually like to try two in the bathtub, one on the couch and perhaps a couple on the bed,' said the photographer. 'The living room floor is fun too...you can really spread out.' 'Bathtub? Living room floor? No wonder it never worked for Harry and me.' 'Well, ma'am, none of us can guarantee a perfect one every time, but if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven different angles, I think you'll be quite pleased with the results.'

'I certainly hope we can get this over with quickly,' Mrs. Jacobs gasped nervously. 'Ma'am, in my line of work a man must take his time. I'd like to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure.' 'Don't I know!' said Mrs. Jacobs.

The photographer pulled out a portfolio of his pictures. 'This one was done on top of a bus in downtown London,' he said, showing Mrs. Jacobs the picture. 'Oh my God!' exclaimed Mrs. Jacobs, tugging on her handkerchief.

'And these twins turned out exceptionally well when you consider the fact that their mother was so difficult to work with.' He showed Mrs. Jacobs another picture. 'She was difficult?' questioned Mrs. Jacobs. 'Extremely,' said the photographer. 'I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the job done right. People were crowding around, four and five deep, just to get a good look.' 'Four and five deep!' Mrs. Jacobs was amazed. 'Yes,' said the photographer. 'And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling. I could hardly concentrate. Then, it started getting dark and I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels started nibbling on my equipment. I just packed it all in.'

Mrs. Jacobs leaned forward. 'You mean the squirrels actually chewed on your, um...equipment?' 'Yes, ma'am. Thank God, no real damage was done.

Well, we'll get to work as soon as I set up my tripod.'

'Tripod? ' Mrs. Jacobs looked extremely worried now.

'Of course. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much to big for me to hold while I'm getting ready for action. Ma'am...ma'am...good God, she's fainted!'","After Mrs. Jacobs found out her husband was sterile, the couple decided to hire a proxy father...",16185

Two guys are walking through the woods one day when they stumble across a big deep hole.

The first guy peers into it and says, “Wow! That looks deep.”

The second guy says, “It sure does. Let’s throw a few pebbles in there and see how deep it is. We’ll be able to tell the depth by how long it is before we hear the noise of the pebbles landing.”

So they pick up a few pebbles and throw them in and wait. Nothing. There’s no noise.

The first guy says, “Jeeez. That is really deep. I know, let’s throw one of these great big rocks down there. Those should make a noise.”

So they pick up a couple football-sized rocks and toss them into the hole and wait… and wait… Again, nothing.

They look at each other in amazement. Then the first guy gets a determined look on his face and says, “Hey, over here in the weeds, there’s a railroad tie. Help me carry it over. When we toss that sucker in, it’s gotta make some noise.”

So the two of them drag the heavy tie over to the hole and heave it in. Once again, not a sound comes from the hole.

Suddenly, out of the nearby woods, a goat appears, running like the wind. It rushes toward the two men, then right past them, running as fast as it’s legs will carry it. Suddenly it leaps in the air and into the hole.

The two men are astonished with what they’ve just seen and look at each other in amazement.

Then, out of the woods comes a farmer who spots the men and ambles over. He asks them, “Hey, you two guys seen my goat out here?”

The first guy says, “You bet we did! Craziest thing I ever saw. It came running like crazy and just jumped into this hole and disappeared!”

She was carrying a large bag full of money. She insisted on speaking with the bank manager to open a savings account because, “It’s a lot of money.”

After a great deal of negotiating, the bank staff decided to humor her and finally ushered her into the manager’s office. The bank manager asked her how much she would like to deposit.

To his astonishment she replied, “£150,000!” and dumped the cash out of her bag on to his desk.

The manager was curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asked her, “Madam, it is a little unusual for someone to be carrying so much cash around. Where did you get this money?”

The old lady replied, “Gambling.”

The manager then asked, “Gambling? What kind of gambling?”

The old woman said, “Well, for example, I’ll bet you £25,000 that your testicles are square.”

“Ahem!” coughed the bank manager, “If you don’t mind me saying so, that’s a rather silly bet. You can never win that kind of bet.”

The old lady challenged him, “So, would you like to take my bet?”

“If you insist,” said the bank manager. “I’ll be very happy to bet £25,000 that my testicles are not square!”

The little old woman said, “Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. as a witness?”

“Certainly,” replied the bank manager.

That evening after work the bank manager started to have second thoughts about the bet and spent ages in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side until he was sure there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet.

The next morning, at precisely 10 a.m., the little old woman appeared with her lawyer at the bank manager’s office. She introduced the lawyer to the head of the bank and repeated the bet: “£25,000 says the bank manager’s balls are square!”

The banker agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see.

The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them. “Well, if you must,” said the bank manager, “£25,000 is a lot of money so you are entitled to be absolutely certain.”

Just then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall.

The bank manager said to the old lady, “What’s wrong with him?”

She replied, “Nothing, except I bet him £100,000 that at 10 a.m. today I would have the Bank manager’s balls in my hand.”",A little old woman walked into the bank...,28

While the boy and his father were watching with amazement, a fat old lady in a wheel chair moved up to the moving walls and pressed a button.

The walls opened, and the lady rolled between them into a small room. The walls closed and the boy and his father watched the small numbers above the walls light up sequentially. They continued to watch until it reached the last number. and then the numbers began to light in the reverse order.

Finally the walls opened up again and a gorgeous 24-year-old blond stepped out. The father, not taking his eyes off the young woman, said quietly to his son.....

A grumpy bishop in a hurry on his way to a ceremony stops by a small Irish town as he's weak with the hunger.

He see's a restaurant, the only place he's seen in miles that serves food. So he parks up and rushes in.

A smiling waiter kindly greets him, but the bishop rushes passed to a table - snapping his order at him.

Bishop: ""I want a rare steak and side plate of veg! And I'm in a rush so BLOODY hurry up!""

So the waiter keeping his cool and not saying anything decided to serve the bishop a very very rare steak instead for his rude manner.

Waiter smirking while serving says: ""Here's your BLOODY steak your holiness"".

The bishop picked up on the waiters attitude and insisted why he called it a ""bloody"" steak. Bishop: ""How dare you speak to I, your holiness, in that manner!""

The waiter chirped up quickly and insisted ""that's what the rare steaks were called in the area.""

The bishop half ignoring him began to eat the steak then left, went about his journey and fulfilled his obligations.

Some time later in the year the bishop was passing by the small town again and decided he would love one of those juicy rare ""bloody"" steaks. He parked up again at the same restaurant and in he went to make his order.

The bishop notices a waiter, not the same as before approaching him.

Before the smiling new waiter can greet him the bishop rudely brushes passed him and brings himself to a table and barks out his order;

Bishop: ""I want one of those ""bloody"" steaks!""

Two of the figures had black penises, but the one in the middle had a pink penis. The curator of the gallery realized that they were having trouble interpreting the painting and offered his personal assessment.

He went on for over half an hour explaining how it depicted the sexual emasculation of African Americans in a predominately white patriarchal society . ""In fact"", he pointed out, ""some serious critics believe that the pink penis also reflects the cultural and sociological oppression experienced by gay men in contemporary society"".

After the curator left, an Irishman approached the couple and said, ""Would you like to know what the painting is really about?""

""Now why would you claim to be more of an expert than the curator of the gallery"", asked the couple?

No one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot. Finally, one man says. ""Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m."" He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.
The woman says this may be a problem, and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.
They roll their eyes, but say, ""Okay."" She's there at 6:30 a.m. sharp, and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round. She's fun and pleasant, and the guys are impressed. They congratulate her and invite her back the next week. She smiles, and says, ""I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45.""
The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp. Only this time, she plays left-handed. The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand. They're totally amazed. They can't figure her out. She's very pleasant and a gracious winner. They invite her back again, but each man harbours a burning desire to beat her.
The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys. This week she plays right-handed, and narrowly beats all three of them. The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part. However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong
play, they can't hold a grudge.
This woman is a riddle no one can figure out. They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse, and finally, one of the men asks her, ""How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?""
The lady blushes, and grins. ""When my Dad taught me to play golf, I learned I was ambidextrous,"" she replies. ""I like to switch back and forth.""
""When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.""
The guys think this is hysterical. Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, ""What if it's pointing straight up?""
She says, ""Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.""",New woman joins a golf club.,137

I am being 100 percent serious when I say this. This shouldn't even be an unpopular opinion, people just don't think about what the word ""difficult"" actually means.  Peeing with a boner is more difficult than giving birth. Giving birth is definitely more painful, but pain by itself does not make something difficult. For example, putting my hand in a fire is not difficult, but it would hurt a lot. In order for something to be difficult, there has to be some chance of failure due to lack of skill, practice, or technique. Peeing with a boner often requires creative problem solving skills, especially in small spaces. There is no creative problem solving aspect of giving birth. Additionally, the way humans have evolved for these two actions supports my point. Giving birth is a natural process, which humans have evolved to be able to do. The female body is literally designed so that it can give birth with the lowest possible chance of error. The only real error that can happen is a mis-carriage, which is also a natural occurrence, not a failure that occurs due to a lack of skill in giving birth. The male body, on the other hand, has evolved specifically so that peeing with a boner is very difficult. The only purpose for having a boner is to impregnate a woman, so the male body evolved to prevent urination during sex. On top of the difficulty in simply getting the pee to flow, there's the issue of actually positioning yourself so that the boner is pointing into the toilet bowl (urinals are much easier, but not always an option). In the past, I have had to give up and wait until my boner goes away because it was simply too difficult to actually pee in the toilet. There has never been a case where a woman has tried to give birth after being pregnant for nine months, not been able to do it, and said ""fuck it"" and waited 3 more months to try again because it would be easier the second try. Giving birth happens, every single time, because it's a natural process - peeing with a boner is the opposite.

In conclusion, peeing with a boner is hard.",Peeing with a boner is more difficult than giving birth.,3

A poor man meets a rich man around Christmas.

The poor man asks the rich man, “What are you getting your wife this Christmas?”

The rich man replies, “Diamond earrings and a Mercedes.”

The poor man asks, “Why are you getting her two gifts?”

The rich man says, “Well, if she doesn’t like the earrings then she can drive to the store and exchange them.”

The poor man nods. Then the rich man asks him, “So what are you getting your wife this year?” The poor man thinks about it for a second and replies, “A pair of slippers and a dildo.”

The rich man asks, “Why those two things?” The poor man astutely responds, “This way, if she doesn’t like the slippers she can go f\*ck herself.”",:),2

So he called for all of his subordinates, and announced a new prestigious title to which all are given candidacy; the title of “Duke of the Best Joke”.

&amp;nbsp;

Not wanting to disappoint, Finance Minister Granger immediately ordered a search for the most expensive comedian in the land. But alas, the comedian could not even manage a giggle from the High King.

&amp;nbsp;

Garrett, Head of Tourism, brought a team of horses to the castle square, where they jumped over hurdles of fire, balanced on large balls, and performed many other tricks. Yet Eldarion yawned. This was not what he was looking for.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, it was Oswar’s turn, Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was well known that Oswar had a knack for negotiation, and was very well liked as the ambassador of the Reunited Kingdom. Much of the peace was owed to him. After racking his brains and using his connections, he brought a group of Ents with him. Each Ent held in the hands a Palantir, the Crystal Ball used for long range communication that is now mass produced under the rule of Eldarion.

The High King gave a puzzled look at the Ents communicating with each other through the Palantiri, before uncontrollably laughing and falling off his throne. Before long everyone was laughing at the sight.

&amp;nbsp;

And so it came to be, that Oswar was conferred the title. It became known across Middle Earth that how Minister Oswar won the title of the Best Joke is Intercom Ents.","Eldarion, son of Aragorn, High King of the Reunited Kingdom, was bored.",8

An Irishman walks into a bar in Dublin, orders three pints of Guinness and sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. When he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more.

The bartender approaches and tells him, “You know, a pint goes flat after I draw it, and it would taste better if you bought one at a time.” The Irishman replies, well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in America, the other is in Australia, and I’m in Dublin.

When we all left home, we promised that we’d drink this way to remember the days we drank together. So I drink one for each o’me brothers and one for me self.” The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there. The Irishman becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way: He orders three pints and drinks them in turn.

One day, he comes in and orders two pints. All the other regulars take notice and fall silent. When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, “I don’t want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss.”

The Irishman looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns and he laughs. “Oh, no, everybody’s just fine,” he explains, “It’s just that my wife had us join that Baptist Church and I had to quit drinking. But it hasn’t affected me brothers though.”",Irishmen!,109

A father was walking past his son's bedroom one day and happened to look in.

He was astonished to see that his bed was nicely made and everything was picked up off the floor. Then he saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow that was addressed to 'Dad.'

Fearing the worst, he opened the envelope with trembling hands and read the letter. It said:

*Dear Dad,*

*It is with great regret and sadness that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.*

*I have been finding real passion with Susie and she is so nice. But I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am.*

*But it's not only the passion. Dad she's pregnant.* 

*Don't worry though, Susie said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.*

*Susie has also opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy.*

*In the meantime, we will pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Susie can get better. She deserves it.*

*Don't worry Dad. I'm 15 and I know how to take care of myself.*

*Someday I'm sure that we will be back to visit so that you can get to know your grandchildren.*

*Love, Your son Tim.*

*P.S. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jimmy's house.*

*I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than a lousy report card ...*

*That's in my desk drawer.*",Son's Note,125

The Manager says, “Do you have any sales experience?” The kid says “Very little.”

His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down. “How many customers bought something from you today?”

The kid says “One”.

The boss says “Just One? Our sales people average 20 to 30 customers a day. How much was the sale for?”

The kid says “$165,000”.

The boss says “$165,000? What the heck did you sell?”

The kid says, “First, I sold him a small fish hook. Then I sold hi m a medium fishhook. Then I sold him a larger fishhook. Then I sold him a new fishing rod. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn’t think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4×4 Expedition.”

The boss said, “A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a BOAT and a TRUCK?”

The kid said “No, the guy came in here to buy Tampons for his wife, and I said, ‘Dude, your weekend’s shot, you should go fishing.’ ”",About a new job,6

After what seemed an eternity, in which he tried his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his car and fall into it. 

He sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off. Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off; it was a fine, dry summer night, flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked the horn and then switched on the lights. 

He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little, and then remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patrons' vehicles left.  At last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out and drove slowly down the road.  

The police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, and promptly pulled the man over and administered a breathalyser test.  To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence that the man had consumed any alcohol at all!

 Dumbfounded, the officer said, ""I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyser equipment must be broken."" ""I doubt it,"" said the truly proud Redneck.

The barkeeper mixed his concoction and poured a glowing blue drink into a glass, passing it to the man in the suit, who downed it instantly. Staggering, he wandered over to the edge of the roof again and jumped. Dumbfounded, Ryan looked on while the club continued to blast its music and the patrons danced. This time, he waited, and sure enough... \*Ding\* The same man walked straight for the bar, slamming his palm on the counter, finger in the air. ""Barkeep! A-another!"" he sputtered out.

""Come in,"" says the podiatrist, ""What's the problem?""



The moth drops down into the nearest chair and says ""What's the problem? I don't even know where to start. First of all, my boss is a vicious tyrant who gets off on the petty torments he puts me through day in and day out, and I'm too spineless to stand up to him, so I just take it and I've gradually come to hate myself for it. Also, every morning I wake up to the same prune-face old crone to whom I pledged my vows so many years ago. I used to love her, but that love has become like some sun-festering beached whale trying to die. We lost our daughter last year to one of the bitterest, coldest winters we've ever had to face in this region. Isn't it funny, doc, how all the prayer circles and charity drives in the world amount to pretty much nothing in the face of that cold, impartial face of winter, that bleak, pounding, harsh fist of a callous environment, carrying on with its machinations without regard to our lives, loves, hopes and dreams? Isn't that hysterical, Doc? Oh and then there's my son. Doc, I don't love him anymore. I don't know what it is but I look in his eyes and I see that same harried look of gutless cowardice that I see when I stare at my own face in the mirror. If I wasn't such a coward, Doc, I know I'd be able to scrape together enough pride to grab that cocked and loaded shotgun I keep by the bedside table, and just run amok and put an end to this grim facade once and for all. I start with the wife, then the boy of course before putting the barrell in my own mouth. Believe you me, Doc, I'd be doing the world a favor. I have nothing to look forward to but a continuation of this spiraling black hole that is my life, this existential cesspool that is the perpetuation of my lingering skid-mark on society. I despise people yet I crave their approval. I'm judgemental yet I care about nothing. I'm bitter, hateful and afraid. I'm alive yet I feel like the walking dead. This is it, Doc: I am a living, breathing, disease.""



The doctor stares at him for a while then finally says ""Jeez, Moth, you definitely have some problems. But I'm a podiatrist. You need a psychiatrist. Why'd you come in here?""



The moth says,""Your light was on.""",The moth joke,3

I'm writing this slow because I know you can't read fast. We don't live where we did when you left home. Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 20 miles from your home, so we moved. I won't be able to send you the address because the last Arkansas family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so that they wouldn't have to change their address.

This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works so well though. Last week I put a load of clothes in and pulled the chain... We haven't seen them since. The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second time for four days.

About that coat you wanted me to send you, your Uncle Stanley said it would be too heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets. John locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out.

Your sister had a baby this morning, but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if you're an aunt or an uncle. The baby looks just like your brother. Uncle Ted fell in a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off playfully and drowned. We had him cremated and he burned for three days.

Three of your friends went off a bridge in a pickup truck. Ralph was driving. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. Your other two friends were in back. They drowned because they couldn't get the tailgate down. There isn't much more news at this time. Nothing much out of the normal has happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Love,

Mom.",Redneck Letter,29

Clyde responded, ""Well, I'll tell you what happened. I had just loaded my favorite cow, Bessie, into the...""

""I didn't ask for any details"", the lawyer interrupted. ""Just answer the question, ...please. Did you, or did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine!'?""

Clyde said, ""Well, I had just got Bessie into the trailer behind the tractor and I was driving down the road....""

The lawyer interrupted again and said, ""Your Honor, I am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the Highway Patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question.""

By this time, the Judge was fairly interested in Clyde's answer and said to the lawyer, ""I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite cow, Bessie"".

Clyde thanked the Judge and proceeded. ""Well, as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite cow, into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my John Deer Tractor right in the side. I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I was hurting, real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.

Shortly after the accident a Highway Patrolman came on the scene. He could hear Bessie moaning and groaning, so he went over to her. After he looked at her, and saw her fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Then the Patrolman came across the road, gun still in hand, looked at me, and said, ""How are you feeling?""

""Now tell me, what the heck would you say?""",A farmer named Clyde had a tractor accident...,106

“Dear Captain, Thursday will be my daughter Melinda’s Debutante Ball. I would like you to send four well-mannered, handsome, unmarried officers in their formal dress uniforms to attend the dance.”

“They should arrive promptly at 8:00 PM prepared for an evening of polite Southern conversation. They should be excellent dancers, as they will be the escorts of lovely refined young ladies. One last point: “No Jews, please.” ""

Sending a written message by his own yeoman, the captain replied: “Madam, thank you for your invitation. In order to present the widest possible knowledge base for polite conversation, I am sending four of my best and most prized officers.”

“One is a Lieutenant Commander, and a graduate of Annapolis with an additional Masters degree from MIT in fluid technologies and ship design.”

“The second is a Lieutenant, one of our helicopter pilots, and a graduate of Northwestern University in Chicago, with a BS in Aeronautical Engineering. His Masters Degree and PhD, in Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering, are from Texas Tech University and he is also an astronaut candidate.”

“The third officer is also a Lieutenant, with degrees in both computer systems and information technology from SMU and he is awaiting notification on his Doctoral Dissertation from Cal Tech.”

“Finally, the fourth officer, also a Lieutenant Commander, is our ship’s doctor, with an undergraduate degree from the University of Georgia and his medical degree is from the University of North Carolina. We are very proud of him, as he is also a senior fellow in Trauma Surgery at Bethesda .”

Upon receiving this letter, Melinda’s mother was quite excited and looked forward to Thursday with pleasure. Her daughter would be escorted by four handsome naval officers without peer (and the other women in her social circle would be insanely jealous).

At precisely 8:00 PM on Thursday, Melinda’s mother heard a polite rap at the door which she opened to find, in full dress uniform, four very handsome, smiling Black officers.

Her mouth fell open, but pulling herself together, she stammered, “There must be some mistake.”

“No, Madam,” said the first officer.

They had invested heavily in factories and infrastructure but nothing seemed to increase their output of ketchup.

The CEO decides to hire an investigator from Germany who is well known for finding shortcomings within growing companies. He tells the inspector that he will receive a bonus if he can find the cause of the problem and report back within 3 days.

The inspector goes to the shipping and distribution warehouse on the first day but finds they are efficiently packing and shipping the factory goods but dont have enough to fill all the orders.

The inspector heads to the factory for the second day only to discover it is really well run but they lack the supply of ingredients to fully utilize the factory.

On the third day he goes to the farms and finds that while they are planting enough tomatoes that half the fields are poorly irrigated causing smaller yields.

He races to the nearest telegraph office to report his findings before the end of the day only to be told that he must pay 10 cents per word. He quickly checks his wallet and pockets to find he forgot to go to the bank recently and only had a quarter and nickel in his pocket.

Thinking quickly he sends off his 3 word telegraph to the CEO.

Every time he travels, he buys his wife a dildo in case she gets lonely. After about 30 years, he's ready for retirement, but has one more trip before he's through. He thinks to himself ""this is my last trip, so I want to get one that's very special.""

He goes to the sex shop in town that he frequents and tells the owner ""this is my last trip, so I want this one to be much more special than the rest."" Thinking this over, the shopkeeper says ""stay right there, I've got the perfect one for you"" and heads to the back. 

A few minutes later, he comes out with an old, dusty wooden box. Seeing Frank's perplexed look, he hold up a hand and says ""trust me."" He sets the box on the table and says ""voodoo dildo, rise"" and the box pops open and the dildo starts to float just above the box. The shopkeep then says ""voodoo dildo, door"" and the thing flies to the door and starts ramming it. Splinters fly everywhere and eventually it puts a hole in the side of the door and just keeps going at it. The shopkeep then says ""voodoo dildo, box"" and it flies back into the box and seals itself back up. Genuinely intrigued, Frank buys it right on the spot. 

He gets home and goes to his wife, Suzie,  and says ""I've got a surprise for you, hunny."" And pulls our the box. Suzie has the same look he had, and he tells her to just wait a second. ""Voodoo dildo, rise"" and it starts floating. ""Voodoo dildo, pillow"" and the thing goes straight into the pillow and starts going to town. Feathers are flying all over and eventually the pillow is withered down to the case. ""Voodoo dildo, box"" and it flies back in and seals up. She can barely contain her excitement. 

Flash forward a couple weeks, Frank's off on his trip and Suzie begins to feel a little lonely. Then she remembers the box. She sets the box on the dresser,  strips down, and lays on the bed. ""How does this work again? Umm... voodoo dildo, rise"" and it hovers over the box. ""Ok, umm... voodoo dildo, my pussy"" and it comes flying over and just starts going to work.

Orgasm after orgasm and just the most pure pleasure she's ever felt. Then it starts to feel raw and rough and eventually starts to hurt. Getting a little frantic now, Suzie says ""voodoo dildo, stop"" but nothing happens. ""Voodoo dildo, stop!"" Yet it keeps going. She grabs it and throws it across the room, but it bounces around and comes right back into her again. Totally freaked now, she grabs it, runs to the window, and throws it as hard as she can. She sees it bounce across the street and start coming right back at her again.

She screams and runs down the stairs and hears it break through the window of her bedroom. She grabs the car keys and runs outside, hops in and starts to drive away. She looks out the mirror and sees the dildo barreling towards her. She slams the gas pedal down and flies down the road. 

Up ahead is a cop car. She flies by and he moves in and pulls her over. As the cop is nearing the window, he sees a frantic naked woman in the driver's seat. She rolls down the window and he asks ""are you alright, ma'am?"" She screams, ""officer! There's a voodoo dildo chasing me!"" He looks at her quizzically and dumbfounded.

“Martha, would you like to go out on a date to the movies with me?” Bill asked. 
  
“Oh. would I, would I ??!! she exclaimed. 
  
Shocked by her making fun of his eye, Bill screamed “fuck you pizza face!” and stormed off.",Martha had terrible acne and had very little luck getting dates.,11
