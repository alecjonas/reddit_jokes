If she doesn’t reply move about 5 feet close and say it again. Keep doing this so that we’ll get an idea about the severity of her deafness”.

Sure enough, the husband goes home and does exactly as instructed. He starts off about 15 feet from his wife in the kitchen as she is chopping some vegetables and says, “Honey, what’s for dinner?” He hears no response. He moves about 5 feet closer and asks again. No reply. He moves 5 feet closer. Still no reply. He gets fed up and moves right behind her, about an inch away, and asks again, “Honey, what’s for dinner?”

post,awoacp,2qh72,jokes,false,1551572116,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/awoacp/purple_box/,self.jokes,,"is kid is walking to school one day when a man jumps out of the bushes at him, yells ""PURPLE BOX!"" then dies. The kid – lets just call him The Kid from now on – was pretty shaken up by the experience. I mean its not every day a crazy old man yells you and dies, but not knowing what to do he continues on his way to school. When he gets there he tries to forget about it and goes about his business until recess comes.
All the kids go out to play and do whatever it is little children do. (Susie was playing hopscotch, Steven was on the swings, ect) That's when the kid told his friend Jimmy about the the old man. ""Hey Jimmy, today i was walking to school when an old man walked up to me and yelled ""Purple Box"" then-"" as soon as he heard ""Purple Box"" Jimmy froze, his face turned to horror and he ran off, leaving no explanation and a very confused Kid. A few minutes the bell rang and The Kid goes back to class where hes stopped by his teacher. ""Jimmy said you told him a naughty story at recess today, is this true?"" The Kid had no idea what she meant by ""naughty story"" so he tried to explain it, but as soon as he got to the end of the story the teacher look down at him with the most appalled look you ever seen and said ""Young man, i have never heard such rude language in my life! Go to the office right now!""
So hes in the office and the principal says to him ""Son I've been told you've been sent down to my office because of a story?"" The Kid looks at him a little scared and tells him the story ""Well today I was walking to school when a man walked up to me and said ""Purple Box"", then he died. I told Jimmy and he freaked out. I told the teacher and she sent me here. whats the big deal with the purple box?"" The principal looked down at him with a look of disgust. ""Young man you are going home right now! you are expelled from this school"" and the kid goes home.
When he gets there his mother asks him why he home and he tells her about the Purple Box. She looks down on him says ""how dare you use that kind of language in front of your mother! Go to your room right now!"" A few hours later his dad walks into his room and and asks what wrong, The kid tells him, ""Today a man walked up to me said ""Purple Box"" then died. I told Jimmy, and he freaked out. I told my teacher, and she sent me to the office. I told the office and they sent me home. I told mom and she sent me to my room."" His dad gets up leaves the room and doesn't come back for several hours. When he does come back he has a briefcase with him and he says, ""Son this briefcase has 10,000 dollars in it. I want you to take it and never come back to this house again"" So The Kid is crushed, they packs his bags, they buy him a plane ticket to china, and they send him on his way.
On the plane one of the stewardesses called him over to come see the cockpit. (One of those ""hey lets make some random kids day"" things you see on tv and shit.) So he goes up, they show him some buttons and flashy bits, and eventually the reason for why hes on the plane in the first place comes up, so The Kid tells them about the old man and the Purple box. The pilot, after hearing the story says, ""There's a parachute in the back of the fuselage. I want you to take it and get the hell off my plane."" They escort him to the back of the plane, strap him in, and toss him out 10,000 feet over the Atlantic ocean.
The kid opens his parachute just fine – evidently there is such a thing as natural talent when it comes to jumping out of an airplane – and floats down to an island where he meets an old castaway. They talk for a while – make friends even – and then he tells him about the old man. ""Well, I was walking to school when an old man jumped out at me and yelled ""Purple Box."" I told my friend Jimmy and he freaked out. I told my teacher and she sent me to the office. I told the office and they sent me home. I told my parents and they sent me on a plane. I told the pilot and he kicked off the plan. Please, please tell me. Whats a Purple Box?
Now the old man sat there for a while, looking all deep and thoughtful. Then he turned to The kid and said, ""Theres a raft on the other side of the island. I spent 6 years making it, but I want you to take it and sail west to New York. There, you will find a Purple Box.
So the kid sets off on an epic adventure across the Atlantic ocean. He fights pirates, wrestles sharks, punches C'thulu in the face, That sort on thing. Until eventually he makes it to New York. The Kid doesn't know where to start so he goes to the top of the empire state building to get a better view. When he peers over the edge of the building he sees a big, bright, sign that says ""Purple Box Here."" Now The Kid is so exited he completely ignores the elevator, bolts down the stairs, runs across the street, and gets hit by a bus.
Moral of the story: Look both ways before crossing.
Tl;Dr: What a twist!",Purple box,0

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,233

The leader of the warriors approaches the two friends and informs them they are trespassing on sacred land and unless they can prove they are descendants of the Gods they will be killed and eaten.

Bob and Frank realize they have little choice but agree they will attempt any test to try to save their lives. 

The chief warrior brings them a bowl full of angry fire ants and drops three small seeds into the bowl. He informs them they must put their lips in the bowl and suck as hard as they can. If they manage to suck up all three seeds without sucking up an ant then the tribe would know they must be sent from the Gods. 

Bob looks wearily at Frank but knowing they have no other options he puts his lips in the bowl and sucks hard. He immediately gets a mouth full of ants and screams in pain as they bite away at the inside of his mouth. Frank now even more nervous takes his turn and to his dismay also receives a nasty mouthful of the viscous buggers. 

The warriors leap to their feet and surround the friends, “Now you must die” declares the chieftain. Just as the first spear is raised to Franks throat he screams “Tria-Gan!” The warriors stop dead in their tracks. “What did you say” asked the chief. “Tria-Gan” yelled frank again. Immediately the chief and his warriors turned and fled into the forest.

“Holy shit” said Bob “What did you just say and how did you know it would work?”

“Well” said Frank,  “my Mother always told me if at first you don’t suck seeds try Tria-Gan.”

A day or so later, he awakens to find himself bound and being dragged by some native savages to their camp. 
The natives are going wild at the spectacle, as he is left in the center of the camp next to a tree stump.

Suddenly they go silent as their chief assumes his seat of power, overlooking the centre.
The natives stare at him, expectantly.

The chief stares down at the pilot and booms, ""DEATH, OR OOGA-BOOGA?""

The pilot is in no rush to die, and sheepishly replies, ""Uhm... ooga-booga?""

The chief nods with satisfaction and decrees, ""OOGA-BOOGA!!""
The natives go absolutely berserk, screaming and hollering, and the pilot twists around just in time to see the crowd parting to make way for the biggest man he has ever seen.

A native, built like a troll, wearing only a goat-skin that barely covers his enormous member, bursts through into the clearing, with an brutish air of malevolence.
His focus finds the pilot, who he promptly ties to the tree stump, and proceeds to sodomise within an inch of his life, to the spectacle of the chief and natives.

After the terrible ordeal, he is left there to be harassed by the natives for the night as they make a fire and feast in honour of their chief.

He finally loses consciousness again, only to wake up early the next afternoon to a similar congregation, minus the troll-like brute. 

The crowd has once again gone quiet, and is awaiting word from their chief, and the pilot fears what is about to come.

""DEATH, OR OOGA-BOOGA?"" demands the chief once more.

The pilot, still traumatised and injured, has lost his will to live, and cries out, ""DEATH!!""

The chief nods slowly, rises out of his throne and raises his arms, tilting his face to the sky,
""DEATH!""

One day the teacher, Mrs Smith, was about to move on to the next page. “Okay, the first word for today is s-“ 
She stopped mid sentence, froze up with her eyes bulging, and promptly keeled over dead as a doorknob. 

The class and staff were shocked and distraught. But with the exams coming soon, they had to move on. 

The next day, Mrs Johnson, a substitute teacher was selected to move on to that new page when she again collapsed and died within minutes. 

And so it went for the next teacher, Mrs Mona. 

Fearing a sort of curse, the headmistress asks for a teacher brave enough to volunteer taking the class. 

Without hesitation a new teacher, Mr Lee, volunteers. 

“Alright class, it looks like you’ve been stuck here for some time. Let’s see what this next word is. The first word for today is...” 

The class holds their breath-

“... ‘sorry’. Can anyone tell me how you should use it?”

Immediately after the lesson, the headmistress summons Mr Lee to her office. 

“How did you know you weren’t going to die?”

“Easy,” replied Mr Lee. “The previous teachers were all married women, and we all know that a married woman would rather die than say ‘sorry’.” ",Substitute English teacher,32

Student, ""OK. So I'd like to ask you a question. If you can give me the correct answer, I will accept my marks as it is. If you can't give me the correct answer, however, you'll have to give me an ""A"". 

Professor, ""Hmmmm, alright. So what's the question?"" 

Student, ""What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal?"" 

The professor wracks his famous brain, but just can't crack the answer. Finally he gives up and changes the student's failing mark into an ""A"" as agreed, and the student goes away, very pleased. 

The professor continues to wrack his brain over the question all afternoon, but still can't get the answer. So finally he calls in a group of his brightest students and tells them he has a really, really tough question to answer, ""What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? "" 

To the professor's surprise (and embarrassment), all the students immediately raise their hands. 

""All right,"" says the professor and asks his favorite student to answer.

""It's quite easy, sir"" says the student ""You see, you are 75 years old and married to a 30 year old woman, which is legal, but not logical. Your wife has a 22 year old lover, which is logical, but not legal.

""Knock knock!"" says an unknown voice.

""Who's there?"" replies Albert.

""It's me, Dave, let me in, we have to get going if we're going to catch our flight"" replies the unknown voice.

Albert goes to the door and lets his friend Dave in. The two talk for a minute as they grab their bags and head down to Albert's car. They start making their way to the local airport to catch their flight to Chicago for their good friend's wedding.

As the two are driving to the airport, Dave suddenly shouts out, ""Look out!""

Albert swerves suddenly to avoid a small bird walking in front of their car.

""It's a chicken!"" exclaims Dave. ""Why did that chicken just cross the road?""

""Looks like there's a farm over there"" says Albert. ""They must not have a fence set up, looks like the chickens just come and go as they please.""

The two finally make it to the airport, park their car, and hop on the shuttle to check in for their flight. They make it through baggage and the security check without any issue, sit around for an hour, and finally board their flight. As they are take their seats, a rabbi and a priest board the plane. The two clergymen sit near Albert and Dave. The four men exchange pleasantries and then keep to themselves for the rest of the flight.

The plane lands in Chicago and Dave and Albert grab their bags and take a shuttle over to pick up their rental car. As they board the shuttle, Dave exclaims, ""Man, we just sat around flying into Chicago and boy are my arms tired."" Overhearing this, the shuttle driver helps Dave lift his bags into the shuttle and they make their way to pick up their rental car.

“You should be ashamed of yourself young man! Drinking is a Sin! Alcohol is the blood of the devil!”

Now John gets pretty annoyed about this, and goes on the offensive.

“How do you know this, Sister?”

“My Mother Superior told me so.”

“But have you ever had a drink yourself? How can you be sure that what you are saying is right?”

“Don’t be ridiculous -- of course I have never taken alcohol myself”

“Then let me buy you a drink – if you still believe afterwards that it is evil I will give up drink for life”

“How could I, a Nun, sit outside this public house drinking?!”

“I’ll get the barman to put it in a teacup for you, then no one will ever know.”

The Nun reluctantly agrees, so John goes inside to the bar.

“Another pint for me, and a triple vodka on the rocks”, then he lowers his voice and says to the barman “and could you put the vodka in a teacup?”

However, people started yelling at the worker from the ground, complaining that he was doing the restaurant a disservice with the ad he was placing up. He couldn't figure out why. Maybe there was something offensive about the ad that someone didn't catch beforehand, and here it was displayed on a giant billboard for all passersby to see.

Later, the worker met up with the manager of the restaurant and told him about the dilemma. ""I think you might have made something a little more offensive than you intended,"" he said. ""Nonsense,"" replied the manager. ""The ad campaign has been test-run by executives, and every single one of them has given us the green light.""

""So why were there so many people complaining about the ad while I was putting it up?"" asked the worker.

Come outside and see what these bastards are doing!"". 

Confused, I apologise to the patron and follow her outside to see a group of workmen in the process of completing a sign above the shop adjacent to my own reading:

""Best Antiques in Town""

Grumbling to myself, I tell my wife to finish her errands and reluctantly continue my day.

After a week of seeing customers walk past my shop and into the neighbouring one, I decide that enough is enough and storm into their shop to demand they take their sign down. With a shit-eating grin, the shop owner tells me his antiques really are the best in town, and that my wife and I should suck it up or find another town to sell in. 

The next day, after locking up my shop, I see another group of workmen setting up a sign above the shop on the other side to my own. Furious, I return home and tell my wife what I saw: ""and you'll never guess what it says"", I told her:

""Cheapest Antiques in Town""

""How many bloody antique sellers are there in this town!?"" she exclaimed, ""they're going to put us out of business!"" she cried, visibly upset. 

After another week of losing customers to the shops on either side, I figure it's worth a try to see if they'll take their sign down. The second shop owner, with the same shit-eating grin, tells me: ""You're as old as the antiques you sell, it's time to make room for the young sellers"" and tells me to leave.

After coming home to my distraught wife I tell her that I've had an idea to fix the situation. After making a few phone calls I head to bed with a smile on my face.

The next week, my shop is bustling with people and as I'm in the middle of haggling with another elderly customer over a broken piece of Elizabethan jewellery, a workman interrupts me and tells me that he's finished. Apologising to the patron, I step outside and look up at my new sign. A shit-eating grin appears on my face as I read it:

""Entrance""

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.

The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. 

The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner.

The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.

The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.

And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",An ancient mathematical joke,1504

Soon after, the son receives a text from his mother saying, "" Sucky's home. Don't know who's cat we buried this morning.""

_____

My first official post on this sub and hope you all find humor in this true story of my cat, Sucky. He was put down last month because of liver failure and it's my favorite story to tell to keep his memory alive.

""I'm sick of all these conferences. I always say the same things over and over!""


The driver agrees: ""You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place.""
 

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""
 

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.
 

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.
 

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :


 ""Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.""

There was strong evidence indicating guilt, but there was no corpse. In the defense’s closing statement the lawyer, knowing that his client would probably be convicted, resorted to a trick.
“Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a surprise for you all,” the lawyer said as he looked at his watch.

""Within one minute, the person presumed dead in this case will walk into this courtroom.” He looked toward the courtroom door. The jurors, somewhat stunned, all looked on eagerly. A minute passed. Nothing happened.

Finally the lawyer said, “Actually, I made up the previous statement. But you all looked on with anticipation. I therefore put to you that you have a reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty.”

The jury, clearly confused, retired to deliberate. A few minutes later, the jury returned and pronounced a verdict of guilty.

“But how?” inquired the lawyer. “You must have had some doubt; I saw all of you stare at the door.”

The jury foreman replied: “Oh, we did look, but your client didn’t.”",A lawyer's trick . . .,149
