My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend - she was a dream! 

There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. 

One day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. 

She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me."" I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. 

I walked straight towards my car, My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, ""We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family."" 


Moral of the story:

""Always keep your condoms in your car.""",Girlfriend's hot sister,6

The old man doesn't want to live with the discomfort of STDs, but he still wants to be sexually active like everybody else. He meets this nice old lady who seems to fancy him. So, to limit the risk of spreading a disease she satisfies him with handjobs. 

Unfortunately, she can't stroke his member because of the painful arthritis in her wrists, so she just sits there and holds his dong. The old man didn't seem to mind. After all, she was the prettiest woman in the retirement home, and he wasn't getting any diseases. 

But one day the nice old lady walks into the old man's room and catches him with another woman. She felt very betrayed.

The churches send all their collected chips to a nearby franciscan monastery for sorting and then the chips are taken to the casinos of origin and cashed in.

The stripper starts singing!  Full on opera, while she's blowing him.  How is she doing this?  He finishes, she turns the light on, and he says ""how'd you do that?""  The stripper smiles coyly and says, ""That's The Secret!""

The man leaves.  How did she do it?  The question gnaws at him.  The next evening, he returns.  He tracks her down, and says, ""I want The Secret again.""

About a week later, his roommate came to him saying, “Ever since your mother came to dinner, I’ve been unable to find the silver plate. You don’t suppose she took it, do you?”

He said ,”Well, I doubt it, but I’ll email her,  just to be sure.” He sat down and wrote….

Dear Son:

She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me."" I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, ""We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family"".

As he settles in, he glances up and sees a stunningly beautiful and very sexy woman boarding the plane. He soon realizes she is heading straight towards him. A wave of nervous anticipation washes over him. Lo and behold, she takes the seat right next to him.  
Anxious to strike up a conversation, he blurts out, “So, are you going to Vegas to try your luck?”
She turns and smiles, and says, “Well no, I'm going to the Adult Entertainment Expo.  I guess you could say I'm a movie star. ”
He swallows hard, and is instantly crazed with excitement. Here’s the most sensuous woman he has ever seen, sitting right next to him, going to Vegas, and obviously she’s a porn queen. Struggling to maintain his outward cool, he asks with some awkwardness, ""Oh, I see . . . so tell me, is it true that Italian men make the best lovers?""
The woman blushes.  ""Well no, that would be Jewish men.  They are very romantic and gentle.""
Disappointed but emboldened, Tony then asks, ""Well, I've heard that Italian men are the most well-endowed.""
The woman smiles.  ""I'm afraid that's wrong.  In fact, they tend to be rather, well . . . small.  Native American men are most likely to be big.""
Suddenly, the woman looks slightly embarrassed. “I’m sorry,” she says, “I feel so awkward discussing these things with you, and I don’t even know your name.”
Tony extends his hand and replies, “Tonto. Tonto Rosenberg.”

twelve times.

On their wedding night they settle into the bridal suite at their
hotel and the bride says to her new groom, ""Please promise to be
gentle,... I am still a virgin.""

This puzzled the groom, since after twelve marriages he thought that at least one of her husbands would have been able to perform. He asked his new bride to explain the phenomena.

The bride responds...

""My first husband was a Sales Representative who spent our entire
marriage telling me, in grandiose terms, ""It's gonna be great!""

My second husband was from Software Services; he was never quite sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he would send me documentation.

My third husband was from Field Services who constantly said that
everything was diagnostically ""okay,"" but he just couldn't get the
system up.

My fourth husband was from Educational Services, and he simply said, ""Those who can... do; those who can't... teach.""

My fifth husband was from the Telemarketing Department who said that he had the orders, but he wasn't quite sure when he was going to be able to deliver.

My sixth husband was an Engineer. He told me that he understood the basic process but needed three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.

My seventh husband was from Finance And Administration. His comments were that he knew how, but he just wasn't sure whether or not it was his job.

My eighth husband was from Standards And Regulations and told me that he was up to the standards but that regulations said nothing about how to do it.

My ninth husband was a Marketing Manager. He said, ""I know I have the product, I'm just not sure how to position it!""

My tenth husband was a psychiatrist and all he ever wanted to do was talk about it.

My eleventh husband was a gynecologist and all he ever wanted to do was look at it.

My twelfth husband was a stamp collector and all he ever wanted to do was... God I miss him!

So now I have married a lawyer, I know I'm really going to get screwed.

Patricia's bemusement grows: ""I'm not sure that we can accept this, do you have any other form of collateral?"" The frog appears mildly frustrated: ""Come on, my father is Mick Jagger and all I want is a £10,000 loan.""

I saw Miss Hershey standing behind the Powerhouse on the corner of Clark and Fifth Avenue when I whipped out my Whopper and whispered, ""Hey Sweetart, how'd you like to Crunch on my big hunk for a Million Dollar Bar?""

Well, she immediately went down on my Tootsie Roll, and it was like pure Almond Joy!

I couldn't help but grab her delicious Mounds because it was easy to see that this little Twix had the Red Hots.

It was all I could do to hold the Snickers and Crackle as my Butterfinger went up her tight little Kit Kat and she started to scream ""Oh Henry, Oh Henry!""

Soon she was fondling my Peter Pan and ZagNut and I knew it wouldn't be long before I blew my Milk Duds clear to Mars that gave her a taste of the old Milky Way.

She asked me if I was into M&amp;M, but I said, ""Hey Chicklet, no kinky stuff."" I said, ""Look you little Reese's Pieces, don't be a Zero, be a Lifesaver. Why don't you take my Whatchamacallit and slip it up your Bit 'O' Honey?""

(What a piece of Juicy Fruit she was, too!)

She screamed, ""Oh Crackerjack, you're better than the Three Musketeers!"" as I rammed my Ding Dong up her Rocky Road and into her Peanut Butter Cup.

Well, I was giving it to her Good 'N' Plenty, when all the sudden... my Starburst!

Yeah, as luck would have it, she started to grow Chunky and complained of a Cadbury Egg in her stomach.

Sure enough, nine months later, out popped? Baby Ruth!

 God created the dog and said, ""Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past. For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.""The dog said, ""That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?""So God agreed.

On the second day, God created the monkey and said, ""Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.""
The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""And God agreed.

On the third day, God created the cow and said,  ""You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.""
The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""
And God agreed again. 

On the fourth day, God created humans and said, ""Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.""
But the human said, ""Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?""

""Okay,"" said God. ""You asked for it.""

So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves. For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.
Life has now been explained to you.",On the first day.,0

As the three men talked, each was surprised to realize that all three of them had grown tired of playing the action hero- shooting the bad guys, pulling off life-threatening stunts, and getting the girl in the end.  The whole scene was just all played out for them.

By chance, Stallone had with him a script that his agent had given to him kind of as a joke.  The script would allow three actors to act out the role of their favorite musical composer.  The three men were delighted, ""This is great! Nobody would ever expect this from us! Let's do it!""  And so the agreement was made. Soon, a big budget studio was attached to the project, Spielberg signed on to direct, everything was falling into place.

On the day of the first pre-production meeting, the actors realized they needed to pick parts. Since Stallone had proposed the idea, he got to choose first.  After thinking for a minute, he declared ""I want to be Beethoven."" The others agreed to let Stallone have Beethoven.

Next, it was Van Dam's turn.  He thought for a moment, then declared, ""I want to play Mozart."" And the others agreed to that as well.

Finally, it was Arnold Schwarzenegger's turn.  After thinking about it for several moments, Schwarzenegger finally declared, *cue Terminator voice*: ""I'll be Bach.""","Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Dam, and Arnold Schwarzenegger",170

""I don't think I get it,"" says Little Johnny, thinking about this observation.

""Why don't you sleep on it, then?"" Dad says. Little Johnny nods his little curious head, wishes Dad goodnight, and heads to bed.

Around 1:00 A.M., Little Johnny hears a lamp fall over. Unable to sleep from the frighteningly sudden noise, he goes to his little brother's room to see what's going on.

The small child is lying in his crib, and apparently, he knocked over a lamp, which was shattered all over the floor. ""Oh dear,"" says Little Johnny, when he sees that his little brother crapped his diaper. He decides to go get Dad.

Little Johnny runs to his parents' large bedroom. He creaks open the door, and sees Mom sleeping, but no Dad! Little Johnny exits to find Dad, searching more of his large house. Eventually, he makes it to their maid's bedroom. Looking through the keyhole, he sees Dad ""doing"" the maid. She seems to enjoy it.

post,3aiw06,2qh72,jokes,false,1434819660,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3aiw06/it_started_out_innocently_enough/,self.jokes,," I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker.

I began to think alone - ""to relax,"" I told myself - but I knew it wasn't true. Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time.

I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself.

I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, ""What is it exactly we are doing here?""

Things weren't going so great at home either. One evening I had turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother's.

I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called me in. He said, ""Skippy, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find another job."" This gave me a lot to think about.

I came home early after my conversation with the boss. ""Honey,"" I confessed, ""I've been thinking...""

""I know you've been thinking,"" she said, ""and I want a divorce!""

""But Honey, surely it's not that serious.""

""It is serious,"" she said, lower lip aquiver. ""You think as much as college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!""

""That's a faulty syllogism,"" I said impatiently, and she began to cry. I'd had enough. ""I'm going to the library,"" I snarled as I stomped out the door.

I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche, with a PBS station on the radio. I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors... they didn't open. The library was closed.

To this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night.

As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. ""Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?"" it asked. You probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinker's Anonymous poster.

Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was ""Porky's."" Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting.

I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home. Life just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking. 

And today I joined the Democratic party!

Right after the transfusion, the rich man goes out and buys his Jewish friend a brand new Ferrari. ""My dear friend, you've kept me alive &amp; well, please take this gift from me."" The Jewish friend, ecstatic, happily accepts.

A month later, the rich man goes to his doctor and sure enough, the man now needs a new kidney. The next day, the rich man goes to work and tells his friend the bad news. The Jewish friend ponders for a moment, and then tells him that he will give him one of his own kidneys. 

Days after the surgery, the rich man hands his friend an envelope. Eagerly, he opens it. What he finds is a $50 gift card to a local restaurant. Dumbfounded, the Jewish friend asks the rich man, ""I don't understand... I gave you a little of my blood and in exchange, you give me a brand new Ferrari. But for one of my own kidneys, a much greater sacrifice, you give me this?""

Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful than a guy getting kicked in the nuts. Well, after another beer, and some heavy deductive thinking, I have come up with the answer to that question.
Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby; and here is the reason for my conclusion.
A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, ""It might be nice to have another child.""

Knowing he was near the bottom of the food chain, he tried to hurry it up.

  Just as the rabbit finished his business, a bear stuck his head through the bush and immediately saw him. Both of them were off like lightening, the rabbit trying to save his fur and the bear trying to land an 'easy meal'. Through the forest the rabbit ran, darting left and dodging right with the bear close in tow at every turn. As the bear closed the gap and started closing in to catch his meal, they ran into an open field and bounded over a slender creek. No sooner were they over the creek when they heard a deep and throaty ""STOP!!""

  Not used to hearing such a sound, they both come to a screeching halt, tumbling over each other. On the bank of the creek was the largest bull frog either of them had ever seen.

  The frog spoke again and said ""You two are pretty loud, running around. Normally I would be annoyed because I was napping in the sun, but you two saved my life from the hawk that was going to snatch me by waking me up.""

  ""Umm...your welcome?"" uttered the bear, keeping an eye on what would still hopefully be his next meal. 

  ""It just so happens I am a wish granting genie and while I am on hiatus, I feel I owe you both for saving my life. I will grant you both three wishes, in succession of course, as a means of gratitude. Ok, who is going first?""

  The bear, unable to contain his excitement, jumped in front of the rabbit and managed to yelp out ""ME, ME!!"" 

  ""Ok bear, what will it be?""

  ""Mating season is tough, with all the competition. I think if you could make all the bears in this forest female, except for me, that would make things easier.""

  ""Done,"" claimed the frog. ""Now rabbit, what can I grant for you?""

  ""I want a helmet,"" he stated, matter-of-factly. The frog, having heard very odd requests in his time, granted the wish with barely a second thought.

  ""Ok bear, time for your second wish. What will it be?"".

  ""Oh man, I thought about it and realized it would be easier if all the bears in the surrounding forests where female too!"" he exclaimed.

  ""Nice wish,"" and with that, the frog made it so. He turned back to the rabbit, asking ""what is your next wish?""

  ""I want a motorcycle."" The frog and the bear looked at each other and exchanged a 'WTF' look. True to his word though, the frog granted the outlandish wish.

  ""Alright bear, you have been on a roll today. What is your last wish?""

  ""Wow, I feel like I wasted my first two but this last one will make up for it. I WISH ALL THE BEARS IN THE WORLD WERE FEMALE!...except for me of course.""

  With the same amount of fervor and excitement the frog exclaimed ""DONE!"" Looking back to the rabbit, feeling a bit annoyed, the frog asked ""What else could you possibly want?"" 

   The rabbit strapped on his helmet, jumped on the motorcycle, looked straight in the bears face and yelled ""I WISH THE BEAR WAS GAY!"" and was out of sight before either of them knew what had happened.

The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years?  That's a pretty long time to perform.  How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""

The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years.  How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""

There were two white christian men, John and Mike, whose plane crashed into a desert. Luckily they survived unharmed. As they traveled through the hot desert looking for food and water, they gave up and sat down, thinking of what to do.
As the dust in the air settled, they suddenly could view a mosque ahead. They became very hopeful. But then John said ''Muslims are there. They might help us if we say we are Muslim.'' Then Mike said ''No way, I won't say I'm Muslim, I'm gonna be honest''.
So John and Mike went to the Mosque ahead and were greeted by an Arab Muslim, who asked what their names were.
John thought of a Muslim name and said, 'My name is Muhammad'. And Mike said 'My name is Mike'.
The Arab man said 'Hello Mike.' And told these other men to take Mike and give him food and drink.
Then he turned to John and said, 'Salaam Muhammad. Ramadan Mubarak! (Hello Muhammad, Happy Ramadan)

-I worked the whole night, and now they think i will be wash the dishes? Never in my life, I sit quietly!

- Well, I cooked whole Dinner and it took me all day, and now I would need to wash dishes ? No way I will sit quietly.
Maggie thinks.
-I pray that Johnny would not say anything.

- For fuck sake I came in guests and I will not wash the dishes.

- And what, I don't give a fuck. Im sure that Johnny fucks her every day. I will not touch these dishes.

A man finds himself swept up on the shore of an island with no other people, no supplies, nothing. Only bananas and coconuts. Used to five-star hotels, this guy has no idea what to do, so for the next four months he eats bananas, drinks coconut juice and longs for his old life. He fixes his gaze on the sea, hoping to spot a rescue ship.

One day, as he is lying on the beach, he spots a movement out of the corner of his eye. It's a rowboat, and in it is the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen. She rows up to him.

In disbelief, he asks her, 'Where did you come from? How did you get here?'

'I rowed from the other side of the island,' she says. 'I landed here when my cruise ship sank.'

'Amazing,' he says. 'I didn't know anyone else had survived. How many are there? You were lucky to have a rowboat wash up with you.'

'It's only me,' she says, 'and the rowboat didn't wash up; nothing did.'

He is confused. 'Then how did you get the rowboat?'

'Oh, simple,' replies the woman. 'I made the rowboat out of materials that I found on the island. I whittled the oars from the gumtree branches. I wove the bottom from palm branches and the sides and stern came from a coconut tree.'

'B-b-but that's impossible,' stutters the man. 'You had no tools or hardware. How did you manage?'

'Oh, that was no problem,' replies the woman. 'On the other side of the island there is a very unusual stratum of alluvial rock exposed. I found that if I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into the forgeable ductile iron. I used that for tools and used the tools to make the hardware. But enough of that,' she says. 'Where do you live?'

Sheepishly, he confesses that he has been sleeping on the beach the whole time. 

'Well, let's row over to my place then,' she says.

After a few minutes of rowing she docks the boat at a small wharf. As the man looks to the shore he nearly falls out of the boat. Before him is a stone walk leading to an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white. While the woman ties up the rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope, the man can only state ahead, dumbstruck. As they walk into the house, she says casually, 'It's not much, but I call it home. Sit down, please; would you like a drink?'

'No, no thank you,' he says, still dazed. 'I can't take any more coconut juice.'

'It's not coconut juice,' the woman replies. 'I have a still. How about a pina colada?'

Trying to hide his amazement, the man accepts, and they sit down on her couch to talk.

After they have exchanged their stories, the woman announces, 'I'm going to slip into something comfortable. Would you like to take a shower and shave?' There is a razor upstairs in the cabinet in the bathroom.'

No longer questioning anything, the man goes into the bathroom. There in the cabinet is a razor made from a bone handle. Two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened onto its end inside a swivel mechanism.

'This woman is amazing,' he muses. 'What next?'

When he returns, she greets him wearing nothing but vines - strategically positioned - and smelling faintly of gardenias. She beckons him over to sit down next o her.

'Tell me,' she begins, suggestively, slithering closer to him, 'we have been out here for a very long time. You've been lonely. There's something I'm sure you really feel like doing right now, something you've been longing for all these months. You know...'

She stares into his eyes. He can't believe what he is hearing.

The lawyer shot a duck and by the time it fell to the ground it was on the farmer's property. The farmer was tending his land and saw it all. He got off his tractor and met the lawyer as he was retrieving the duck. 

The lawyer says, ""Sorry about that. Honest mistake. I didn't think he would make it to your property."" The farmer replied, ""Well, I've asked you before to not shoot anything if it ends up on my property. So I'm gonna have to keep that duck.""

The lawyer quickly puffs out his chest and says, ""Sir, I don't think that's gonna happen! I know we've talked about this but it was an honest mistake! Now listen, I shot this duck. It was over my land when I shot it. I have the proper licenses to harvest this duck, and if you intend to keep me from claiming this duck, I'll sue you!""

The farmer says, ""Hold on a minute, there's no reason to throw around threats like that. We can handle this like men. How 'bout this: instead of going to court and whatnot, why don't we settle this like we did back in the old days. A little Swap 3?""

The lawyer says, ""What in the world is Swap 3?""

The farmer explains, ""It's real simple. Each guy gets to take 3 shots on the other guy: punching, kicking, elbowing, etc. and we go back and forth until one gives up.""

The lawyer, being around 6'2"" and nearing 250, sizes up the old farmer at around 5'8"" and 175 pounds. The lawyer says, ""Sir, you will rue the day you offered me this. I accept."" They shook on it.

The farmer says, ""Okay. Well, since the duck landed on my property, I think I should get the first shots. What do you say?""

The lawyer, almost feeling guilty for his clear size advantage, says, ""Ok, that's fair enough.""

The farmer rolls up his flannel sleeves, makes sure the lawyer is ready, and *swiftly* kicks him in the balls. The lawyer doubles over in absolute agony, spitting up and trying to catch his breath. The farmer gets closer to him, puts his hands on the lawyer's shoulders and knees him right in the kisser. The lawyer leans way back, trying not to fall backwards, and as soon as he regains his balance the farmer hits him with a clean right straight to the jaw. The lawyer tumbles over in a heap.

After the lawyer stood back up and wiped the blood off his mouth, he said to the farmer, ""Alright, old man, you're **really** about to get it now!""

The farmer says, ""Nah, I give up. You can have the duck.""",The lawyer and the farmer,145

“Yes… please do. Tell him to call me when he gets home.”

 By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost &amp; wasn't a spy.

He rings the bell and the owner tells him the dog is in the backyard.

The guy goes into the backyard and sees a nice looking Labrador sitting there.

“You talk?” he says.
“Yep” the dog replies.

After the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog speak, he says “So, what’s your story?”

The Lab looks up and says, “Well. I discovered I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA. In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping.”

“I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running, but the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn’t getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.”

“I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I’m retired.”

The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.

“Ten dollars.” the guy says.

“Ten dollars? This dog is amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheap?”


“Because he’s a liar. He never did any of that shit.”",The Talking Dog,1652
