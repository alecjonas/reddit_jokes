post,5vg5pl,2qh72,jokes,false,1487731994,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5vg5pl/the_fly_on_the_lake/,self.jokes,,"So there is this lake. Beautiful and clear and surrounded by dense forest. Hovering above the lake, about 6 inches, is a fly.
 Hes buzzing around doing fly things, when, under the surface of the lake, a fish spots him.

""Aha!"" Says the fish to himself. ""When that fly drops 6 inches, I can jump up and eat him for my lunch."" 


On the shore of the lake is a bear, snuffling around, doing what bears do, when he looks out to the lake and spots the fish, who is watching the fly and he says

""Aha! I see whats going on here. When that fly drops 6 inches, the fish will jump up and catch him, and while the fish is distracted, I can run in and have him for my lunch."" 

Now out in the forest is a lonely little cabin, all by itself. Inside the cabin is a hunter, waiting, watching. When he spies the Bear, who is watching them fish, who is watching the fly, he says

""Aha! I see whats going on here. When that fly drops 6 inches, the fish is gonna jump up and get the fly, the Bear is gonna run in and get the fish, and while the Bear is distracted I can shoot him, and hang his head on my wall.""
 
In the rafters of the cabin is a little mouse, scurrying to and fro. He looks down at the hunter, who is watching the Bear, who is watching the fish, who is watching the fly and he says,
 ""Aha! I see whats going on here! When the fly drops 6 inches, the fish will jump and get the fly, the Bear will run in and get the fish, the hunter will shoot and get the bear,
 but while the hunter is distracted I can go and get the hunters sandwiches for my lunch.""

On the floor of the cabin is a little grey Tabby, prowling back and forth. He looks up and spots the mouse, who is watching the hunter, who is watching the Bear, who is watching the fish who is watching the fly and he says,

 ""Aha! I see whats going on here! When that fly drops 6 inches, the fish will jump up and get the fly, the Bear will run in and get the fish, the hunter will shoot the Bear
the mouse will go for the sandwiches, but while the mouse is distracted, I can go in and catch that mouse and have him for my lunch. Yum."" 

And soon.....

 The fly drops 6 inches.

 The Fish jumps up and eats the fly.

 The Bear runs in and catches the fish.

 The hunter lines up his shot - BUT THE MOUSE GOES TO EARLY!!

 And the hunter catches him out of the corner of his eye, swings around suddenly, pulls the trigger on his rifle, scaring the cat so much, it jumps up and runs into the lake. 


Now the moral of this story is:

When the fly drops 6 inches, Pussy is getting wet...",The Fly on the lake,4

So the mortician rolled him over. Seamus looked and said ""Nope, it ain't Paddy.""

The mortician thought that was rather strange and then he brought Sean in to identify the body.

Sean took a look at him and said, ""Yup, he's burnt real bad, roll him over.""

The mortician rolled him over and Sean looked down and said, ""No, it ain't Paddy.""

The mortician asked, ""How can you tell?""

Sean said, ""Well, Paddy had two arseholes.""

""What? He had two arseholes?"" asked the mortician.

""Yup, everyone knew he had two arseholes. Every time we went into town, folks would say, 'Here comes Paddy with two arseholes..""",Paddy died in a fire and was burnt pretty badly,6

After about four weeks, the one guy goes up to the other guy and says, ""Look man, we have to do something about this. I am really needing to get laid. I have been without sex for weeks. Maybe we can work something out. Look, I will tell you a riddle, and if you guess right, you can fuck me. If you guess wrong, I can fuck you.""

The other guy says, ""I don't think that will work.""

So the guy says, ""Do you have a better idea?""

The other guy thinks for a second and says, ""Well, I am pretty good at riddles, so yeah, let's do it.""

The guy then tells him the riddle, ""So this animal has four legs, is usually black and white, has a tail, we can milk them, and they say 'moo.'""

The other thinks for a second and says, ""A mosquito!""

The guy then says, ""YOU'RE RIGHT!""

TUESDAY: Fruit salad supper, serve without dressing. I didn't get dressed at all, as per recipe, and what a surprise when my boyfriend brought his friends home for supper.

WEDNESDAY: Rice pilaf, wash thoroughly before steaming the rice. I took a good bath and washed very thoroughly, even between my toes. The taste of the rice was same as last time for some reason, so washing doesn't seem to help.

THURSDAY: New salad recipe for a change. Prepare ingredients by laying a bed of lettuce one hour before serving. I was rolling around in the garden laying on the lettuce heads for one hour and then I got sunburned. 

FRIDAY: Being Friday, it's great to try some treats, so today it's time to make cookies. The recipe calls for placing the ingredients in a bowl and beat it. I beat it to the grocery store to pick up some more milk, came back, but nothing happened to the ingredients I placed in the bowl. I ended up throwing the whole thing out, what a waste. 

SATURDAY: My boyfriend's parents came to our house and stayed for dinner. I wanted to serve roast but we only had hamburgers in the freezer. I put the hamburgers in the oven, and set the dial to roast. Unfortunately, the taste was still almost exactly like hamburger, just a bit roasted. 

This has been a great time cooking and I'm having a lot of fun. I can't wait until we buy a new and much bigger oven, because I want to surprise my boyfriend with chocolate mousse. ",Blonde Cook,1

Women often receive warnings about protecting themselves at the mall and in dark parking lots, etc. This is the first warning I have seen for men. I wanted to pass it on in case you haven't heard about it. A 'heads up' for those men who may be regular customers at Lowe's, Home Depot, Costco, or even Wal-Mart. This one caught me totally by surprise. Over the last month I became a victim of a clever scam while out shopping. Simply going out to get supplies has turned out to be quite traumatic. Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't happen to you or your friends. 

Here's how the scam works; Two nice looking, college-age girls will come over to your car or truck as you are packing your purchases into your vehicle. They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. (It's impossible not to look). When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say 'No' but instead ask for a ride to McDonald's.

You agree and they climb into the vehicle. On the way, they start undressing. Then one of them starts crawling all over you, while the other one steals your wallet.

I had my wallet stolen Aug. 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, again on the 17th, 20th, 24th, and the 29th. Also Sept. 1st, 4th, 8th, twice on the 16th &amp;17th, and very likely again this upcoming weekend.

So tell your friends to be careful. What a horrible way to take advantage of us older men. Warn your friends to be vigilant.

Wal-Mart has wallets on sale for $2.99 each. I found even cheaper ones for $.99 at the Dollar Store and bought them out in three of their stores.

Also, you never get to eat at McDonald's. I've already lost 11 pounds just running back and forth from Lowe's, to Home Depot, to Wal-Mart.

So please, send this on to all the older men that you know and warn them to be on the lookout for this scam. (The best times are just before lunch and around 4:30 in the afternoon.)",Older Men Scam,10

at 12 noon on the button.  However, on the way home, I spotted a girl half
our age who was struggling with a flat tire.  I changed that tire in a
jiffy, and next, she was offering me money.  Of course, I refused the
money.  Then she told me that she was headed to the bar at the Sheraton and
begged me to stop so she could buy me a beer.  She was such a sweetie, so I
said, ""Yes.""  Before you know it, one beer turned to three or four, and I
guess we were looking pretty good to each other.  Then she told me that she
had a room at the Sheraton less than 50 steps from our table.  She suggested
that we go for some privacy, while pulling me by the hand.  Now I'm in her
room.
The talking stopped, and clothes were flying.  We proceeded to have sex in
every way imaginable.  It must have gone on for hours, because, before I
know it, the clock says 5:30 p.m.  I jumped up, threw on my clothes and  ran

is a real jerk, steps out of his car and comes striding toward the officer,
demanding to know why he is being harassed by the Gestapo!


So the officer calmly tells him of the red light violation. The motorist
instantly goes on a tirade, questioning the officer's ancestry, sexual
orientation, etc., in rather explicit offensive terms.


The tirade goes on without the officer saying anything.


When the officer finishes writing the ticket he puts an ""AH"" in the lower right 
corner of the narrative portion of the ticket. He then hands it to the 'violator' 
for his signature. The guy signs the ticket angrily, and when presented with 
his copy points to the ""AH"" and demands to know what it stands for.


The officer says, ""That's so when we go to court, I'll remember that you're an ass hole!""


Two months later they're in court. The 'violator' has a bad driving record and he 
is in danger of losing his license, so he hired a lawyer to represent him.


On the stand the officer testifies to seeing the man run the red light.


Under cross examination the defense attorney asks;
""Officer is this a reasonable facsimile of the ticket that you issued to my client?""


Officer responds, ""Yes, sir, that is the defendant's copy, his signature and mine, 
same number at the top.""


Lawyer: ""Officer, is there any particular marking or notation on this ticket you 
don't normally make?""


""Yes, sir, in the lower right corner of the narrative there is an ""AH,"" underlined.""


""What does the ""AH"" stand for, officer?""


""Aggressive and hostile, Sir.""


""Aggressive and hostile?""


""Yes, Sir.”


""Officer, are you sure it doesn't stand for ass hole?""


“Well, sir, you know your client better than I do.”


How often can one get an attorney to convict his own client?

Before anyone knows it, the three men found themselves standing before the Pearly Gates of Heaven, with St. Peter and the Devil standing nearby. 

""Gentlemen,"" the Devil started, ""Due to the fact that Heaven is now overcrowded, St. Peter has agreed to limit the number of people entering Heaven. If anyone of you can ask me a question which I don't know or cannot answer, then you're worthy enough to go to Heaven; if not, then you'll come with me to Hell."" 

The philosopher then stepped up, ""OK, give me the most comprehensive report on Socrates' teachings."" With a snap of his finger, a stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The philosopher read it and concluded it was correct. ""Then, go to Hell!"" With another snap of his finger, the philosopher disappeared. 

The mathematician then asked,""Give me the most complicated formula ever theorized!"" With a snap of his finger, another stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The mathematician read it and reluctantly agreed it was correct. ""Then, go to Hell!"" With another snap of his finger, the mathematician disappeared too. 

The idiot then stepped forward and said, ""Bring me a chair!"" The Devil brought forward a chair. ""Drill 7 holes on the seat."" The Devil did just that. The idiot then sat on the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, he asked, ""Which hole did my fart come out from?"" The Devil inspected the seat and said, ""The third hole from the right."" ""Wrong,"" said the idiot, ""from my asshole.""

""Remember God created EVERYTHING in six days.  On the sixth day, he scooped up some dust and made Adam.  He took one of Adam's ribs and made Eve.  They had kids and their kids had kids and so on, so that's how we're here.""
Not entirely convinced, he asked his mom the same question.  
""It began with microorganisms you couldn't see without a microscope.  Over time they evolved--creating algae, fish, birds, tadpoles, for example.    Eventually, who knows, but something--tadpoles or algae---evolved into monkeys and apes and eventually humans!!""

Mom's explanation seemed more logical so the boy approached his dad.   ""You lied to me!  Mom told me about evolution.""

Dad responded, ""no, Son.  I didn't lie.  Your mother was just telling you about HER side of the family.""

post,5va37i,2qh72,jokes,false,1487659065,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5va37i/a_quick_math_question/,self.jokes,,"Alright, so here's quick math question for ya:

So there's two trains. The first train is traveling at *exactly* 90 miles per hour from Plotopia heading due west. There is a clown standing atop it. He is holding a grenade. (And yes, his billowing pants and rainbow-dyed afro-wig *are* affecting wind resistance, but it's negligible).

The second train is traveling from Plotburg at 100 miles per hour heading due east on the same track(a collision course, if you will). There is a mime standing atop it. He is *pretending* to hold a grenade.

This second train is a newer electric model(hence its increased speed), whereas the first train is an older coal model(complete with caboose). Since it's a coal train, there is soot issuing forth from it dying the clown's rainbow-wig black.

 This irritates the clown.

Now between the coal train and its caboose are 5 freight cars(this is important), 3 of which are holding 5,000 bushels of apples each. Aboard the train is Señior Tyrone Chang(he's from Russia) with the intention of selling his apples at Plotburg. The current going price for apples is $150 a bushel.

Alas, there's been a collapse in the apple market! And the price of apple bushels is plummeting at a steady rate of 1 dollar a minute!

Now, assuming there is exactly 90 miles between Plotopia and Plotburg, and the trains do not alter their speeds, they will meet each other at....Midway City(Do you know why they call that place Midway City? Cause that's what was painted on the sign, it'd be silly to call it something else).

After roughly 28 minutes of his wig being dyed black, the clown has had enough and throws his grenade. This isn't just *any* grenade, however, but a Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch which explodes on the fourth second obliterating all within its presence save for Plotonium(Which is nearly invincible, due to the plot).

The clown has a very strong throwing arm(due to his pie-throwing days in the circus) and the grenade is lobbed forth through the air 4 seconds ahead of the coal-train(which is about 6 seconds away from colliding with the electric train).

1...2...3...

**HALLELUJAH**

And it explodes, launching the coal-train *just* over the incoming electric train by a hairs breadth, landing completely unscathed. The mime doesn't make it(but he pretends to).

Assuming there are no further incidences, the train arrives at Plotburg on time one hour after departure. This means Señior Tyrone Chang(from Russia) is going to sell his apples at...$90 a bushel. For a grand total of...yep, you guessed it: $1,350,000

Now, the question is: how many train cars pulled by the coal train didn't have apples?

Guessed Wrong: [3. You forgot about the caboose(They always forget about the caboose). Where did you think Señior Tyrone Chang was sitting? Up front with the conductors? *Preposterous*! He's merely a humble apple merchant; he hasn't the authorization.](#s)

Guessed Right: [...damnit.](/#s)",A quick math question,10

The politician agreed and so God Teleported them to Heaven and was shown around. Angels singing, the dearly departed floating from one cloud to another, everyone with a smile on their face. It was quite peaceful the politician had to admit.

After a day looking around it was Lucifer's turn to show him Hell. They teleported down and the Politician was greeted by not only Lucifer but all of his friends that have died over the years. They greeted each other with big hugs and firm handshakes and started to show him around. They had golf clubs, strip joints and really fancy dinners with caviar, wine, all of the works. 

 After a day has passed the Politician was back in Limbo and God asked ""so what will it be?""
 He replied "" well as weird as it is for me to say this Lord I think I would rather prefer Hell with my friends""
""so be it"" said God and the politician was teleported to Hell

However when he arrived there were no mown lawns of the golf courses, the strip joints were no were to be seen. His friends were in rags slowly walking about looking gaunt and lifeless.

""T-th-This is not what it was like yesterday! What happened to all the strip joints, food and fun?

It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50
The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.
The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.
The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.
First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.
Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.
Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.
The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.
First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.
Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.
Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.
The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""
Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

The interview goes great and the lucky guy is offered the job immediately. The interviewer asks ""would you like to see what you will be doing?"" and the man agrees it would be good to get a feel for his new task.

They walk out into a large manufacturing site and at the end of a long conveyer belt, dozens of newly packed Durex's roll to a stop. The interviewer takes one of the Durex's out of the wrapper, drops his pants and rolls it on to his man sausage. He then hits a large red button, the conveyor stops and a supermodel standard, well endowed blonde rushes out of an office, naked, and throws herself over the conveyor belt. The interviewer slips in from behind and pounds away for a few minutes until it comes to its inevitable end. He then takes the Johnny off, rinses it out under a tap and places it back in the wrapper. ""Nothing wrong with that"" he exclaims cheerily.

The the new employee, understandably, can't believe his luck and asks eagerly, ""when can I start?"" The interviewer, impressed with his eagerness, says ""you can start right now if you want?"" The new employee agrees and the interviewer leaves him to get on with his new job.

The new employee frantically grabs a Durex and quickly slides it over his eager member. He quickly smacks the button and out flies another incredibly beautiful, busty blonde. She runs over to him, grabs his cock and proceeds to give him a quick-paced hand job. ""What the fuck are you doing?"" he asks disappointingly and she replies; ""You have to work a week in-hand here!""",Man a Gets Job as 'Chief Tester' at a Durex Factory!,6

In the washroom, while washing his hands, Bubby asked if it was okay if he could pee. Not sure how to react in this awkward situation George said yes. 

Now, George was a man married for 13 years. He didn't mind a teen taking a piss in his bathroom. He was just surprised that Bubby would do it in front of him. What surprised him most, though, was the size of Bubby's 11th finger. 

He jokingly said ""I'm glad someone with such a long hose is watering my garden""

Bubby casually replied, ""It's easy to get one like this. I just whack it on my bed's headboard 3 times before I go sleep.""

After saying good bye Bubby left. After a hearty meal and a nice shower George went to bed. He decided to try Bubby's trick. He whacked it 3 times on the bed. His wife, Elaine, woke up.

In a tired and exhausted voice she whispered: ""Bubby? Is that you?""",It was just another day...,2

""C'mere"" says the drunk and leads Stan to the railing.  ""Hold my beer and watch this"" the drunk says handing over his drink.  As soon as the beer is safe the drunk vaults over the rail. Stan is too shocked to do anything but watch as the drunk plummets down. But amazingly rather than splat the drunk bounces off the sidewalk and sails easily back up to the roof. ""How did you do that?"" Stan sputters. ""It's easy"", says the drunk, ""anybody can do it, but only right here on cold night like this"". ""Go ahead. Give it a try"". So Stan hands over the beer and his whisky and vaults the rail. Of course when Stan ends his 10 story fall he dies instantly, smashed into tiny bits on the pavement.

The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina. The doctor said ""OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my dick I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina."" 

The husband nodded and gave his approval. The young lady said ""Yes, yes, whatever, just get on with it."" 

So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, ""I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper"". 

So the doctor went deeper and deeper. After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed. The young lady began to quiver with excitement, she began to moan and groan aloud, ""Oh doctor, doctor!"" she shouted. The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself. 

He then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises. 

The husband, at this point, suddenly became very annoyed and shouted. ""Now wait a minute, what the hell do you think you're doing?!"" he blasted.

One thing they did fashion out of wood, though--specifically teak: an ornate central chair meant to grace the hall and serve as a seat for the bold mariner who had led them to their new home, who the other now-settled wanderers intended to name their first king at the feast celebrating the hall's completion.

To that end, they hid the carved chair in the small space between the hall's woven ceiling and roof, to be lowered dramatically as they surprised the mariner with his new crown.

Unfortunately, the heavy wooden object instead fell through the flimsy rattan ceiling just as they were crowning him, crushing him to death.
