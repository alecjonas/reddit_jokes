He takes the only other urinal, which is right next to this odd armless fellow, and does his best to ignore him. The man pisses and the armless bounces. He finishes his buisness and begins to walk out when curiosity finally get the best of him. 

""Are you ok"" he asks

The armless man turns to him with a look of obvious distress on his face. ""I'm about to piss myself and as you can see I've got a little problem. I'm ridiculously embarrassed to ask, but I would be so grateful if you could help me out here""

""Uhhh..what kind of help"" the man asks

""Could you unzip my pants and pull my dick out so I can piss. You can see that I can do it myself and I'd be humiliated if I had to go back in the bar having pissed myself""

The man thinks for a second about how unfortunate this poor guy is. Maybe he's a wounded soldier or a victim of some terrible accident. He's definitely not too excited about touching another mans dick, but figures that the bathroom is empty so no one would probably know anyway.
""Sure"" he says and unzips the armless mans pants and pulls out his dick.

The armless man is euphoric at finally getting to piss, but our hero can't help but notice that the guys dick is absolutely disgusting. It's covered in oozing scabs and smells like zombie shit. As the armless man pisses, the man rushes to the sink to wash his hands.

""Wait"" says the armless man. ""I need you to help me put it back in. I can't walk out of here with my dick out""

The man is stunned. He doesn't want to touch the Worlds Ugliest Dick again, but again he thinks about what could have happened to this poor man and how humiliated he must be to have to ask for a strangers help with this. 

""Hurry up"" our hero says as he tries to tuck the quasimodo or dicks back into the crippled mans pants. Good deed completed, he rushes to the sink and begins scrubbing his hands as the armless man thanks him and starts to walk out.

""Wait"" the man says. ""I know this is pretty rude, but I've got to know....what the fuck is wrong with your dick""

The armless man pulls his arms out of his shirt and says ""Fuck if I know but I ain't touching it""

his axe fell into the river. 
When he cried out, the Lord appeared and asked, ""Why are you crying?"" 
The woodcutter replied that his axe has fallen into water, 
and he needed the axe to make his living. 
The Lord went down in the water and reappeared with a golden axe. 
""Is this your axe?"" the Lord asked. 
The woodcutter replied, ""No."" 
The Lord again went down and came up with a silver axe. 
""Is this your axe?""the Lord asked. 
Again, the woodcutter replied, ""No."" 
The Lord went down again and came up with an iron axe. 
""Is this your axe?""the Lord asked. 
""Yes"", he replied. 
The Lord was pleased with the man's honesty and gave him all 
three axes to keep, and the woodcutter went home happy. 
Sometime later the woodcutter was walking with his wife along the 
riverbank, and his wife fell into the river. 
When he cried out, the Lord again appeared and asked him, 
""Why are you crying?"" 
""Oh Lord, my wife has fallen into the water!"" 
The Lord went down into the water and came up with Jennifer Lopez. 
""Is this your wife?"" the Lord asked. 
""Yes,"" cried the woodcutter. 
The Lord was furious. ""You lied! That is an untruth!"" 
The woodcutter fell to his knees and cried, ""Oh, forgive me, Lord. It is 
a misunderstanding. You see, if I had said 'no' to Jennifer Lopez, You 
would have come up with Catherine Zeta-Jones. Then if I also said 'no' to 
her, you would have come up with my wife. Had I then said 'yes,' you would 
have given me all three. Lord, I am a poor man, and am not able to take care 
of all three wives, and I love my wife such that I don't want her to share 
me with anyone, so THAT'S why I said yes to Jennifer Lopez."" 
The moral of this story is: Whenever a man lies, it is for a good and 
honourable reason, and for the benefit of others.. MOSTLY his wife! 
That's our story, and we're sticking to it..

Texas, staked out, the officer noticed a man leaving the bar so
intoxicated that he could barely walk. The man stumbled around the
parking lot for a few minutes, with the officer quietly observing.
After what seemed an eternity and trying his keys on five different
vehicles, the man managed to find his car which he fell into. He sat
there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and
drove off. Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off
(it was a fine, dry summer night), flicked the blinkers on, then off a
couple of times, honked the horn and then switched on the lights. He
moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little and then
remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patron
vehicles left. At last, the parking lot empty, he pulled out of the
parking lot and started to drive slowly down the road.
The police officer, having patiently waited all this time, now started
up the patrol car, put on the flashing lights, and promptly pulled the
man over and carried out a breathalyzer test. To his amazement the
breathalyzer indicated no evidence of the man having consumed any
alcohol at all! Dumbfounded, the officer said, ""I'll have to ask you
to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyzer equipment
must be broken."" ""I doubt it,"" said the truly proud Texan. ""Tonight
I'm the designated decoy.""","Recently a routine police patrol parked outside a bar in Bandera, Texas",77

The driver is distraught, he gets out to see if there's anything he can do, realises the cow is dead and looks around before returning to the car. He announces: ""It's dead. There's a house on the hill that must belong to the farmer. I'll let him know and see if he can help clear the road.""

Katie watches him walk up the hill, the driver knocks on the door and after a brief exchange is welcomed into the home with glee. Five, ten, fifteen minutes pass and it's starting to get dark. It's an hour before the now-disheveled driver finally leaves the house and walks down the road to the car. 

Hopkins is fuming: ""Where the hell have you been?""

The driver hiccups: ""My apologies, they invited me inside, fed me a huge meal, let me drink their finest wine and even invited me to sleep with their most beautiful daughter.""

Confused, Hopkins inquires further: ""What on earth did you say to earn that?""

Stumbling, the driver responds: ""Not much! Just that i'm Katie Hopkin's driver, and i've killed the cow!""",Dead Cow,2

She walked over to the limp, dead rabbit, and sprayed the contents of the can onto the rabbit. Miraculously, the rabbit came to life, jumped up, waved its paw at the two humans and hopped down the road. 

50 meters away the rabbit stopped, turned around, waved at the two again, hopped down the road another 50 meters, turned, waved, and hopped another 50 meters. 

The man was astonished. He couldn't figure out what substance could be in the woman's spray can! He ran over to the woman and demanded, "" What was in your spray can? What did you spray onto that rabbit?"" 

The woman turned the can around so that the man could read the label. It said: "" 'Hare Spray' Restores Life to Dead Hare. Adds Permanent Wave.""

So right at three he went up the stairs to the massive Bell;m, rand and slammed his entire face into the bell, ringing it once. He backed up, and ran into the bell with his face again, ringing it once more.

At ten o'clock, as he was running towards the bell he tripped and fell off the tower and died.

She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.
‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. 

‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

There were a lot of trees.  Some were bigger than others, and the small ones were considered little trees.  All the trees were able to communicate with each other by using their advanced knowledge of roots.  In fact they are able to communicate with other forests too.  They have nice and strong roots.  If a tree wants to tell another tree ""hello"", all he/she has to do is think of the word ""hello"" and think of the tree in which the ""hello"" needs to be sent to.  That thought will travel down a trunk and through some ground and into a tangled system of roots that mirror the shape of silly string.  The soft and kind message is able to find out where it needs to go, because that is what it was told to do.  Once that message arrives through the beautiful root system and into the mind of the recipient tree, it turns the tree recipient into a tree messenger.  He/she then acknowledges the message, and is able to respond via root system tree message telepathy.  The original tree messenger now becomes the tree recipient and a tree messenger.  Not only is she/he able to send messages through her/his beautiful clever wooden, open gate of love words, the tree is also able to receive such messages, which completes, and molds /her/him into a communicating tree of the forest.  

If a human can talk to a tree, then the tree can also talk to a human, as long as the tree can acknowledge that a human is indeed trying to talk to the tree.  The tree will then help nest an eagle above, and that eagle will protect your life and the tree's life with its beak, bravery, screaming and fishing skills.  If that eagle flees the nest, it is because the tree no longer wants it to reside in its space, because there is nothing that is residing with the tree and within its space, and the tree will want to be alone like it was in the forest with all of the other trees.  Always talk to a tree, because a tree is board and trees do not like to be board.  ","The tree who talks, and listens. *The ending is the best part*",0

“Why yes John, that would be nice.” said Marie.
Well, John couldn’t believe his luck.
All week long he polished up his car, and on Friday he picked up Marie and took her to dinner, the finest restaurant in Raleigh.
When they sat down, John looked over at Marie said, “Hey Marie, would you like a cocktail before dinner?”
“Oh no John, “said Marie. “What would I tell my Sunday School class?”
Well, John was setback a bit, so he didn’t say much until after dinner.
Then he reached in his pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes.
“Hey Marie” said John and asked, “Would you like a smoke?”
“Oh no John” said Marie. “What would I tell my Sunday School class?”
Well, John was feeling pretty low after that, so he just got in his car and was driving Marie home when they passed the Holiday Inn.
He’d struck out twice already, so he figured he had nothing to lose.
“Hey Marie” said John, “How would you like to stop at this motel with me?”
“Sure John, that would be awesome” said Marie.
Well, John couldn’t believe his luck. He whipped a U-turn right then and there across the median and everything, and drove back to the motel and checked in with Marie.
The next morning John got up first. He looked at Marie lying there in the bed. “What have I done? What have I done?” thought John.
He shook Marie and she woke up. “Marie, I’ve got to ask you one thing” said John. “What are you going to tell your Sunday School class?”
Marie said, “The same thing I always tell them. You don’t have to smoke and drink to have a good time!",Dating the Sunday School teacher,2

So December 1st is upon us (in Australia at least) and that means that it is time for me to begin my annual tradition of posting daily status updates on facebook with terrible xmas jokes until xmas. An advent calendar of xmas cracker jokes if you will.

Anyway this is my third or fourth year doing it (I can't really remember) and the well has run kind of dry. So I thought I might reach out to the jokes community of reddit and ask for  any terrible, cringe, hilarious and/or dirty xmas cracker jokes you have, made up, whatever.

There is every chance I will have seen a lot of these as I have filtered through 100s in my time looking for amusing ones, but I will appreciate any help I can get.


Some examples of the type of jokes I am looking for are:

What kind of motorbike does Santa ride?
A holly davidson

Why does Santa have 3 gardens?
So he can hoe hoe hoe.

What does Miley Cyrus have at xmas?
Twerky.

What happened to the man who stole an advent calendar?
He got 25 days.

If they were funny that'd be good, ones like the following which are just plain bad are less desirable

What's the most popular xmas wine?
""I don't like brussel sprouts""

Any way all help appreciated",Xmas Joke Help,4

They lived on an island and were constantly terrorized by a mountain ogre, who always marched to their little village and kicked, sometimes killing, many of the Trids.  

One day, a Rabbi went to the island as a part of a tour he was in and saw the island's indigenous people being harassed by the mountain ogre.

""Why does he always attack you guys?"" the Rabbi said.

""Since we're much shorter than him, he figures he can kick us around with no problem!""

""Well I'm about his height, so I'll go speak to him.""

And so he travelled up the island's mountain to meet the ogre.  At the top, he saw him.

""Why are you always harassing the Trids?""

""They can't fight back, look at their height!""

""Oh, that's why?  In that case, why don't you kick me?  I may be your height, but I'm an old man!  I can't fight back!""

""Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids!""

-------------------------------------------------------------------
BONUS JOKE:

On the way back to the ship to continue the tour, the Rabbi approaches the Trids - ""I tried to make him stop, it didn't work.""  He said.

""Oh, that's alright!  Have fun with your tour!""  One of them replied.

All of a sudden, a bird flying across the sky flew across the rabbi's head, leaving his droppings on the Rabbi's head.

""Do you happen to have any way of washing this off?""

""No!  Don't wash it off!  That's the droppings of the sacred Foo bird!  The Foo's droppings landing on your head indicates good luck and prosperity!""

""The Foo bird, huh?  I see.""

Wanting to respect their culture, the rabbi waits for the boat to depart before trying to wash the droppings off.

Once on course, he washed his head, trying to get the smell of the Foo out.

As soon as he was successful, the boat, almost like magic, suddenly sank.

He, along with other passengers, sank to their death.

When the armless man finishes, the other man helps him put his junk back in his pants. As they're leaving, the man asks, ""by the way, what the fuck was wrong with your dick?!""
The other man pulls his arms out of his shirt and says,

As she lay her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. After a moment or two, the Vet shook his head sadly and said, ""I'm so sorry, Polly has passed 
away."" 
  
The distressed owner wailed, ""Are you sure? I mean, you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something."" 
  
The vet rolled his eyes, shrugged, turned and left the room returning a few moments later with beautiful black Labrador. As the bird's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the dead parrot from top to bottom. He then looked at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. 
  
The vet led the dog out but returned a few moments later with a cat. The cat jumped up and also sniffed delicately at the ex-bird. The cat sat back, shook its head, meowed and ran out of the room. The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry; but like I said, your parrot is most definitely, 100% certifiably ...dead."" 
  
He then turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill which he handed to the woman. The parrot's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried. ""$150 just to tell me my bird is dead?!""

""Greetings, comrade"", says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the Russian says, ""I think you are American spy"".

The spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained spy, he says, ""that is not true, I am the proudest Soviet there is! I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!""

He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully. Everybody in the bar cheers.

""Very good, very good!"", says the politician. ""But I still think you are spy.""

The man continues to keep his cool. ""I am a historian! I can tell you everything about this glorious country!"". He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America, and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.

""Amazing! You are skilled!"", says the politician. The spy smirks. ""But I still think you American spy.""
The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed. He replies, ""I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!""

The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest. The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka. After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.

In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats ""You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.""

The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up. ""Okay, you got me. I am an American. But what made you think that way, after all this time?""

Throughout the tournament the American had barely beaten every opponent while the Russian had pinned everyone he faced by the Russian pretzel. 

During the match, the American seemed to be getting the best of the Russian until he felt he Russian gain control of his body and start contorting it in a way he had never felt.

The crowd hear a loud yell, and the American escaped and ended up winning the match.

I used to get on the chat rooms and speak to random strangers for hours, especially in the summer. This was probably the summer before freshman year, and I meet this girl with the screen name of sexyblonde69. We are just chatting and going back in forth. I think I met her in a singles chat. We exchanged ASL, she said she was 35, female, from Texas. I thought it was awesome she was from Texas and I told her I was 25. I don't know if she believed me, but I have always looked older than I am. We exchange photos and I find out she is from Houston. She is stacked. I mean, gorgeous breasts. One day, a buddy of mine stops by my house and tells me he is running from the cops and needed to stash some of his coke at my house for a day or two. I oblige, and ask him if I can do some. He says of course, just get him back. So, I do a line and stick the rest in my closet. Both of my parents were working at the time and my brothers were either not home or just not around. I go out to the computer room and jump on AIM. Sexyblonde69, whose name is Cheri, is on and we start chatting. She tells me that she is about to go do some shopping for a party tonight and ask what I am up to. I felt like a badass so I bragged about just doing some coke and how I was just chilling at the house. She asked if I had any plans for tonight and I told her no. She invites me out to Houston so I can go to the club with her friends. Keep in mind, I was 14 without a car. My dad always had an extra work truck or two at the house for some reason, so I could definitely get a car. I had been working as a shop hand most of the summer so I also had a little spending money. I start really thinking that I could make it to Houston. Then she adds in that if I show up, I will definitely get to fuck her tonight. Okay. Now I am stoked. I pull the coke down from the closet and do another line. I really have to think on this. If I go to Houston, I get to lose my virginity to a gorgeous 35 year old woman. Well, I think with my dick like any other 14 year old would and I go check to make sure the keys are in the work truck. Cheri and I exchange numbers and I hit the road. Keep in mind this is before GPS on your phones and everything. I believe I had a Razr... So, a typical drive to Houston would take 2 and a half hours. I leave at 5pm and plan on meeting Cheri at her house and then taking her out for dinner before the club. So, I get to Houston as planned around 8, but then I proceed to drive around Houston on the phone with Cheri for two fucking hours because she could not give me directions as to where she lived. I finally pull up to her house. Nice looking house, it was all lit up and there were two vehicles out front already. I think, okay. You got this. I pop a mint and head for the door. I knock and about 30 seconds later some dude in shorts and a wife beater answers the door. Big beer belly sticking out. Had to be in his mid 50's.. I nervously ask if Cheri is home, to which he replies yes that she is getting ready. I am 2 hours late and this bitch is still getting ready! He invites me in and introduces himself as Mike, Cheri's father. We walk into the living room where he is watching the History Channel. He offers me a beer, to which I decline because I tell him I am driving and want to be responsible. He tells me good choice and we start watching TV. Well, after 10 minutes or so he pulls out a joint and asks if I would like to smoke. I tell him fuck yes. I was a bit nervous that Cheri did not exist and I really needed to smoke to calm some nerves.He lights it up and we continue watching TV and smoking for another 30 minutes or so. It is creeping up on 11 and I start to get antsy, so I ask him if he thinks Cheri is ready yet. He said he will check, and he screams ""Cheri, are you ready yet!?"" to which she replies that she almost ready and to hold the fuck on. A sigh of relief. There is a woman here! about 5 more minutes goes by and here comes Cheri, wheeling herself in in a wheelchair. I am high and not expecting this. My jaw drops. She asks if everything is okay and I reply it's fine, I just didn't know she was in a wheelchair. She asks if that is a problem, which it wasn't. She and I start to leave the house when her dad calls to me and tells me I will probably need these, and he tosses me the keys. I ask what this is to and he explains it's the wheelchair accessible van out front. Okay, well it is way too late for dinner now and Cheri is apologizing for taking so long she just wanted to look perfect for me. I am still in shock at the wheelchair. I had never seen a full picture of her, but I did see her from the waist up. Those tits. It didn't matter. I drove to Houston for a good time, nothing was going to stop me. She directs me to the club and I tell her that I can't find my license and that I am sorry but we may not be able to get in. She tells me it is fine that she knows the guy working the door and she will get me in. Sure enough, I can just walk on by no questions asked. Her friend is turning 35, so she rented out the VIP room in the back and had bottles all over the table. It gets crazy pretty quick. I am out there, dancing and having a good time when I see Cheri sitting there with a bottle and a sad look on her face. I walk up and ask her what the problem is and she tells me that I haven't even asked her to dance. My jaw hits the floor again. I am drunk, high, and wondering how the fuck I am suppose to dance with a girl in a wheelchair. Regardless, I apologize. I mean, she is fucking me tonight, I need to try my hardest not to screw that up. So, I ask her if she wants to dance. An R&amp;B song is on, it is a slow jam and I push her out to the dance floor and twirl her around some. Now she is smiling, and the song changes. She tells me this is her song and to back up. It's a faster song, so I back up off her and the next thing I know she is popping a wheelie and spinning circles on the dance floor. So, I remember I still have that coke in my pocket and I ask everyone if they want a line. A lay out 5 or 6 lines and Cheri and I both get one along with some of her friends. After a few minutes she tells me to lean in, so I bend down to hear what she has to say and she tells me that coke has her feeling a certain type of way and that we should get out of there. I tell her hell yeah and we tell her friends by. I get her loaded up into the van and off we go. I tell her she has to tell me how to get back to her house because I sucked at remembering directions. So, after 15 minutes of driving or so we get to a dirt road. I tell her I don't remember this road, but she tells me just a little further and there is a nice park we can park at. I tell her okay, and we pull up to the park. We are making out and things are starting to get heated when she asks me if I want to fuck her. Well, the ""how"" had not crossed my mind until now. She points to a tree and tells me that is how. I do not understand, so she goes under her chair and pulls out a contraption. It is a sex swing. She tells me she has done this before and I just needed to climb the tree to tie off the ends. I am horny, young, and drunk. I tell her hold on though, and I do a key bump. I am up that tree in thirty seconds, tying that rope like a fucking boy scout. I put her in the sing and start getting after it. I mean, I am losing my virginity! The best thirty seconds ever. We get loaded back up and headed back to her house, it is 3am or so and all the lights are still on. We go in through the front door and she leaves skid marks as she races off to the restroom. I think ""God, don't make it so obvious.."" And I walk into the living room, where her dad is still sitting watching the History Channel. He asks me how the night was, and I tell him it was great. He has a really wonderful daughter. He thanks me for taking her out and giving her a chance. Tells me it has always been pretty difficult for her to date. He then asks me if she had told me about the last asshole that she dated, and I told him no that she hadn't. I asked what happened, and Mike says the guy was a real asshole. That he left her hanging.",The last guy was a real asshole,4

His dream is to combine his love of the outdoors with his new knowledge and he decides to open a camping supply store. He decides that in order to stand out from the competition, he needs to do some things differently. He decides that at his store customers will be allowed to design their own tents and customize their camping gear. He even decides on a catchy name, ""You Tent It!"", a name that he feels captures his new business perfectly.

He lines up investors and finds a great location right by a national park. Everything is going along great right up until the day before the grand opening. He receives an order of tent pegs that are defective. He knows that he can't sell the defective tent pegs, but he also knows that he can't delay the grand opening without angering his investors.

Left with nowhere else to turn, he calls one of his old business college professors. Luckily, the professor knows someone in the tent peg industry and the professor offers to put him in touch with them. Feeling relieved, he opens the store as planned.

The professor, naturally curious to see how things turned out, stops by the store on opening day. As soon as he walks in the door he sees that his contact in the tent peg industry was able to come through. 

The professor rushes up to Daniel and exclaims ""You Tent It! Dan, you got new pegs! New pegs!""",Daniel decides to open a camping supply business...,1

At a computer expo, Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated ""If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon.

In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating: If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics:

1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.

2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a new car.

3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. For some reason you would simply accept this.

4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.

5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive - but would run on only five percent of the roads.

6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be replaced by a single ""General Protection Fault"" warning light.

7. The airbag system would ask ""Are you sure?"" before deploying.

8. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.

9. Every time GM introduced a new car, car buyers would have to learn to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.

10. You'd have to press the ""Start"" button to turn the engine off.",GM and Microsoft,48
