A science convention is in town. So a chemist, physicist and engineer walk into a local bar. The bar tender sees them and says, ""hey, you're all wise guys, how would I figure out the volume of this ping pong ball?"" The chemist takes the ball from him, pulls out a graduated cylinder, fills it with water and observes how much it displaces and says ""Done! This is the volume to the nearest mL!""  Not to be outdone, the physicist takes the ball, pulls out a micrometer, and measures its diameter. He scribbles some things down on a napkin, hands it to the bartender and says ""Done! This is the volume to the nearest cubic micron!"" Looking at them both like they're crazy, the engineer takes the ball, writes down the serial number, googles the manufacturer, shows the bartender the phone and says ""Done!

post,9z35rb,2qh72,jokes,false,1542806463,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9z35rb/the_pink_ping_pong_balls/,self.jokes,,"There was once a boy. He was the son of the richest man in the universe. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, he dwarfed them all. He was a multi-trillionaire. Now, it was this boy's birthday. His father asked him,

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. A store full of lego, all the video games in the world, anything. What would you like?""

His son replied.

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one pink ping pong ball.""

His father was rather confused by this request. Out of all the things he could've chosen, his son chose a ping pong ball. Nonetheless, he agreed and gave him a pink ping pong ball. His son was overjoyed and spoke to him.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong ball?""

""Okay son, go ahead.""

The boy then went up to his room and played with his pink ping pong ball. When his father went in the next morning to check on him, the boy was sleeping in his bed and the pink ping pong ball was nowhere to be found.

On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

His son replied.

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one box full of pink ping pong balls.""

His father was again, confused by this. Still, he bought a cardboard box and filled it with ping pong balls. He gave it to his son, who said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong balls?""

The father nodded, and the son went up to his room to play. The next morning when his father went to check, the boy was sleeping peacefully and there were no pink ping pong balls in sight. Just the empty cardboard box in the middle of the room.

On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one truck full of ping pong balls.""

Now, by this point, the father was extremely confused. Why did the boy want so many pink ping pong balls and where were they going? He asked.

""My son. You are the most precious thing in the world to me and I can certainly get you this, but may I ask, why do you want a truck full of pink ping pong balls?""

His son replied.

""My father. Please humour me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.""

His father agreed and ordered a truck full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the truck and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?""

The father agreed and the boy spent the night in the truck. When the father went back to check on him in the morning, all the pink ping pong balls were gone, and only the boy was left, sleeping in the back of the truck.

The day before the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one oil tanker full of ping pong balls.""

The father was very confused by this and had to ask again.

""My son can you tell me why you want these pink ping pong balls?""

His son replied.

""My father. Please humour me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.""

His father once again, agreed and bought all the ping pong ball factories in the world and made the workers work overtime to produce all the pink ping pong balls needed. He also bought an oil tanker and a pump, a crane and a dump truck to get all the ping pong balls in overnight. On his birthday, his father gave him the oil tanker full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the oil tanker and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?""

Now the father had expected this and had made sure the oil tanker was completely safe for the boy's use. He agreed and the boy went into the oil tanker for the night. The next morning, when the father went to check, all he found was his son sleeping in the ship with all the pink pong balls gone without a trace.

Now, a few days before his next birthday, the boy got into a huge car accident and was on the verge of death. His father asked him.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

The boy replied with a choked voice, obviously forcing himself to speak despite the pain.

""My father... It would make me the happiest... boy in the world... if you could get me one... pink... ping pong ball...""

His father replied.

""My son. This may be the last time I ever speak to you. Will you please tell me why you wanted all the pink ping pong balls?""

""Alright father. Come closer.""

His father nodded, bringing his face up close to his son's. The son's voice was getting weak by this point, coughing in between breaths. Still, he brought up the strength for one final sentance.

""The reason I wanted all the pink ping pong balls is-""

And then he died.",The pink ping pong balls,6

The little boy, sobbing, said, ""I put flour on my face and said 'look mama, I'm white'.""

His dad bends the little boy over and gives him a spanking. ""You go up stairs and tell your grandmutha whatchu said!""

Sobbing even harder, the little boy slowly climbs the stairs. His grand mother says, ""oh lordy oh lordy! Wus-amatta baby, honey, sugar sweet pie? Come on ova here and tell grandmama what's wrong.""

Crying even harder, he sobs, ""I put flour on my face and said, 'look mama, I'm white'.""

Finally God grew tired of the arguing and he said, ""Let's see who can code the best program in only one hour."" He snapped, the world went blank, and there was nothing but two computers and two desks side by side. Satan and Jesus sat down and began typing at once.

Each of them typed gargantuan amounts of advanced code that would take anyone else hours to just learn the basics of. When there were less than five minutes left in the competition, there was a loud pop and the screens went blank. The power came back on a few moments later,  and Satan realized he was in a bout of trouble.

He had tried everything to recover his program, but it simply could not be found. He definitely didn't have time to restart the coding from scratch.

He began shouting, ""I lost every single thing when the power went out! All of my code! My precious program...""

Jesus, however, had no issues recovering his information. All it took was a simple click of a button, and there his program was. Unharmed without fault, and definitely not lost like Satan's.

A look of awe and jealousy crossed Satan's face. ""But... I don't understand."" He looked between God and Jesus, ""This *has* to be a trick. A ploy.""

I've never written to you before, but I really need your advice. I have suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me. The usual signs are phone rings, but if I answer, the caller hangs up. My wife has been going out with ""the girls"" a lot recently, although when I ask their names she always says, ""Just some friends from work, you don't know them.."" I always try to stay awake to look out for her coming home, but I usually fall asleep. Anyway, I have never approached the subject with my wife. I think deep down I just didn't want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her. 

Around midnight, I decided to hide next to the garage behind my boat so I could get a good view of the whole street when she arrived home from a night out with ""the girls"". When she got out of the car she was buttoning up her blouse, which was open, and she took her panties out of her purse and slipped them on. It was at that moment, crouching behind the boat, that I noticed some hairline cracks in my gelcoat, right were the hull meets the transom of my boat. 

Is this something I can fix myself or should I take the boat to the shop for repairs?",Guy writes to Dear Abby about his wife cheating,0

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""","Once upon a time in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a monk named Sam.",8

On its initial trials, this pride of the fleet flies by the main Space Force base in fully cloaked mode. On board the Space Force base the Lieutenant turns to his admiral and says, “Sir, sensors indicate a large mass has just passed our base!”

He works up the courage to ask her, but she says that although she likes him, her parents would not allow her to go out with a Whole Wheat Cheerio. This upset Jim quite a bit, so he decided to get a job

He got a job at a local McDonalds. He worked hard every day after school and all day on the weekends

One morning he woke up feeling rather sticky, so he got out of bed and looked in a mirror. It turns that he earned so much money that his status changed to a Honey Nut Cheerio

After this he went to school and asked Alice if she would go out with him now 

She gave the same response saying that her parents would still forbid it. 

Jim was really upset again but he didn’t let that stop him from trying to work hard enough to become a Frosted Cheerio so that he could be with Alice

He worked so hard that one day the store owner was retiring and asked Jim if he would take the job

Jim was rather ecstatic about this thinking that it would turn him into a Frosted Cheerio, but it didn’t.

He kept working every day in his new restaurant until one day the CEO of McDonald’s visited Jim’s restaurant and the CEO was really impressed

He offered Jim to take over half of the restaurant in the corporation. Jim eagerly agreed.

The next morning Jim woke up feeling really cold. He got up and looked in the mirror.
It turns out that he became a Frosted Cheerio. 

Jim was feeling really confident and asked Alice to prom again with only one day remaining. She excitedly said yes to Jim.

Jim took her to prom and they danced for hours. Jim asked Alice if she would like a drink and she said that should would love one

You’re in charge. Let’s see how you handle it. You know the business well enough. Just remember, the new dildo line goes on sale Saturday. That’s $25 for the white dildos, and $50 for the black dildos.”

“25 for white, 50 for black,” she dutifully wrote down everything he said. “Got it, boss!” She was so excited to finally have the chance to prove that she was ready for that promotion.

All weekend long, dildos practically flew off the shelves. Customers seemed to love the design, the feel, even the packaging drew rave reviews. Sales figures were through the roof, and Lori was delighted. “This’ll show him. I can manage this place.”

Round closing time Sunday evening, a sweet-looking young lady entered the store and inquired about the dildo selection. Lori recited her sales pitch to perfection: “Well we have these lovely new white dildos for $25, or, for the woman who wants it all, this deluxe black model for $50. Would you like that gift-wrapped?”

The lady crinkled her nose bit, and squinted her eyes to see the objects on the shelf behind where Lori was standing. “How much is that plaid dildo back there?”

“Oh, that’s…. that’s not for sale. My manager asked me to sell the black ones and the white ones, but that one is not actually on the sales floor…”

“Oh come on, I’ll give you a little extra, you can take some off the top for your own pocketbook? I’ll give you $120, you skim off $20 for yourself, your boss will love you for it. Whaddya say? Help a girl out?”

“Well, OK.” Lori responded, and rang up the transaction.

The next morning, Lori arrived at the Sex Shoppe, and found the owner already in the office, going over the shop’s financials for the weekend. “Looks like you had a good weekend!” he chimed.

“You have no idea! I sold 74 white dildos, over 100 black dildos, and some ditzy lady gave me $100 for your Thermos.”

She summoned all three suitors to the grand hall and announced - ""whoever brings me the most ping pong balls shall have my hand in marriage - this is my test of love!"" Each suitor goes off to meet the challenge.

The first suitor comes back a few weeks later with loads and loads of horse drawn carriages filled with ping pong balls. The convoy stretches as far as the eye can see. All together they amount to 1 million ping pong balls and the princess is impressed.

The second suitor realises he has to up his game and hires a fleet of ships to gather deliver the ping pong balls. A few months later ships upon ships line the harbour in front of the princess' castle, and the princess swoons at the sight of 100 million ping pong balls being offered to her.

The third and final suitor then shows up a year later. He's all bloodied and beaten up, horrible scars across his arms. In his left hand he clutches a big brown heavy sack. The princess confronts him, clearly unimpressed and says ""what are you doing!? Clearly this can't beat the 100 million ping pong balls I had from my second suitor! Stop wasting my time!""

“Well, look at these three wise men. *Three wise men?*  That sounds like Ivy League elitists to me. Plus, Frankincense and myrrh? I bet these guys are Arabs. The president wouldn’t like this at all.”

“Not really,” says the second one, “Look at Mary and Joseph - they’re refugees! I bet they’re bringing drugs and crime to Nazareth.”

It's a Mexican border town, just across the Rio Grande from Laredo, TX. There's lots of American expats on the south side of the border and a lot of Mexican expats on the north side of the border, and large extended families spread their tendrils regardless on both sides of the river.  


One of the patriarchs of those extended families had passed away, and they had to do a joint Catholic/Methodist service to keep the peace among the descendants. The pastor and priest agreed that they would each do the bit they needed to do, and let the nearly-centenarian widow control the mic after the service.   


It lasts forever. I mean FOREVER. All the children come up and speak very movingly. Their children come up and speak very movingly about all their Abuelo meant to them. But then come the nieces and nephews. The two great-grandchildren old enough to speak are a point of interest, but they mostly just parrot what their elders said.  


Finally, as everything seems to be closing up, the widow takes the mic back and is about to hand it to the priest. But she sees an old man lingering in the back. She senses he wants to say something, and so beckons him forward.  


""Padre"", she says, ""did you have something to add?""  


""Hermana"", he replies, ""I barely knew your husband, but he still was dear to me. Would it be possible for me to say a word?""  


She nods and hands him the microphone. He gathers himself, clears his throat, and says, ""Plethora"", and hands the microphone back to the widow.  


""Thank you"", she says, ""That means a lot.""",There's a long funeral service in Nuevo Laredo,3

The only phrase Johnny caught was “Purple flowers.” The next day in class, after giving instructions, the teacher asks if anyone has any questions. Johnny raises his hand and asks, “What are purple flowers?” The teacher goes, “Johnny, I will not tolerate that kind of language in my classroom. Go sit in the hall and think about what you’ve done.”

He goes out and sits in the hall when another teacher walks by and sees him. The teacher asks Johnny, “What are you doing sitting in the hall?”

“I asked a stupid question.”

“What was the stupid question?”

“What are purple flowers?”

“Johnny, go to the principal’s office. Now.”

When he gets there, the principal tells him, “You’re a good student, Johnny. You haven’t gotten in trouble before. So why are you here now?”

“I was sitting in the hall.”

“Why were you sitting in the hall?”

“I asked a stupid question.”

“What was the stupid question?”

“What are purple flowers?”

“Johnny, go home early. You’re suspended for the rest of the month.”

Johnny goes home and his mother asks him, “Why are you home so early, dear? It’s only noon.”

“I was sent to the principal’s office.”

“Why were you sent to the principal’s office?”

“I was sitting in the hall.”

“Why were you sitting in the hall?”

“I asked a stupid question.”

“What was the stupid question?”

“What are purple flowers?”

“Johnny, I’m kicking you out of this house. No son of mine is asking that.”

Johnny is now homeless. He decides to get a job at McDonald’s. Now keep in mind he’s, like, twelve. He gets the job, but after about an hour on his shift, the CEO stops him and says, “So we’ve looked at your record, and you’re severely underage. Why are you getting a job at McDonald’s anyway?”

“I got kicked out of my house.”

“Why were you kicked out of your house?”

“I was sent to the principal’s office.”

“Why were you sent to the principal’s office?”

“I was sitting in the hall.”

“Why were you sitting in the hall?”

“I asked a stupid question.”

“What was the stupid question?”

“What are purple flowers?”

“Johnny, you’re fired.”

Johnny is now both homeless and unemployed. He has no money, no supplies, nothing. He sits next to a hobo on the side of the road. The hobo looks at him and goes, “What’s a kid like you doing sitting out here alone?”

“I got fired from McDonald’s.”

“Why were you fired from McDonald’s?”

“I got kicked out of my house.”

“Why were you kicked out of your house?”

“I was sent to the principal’s office.”

“Why were you sent to the principal’s office?”

“I was sitting in the hall.”

“Why were you sitting in the hall?”

“I asked a stupid question.”

“What was the stupid question?”

“What are purple flowers?”

“Oh, you know what? I heard someone talking about purple flowers just a few minutes ago,” says the hobo. “Yeah, and he’s on the other side of the road there.” Johnny looks over and sees his brother on the other side of the road. Relieved, he goes to resolve the problem by asking the man himself. Johnny takes two eager steps onto the road and gets run over by an eighteen-wheeler.

Johnny wakes up in hell dazed and confused. His head still hurt a little. It wasn't long before he was approached by Satan himself.

""What are you doing here?"" Satan asked. ""Your so young and you don't seem to have a reason to be down here.""

Little Johnny sighed. ""Well I suppose it can't get much worse than this. I was hit by a truck.""

""Why were you hit by a truck""

“I got fired from McDonald’s.”

“Why were you fired from McDonald’s?”

“I got kicked out of my house.”

“Why were you sent to the principal’s office?”

“I was sitting in the hall.”

“Why were you sitting in the hall?”

“I asked a stupid question.”

“What was the stupid question?”

“What are purple flowers?”

""Oh, purple flowers! It's been a long time since I've heard that one."" Satan exclaimed.

""Hey, now that I'm down here forever, do you mind telling me what purple flowers means?""

""Oh purple flowers?"" Satan began. ""That's just something we made up to waste people's time.""

A theologician from a Christian university was sent to the Tiktiks to spread the word of the Bible. The Tiktik chief had quickly learned the English language after first contact, and acted as a translator when the theologician held his sermon to the tribe.

He started out by telling about the old Jewish prophecies and the birth of Jesus. Several minutes went by without an interruption from the chief, so eventually the theologician stopped and asked the chief to translate what he had said. The chief raised his hands, turned to his tribe, and said onle one word: ""I'esua!"". The tribe erupted in thunderous applause and cheering. After it had died down, everybody looked back at the theologician, obviously waiting for him to continue.
""Is that all?"" whispered the theologician. 
""Tiktik is a very dense language,"" replied the chief. ""We can tell long stories in short sentences. Continue the sermon, please"".

So the theologician continued his story, and told of Jesus' life and his miracles. He had got all the way to the last supper without an interruption, so he felt it was time for some translation again. Once again, the chief raised his arms, turned to his tribe, and said ""Qhuoong I'esua!"" Once again, the thunderous applause followed by a silence of total anticipation.

The theologician continued, telling of Jesus' death and resurrection. At the end of his sermon, he indicated for the chief to translate. The chief turned to his tribe again, raised his arms and said ""Tano Qhuoong I'esua!"". The applause and cheering lasted for several minutes. 

To reduce the risk of spreading diseases, the theologician had to return to his university after that one session. But he kept wondering about the Tiktik language, and what the words he had heard could mean. Was Iesua = Jesus? Could the gospel had spread by its own to the Tiktiks, in their isolated jungle? Was that why the summary had been so short? The chief was just telling them they knew the story already?

Half a year later, the theologician noticed that a young girl from the Tiktik tribe had enrolled at the university. Excited, he summoned her to his office to get a proper translation of the chief's words.

""That does 'Tano' mean in Tiktik?"" he asked her. 

""Tiktik is a very dense language,"" she replied. ""And that word has many meanings. 'Tano' can mean... 'enormous', or 'supreme', or 'really really much'. It is difficult to translate.""

""What about 'Qhuoong'?"" the theologician asked. 

""Another difficult word! 'Great', perhaps. Or 'total'. 'All-encompassing'. Something like that. In English you have so many words for the same meaning.""

""And ... what about 'I'esua'?"" he asked, excited. ""What does that word mean?""

Her face brightened. ""That word is easy! It means 'cow poop'!""",A theologician went to an isolated tribe...,5

One day the chief of police came to ask for his assistance:

""Apparently even us policemen aren't immune to the flu as a lot of our employees have called in sick. If you'd like a little change in your usual job, here's the chance, we could really use a good man like you guarding the cells tonight.""

""I'm on it, sir!"" Lee replied excitedly.

As he made his way down to the cells that night, he noticed only one cell was occupied at the moment. Some guy was caught drinking in the nearby park, scaring the kids around him.

Officer Lee stood by the cell door for what seemed like hours, but he wasn't complaining as it still beat his usual desk job.

Suddenly he heard a voice coming from behind him:

""Earl is that you?"" said the drunken man.
""It's me, Ken Bernard, from high school! Haven't heard from you in ages. Listen to me, you've got to help me out. Remember years ago when I introduced you to your wife and you said you'd owe me a favor? I'd like to cash in that favor right now, let me out and we're even.""

Hesitant at first, knowing this might be the last time seeing Ken, Lee decided to help out his former friend, for he never backed out of his promises.

After unlocking the cell door, Lee helped his old friend escape. Knowing well he'd be in trouble after the chief found out what he'd done, Lee panicked and fled the scene of the crime.

Another officer came by the cells to check how Lee was doing, and noticed the empty cell with no sign of Lee around. He rushed to the chief's office.

""Chief! It seems Officer Lee has helped an inmate escape, and also left the station without permission.""

""We have a serious lack of manpower already, didn't need one to go rogue"" said the chief. ""It's a busy night, I don't think we can go after him until dawn.""

The chief and the reporting officer stood in silence pondering the situation until the chief asked the officer for his opinion:

""What shall we do with the drunk-Ken's jailer, Earl Lee, in the morning?""",The tale of officer Lee,1

Day 983 of my captivity.

My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets.

Two minutes after they land on shore, they are jumped by an amazon tribal group. They say “You have trespassed on our sacred burial ground. We must now take you back to our council in order to decide your punishment.”

When they get to the tribe, there are many people standing around and the travelers come up to the largest man with a feathery hat. He says, “The council has decided that you will die for the crimes you have committed. And we will skin you in order to turn you men into our canoes for traveling the amazon river.

Day 983 of my captivity.

My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets. Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength.

The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an Attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet. Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates my capabilities. However, they merely made condescending comments about what a “good little hunter” I am. Fools!

There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of “allergies.” I must learn what this means, and how to use it to my advantage.

Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow, but at the top of the stairs.

I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and Snitches. The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released, and seems to be more than willing to return.

Both his parents died in a car accident when he was just a little boy. He spent his whole childhood in different foster homes, unable to afford any games and living in poverty. One day, as he spent the afternoon begging on the street, he heard a man playing on his harmonica. Fascinated by the sound he never witnessed before, Josef approached the man and asked if he may try to play this instrument as well. The Man let him play, and it was the first time in his whole life that Josef was truly happy. The next day, the same guy came to Josef an donated a harmonica to him. Josef practiced every day and his wounderful melodies brought joy to his foster home. One day, the director of a company walked past Josef playing on the street for a cheering crowd and decided to hire this young man full of self confidence and happiness. Now Josef is leading the company and he has married a beautiful wife, Mary. Occupying a leading role all the time, he realised that it actually helped him to relax when his wife was ordering him around. Thus his wife started shouting at him without any particular reason because she wanted to see him smile and help him relax. 
They both had forgotten about Josef's identical twin brother John. He didn't have as much luck as Josef after they got separated and was still living in poverty. When he heard about the success of his brother, he decided to swap roles with him to be able to enjoy such a glorius life as well. As Josef was on his way home from the office, John pulled him into an alley, holding a knife on his throat. He then tied Josef up and took his clothes. When John arrived at Josefs house, the wife was preparing the meal. She sensed immediatly that something was wrong because her husband was behaving differently. She decided to cheer him up by screaming at him: Why didn't you bring the tomatoes like i asked you in the morning? 
In this moment, looking into the startled face of her husband trying to find an excuse why he didn't buy tomatoes, Mary realised that the man standing in front of her was actually not her husband.

The letter read:
Dear God,
I am an 83 year old widow, living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had £100 in it, which was all the money I had until my next pension cheque.
Next Sunday is Christmas, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner.
Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with. I have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope.
Can you please help me?
Sincerely,
Edna

The postal worker was touched. He showed the letter to all the other workers. Each one dug into his or her wallet and came up with a few pounds. By the time he made the rounds, he had collected £96, which they put into an envelope and sent to the woman.
The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of Edna and the dinner she would be able to share with her friends.
Christmas came and went.

A few days later, another letter came from the same old lady to God.
All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened.
It read:
Dear God, 
How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your gift of love, I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day and I told my friends of your wonderful gift.
By the way, there was £4 missing.

One night, Nancy and Polly decided to try out ""Uwa"", a new club down the street.  Neither of them were heavy drinkers, but after chatting with Sam the bartender they decided to order a pair of O/P beers, the house specialty.  A few minutes later a pair of Belgians, Kas and Pohar, slid up next to them from the far side of the bar, and the four of them become aquainted. They remained together most of the night, when suddenly the pair of women stood up without a word and headed for the exit.  Perturbed, Kas calls out, ""Hey! We're just a little drunk"".  Nancy turns around, shocked, ""You say nothing all night - suddenly you can talk?"". Pohar commiserates to Kas, ""Bah, let them go, we're totally wasted"".  Sam looked up from the glasses in front of him and motioned the confused Polly aside, whispering, ""You know, this wouldn't have happened if you gals had drank more than half"".",Heavyhanded and lightheaded,0

The man kneels down beside her. 

“Are you sure? I don’t mean to intrude, but I can’t help noticing the tears. Is there anything I can do for you?”

The woman starts crying even harder, but eventually speaks. 

“The truth is, I’m 25 years old and I’ve never been hugged by any man besides my father. I’m afraid I will never feel the strong arms of anyone else embrace me. No man could ever love a woman without arms and legs.”

The man smiles and leans in a little closer. 

“You are a beautiful young woman, I think any man would be lucky to have you. But if you’d like, I can give you a hug.”

The young woman’s eyes light up and she nods her head yes. So the man leans in, wraps her in his arms and gives her a long, caring hug. As he’s hugging her she starts to cry again. He lets her go and leans back a bit to look at her. 

“What’s wrong,” he asks, “did I squeeze you too tightly?”

“No no!” she exclaims, “it was lovely! It’s just that, well, I’m 25 years old and no man has ever kissed me. Who would want to kiss a woman with no arms and legs?”

The man, never one to turn down an opportunity to soothe a hurting heart, leans down and gives the young woman a long, passionate kiss. When the kiss ends, he stands to leave. But the woman begins to cry again. So he leans back down. 

“Was the kiss not to your liking?”

“No, it was,” she sighs, “it’s only that, well, I don’t want to be too forward, and you’ve already done so much for me... but, having no arms and legs, I’ve always been afraid I’d die a virgin. For so long now I’ve been wanting to be fucked by a man on the beach at sunset, and well...” her voice trails off. 

The mans eyes light up. 

“Of course I will!” The man exclaims, “I’ll fuck you!”

“Spend $100 or more and get a free 20 pound or less frozen turkey, while supplies last.

That was the promotion our store ran every Thanksgiving for the last 17 years. Well, for as long as I’ve been here, that is.

But not this year

This year, we’re not running a promotion. I really can’t blame them, after what happened last year

My stomach still gets queasy, just thinking about it.

First off, my name’s Jim, I’m the Meat Manager here at Barnaby’s. I saw it the whole thing.

It was two days before Thanksgiving, I was working the morning shift, like I always do

It was around 11 o’clock, I’d say.

We just received our truck, but unfortunately, the turkeys we ordered, were out of stock from the warehouse. For those of you that don’t know what that means, it means the warehouse didn’t have any to send us.

“Shit!!! This isn’t good.”, I said to myself.

I want to the case to see how many we had left. All we had was one. One lone turkey.

“Fuck!!!”

Then it happened.

From opposite ends of the aisle came two women. One, an older Asian women and Two, a younger blonde, Barbie wannabe.

They both arrived at this case at the same time. I informed them that this was the last turkey we had due to the warehouse issue.

Their eyes widened with fear and shock as they both turned to the freezer case door.

The Asian women grabbed the door and flung it open, hitting “Barbie” in the face and knocking her back. “Barbie” screamed like some kind of demon, charged and grabbed “Asian” by the hair, spinning her around, and slamming her head first into the adjacent glass freezer case door, Nearly missing a small child that stood with her mother in the aisle. She grabbed her kid and ran.

Now, Barnaby’s is a very old store, we still have actual glass freezer doors.

Anyway, a few seconds went by and “Asian” crawled out of the case and turned. Pieces of glass were stuck in her face, arms and her neck, she was bleeding like a pig.

She pulled the rather large piece of glass from her neck, holding it in her hand, blood dripping. She tried covering the wound with her other hand, but blood was just gushing out from between her fingers.

I swear to God, I almost puked all over myself.

Anyway, she screamed, and charged “Barbie” as she was lifting the turkey out of the case. She drove that piece of glass directly into “Barbie’s” heart, knocking back against the freezer case door.

“Barbie” coughed up blood and spewed it right in “Asian’s” face as she screamed in pain.

Then, in slow motion, both fell to the floor. As well as the turkey, which rolled halfway down the aisle.

Blood everywhere!!

People screaming and running. One guy tried to jump over them but slipped in the blood and face planted right into an abandoned shopping cart

I’m sorry, but that shit was funny

He was okay though. He got up and staggered away.

We are trained NOT to interfere with robbers, shoplifters, and even fights such as this. So I just stood there.

I guess one of the customers, who wasn’t videotaping on their phones or a manager or someone called the cops. They showed up and closed the store down.

The paramedics showed up, did their thing, as the employees moved any customers up to the front for checkout.

As I was walking back through the store to make sure there were no more customers, I saw the paramedics covering the bodies with white sheets.

They died, right there, in Aisle 12.

I saw the turkey still laying there on the floor, still frozen. I picked it up, as I needed one myself, take it to the front, paid for it, gave the cops my statement, and brought it home to me family

My wife cooked it up, and we had a amazing Thanksgiving dinner

The best part was the turkey, though.

Yeah....that thing was to die for.",The Promotion (long),6

After a lengthy search, the Ranger tracked the bandit to his favorite cantina and snuck up  behind him.  At the sound of the Ranger's guns cocking and preparing to fire, the surprised bandit  sped around only to see both of the Ranger's six-shooters bearing down on him. The Ranger announced,  ""You're under arrest! Tell me where you hid the loot or I'll drop you where you stand,"" his finger  becoming itchy on the trigger.  However, the bandit didn't speak English and the Ranger didn't speak  Spanish.  Fortunately for the Ranger, a bilingual lawyer was present in the cantina and translated the  Ranger's demand to the bandit.  The terrified bandit blurted out, in Spanish, that the loot was buried  next to an old oak tree behind the cantina.  ""What did he say, what did he say?"", the Ranger hurriedly  asked.  To which the lawyer replied, ""Well, the best I can make out he said ... **DRAW!**""  ","A Mexican bandit made a specialty of crossing the Rio Grande from time to time, robbing banks in Texas. Finally, a reward was offered for his capture, DEAD or ALIVE!",41
