Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.

 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.

 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.

 

&amp;#x200B;

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,2

Director: Haha that was a funny joke with a great setup and punchline that’s sure to amuse a lot of people, with potential for remakes and remasters! I can’t wait for this to hit the big screens!
Now, to the editing room!

[Joke Pre-release Interview]

Interviewer: So the joke is one month away from release. How do you feel?

Director: Oh, gosh. I can’t find it in me to express how excited, ecstatic and nervous I am. It’s a hodge-podge of intense emotions. 

Interviewer: You must be so used to this by now. Your joke premieres are massive events and it’s no overstatement to say that you’ve got millions of fans across the world.

Director: Believe me when I say this. I will never get used to this. As long as I care about what I put out there, I’ll always worry if I’m missing the mark.

Interviewer: I’ve always wanted to ask. How do you do it? I mean, this is a tough job, making people laugh. It’s always a hit or miss thing. And when you fail, it’s the worst feeling in the world. How do you find comedy amidst all these emotions?

Director: Oh, it’s this amazing process. It begins with me looking at my comedic idols and taking their work. I then keep the exact same thing, pretty it up (if needed) and I repurpose it for my own vision. What’s sweet and cool is that it actually works and you’re able to make so many people laugh.

Interviewer: That was wonderful insight, I’m pretty sure you’re all out there taking notes!

Director, it has been an absolute pleasure chatting with you. We cannot wait to see what you have in store for us.

Director: I cannot wait to see your reactions!

[Joke premiere]

(Joke has now begun)

A guy asks his friend “What’s relationship like with your sex robot?”

So his friend responded, in a disappointed tone.

“Oh, it’s.........”

(Audience stares wide eyed in anticipation)

“......it’s......”

So, he opens the box and picks up the letter. He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong.

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk. “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”",A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,1

He gave The Grinch a swift kick and got him away from the tree. The Grinch fell to the ground and scurried off. After another fifteen minutes, The Grinch put on a fake mustache and trenchcoat in the hopes of getting close enough to the three, but his The Grinch costume gave him away in an instant and Vittore scared him off. 

Finally the time had come for the judges and camera crew to make their way to Vittore's tree. He was watching them intently but failed to notice the Grinch sneaking up to the tree. By the time Vittore noticed him, it was too late. The Grinch had grabbed a taco and stuffed it into his mouth. And even more unfortunately, he had grabbed a lode-bearing taco and the entire tree came crumbling down into a big taco heap.

The judges arrived just in time to see Vittore's ruined taco tree. One of them approached Vittore to inquire as to how this took place.

Now, he removes one leg and says ""Spider, come"" and the spider walks to him without a problem. The scientist writes down ""With 7 legs, the spider responds to my call""

Then, he removes another leg and asks for the spider to come, and the spider walks to him struggling a little but. The scientist writes down ""With 6 legs, the spider responds to my call""

He removes the third leg and calls the spider, which, suffering, goes towards him. The scientist writes down ""With 5 legs, the spider responds to my call""

Now, he removes a fourth leg and says ""Spider, come"" and the spider manages to get to him. The scientist writes down ""With 4 legs, the spider responds to my call""

Then, he removes another leg and calls the spider, which struggles a lot yet manages to reach him. The scientist writes down ""With 3 legs, the spider responds to my call""

He removes an sixth leg and says ""Spider, come"" and, miraculously, the spider gets to the scientist. The scientist writes down ""With 2 legs, the spider responds to my call""

When Chuck got back home, he had a giant smile on his face.  His father, kind of in shock, asks him how it went, as a dollar barely gets you a halfhearted handjob.  So he says, ""How'd it go?""

He crawls to the object, pulls it out of the ground and discovers what looks to be an old briefcase. He opens it and out pops a genie. 

But this is no ordinary genie. She is wearing an IRS ID badge and a dull grey dress. There's a calculator in her pocketbook.

She has a pencil tucked behind one ear. 'Well, cowboy,' says the genie, 'You know how I work....You have three wishes.' 

'I'm not falling for this,' said the cowboy, 'I'm not going to trust an IRS genie.' 

'What do you have to lose? You've got no transportation, and it looks like you're a goner anyway!' 

The cowboy thinks about this for a minute and decides that the genie is right. 

'OK! I wish I were along-side a lush spring with plenty of food and
drink.' 

--POOF--
The cowboy finds himself beside the most beautiful spring he has ever seen, and he's surrounded with jugs of wine and platters of delicacies. 

'OK, cowpoke, what's your second wish.' 
'My second wish is that I was rich...beyond my wildest dreams.' 

--POOF--
The cowboy finds himself surrounded by treasure chests filled with rare gold coins and precious gems. 

'OK, cowpuncher, you have just one more wish. 
Better make it a good one!' 

After thinking for a few minutes, the cowboy says, 'I wish that no matter where I go, beautiful women will want and need me.'

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know.

If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?

The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk. The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.

The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.

The monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.

He says, Real funny. May I have the key? The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.

The man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end .

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But he can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk

There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living...,7

One day the two were playing, when the horse fell into a bog and began to sink. 

Scared for his life, the horse whinnied for the chicken to go get the farmer for help! 

Off the chicken ran, back to the farm.. Arriving at the farm, he searched and searched for the farmer, but to no avail, for he had gone to town with the only tractor. 

Running around, the chicken spied the farmer's new Harley. 

Finding the keys in the ignition, the chicken sped off with a length of rope hoping he still had time to save his friend's life. 

Back at the bog, the horse was surprised, but happy, to see the chicken arrive on the shiny Harley, and he managed to get a hold of the loop of rope the chicken tossed to him. 

After tying the other end to the rear bumper of the farmer's bike, the chicken then drove slowly forward and, with the aid of the powerful bike, rescued the horse! 

Happy and proud, the chicken rode the Harley back to the farmhouse, and the farmer was none the wiser when he returned. 

The friendship between the two animals was cemented: Best Buddies, Best Pals. 

A few weeks later, the chicken fell in to a mud pit, and soon, he too, began to sink and cried out to the horse to save his life! 

The horse thought a moment, walked over, and straddled the large puddle. 

Looking underneath, he told the chicken to grab his hangy-down thingy and he would then lift him out of the pit. 

The chicken got a good grip, and the horse pulled him up and out, saving his life.

""What's wrong ma'am?"" He inquired earnestly.

""Well you see, I was born like this, and because of it I've never gotten close to a man, I've never even hugged one.""

The man contemplates this for a second before shrugging. 'What the hell.' He thinks to himself, so without saying a word he picks her up and gives her a great big hug, and then gently sets her down.

""There, I hope that makes your day at least a little bit better."" He says, before starting to walk away.

However he only gets about 5 feet away before he can hear her start to cry again.

""Aw, now what's wrong darling?"" He asks

""Well, since I had never hugged a man, obviously I've never been kissed either.."" she answered sheepishly.

The man thinks for a moment again, before again coming to the conclusion that why not? So this time he walks up to her and stoops down, puts his hand on her cheek and gives her a deep and passionate kiss. He then stands back up and takes a step back.

"" Alright, well I've really got to be going now, but again, I hope that helps"" he said as he again started to walk away.

This time he gets about ten feet away before he hears her crying again, this time quite loudly. The man sighs to himself, getting quite annoyed, but not wanting to see a woman cry, he turns around again.

""Now what's wrong??"" He says, barely keeping his voice civil.

""Well since I'd never even been kissed, obviously no one has ever wanted to make love to me."" She replied, tears still streaming down her face.

This caused the man to really think, he barely knew this woman, and he was definitely going to be late if he gave in to this latest request. However he couldn't stand to see her so sad, so finally he walked over to her and picked her up.

""Dont worry honey, I'll take care of you"" he said with a wink.

So the man took her out into the water, going just deep enough for the ocean to help make her buoyant. He looked deeply into her eyes kissed her again and said:

""Baby, I know you want me to make love to you.."" he whispered to her.

Suddenly the man shoved her away, further into the water.

""Well you're fucked now!""","A man is walking down the beach,",8

As he approached the first stop on his route he could see some poor soul laying on the bench. He stopped the bus, opened the doors and called out to the soaking wet person laying there.

""Hey, buddy!"" The guy sat up and looked as wet and cold as he was drunk. ""Hey fella, get outta the rain and on the bus.""

""I can't"", mumbled the drunk, ""I don't haff any money.""

""Nevermind that, get on the bus"", said the driver kindly. So the drunk staggers up the steps and plonks down in the seat across from the driver. He looked so bedraggled and sad that the driver wanted to make him feel at least a little bit happier.

So he says to the drunk, ""Hey, buddy, hey watch this!""

He stops the bus and a sour-looking older woman gets on, shaking her umbrella. She deposits her fare, and as she goes past the driver, he says, ""Tickle your c#nt with a feather?""

The woman wheels around, ""What did you say?!!""

The driver answers, ""Typical country weather....Don't you agree?""

The woman is red-faced and embarrassed at what she thought she heard and mumbles yes, she agrees and sits herself well down the back.

The drunk is smiling a bit, so the driver knows its having a positive effect. ""Watch this one"", he says.

Sure enough, at the next stop another woman gets on. She looks like she's never cracked a smile in her life. As she drops in her fare and starts to move past the driver, he mumbles, ""Tickle your snatch with a feather?""

The woman gasps and says,""I beg your pardon?!!""

To which the driver answers, ""I said typical nasty weather.""

The woman is completely shaken and apologises and agrees, yes the weather is atrocious. Then hurries to her seat.

Now the drunk is chuckling quite freely.

The driver leans over and says to the drunk, ""Why don't you do the next one?""

The drunk shakes his head, ""No, I'm too dr-dr-drunk."" ""Nah"", says the driver, ""you do this one.""

So as the bus stops, the drunk pulls himself up straight in the seat, smooths his clothes out and stares straight ahead. His face is a study in concentration. As the lady pays her fare and begins to pass by the drunk, he says in a clear, strong voice, ""SCRATCH YER C#NT WITH A STICK?""

The woman, absolutely shocked, turns to the drunk and says, ""WHAT did you say to me?!!""

So Bob the ant went around town auditioning for gigs. He let his crazy attitude go full force at the judges. They weren’t too impressed, but one venue offered him a gig for next Saturday night.
 

Bob, disappointed he didn’t get the judges to laugh as much as he wanted, shakes his head at it and reassures himself it’s a fluke and he will rock the crowd on Saturday.
 

Saturday rolls around and Bob is next to go on stage. He gets up there and starts. His act is insane and wacky. Bob the ant is going nuts. But the crowd isn’t laughing. Disappointedly, Bob walks off stage to the audience after his set to reflect on why he wasn’t so funny. As he does this, the next ant comedian walks on stage. His name is Tom, and Tom has a much more relaxed and chill vibe to him than Bob. Tom is killing it. Every sentence makes the crowd roar with laughter.

 
Confused, Bob asks the manager of the club who happened to be sitting next to him, “Hey, what makes that guy so much more funny than me?!” To which the manager replied, “The real joke is in the calm ants”

As he leaves he sees a new sign next door. ""Lose 2 pounds for $2"". He pays, enters. This time there are two gorgeous naked women in running shoes. They say ""Better start running."" He does, chasing them around the track. Two hours later he catches them. He is doubly... rewarded. On his way out the scale shows he lost 2 pounds!

The man leaves. Sure enough, next door there is a final sign: ""Lose 3 pounds for $3."" By now the fat man is exhausted and can barely walk... but he cannot resist. He pays and enters. The door slams shut behind him and locks.

Alone on the running track is a 6'4"" muscular male body builder, naked except for running shoes. The naked athlete points down at his enormous erection, smiles at the fat man and says...

""Better start running.""",A fat man sees a sign on a door: lose 1 pound for $1...,1411

Every day, I walk down the street and tell passers by what I have eaten, how I feel, what I have done the night before and what I will do for the rest of the day. I give them pictures of my wife, my daughter, my dog and me gardening and on holiday, spending time by the pool.

And it works. I already have four people following me: two police officers, a social worker, and a psychiatrist.'",Social media In real life.,34

So the pig and chicken run up to the farmers house and they bang on the door, no answer... again they bang on the door, no answer.

In a fury the chicken busts down the door and grabs the keys to the Mercedes parked out front. Then the two of them grab some rope.
The pig then drives down to the mud hole and attaches one end of the rope to the horse and the other to the bumper. 

The pig then pulls the horse out with the Mercedes.

The next day, the three of them are walking again and the chicken falls into the same hole.
The pig begins to say “I know what to do!” and begins to run back to the house, but the horse stops him and says “hold on, watch this”.

The horse then steps over the mud hole and says to the chicken, “grab hold of my penis”. The chicken complies as he doesn’t want to die in the mud hole and grabs hold of the penis and the horse pulls him out.

If I lose I may be disappointed, but if I win I will join the legendary Gods of the Pantheon!
  

So he makes his way to Zeus, excited to see what is in store for him in order to prove his worth to the Gods. Along the way, he sees dozens of noble warriors, bodybuilders and others laying on the ground, devastated. Their absolute and utter exhaustion is displayed clearly by the pools of sweat underneath them, and the sound of wheezing could be heard from over 50 yards away. The hero is now concerned, these men appear to be very strong and fit, but he is more so than all of them. A ways further and he sees Hercules, Chuck Norris, and even Atlas, who held up the sky for countless years, receiving medical attention for their hands which are shaking uncontrollably. The hero is extremely worried, and heavily considers turning back. If these great men could not best the challenge of strength, then how could I? But the prospect of becoming a god was too tempting, and he pressed forward.
  

The hero had finally reached Zeus who was holding a jar of peanut butter. ""Welcome, great hero. If you wish to become a god you must complete 4 feats of strength. Here is a jar of peanut butter. Please open the jar without using any hot water."" The hero took the jar, and while tight, presented no challenge as he opened it without a grimace.
  

""Very good"" says Zeus. ""For the next challenge, you must carry 8 bags of groceries in one trip, without dropping any or breaking the eggs."" As a man, the hero has done this countless times before, so he was not particularly worried. He picked up 4 in one hand and 4 in the other, and carried them over to Zeus's refrigerator.
  

""You give me hope, challenger! Perhaps someone will be able to complete my challenges after all. The feats increase in difficulty, of course, so be prepared for this next one! I have lodged my sword in this slab of granite. Retrieve the sword for me and I will present you the final challenge."" The hero begins to pull on the sword, and it is very difficult. He notices the sword wiggle slightly, which gives him just enough confidence to unlodge the sword using most of his might. He presents the sword to Zeus.
  

""Hero, you have completed the first 3 trials and only one remains. No mortal man has made it this far, and it is as far as Hercules, Chuck Norris, and all the great heroes have made it; but none have succeeded. Complete this, and you shall have a seat in the legendary Pantheon.

S: Sir, what's wrong?

S: Ok, I will help you, but I must warn you about something.  ""There is a special toilet that only we can use, and it has four buttons.  DO NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT press ANY of them, got it?""
Passenger: ""Yes, I got it, just get me to that freaking toilet NOW.""

""Oh, this is nice he thought"".  Then he pressed ""D"" and then felt the drying motion.  ""Hey, this is sweet, he thinks"", then he pressed ""P"" and a baby powder was emitted.  ""Now, that's living he thought to himself"" and then he pressed the ""A.R.T"" button and lights out.

post,cadbzz,2qh72,jokes,false,1562540956,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cadbzz/the_swingin_farmer/,self.jokes,,"This is a true story, inasmuch as any story is true. I once lived in a small town in a rural part of Oregon and worked as the night desk clerk at a motel just across from a truck stop. One night a customer came in wearing bib overalls over a flannel shirt and asked for a room for a couple weeks, paying all in advance.

He explained he was a nearby farmer who was having his house expanded because he had three girlfriends who were all going to move in with him. It was late at night, so I didn't mind a little conversation to break the monotony. Well, over that next couple weeks, he was a regular for our continental breakfast and we'd chat. He was a friendly enough guy, but I did notice he was a pretty heavy drinker. Some nights I knew would be dead, we'd share a fifth of bourbon in our lobby.

Well, eventually the two weeks was up, and he got a call. Since we'd gotten to be pals, he asked if I wouldn't like to come out and see the house and meet his three girlfriends. I had kind of forgotten about his swinging by that point, but I figured what the hell, why not.

We climb into his pickup, and it's a pretty good ride from my work site out to his farm. It's a pretty decent size acreage, and toward the back is a really nicely done farmhouse. We step up onto the wide porch and the front door opens to display a naked woman standing there. Just stark naked. Now that would've been pretty nice, except this girl is sorta... unfortunate-looking.

Tall, painfully skinny, stringy blonde hair. It's like somebody taught a mop to stand upright and walk around.

My friend leans down and says, ""I don't rightly remember her actual name, I jus' call her Corona.""

I didn't know what to say to that, so I kinda stumble out with, ""Because she's, uhhh... cool and refreshing?""

He laughs. ""Naw, 'cause I was drunk as hell after a case of Corona when I hooked up with 'er!""

The woman leads us into the living room, and we sit. She brings us each a nice cold beer. Just then the bedroom door opens and out comes a second woman. The farmer grins real big and I look.

Well, she's about five foot even and probably 350 pounds or more. Face like a pug, hair like a scorched tumbleweed, and a scowl that would make a rattler think twice about biting her. The farmer says, ""This here's Tequila!""

I didn't know what to even say to that except: ""Why would you name her...""

""Yup, 'at's right!"" he guffaws. ""I's blackout drunk on Patron when I hooked up with 'er!""

At this point I'm just sitting there with a thousand yard stare. And then I hear it. The sound nobody ever wants to hear, the sound everybody who's seen an old horror film knows instinctively.

From somewhere in the back of the house, the door of what could only have been a fruit cellar starts to s-l-o-w-l-y *crrrrrrrreeeeaaaak* open.

The farmer jumps up, gives out with a whoop, and yells, ""Hoooo, yer in fer a treat now, son! *Here comes Gasoline!""*",The Swingin' Farmer,0

Reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants, takes hold of the boy’s testicles and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly.

After a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the last penny, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand.

Releasing the boy’s testicles, the woman walks back to her seat at the coffee bar without saying a word, but keeps the penny.
