post,c1poft,2qh72,jokes,false,1560789121,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/c1poft/the_brown_black_and_blue_house_long/,self.jokes,,"One day in first grade, Little Timmy was super bored. His teacher blabbered on and on about seemingly random things that would supposedly be useful later in life. Little Timmy was lucky to have a window seat. Most days were spent looking out across the horizon with adventure burning throughout his veins, however, today was different. Today, he saw a small, brown, black and blue house, a house that wasn't usually there. He asked his only, and best, friend Billy, ""Billy, have you seen that weird house?""

Billy replied, ""What house?""

And Little Timmy said, ""That brown, black and blue house over there"", moving his head to direct Billy's eyes.

Immediately, Billy shunned Timmy and completely ignored him; Timmy couldn't get him to answer his question about the house, or reply at all. So, Little Timmy did all he thought he could do, and asked his teacher, ""Mrs. Teacher, what's with that house in the distance?""

Mrs. Teacher questioned, ""What house?""

Again, Little Timmy said, ""That brown, black and blue house over there"" pointing out the window.

Without hesitation, Mrs. Teacher screamed at him telling him to go to the principal's office.

Little Timmy started his perilous journey, nervous as to what the principal would do to him, and his perfect 5.0 first grade GPA. As he walked in, the principal greeted him and stated his surprise regarding Little Timmy's arrival saying, ""Little Timmy, welcome! I don't see you often enough; you're so bright, you've got a great future ahead of you! What brings you here?""

Little Timmy started, ""I was just Talking to Billy about this weird house, and then he shunned me...""

Mr. Principal said, ""That's a shame Little Timmy, but I'm still not sure why you're here.""

Little Timmy continued, ""Well, I asked Mrs. Teacher about the house and she sent me to you.

Mr. Principal asked, ""What house, Timmy?""

Little Timmy could see where this was going, and slowly let the words trickle out of his mouth, ""The brown, black and blue house"".

With a strength even Hercules would fear, Mr. Principal flipped the table and it shot through the wall, ""YOU ARE EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL... FOREVER!!!"" 

Little Timmy was in shock and quickly ran home. He flung the front door open and encountered the warm embrace of Mommy. Little Timmy had geysers shooting from his eyeballs. Sweet Mommy asked, ""My baby, Little Timmy, what's wrong? Why are you home so early? Are you okay, sweety-kins?""

Little Timmy said through a waterfall of tears, ""I got expelled from school, Mommy!""

Mommy said, ""Oh, my sweet Little Timmy, it's okay. I love you so much. I will give up every day of my life to tutor you... Just tell me, what happened?""

Little Timmy said, ""Well, I asked Billy about this house and he ignored me, and then I asked Mrs. Teacher and she sent me to Mr. Principal's office, and he sent a table through a wall, and expelled me. Just because I mentioned some house.""

""What house"", said Mommy

Little Timmy hesitated, thinking she would react as the others did, but Little Timmy knew Mommy loved him. He said with some confidence, ""The brown, black and blue house.""

Mommy burst into tears, more tears than Little Timmy's, more tears than Niagra Falls could muster if it tried, and barely squeaked out, ""Go to your room""

Timmy zipped upstairs and waited for something to happen.
And waited...
And waited..
And waited.

Until... Little Timmy's dad finally came home.

Mommy was still in tears and told Little Timmy's dad to talk to Timmy upstairs. Dad walked into Little Timmy's room and said, ""Son, Little Timmy, what did you do to your mother to leave her in this state of disarray?""

Little Timmy said, ""Well, I asked Billy about this house and he ignored me, and then I asked Mrs. Teacher and she sent me to Mr. Principal's office, and he sent a table through a wall, and expelled me, and Mommy had a mental breakdown. Just because I mentioned some house.""

""What house"", said Dad.

Little Timmy was afraid, but couldn't hide something like this from his father, ""The brown, black and blue house.""

Little Timmy could see the anger in his Dad's eyes grow. Dad's fury couldn't be contained, and Dad beat Timmy over and over and over, until Little Timmy's arm popped off. Dad sent Timmy out of the house, never to return. Timmy was alone, with one arm, on the street. Timmy saw some flashing red and blue lights, and ran.

""What are you running for, and why do you only have one arm?"" Said the police man.

Little Timmy said, ""Well, I asked Billy about this house and he ignored me, and then I asked Mrs. Teacher and she sent me to Mr. Principal's office, and he sent a table through a wall, and expelled me, and Mommy had a mental breakdown, and then Dad beat my arm off, and sent me away.  Just because I mentioned some house.""

""What house,"" said the police man?

""The brown, black and blue house,"" said Timmy.

And with that, the police man slapped hand cuffs on the only one of Little Timmy's arms that remained. The police man threw him into the police car, and drove him straight to Prison. Little Timmy served a 44 year sentence and never once mentioned the house. Every night, though, he would look out his prison window and look at the house. Timmy waited...
And waited...
And waited..
And waited.

Until his sentence was up
When Timmy was released, he stepped into the free world. Just past the gate, Timmy saw his old friend...
Billy.
They hugged and laughed and told each other about their lives, and Timmy ended with; ""But I still never saw what was with that weird house.""

And Billy said, ""Let's go.""

So they walked...
And walked...
And walked.. 
And walked.
Until they neared the street the house was on.
Billy and Timmy looked at each other and with joy fueling each step, they began to cross the street. 

and then they got hit by a bus;
look both ways before crossing the street",The brown black and blue house [LONG],3

The hillbilly walks over to the woman, lifts up her dress, yanks down her drawers, and quickly gives her right butt cheek a lick with his tongue.
The woman is so shocked that she has a violent spasm, and the obstruction flies out of her mouth.

A friendly local thought this was too good to be true and paid the $50 entry fee to see for himself.

As he entered, the dog started immediately:
“Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon”
“The square root of nine is three”
“France is in Europe”

The man couldn’t believe his eyes or ears as the dog kept speaking truthful phrases late into the night.

Finally, the dog curled up in the corner and went to sleep, tired from all the speaking.

The local man said to the owner: “a speaking dog is one thing, but a speaking dog that always tells the truth, it’s no wonder you’re making a fortune!”

Just as he finished his sentence, he started to hear a murmur in the corner where the dog was napping.

The dog was still muttering phrases in its sleep! The local man got closer and listened carefully

As the dog was napping, the man could hear it speaking under its breath:
“2 + 2 is 5”
“I’m a pink pussy cat”
“triangles have 4 sides”

The local man turned to the owner in absolute shock, the jig was up!

Only to see the owner holding out an offer of $5,000 in cash and said:

One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slid over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

/ till the ocean grew dim...

and the earth itself...

began to shrink...

past our moon...

and on...

and Mars...

and on...

higher, and higher...

through the asteroid belt...

and on and on towards the diving board...

past the outer planets, until...

on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...

he reached the board.

He climbed on top and radioed the captain...

and then...

.' '.

. .

. .

he jumped.

:

Slowly at first,

faster, and faster,

speeding past Pluto,

through the asteroid belt,

past Mars,

and the moon,

faster,

and faster,

faster - ever faster,

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster,

past the albatross,

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

DOWN!

THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!

THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL.........

SMASH!

Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping...

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most \*STUPENDOUS\* piece of diving I have ever seen.""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...

I'm a just poor tramp...

so you must understand...

I've been through many hard ships in my life.""",There was this tramp.,275

Dazed and confused I crawled out of the ditch to the edge of the road when a shiny new convertible pulled up with a very beautiful woman who asked, ""Are you okay?""

As I looked up, I noticed she was wearing a low cut blouse with cleavage to die for... 

""I'm okay I think,"" I replied as I pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.

She said, “Get in and I’ll take you home so I can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head.”

""That's nice of you,"" I answered, ""but I don't think my wife will like me doing that!""

""Oh, come now, I’m a nurse,"" she insisted. ""I need to see if you have any more scrapes and then treat them properly.""

Well, she was really pretty and very persuasive. Being sort of shaken and weak, I agreed, but repeated, ""I'm sure my wife won't like this.""

We arrived at her place which was just a few miles away and, after a couple of cold beers and the bandaging, I thanked her and said, ""I feel a lot better, but I know my wife is going to be really upset so I'd better go now.""

""Don't be silly!"" she said with a smile, while unbuttoning her blouse exposing the most beautiful set of boobs I’ve ever seen. ""Stay for a while. She won't know anything. By the way, where is she?""

""Still in the ditch with my Harley, I guess""","While riding my Harley, I swerved to avoid hitting a deer, lost control and landed in a ditch, severely banging my head.",55

At the station, the pastor tells his associate to have a seat while he purchases their tickets. 

After standing in line at the ticket counter for an extended period of time, he's finally next in line to purchase the tickets for himself and his associate preacher when he's greeted by an absolute bombshell of a woman working at the ticket counter. 

Being a man of God, he tried to avert his gaze from the stunning sight of her voluptuous bosom busting through her bright red, low cut top, only to be stunned again by her beautiful long brown hair, bright green eyes, and lipstick that reminded him of the low cut top which was barely containing her busty chest.

Trying not to linger too long he attempts to regain his composure, but to no avail as his eyes drift back towards her cleavage as he mumbles, ""I'll take two pickets to Tittspurgh, please."" 

As soon as the words left his mouth he realized how grievous error and fervently apologized, thoroughly flustered.

The gorgeous woman blushed and assured him that all was forgiven as the pastor quickly strode back to his associate and sat down, utterly embarrassed by the whole ordeal.

A moment later, a stranger sat down next to him and introduced himself as the man who has been behind him in line, and had witnessed the whole thing.

""Don't worry father,"" the man chimed, ""everyone misspeaks every now and again. It's nothing to be so embarrassed about. Even just this morning I had a similar incident with my wife.""

Looking a little less ashamed after hearing the stranger's kind words of encouragement, the pastor asks, ""Well, tell me my son, what happened with your wife this morning?""

""It was the darnedest thing,"" the stranger said, ""we sat down with our two boys to have breakfast this morning, and what I meant to say was, 'Honey, could you please pass the strawberry jam?' but what actually came out of my mouth was, 'You dirty bitch! You've ruined my life!'""

The pilot's story was that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation. By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn't a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying ""you-did-not-see-a-base"" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way. The day after that though, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane... Only this time there were two people in the plane. The same pilot jumped out and said, ""Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last night!""","You've all heard of the Air Force's ultra-high-security, super-secret base in Nevada, known simply as ""Area 51?""",10919

As I looked up, I noticed she was wearing a low cut blouse with cleavage to die for... ""I'm okay I think,"" I replied as I pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.

She said, “Get in and I’ll take you home so I can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head.”

""That's nice of you,"" I answered, ""but I don't think my wife will like me doing that!""

""Oh, come now, I’m a nurse,"" she insisted. ""I need to see if you have any more scrapes and then treat them properly.""

Well, she was really pretty and very persuasive. Being sort of shaken and weak, I agreed, but repeated, ""I'm sure my wife won't like this.""

We arrived at her place which was just a few miles away and, after a couple of cold beers and the bandaging, I thanked her and said, ""I feel a lot better, but I know my wife is going to be really upset so I'd better go now.""

""Don't be silly!"" she said with a smile, while unbuttoning her blouse exposing the most beautiful set of boobs I’ve ever seen. ""Stay for a while. She won't know anything. By the way, where is she?""

So the man goes to the bartender and asks why everyone is yelling numbers and the bartender explains, “well, around here we like to tell jokes. Hell, we’ve told so many jokes that we’ve heard all the jokes there are to tell, so rather than telling the joke we just assigned all the jokes a number so you just have to say the number and everyone gets the joke.”

The man thanks the bartender and goes to sit down, but he is intrigued by the idea of telling jokes by number so he yells out “number 17!”

But nobody laughs. 


He thinks it must not be a very good joke. Probably been told too many times. After all, it’s a lower number than the other jokes being told, he figures go with a higher number. 

“Number 59!

Complete silence


Well now he really doesn’t get it. He figures maybe he should try a joke he knows is good so he jumps back up

“Number 42!”

Nothing


So he goes back up to the bartender and says “man, I don’t get it. Nobody liked my jokes. I even told a joke I know is a good one, but nobody thought it was funny.”

This man, however, really wanted to become a train conductor. Unfortunately, he gets the job and he loves it. But one particular day, he’s enjoying his job a little too much. He’s driving too fast and accidentally derails the train, killing a passenger! 

Bulgaria takes him to court and they find him guilty, sentencing him to death by electrical chair. They ask for his last words and his last meal. He didn’t have much to say, but he did ask for one banana. The executioner, surprised, gave him his banana and sat him down. He pulls the lever, sparks fly and smoke fills the room, and as it clears, he’s still sitting there..

Now, at the time Bulgaria had this superstition: if someone lives their death sentence, it has to be a sign from God. He gets a second chance and he’s back to driving trains.

He’s happy as can be, celebrating his life and things going back to normal. He had a few drinks on the job, derails and kills 2 passengers this time. He goes back to court, same deal, found guilty and sentenced to the electric chair. They ask for his last words, and once again he doesn’t have anything to say, but asks for 2 bananas this time. Now feeling a bit suspicious, they give him his bananas anyway. Flip the lever, smoke fills the room and sparks fly.. and to their amazement, he’s still sitting there. 

Third times the charm right? Well, I guess this guy doesn’t learn his lessons. As you might’ve guessed, he killed 3 this time. The court is fed up with the guy, the people are outraged. “No more of this, screw the court system, screw your last words and your last bananas.” The executioner tells him while cranking up the voltage. He flips the switch, and after the smoke settles, he’s STILL sitting there. 

They’re dumbfounded, the nation is in shock (hehe). When they ask him how he’s doing it he replies, “well, the bananas didn’t have anything to do with it... I’m just a bad conductor!”",The Bulgarian Train Conductor,77

The night of the party arrives and the first guests were two lawyers dressed in head-to-toe green. When the man asks what their outfits mean, they reply, “We’re green with envy about your recent financial success!”. Pleased with the answer, the man waves them inside. 

The next couple to arrive were teachers at the nearby elementary school. Their bodies were completely covered in pink feathers. The man amusedly inquires what emotion the feathers represent. In unison they chime, “We’re tickled pink that you’re so wealthy now!”. Sharing a chuckle, he lets them into the party. 

The third duo to show up on the man’s doorstep were two notoriously vacuous gangsters nearly as naked as their first birthday. Shocked, the man asks why they are completely nude except for one of them having a piece of fruit on his penis, and the other with his manhood in a bowl of gloop.

I was still in college, so on a long weekend, I loaded all the guys I could in my car, drove the 11 hours home. We borrowed a truck, backed it right up, and tried to lift it. We couldn’t move it.

So I called in all the old high school friends I could reach. It still wouldn’t budge.

So we get scientific, try to wedge a metal beam from the garage under it, and slip an old tool chest in as a fulcrum, hoping to pry it loose. The beam bends, and the tool chest actually snaps.

By now, it’s been a few hours, most of the group is ready to give up, and the pizza and drinks I’d offered and running out, when I see Nate pull in next door. He was our neighbor’s son, rarely showed up to visit her, but felt like a godsend at that moment.

I convinced myself one more man would make a difference, which seems a little less crazy when you know Nate. He’s 6’8"", and pure muscle. He holds back when shaking hands so he doesn’t hurt people, and still feels like he’s going to crush you hand. He grabbed me by the arm to pull me out of the way of a speeding car once, and they had to put the arm in a cast, because his grip broke it. Saved my life at least. Plus, Nate is a landscaper, and I figured he might have trick to help us.

So I thought with everyone and Nate, we got this. I ask Nate for help with the boulder, start waving everyone else over. Only Nate doesn’t wait for us. He just grabs the boulder and pops it up into the truck.

And that’s how I learned a valuable lesson: better Nate than lever.

The woman was mortified, ""Grandmother"" she said., you are 97 years old that is way too old to be having sex. Her grandmother said, ""I'm well aware of my age my dear and your grandfather and I had it figured out."" 

We still loved each other and wanted to make love as much as we could but because of our age we would only have sex on Sundays when we could hear the church bells, 

The bells would help your grandfather keep a steady pace and not over exert himself, he would listen to the bells while we made love, and he would go in on the Ding and out on the Dong 

The grandmother then let out a long sigh and said

A couple of days pass by and he manages to find a job as a lumberjack. Only problem is, it's is a live-in position. Since the forest is located on the outskirts of the city, the man would be required to move out to the log cabin there and stay on premises for weeks on end. Seeing as he had no choice, he decided to take the job offer.

When the man gets to the cabin, he sees that there are other male lumberjacks there, but no women. He starts working and continues doing so for the next couple of days without exchanging much words with anyone.

After a week passed, the man goes to his boss and asks:

""say, why aren't there any women around here? I don't know how you guys deal with it. I'm going crazy from being so horny, what's a man supposed to do?""

The supervisor looks at him and says:

""There's a big hollow tree in the yard, that has a perfectly shaped hole in it. We call it the fucking tree. We all have our way with it. Why don't you go give it a shot tonight?""

The man couldn't believe what he heard but decided to go along with it anyway. Later that night, the man got extremely horny and decided to give it a shot. He cautiously walked to the yard, making sure that nobody saw him as he was making his way there. Once he got to the tree, he took his pants off and reluctantly stuck his dick inside the hole. He couldn't believe how good it felt! He continued pounding the tree for a few minutes until he eventually came.

""goddamn, that was amazing! I now understand why all the lumberjacks fuck this tree"" said the man, as he left back to his cabin.

Over the next couple of nights the man kept coming back and fucking the tree relentlessly. Each night felt just as good as the first and he couldn't get enough of it.

One night the man came back to partake in his daily routine. He proceeded to stick his dick inside, but this time he felt nothing. He took it out and tried again and again, but to no avail. The pleasure was gone.

The man angrily returned to his, supervisor's office and began yelling at him.

""what the fuck is going on? I've been pounding this tree for days and it felt great, why don't I feel anything now?""

The first boy enters and sits down. The principal asks him why he was late, to which the boy responds, ""I was throwing sticks in the lake."" The principal, new at the school, thinks to himself, ""Boy, this school sure is strict - that's not really worth an offense worth going to the principal's office over. Heck, I loved doing things like that when I was a kid!"" Pretending to be dead serious so that the boy might shape up a little, he slowly says, ""Well, knock it off and get to class on time from now on. You won't get off as easy if I see you back in here after this."" The boy furiously nods his head and practically sprints out of the office. 

As soon as the door closes, the other boy comes in after him and sits down in front of the principal's desk. The principal asks him why he's late, and he gives the exact same response - he was throwing sticks in the lake. A bit annoyed now, but understanding that the boys were just enjoying themselves together, and reminiscing on his own youth, the principal tells him, ""I'll let you off the hook this time, but go to class and come to school on time. You're here to learn - don't squander your opportunities by goofing off."" The student, now red in the face, gives a faint ""Yes"" and leaves the office. Satisfied, the principal smiles, leans back in his chair, and thinks to himself, ""These kids aren't so bad. I think I'll like it here.""

No sooner than the instant he finishes that thought, the door swings open for a third time, and a boy who looks to be about as old as the other two slowly walks into the office, soaking wet, completely disheveled and tracking mud everywhere he steps. He gets to the chair the other students sat at before him, angrily grumbles to himself, and sits down in a huff, furiously staring at the tiled floor. The principal, a bit fed up at this point, but still not wanting to be overly harsh, jokingly says, ""Let me guess: throwing sticks in the lake with your friends, and you bit off a little more than you could chew?""

Jimmy thinks for a moment and says, ""You know Dad, what I REALLY want, is a toy tractor. I just love tractors!"" His father gives a knowing smile, and responds with, ""Well, we'll see what happens come your birthday"" and heads off for the days work.

&amp;#x200B;

Jimmy's birthday comes around and lo and behold, in the morning, there's a small package at the bottom of his bed. Barely containing his excitement, he rips it open to see there's a small tractor! He runs downstairs to the playroom, and spends his morning playing with it, his mother coming in and reminding him to get ready for school. At school he can barely contain his excitement, when school ends he rushes home to play with his tractors again.

""Well, Dad, I really love the tractor that you got me last year, but can I get another one? Maybe a little different, or bigger?"" His Dad smiles knowingly again, and heads off to tend the fields.

&amp;#x200B;

Jimmy's wakes on his 6th birthday to see a package at the foot of his bed. He rips it open and finds another tractor! A little bigger, a little better. Jimmy plays with it all morning, then again after school, and again the next day.. and the next.

&amp;#x200B;

This continues through his childhood, and his teenage years. Every year the tractor at the end of the bed is a little bigger, a little better. Eventually Jimmy turns 16. He's got himself a job, fixing tractors! Jimmy loves the work, and starts using his pay to collect old tractors. He spends all his spare time playing with them, fixing them up, rebuilding the engines and using his experience to restore them to their original grandeur.

&amp;#x200B;

His hard work pays off, with his collection growing and growing until he starts a small tractor museum in his nearby town.

&amp;#x200B;

Jimmy gets a little older and after a few short relationships, finally meets a gal who seems to be right for him. Jane loves Jimmy, and he loves her. Everything is perfect, they are great for each other and eventually, Jimmy uses the proceeds from his tractor museum to buy Jane an engagement ring.

&amp;#x200B;

He takes her out to the nicest restaurant in the nearby town, and after dessert, brings out the ring for her, falling to his knees and asking her to marry him.

&amp;#x200B;

Jane looks shocked for a moment, happy and surprised. Then an odd look occurs on her face. ""Jimmy, look, you know I love you. I love you with all my heart. But I don't think I can say yes, because.. of.. well.. the tractors. I can't stand them, I can't stand the smell, the noise, or the sight of them!""

&amp;#x200B;

Jimmy takes a moment to process this, he's heartbroken in a way, but stays there for a moment, kneeling on the floor of the restaurant, and realises, Jane is far more important to him. He can find another way to make a living, and she brings him so much joy, he won't need the tractors. ""Jane, my love, it's hard for me, but I really absolutely truly love you and want to be with you. I'll get rid of the tractors"".

&amp;#x200B;

Jane jumps with excitement, ""Yes, then, yes! A hundred times yes!!""

&amp;#x200B;

Jimmy and Jane carry on with their lives, spending their spare time together planning for their wedding. Jimmy sells his collection of tractors, ending up with an incredible nest egg. Some of the tractors were very rare, collectors were delighted with them!. After setting a date for the wedding, Jimmy finally sells the last of the tractors, ends the lease on the building for the museum and is free of the tractors for good!

&amp;#x200B;

A few months later the wedding is finally here! Jimmy and Jane's family and friends all gathered in the local town hall to celebrate their union. After the ceremony and the speeches, the guests all start dancing following the bride and groom.

&amp;#x200B;

Later into the night, with everyone happy, dancing and a little tipsy, all of a sudden there is an issue with the air conditioning. The vents all start pumping dark, toxic gas into the room at an alarming rate. The guests rush to the exits, only to find the doors not working. They're all stuck, with nothing they can do.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the guests manages to crack a window a couple of inches, but all the windows are broken as well. Nobody can escape. People start lying on the floor, trying to avoid the toxic gas.

&amp;#x200B;

Jimmy looks around in shock, wondering what to do, Jane is on the floor beside him, tugging on his pants, trying to get him out of the smoke and gas.

&amp;#x200B;

Jimmy looks down at her, smiles, looks back up, and then pulls in the deepest breath he possibly can, filling his lungs. He runs to the window that the guest managed to open, then empties his lungs into the world outside. He turns into the room again and breathes in, filling his lungs, then turns and blows it all out the window.

&amp;#x200B;

Jimmy stands there, breathing in and bellowing endlessly out the window. The AC units eventually stop pumping the gas, but he keeps going, clearing the remaining gas from the room.

&amp;#x200B;

The room is finally safe, clear of the toxic gas and smoke. The guests start standing up, slowly walking towards him, coughing and spluttering, able to breathe again. Crowding around him, thanking him, hugging him and praising him. Jimmy smiles, glad he was able to save his friends, until finally one guest asks him - ""How did you DO THAT?!""

&amp;#x200B;

Jimmy looks at Jane and smiles, looks back to his family and friends and says, ""Well, I'm an ex-tractor fan"".",Jimmy's birthday present,44

But the manager clearly saw that the profits would shrink quickly and go negative soon.


The factory took a drastic step- they fired most of the adult workers and replaced them with kids with half-pay. One such kid was an 11-year-old boy named Ying Li. Ying's job was to test the MacBooks for flaws- he would press a bunch of buttons at the assembly line, a robot would then begin testing a MacBook, then he would log the results and repeat the process.


A few weeks later, a mysterious problem surfaced in the factory. Every time after the 500th test and before hitting the 1000th test, the whole system began to crash. None of the experts in the factory could point out what's wrong. The enigma of the perplexing crash soon acquired a reputation of the likes of Sherlockian mysteries. A slew of experts flew from all over the world to solve the problem. Even after weeks of all-nighters, the experts could not figure out what's causing the crash.


Eventually, they began to analyze the conditions of the entire factory exhaustively after every single test. Ying was at the assembly line pressing the buttons for the testing. He tested the 500th Macbook, then hit 501, a few hours later it was the 600th test, then 700th test and so on. 


Then, a little later, the whole system came crashing down. At that moment, an epiphanic moment, a moment of Eureka, everyone suddenly realized what went precisely wrong. They all jotted it down on their logs, the sole reason-


""It was all due to the kid, the new kid at the assembly line!

""Sure,"" the manager tells him, as he grabs a fork from the cutlery drawer he'd been cleaning and hands it to him. The homeless guy tips his hat in gesture and walks away.

post,c0xm82,2qh72,jokes,false,1560607436,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/c0xm82/the_future_of_escooters/,self.jokes,,"The next iteration of dockless, phone-activated micromobility devices — those modern miracles of transportation you can ride and park literally anywhere you want — will be a liquid-fuel rocket.

&amp;#x200B;

The name of the brand, of course, will be ROCKET.

&amp;#x200B;

To ride a ROCKET, riders will straddle the warhead between their legs like Major King Kong from “Dr. Strangelove,” controlling thrust and direction with a pair of adjustable and ergonomic plastic handles screwed into the sides of the frame.

&amp;#x200B;

Featuring a phone charger, a 15-inch LCD screen with free access to Amazon Prime Video, a six-speaker Bluetooth stereo system powered by Bose, and a high-definition camera you can link to your social media feeds, ROCKET will allow people of any age or skill level to zip around their congested cities with convenience, comfort, and style.

&amp;#x200B;

But we understand it's not enough to just create the grooviest way to get around. That's why, because of our deep commitment to environmental sustainability, ROCKET only uses carbon-free, dolphin-safe, ethically sourced hydrazine and liquid fluorine. With our proprietary propellant technology, you'll be able to reach speeds of 250 meters per second — meaning you'll never need to worry about running late or battling rush hour traffic again. (Every ROCKET will also come pre-equipped with an optional bicycle helmet and set of elbow pads to keep you safe while you scoot around town.)

&amp;#x200B;

However, we'll admit it. At ROCKET, our biggest passion is fun. That's why we're also including an optional feature for making every trip memorable — and ending it with a bang.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly before you reach your destination, you'll be able to hit the eject button located on the underside of the fuel tank to safely jettison you off your ROCKET while in flight. Now on autopilot, your ROCKET will accelerate to maximum velocity and do its best to perform stunning tricks on the streets and in the skies until it collides with an object, after which it will detonate its payload for the ultimate jaw-dropping finale.

&amp;#x200B;

You've always liked making an entrance. Now, for just an extra $2.50 added to the cost of your trip, you can saunter up nonchalantly to the spectacle and cacophony of the most dramatic fireworks display anyone but the most grizzled armed forces veterans have ever seen.

&amp;#x200B;

As with all dockless micromobility devices, customers can simply abandon the wreckage and walk away from any damage to city or private property, relying on the free labor of the community to clean up the mess. Just use our mobile app to find the closest replacement ROCKET for your next trip.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll be debuting in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Somalia, and we can't wait to give you the chance to ROCKET on your next commute.",The Future of E-Scooters,4

..after taking some time to size Jim up and decide that he can trust him, Carl tells Jim about his plan to escape.

""You see, "" Carl says ""for the first 5 years I was inside, I trained my digestive system to follow my command. Now I can eat something and it comes out broken down into it's components."" Jim is skeptical, but intrigued.

Carl continues: ""For the *last* five years, I've been swallowing pieces off my uniform. It's perfect, because the guards just think it's rats chewing on it.""

So Jim asks, ""Well, what does that have to do with me? How can I help?""

Carl says ""Well, the pieces of fabric come out as individual fibers. I figure by this time next year, we'll have enough to fashion enough rope to get over the wall. I just need you to tie the fibers.""

Jim, disgusted, says ""You have *got* to be kidding me!""

And Carl says ""I shit. You knot.""
