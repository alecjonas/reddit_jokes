However, he finds himself standing outside the gate of Heaven! Saint Peter stands before Mark and says “Welcome, Mark. We have been waiting for you.” 

Now, Mark is confused. He says to Saint Peter, “I got into Heaven? Really? No offense, but I was a dirty, rotten, son of a bitch.”

Saint Peter smiles and says, “It is not my position to question the will of God. Are you ready to come in?”

Mark continues and says, “There has to be some kind of mistake. I was a swindler. I swindled nearly every person I’ve ever met.” 
Saint Peter nods and says, “Again, it is not my position to question the will of God.” 

Mark continues and says, “I was a murderer! I’ve murdered a couple of people.” 

Saint Peter, getting frustrated, says, “I was told to let you in. I didn’t ask why. Not my choice in the matter.” 

Mark continues and says, “I was a rapist. I raped people. Are you telling me they let swindling, murdering rapists into Heaven!?” 
Saint Peter says to Mark, angrily, “You don’t think we already know all that? Are you coming in or not?”

Mark thinks and says, “I really don’t think I deserve to be here,” to which Saint Peter responds, “Fine! You can go to Hell,” then he snaps his fingers and sends Mark straight to Hell. 

Mark finds himself among a crowd. Up on a craggy cliff, Satan appears, and bellows out to the terrified masses below, “Welcome, unrepentant sinners, to eternal damnation… wait a minute, is that Mark? Who the fuck let that dirty, rotten, son of a bitch in!? You ask God for ONE favor-”

The blonde hostess answered the phone, crying, and said, “I can’t get out of the room!” Zouma can’t believe what he heard and asks,

“You can’t get out of your room? Why you can’t ?”

His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance. 

'Welcome to heaven,' says St. Peter. 'Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.' 

'No problem, just let me in,' says the senator. 

'Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from higher up. What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.' 

'Really, I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,' says the senator. 

'I'm sorry, but we have our rules.' 

And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him. 

Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people. 

They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and champagne. 

Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a good time that before he 
realizes it, it is time to go. 

Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises .. 

The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him. 

'Now it's time to visit heaven.' 

So, 24 hours pass with the senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and, 
before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns. 

'Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now choose your eternity.' 

The senator reflects for a minute, then answers: 'Well, I would never have said it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in hell.' 

So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. 

Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. 

He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above... 

The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder. 'I don't understand,' stammers the senator. 'Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drank champagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?' 

The devil looks at him, smiles and says.......

post,7yjop2,2qh72,jokes,false,1519010022,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7yjop2/voodoo_dick/,self.jokes,,"
There was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man said, ""Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. ""Except what?"" the man asked. ""Nothing, nothing."" ""C'mon, tell me! I need something!"" ""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'"" ""So what's up with this voodoo dick?"" he asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said ""Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!"" The old man replied, ""But you haven't seen what it'll do yet."" He pointed to a door and said ""Voodoo dick, the door."" The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said ""Voodoo dick, get back in your box!"" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more. ""I'll take it!"" said the businessman. The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say ""Voodoo dick, my pussy."" He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.

After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said ""Yeah, right.. Voodoo dick, my ass!""",Voodoo Dick,40

The State Police officer, chuckling, explained to her that ""22"" was the route number, not the speed limit. A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error.

""But before I let you go, Ma'am, I have to ask... Is everyone in this car ok? These women seem awfully shaken,"" the officer asked.

""Oh, they'll be all right in a minute officer. We just got off Route 119.""",The speeding ticket,37

This cow was the only means of survival for the farmer and his family.

One day the farmer goes out to feed the cow and the cow was dead.  

The farmer was so distraught he hung himself in the barn.

The farmer's wife comes out and sees the cow dead and the farmer hanging from the rafters in the barn and being overcome with grief she hangs herself next to the farmer.

The farmer's oldest son comes and sees the cow dead, the farmer dead, the farmer's wife dead and was about to kill himself as well when a small beautiful female leprechaun appeared to him.  

The leprechaun said ""Have you been having a bad day?""

The Oldest son says ""Well it appears that way""

The leprechaun tells him ""if you can make love to me 10 times in a row I'll bring your family and the cow back to life, but if you don't I'll kill you and hang you next to your parents""

So the oldest son being loyal to his family accepted the challenge, made it to 6 times in a row but he could go no farther.  The leprechaun killed him and hung him up next to his parents.

The middle son then came out of the house to see the cow dead, his dad dead, his mom dead, his older brother dead and a little leprechaun woman.  

Again the leprechaun woman says """"if you can make love to me 10 times in a row I'll bring your family and the cow back to life, but if you don't I'll kill you and hang you next to your parents and your brother""

The middle son accepted the challenge but again he failed to please the leprechaun and she killed him and hung him up next to his parents and brother.

Finally the youngest son wanders out of the house, he sees the cow dead, the dad dead, the mom dead and his two older brothers dead and a beautiful leprechaun woman.

One last time the leprechaun says """"if you can make love to me 10 times in a row I'll bring your family and the cow back to life, but if you don't I'll kill you and hang you next to your parents and brothers""

The youngest son says ""10 Times and I get all that back? What if I make love to you 15 times?""

""15 Times? the leprechaun says?  Well if you can make love to me 15 times then I'll bring your Dad back, your mom back your 2 brothers back, your cow back and get you a nice big mansion instead of your farmer's house to live in""

so the youngest son says ""Well that's all very nice but what if I make love to you 20 times in a row?""

""20 times?"" said the leprechaun.  ""Well then I'll bring your Dad back, your mom back your 2 brothers back, your cow back and get you a nice big mansion and I'll give you a huge pot of gold and you'll never want for anything ever again""

So the youngest son says ""Well, that sounds great but I'm worried.  How do I know you won't die?""

""Die?"" Said the leprechaun.  ""What makes you think I would die?""

so the youngest son says ""Well... the cow did""",The Cow Did,74

The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50
The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.
The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.
The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.
First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.
Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.
Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.
The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.
First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.
Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.
Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.
The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""
Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

The bartender is in shock, an actual horse just walked into his bar, sat down at the bar like a person, and ordered a beer in perfect English. He tells the horse,

""I'm sorry sir, I just have to go speak to my manager for a moment.""

So the bartender goes to the back, and explains the situation to his manager. The manager thinks for a moment and then says to the bartender,

""Okay look, this is a bar so go ahead and serve that horse a beer. However considering he's a horse, he probably doesn't know how much beer costs, so go ahead and charge him $50 for it.""

The bartender shrugs and goes back to the front, where the horse is still sitting, visibly watching football on the TV. The bartender gets to the bar and asks the horse,

""Okay, what'll you have?""

The horse turns back around and says,

""Gimme an IPA""

So the bartender pours him an IPA, and slides the beer across to him. He then slowly slides the $50 check across the bar to the horse. The horse picks up the check with his hooves, passively looks at it, pulls out his credit card, slowly slides it and the check back, and then calmly goes back to watching the game as he laps his beer. Now the bartender is still confused, the situation is difficult to get his head around, but he doesn't want to risk offending a 1000lb horse by asking the wrong questions. So he opts to start some small talk and says to the horse,

""You know, we don't really have too many horses coming in here.""

The horse slowly, impassively turns back around to face the bartender and replies,

They end up getting together regularly for several weeks, when the man begins to notice a small, soft lump on the underside of his penis. Immediately he goes to the doctor. After some tests, they determine that it's breast tissue caused by constant submersion in a highly estrogen-rich environment. 
Not wanting to give up his girl, he ignores the warning signs and continues to satisfy every desire his girlfriend has. After some time, she notices the tissue, which is now noticeably round and soft and even seems to he growing a nipple. She asks him about it, and he explains that he doesn't care and just wants to continue loving her. ""Why,"" she asks, ""why would you continue to do this even though this is happening?"" 
He looks her in the eyes and tenderly tells her, ""I'm a dick tit to you baby, you're a hard habit to break.""

 Billy Martin was gifted a new rifle and asked Mickey if he would take him deer hunting. Mickey told him he knew a doctor with hundreds of acres they could hunt on. Billy couldn’t wait.
 
 So they get up early one morning and drive four hours out to the place and Mickey tells Billy to wait in the car while he chatted up the doctor.

 Mickey knocks and the doctor is happy to see him and tells him that, of course, he’s welcome any time.

 Mickey thanks him and turns back toward the car when the doctor asks- 

 “But, hey, I wonder if you’d do me a little favor: out by the barn is an old mule. He’s getting pretty old and, well, darn it, I don’t have the heart to put him down. Would you do it for me on the way down?”

 “It’s the least I can do.”

 So Mickey walks back to the car and gets the idea to play a little prank on Billy.

 He gets in and acts all angry, slamming the door hard.

 “That sonofabitch! He won’t let us hunt! Can you believe it? And after we drove all this way! I tell you what I’m gonna do- You see that old mule standing there? I’m gonna walk over and shoot it to teach him a lesson!”
 
 So Mickey strolls over, puts the rifle to the animal’s head and shoots him dead. He can’t wait to turn around and see the look on Billy’s face- but all of a sudden, he hears- BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

 Mickey turns to his left, only to see Billy standing there with a smoking rifle.

When he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more. The bartender asks him, “You know, a pint goes flat after I draw it; wouldn’t you rather I draw fresh pints for you one at a time?” The fellow replies: “Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is now in America and the other, in Australia. When we all left home, we promised we’d drink this way to remember the days when we drank together.” The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there.

The fellow becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way: he orders three pints and drinks them in turn. One day, he comes in and orders two pints. All the regulars notice and fall silent, speculating about what might have happened to one of the absent brothers.

When the fellow goes back to the bar for a second round, the bartender says, “I don’t want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your great loss.” The fellow looks confused for a moment and then a light dawns in his eye and he laughs and says: “Oh, no, everyone’s fine. You see, it’s just that I’ve given up beer for Lent.”

The only problem was that none of them wanted to be the one to stick the cork in. So they bought a monkey and trained him to stick corks in bottles.

After a week or two of this, they stick the monkey in the pen with the pig and a cork, and after a minute, the monkey did what he was supposed to do. The farmers fed the pig for a month and sure enough, they won first prize. Once they got home, they realized they still had to take the cork out.

So they trained this same monkey to take corks out of bottles. They stuck the monkey in the pen with the pig, and the farmers woke up three days later in the hospital with a reporter sitting next to them. The reporter asked the first farmer, ""What is the last thing you remember?""

""Shit flying everywhere,"" the farmer replied. The reporter asked the second farmer the same question and got the same response. When she got to the third farmer and asked him what he could remember, he started crying.

He decided to try one last time to remedy his situation, and went to see a headache specialist.

The doctor said, ""Good news is I can cure your headaches.
The bad news is that it will require castration. You have
a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to
press up against the base of your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.  The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.""

Steve was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He couldn't concentrate enough to
answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the
knife.

When he left the hospital he was without a headache for
the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt
like a different person. He could make a new beginning
and live a new life. He saw a men's clothing store and
thought, ""That's what I need!  A new suit."" Steve entered
the shop and told the salesman, ""I'd like a new suit.""

The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, ""Let's
see ... size 44 long.""

Steve' laughed, ""That's right, how did you know?""

""Been in the business 60 years!""

Steve tried on the suit. It fit perfectly. As Steve
admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How
about a new shirt?""

Steve thought for a moment and then said, ""Sure.""

The salesman eyed Steve and said, ""Let's see .. 34 sleeve
and 16 and a half neck.""

Steve was surprised, ""That's right, how did you know?""

""Been in the business 60 years!""

Steve tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly. As Steve adjusted the
collar in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about new shoes?""

Steve was on a roll and said, ""Sure.""

The salesman eyed Steve's feet and said, ""Let's see...
9-1/2 E.""

Steve was astonished, ""That's right, how did you know?""

""Been in the business 60 years!""

Steve tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly. As Steve walked
comfortably around the shop the salesman asked, ""How about some new underwear?""

Steve thought for a second and said, ""Sure.""

The salesman stepped back, eyed Steve's waist and said,
""Let's see size 36.""

Steve laughed, ""Ah ha! I got you! I've worn size 32 since
I was 18 years old.""

The salesman shook his head, ""You can't wear a size 32.
A 32 underwear would press your testicles up against the
base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.""",One Hell of a Headache (long),0

She puts on her dressing gown and goes downstairs to look for him.

She finds him sitting at the kitchen table with a hot cup coffee in front of him. 

He appears to be in deep thought, just staring at the wall.

She watches as he wipes a tear from his eye and takes a sip of his coffee...

'What's the matter, dear?' she whispers as she steps into the room.

The husband looks up from his coffee, 'I am just remembering when we first met 20 years ago and started dating. Do you remember back then?' he says solemnly.

The wife is touched to tears thinking that her husband is so caring, so sensitive. 

'Yes, I do' she replies.

The husband pauses. The words were not coming easily.

'Do you remember when your father caught us in my car?'
'Yes, I remember!' said the wife, lowering herself into a chair beside him.

The husband continues. 'Do you remember when he shoved the shotgun in my face and said:
 'Either you marry my daughter, or I will send you to jail for 20 years?'

'I remember that too' she replies softly.

He wipes another tear from his cheek and says...

""I would have been released today..!!!""",Nostalgia over a past date,4
