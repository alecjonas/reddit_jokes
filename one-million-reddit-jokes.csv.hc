The wind was slicing through bringing the Soviet air russian across the deck. The waves towered higher and higher as the night grew darker. Fear began to set in. We had lost our way, the instruments had frozen and we were now sailing on a prayer and a hope for something on the horizon. 

Suddenly, there was something, but it wasn’t on the horizon. A small rocky island way too close to avoid. Our ship struck it and I was hurtled into the frigid waters. I was helpless. Drifting off away from the ship, floating on a bouy that had fallen off in the crash. 

Hours went by and my strength left me. I slipped off the bouy and down into the sea. I didn’t fall far before I felt ground! I bounced up to the surface, and frantically started swimming to a hazy shore through the rain pelting me. I dragged myself onto the rocky beach with my last ounce of strength. I could breathe. I had made it to land. 

As I lay there, floating in and out of consciousness, I figured I was still destined to die. My vision was blurred, and I couldn’t blink enough to clear it up again. I opened my eyes one last time.... and a man was running towards me. I couldn’t make out if he was real or not. He ran closer.... he was wearing spectacles, he looked like some sort of doctor... I blink again, he was gone. 

I closed my eyes figuring I was seeing things, but when I opened them he was there again! Closer this time, and holding a piece of paper with a bunch of letters on them... He frantically pointed at them, yelling out “what do you see!?” I blinked again, he was gone. Where did he go? 

I worried I was going crazy! I wondered if I was losing my grip or if I was actually seeing an Optical Aleutian.

The prostitute immediately demanded the balance and threatened to sue if she didn't get it.   ""That's a laugh!"" the man stated, ""I'd like to see you try.""  A few days later the man was surprised to receive a  summons ordering him to appear in court as a defendant in a lawsuit.  The man hurried to his lawyer's office and  explained the details of the case.  His lawyer said, ""She can't possibly get a judgment against you on such grounds,  but it will be interesting to see how she presents her case.""  After the usual preliminaries, the parties appeared in  court ready for trial.

    The prostitute's lawyer addressed the court first, ""Your Honor, my client, this lady here, is the  owner of a piece of property, a garden spot surrounded by a profuse growth of shrubbery, which property she agreed to  rent to the defendant for a specific length of time for the sum of $500.00.  The defendant obtained exclusive possession  of the property, using it extensively for the purpose for which it was rented.  However, upon evacuating the premises,  he paid only one-half of the amount agreed upon.  The rent was not excessive since it is restricted and exclusive property  and we ask that judgment be granted for plaintiff and against defendant in the amount of $250.00.

    The defendant's lawyer, thrown back by what he  had just heard, pondered the opening remarks for a moment  and stood to present his off-the-cuff version of the case, ""Your Honor,  my client agrees that the young lady has a fine piece of property, and  that  he rented such property for a period of time, and that he even derived a  degree of pleasure from the transaction.  However, my client  found a well on the property upon which he placed his own stones, sunk a  shaft, and erected a pump.  All equipment belonging  to my client and all labor being performed by him.  We allege that these  improvements to the property were sufficient to effect  an offset of the unpaid portion of rent and further allege that the  plaintiff was adequately compensated for the fair market rental value of  such  property.  We, therefore, ask that judgment not be granted for plaintiff  and that the defendant be awarded his attorney's fees  and costs incurred in the defense of this frivolous action.""

    The prostitute's lawyer replied, ""If it pleases  the court your Honor, my client agrees that the defendant did find a  well on  the property, and that he made the improvements to the property as  alleged.  However, had the defendant not known the well existed, he  would  have never rented the property.  Furthermore, upon evacuating the  premises, the defendant removed the stones, pulled out the shaft,  and took the pump with him.  In doing so, he not only dragged his  equipment through the well-manicured shrubbery, but left the well with a   hole much larger than it was prior to his occupancy, making it easily  accessible to small children, thereby creating a possible  danger to the health and general welfare of the public.  We, therefore,  ask that judgment be granted as requested in the complaint.

“Did you get that for your birthday?” – asked Johnny.

“Nope.” – replied Jimmy. “Well, did you get it for Christmas then?”

Again Jimmy said “Nope.” “You didn’t steal it, did you?” – asked Johnny.

“No,” said Jimmy. “I went into Mom and Dad’s bedroom the other night when they were ‘doing the nasty’. Dad gave me his watch to get rid of me.”

Johnny was extremely impressed with this idea, and extremely jealous of Jimmy’s new watch. 
He vowed to get one for himself. That night, he waited outside his parents’ bedroom until he heard the unmistakable noises of lovemaking.

Just then, he swung the door wide open and boldly strode into the bedroom. 

His father, caught in act, turned and said angrily. “What do you want now?”

 “I wanna watch,” Johnny replied.

Without missing a beat, his father said, “Fine. Stand in the corner and watch, but keep quiet.”

One of them picks it up, rubs it, and out pops a Genie.

It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.

First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.

Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed."" Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

They would get together two or three times a week for coffee and to talk shop.   
One  day, someone made the comment that preaching to people isn't really all  that hard. A real challenge would be to preach to a bear.   
One thing  led to another and they decided to do an experiment. They would all go  out into the woods, find a bear, preach to it, and attempt to convert  it.   


Seven days later, they're all together to discuss the  experience. Father Flannery, who has his arm in a sling, is on crutches,  and has various bandages on his body and limbs, goes first.   
""Well,""  he says, ""I went into the woods to find me a bear. And when I found him  I began to read to him from the Catechism. Well, that bear wanted  nothing to do with me and began to slap me around. So I quickly grabbed  my holy water, sprinkled him and, Holy Mary Mother of God, he became as  gentle a lamb. The bishop is coming out next week to give him first  communion and confirmation.""   


Reverend Billy Bob spoke next. He  was in a wheelchair, with an arm and both legs in casts, and an IV drip.  In his best fire and brimstone oratory he claimed, "" WELL brothers, you  KNOW that we don't sprinkle! I went out and I FOUND me a bear. And then  I began to read to my bear from God's HOLY WORD!

So I quick DUNKED him and BAPTIZED his hairy soul.And just  like you said, he became as gentle as a lamb. We spent the rest of the  day praising Jesus.""   


They both looked down at the rabbi, who was  lying in a hospital bed. He was in a body cast and traction with IV's  and monitors running in and out of him. He was in bad shape.

Bob, even though he was his good friend, didn't believe him. ""Harvey, you can't know everyone."" He said. ""I bet you don't know the Mayor.""

Harvey said, ""Sure I do."" He pulled out his cell phone and dialed a number. After a moment he said, ""Hi, this is Harvey. Could you tell my friend Bob here who you are?""

He hands the phone to Bob. The voice on the phone was unmistakably the Mayor, who said to Bob, ""How's my old friend Harvey treating you?"" Bob was taken aback. He talked to the Mayor for a few moments before he handed the phone back.

""OK, you win that one. But I bet you don't know the President!"" he challenged.

Harvey smiled and dragged his friend out to the car. ""We're going to DC."" He said.

A few hours later, they pull up to the White House. The security guys immediately recognized Harvey and let him through. Just then, the President came out of the front door walking his dog. Harvey leaned out the window and waved. Then, to Bob's chagrin, the President walked right over to the car and talked with Harvey for a good fifteen minutes.

Bob was starting to get a little perturbed. He figured that maybe Harvey only knew people in the US. So he said, ""I bet that you don't know the Pope....""

Harvey just grinned and drove to the airport. The next day, they were standing outside the Pope's residence. Harvey didn't think that he'd be able to get Bob in, since the security was so tight. But Bob agreed that if he saw the Pope and Harvey together in the Pope's window, then he would admit that Harvey knew everyone.

A short while later, Harvey walked out onto the balcony, arm in arm with the Pope. The Pope waved to the screaming crowds in the street. Harvey looked down into the crowd, trying to find Bob. To his shock he saw his friend collapsed in an unconsious heap on the ground. He quickly rushed down to see what had happened to his friend.

""Bob, Bob!"" Harvey shook his friend. ""Are you ok?? What happened??""

""Yeah. I'm OK."" he replied. ""But that was quite a shock.""

""No,"" said Bob. ""When the guy next to me in the crowd said, ""Hey, who's that guy up there with Harvey?""""",Really long,4

“All the phones are down, I can drive you into town in the morning. You can stay here but you have to stay away from my daughters. I keep a loaded shotgun in case you get any ideas”

 “Fuck me now, Fuck me hard or I will paint my pillow red and tell my father you popped my cherry.” 

The man scared, decided to go for it and made quiet but intense love to her. Then she left. He fell asleep for 20 min and then the door opened again. This time it was a 18 year old beautiful angel. The man , freaked out says,

 “I can’t , please”…. The girl says “Fuck me , fuck me hard. Fuck me or I will paint my pillow red and tell dad you popped my cherry.”

Determined to find a place for his offspring, the father decided that his son needed his own project.

So the father placed his son in charge of the new advertising campaign. He told him that he would have no supervision and that any and all resources which he needed would be placed at his disposal. The son was elated and immediately set off to make his father proud.

Four weeks later the son proudly proclaimed, ""I have finished!"" and he and his father went out to examine the first product of the new campaign: a billboard.

As they drove to the sight, the son explained how he had been blocked until a sudden insight had leaped into his head. They turned the corner and to the father's horror the billboard portrayed Christ on a cross with the caption: ""Even Then They Used Goldberg Nails.""

The father explained to the son that they couldn't portray Christ on a cross as it might offend their Christian clients. Dejected, the son said that he would fix the problem and report back to his father.

One week later the son again exclaimed that he was ""finished,"" and took his father off to see the billboard. Sure enough, Christ was no longer on the cross; he was lying at the base of the cross and the caption read:

One bright day in the middle of the night,
two dead boys got up to fight.
(The blind man went to see fair play;
the mute man went to shout ""hooray!"")
Back to back they faced each other,
drew their swords and shot each other.
A deaf policeman heard the noise,
and came and killed the two dead boys.
A paralysed donkey passing by
kicked the blind man in the eye;
knocked him through a nine-inch wall,
into a dry ditch and drowned them all.

through a knothole in a wooden brick wall.

Amused by the request, Mr. Johnson replied, ""Son, knock yourself out."" knowing full well that he couldn't possibly get milk from milkweed. Sure enough, Billy came back to Mr. Johnson with 2 pails of milk. Little Billy thanked the now shocked and speechless Mr. Johnson and went on his way.

The next day Billy knocked on Mr. Johnson's door again. ""Afternoon Mr. Johnson, I noticed ya had some buttercups growing in your backyard, mind if I get some butter?"" Curious this time around, Mr. Johnson replied, ""Sure son, go right ahead."" knowing full well he couldn't possibly get butter from a buttercup. Sure enough, Billy came back with 2 buckets of butter. Again, Billy thanked a now even more shocked and speechless Mr. Johnson and went on his way.

The next day little Billy knocked on Mr. Johnson's door for a third time. Mr. Johnson, very intrigued by little Billy's strange requests eagerly greeted the young man. ""How can I help you today son?"" said Mr. Johnson. ""Well sir, I noticed ya had some pussy willows growing in your backyar-"" and before Billy could finish Mr. Johnson interrupted, ""Hold on Billy!

He lived on the fifth floor of an apartment, 5 hours away from his school.

As he grew up, the number five cropped up in his life in weird and wonderful ways. He was five minutes late to everything. He received 55% in every test he ever did. He had five significant others, and so on and so forth.

On his fiftieth birthday, John received a lottery ticket from his cousin as a birthday present. He entered it, and was shocked to find that he had won $5,555,555 in cash, and decided to spend it on horse racing.

At the horse-racing track, as John looked up at the signs, he noticed that a horse named Pentagram was about to run in the fifth race of the fifth heat at 5:55 pm.

*This must be a sign from the heavens!* he thought. *This horse and I were simply meant to be! I mustn’t ignore this—my entire life has been leading up to this moment!*

He bet all $5,555,555 of his money on Pentagram winning. As he sat in his seat (fifth seat in the fifth row) and watched the horses, including Pentagram, line up at the start, he felt a sense of anticipation and excitement beyond anything he had ever felt in his life.

*BANG!* went the gun, and the race started. It was an unbelievably close race, with all nine of the horses performing spectacularly well. Pentagram ran around the track in just fifteen seconds. But in the end, after the horses crossed the finish line, John’s jaw dropped.

Pentagram, obviously, had come fifth.",There once was a man who’s lucky number was 5.,17

The jockey thinks the trainer is mad but promises to shout the command. The race begins and they approach the first hurdle. The jockey ignores the trainer's ridiculous advice and the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.

They carry on and approach the second hurdle. The jockey, somewhat embarrassed, whispers ""Aleeee ooop"" in the horse's ear. The same thing happens - the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.

At the third hurdle, the jockey thinks, ""It's no good, I'll have to do it,"" and yells, ""ALLLEEE OOOP!"" really loudly. Sure enough, the horse sails over the jump with no problems. This continues for the rest of the race, but due to the earlier problems the horse only finishes third.

The trainer is fuming and asks the jockey what went wrong. The jockey replies, ""Nothing is wrong with me - it's this bloody horse. What is he - deaf or something?""

The first evening, the ship's Captain received the following note from the wife of a very wealthy and influential plantation owner:

'Dear Captain, Thursday will be my daughter's Debutante Ball. I would like you to send three well-mannered, handsome, unmarried officers in their formal dress uniforms to attend the dance. They should arrive promptly at 8:00 PM prepared for an evening of polite Southern conversation. They should be excellent dancers, as they will be the escorts of lovely refined young ladies. One last point: No Jews please.'

Sending a written message, the captain replied:

'Madam, thank you for your invitation. In order to present the widest possible knowledge base for polite conversation, I am sending three of my best and most prized officers.

One is a lieutenant commander, and a graduate of Annapolis with an additional Masters degree from MIT in fluid technologies and ship design.

The second is a Lieutenant, one of our helicopter pilots, and a graduate of Northwestern university in Chicago, with a BS in Aeronautical Engineering. His Masters Degree and PhD. In Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering are from Texas Tech University and he is also an astronaut candidate.

Finally, the third officer, also a lieutenant commander, is our ship's doctor, with an undergraduate degree from the University of Georgia and his medical degree is from the University of North Carolina . We are very proud of him, as he is also a senior fellow in Trauma Surgery at Bethesda .'

Upon receiving this letter, the mother was quite excited and looked forward to Thursday with pleasure. Her daughter would be escorted by three handsome naval officers (and the other women in her social circle would be insanely jealous).

At precisely 8:00 PM on Thursday, Melinda's mother heard a polite rap at the door which she opened to find, in full dress uniform, three very handsome, smiling black officers.

Her mouth fell open, but pulling herself together, she stammered, 'There must be some mistake.'

'No, Madam,' said the first officer, 'Captain Goldberg never makes mistakes.'","""No Jews Allowed""",379

I’m in the midst of picking out a new pair of pants, when out of the corner of my eye, I notice a middle-aged woman staring at me from the other side of the store. I ignore it briefly, and continue looking for my clothing purchases. 

10 minutes later, I notice that she’s still randomly looking over at me, so I begin to stare back. Then, all of a sudden, she walks over to me. 

Her: “I’m sorry to be staring at you like that.”

Me: “It’s ok, I guess.”

Her: “It’s just crazy though. You look just like my son!”

Me: “Ooh, ok.” And think, well, I guess that makes more sense. But then she goes:

Her: “But he died 3 months ago.”

Me: “Wow, I am so sorry...”

Her: “No, no. It’s totally fine. It’s just nuts how much you look like him. Can you do me a favor?”

Me: “What’s that?”

Her: “When I leave the store, can you wave goodbye to me and say “Bye Mom”? It would really help...you know...for uh, closure?”

So I think to myself, in the heat of the moment, I guess I’ll do the nice thing in this incredibly awkward situation and just go along with it. So I say:

Me: “Sure.”

So I continue seeking out my purchases and end up selecting one shirt and one pair of jeans. I get to the counter to pay, and she happens to be right in front of me in line. She grabs her bags of clothes and heads to the end of the store, by the exit. And stands there. Waiting. I actually have to do this....

So, I wave to her and mouth the words “Bye Mom”. 

She nods her head in thankfulness, turns around, and walks away. 

I’m still sitting there in a bit of shock at the whole situation. All of a sudden, the person ringing me up says:

Cashier: “Your total is $811.37.”

Me: “Wait, what?”

Cashier: “Your total is $811.37.”

Me: “But...all I bought was a pair of pants and a shirt!”

Cashier: “Well, wasn’t that your mom?”

Me: “Uh, why?”

Cashier: “Well, she told me she had to get to an appointment but that you were her son, and you would pay for her stuff.”

So then it all clicks for me, and I go:

Me: “Sir, I’ll be right back!!” 

And I start running out of the store trying to find her. We’re in a mall, so I begin running as fast as I can for the nearest exit. I get there and I see her (with her four bags), and she sees me. She had a car waiting, engine on and everything. She throws the bags into the backseat, and opens the front door. She goes to sit down in the front seat, and before she can close the door, I run as fast as I can, and I jump and start pulling on her leg just like I’m pulling on yours!

Over the next few months, they build a little community: all three craft little huts out of sticks and leaves, and they fairly split up all the tasks and chores essential to their survival. They even build a little church where they go to pray every Sunday.

But after a little while, everyone gets, well, restless. To be blunt, they're all horny and have no sexual outlets. Being devoutly religious people, pre-marital sex is out of the question.

So, they come up with a system. The woman marries one of the men for a week, then gets a divorce and marries the other man for a week. They just go back and forth like this. This way, each of the guys get seven days full of sex every other week, and the girl gets laid whenever she wants.

This situation works out great, and their three-person community is thriving. But after eight months of this, the woman gets bit by a poisonous snake and dies.

The first week is really rough. The second week is even worse. The third week is just plain terrible. The fourth week is practically unbearable. So on the fifth week, they decide to bury the body.",Two guys and a girl become shipwrecked on a deserted island...,92

One day when the Hunchback was sipping his tea at the top of his belltower he heard a knock on his door, on hearing this he climbed down his stairs and opened to door where a young man was stood,
""Hi, I'm here for the bell ringer job"" he said
""Very good then follow me"" the Hunchback replied as he beckoned him to follow. 

As they got to the bell the Hunchback said he was going to demonstrate how to ring the bell. He pulls it back, pushes it fowards and takes a step to the side and the bell makes a huge DING sound. Then it was the boys turn. He pulled it back, pushed it foward, but stood still, and the bell came back and hit him smack bang in the face, DING, which knocked him all the way down the tower. 

The Hunchback thought he'd better go check on him. So he went all the way down his stairs and by the time he got to the bottom a crowed had formed. A police officer came up to the Hunchback and said,
""Do you know this kid?""

Together they had a baby who they named, Trev Jr. For his first birthday, Trev gave Trev Jr a small, red toy tractor, and he loved it. Everyday Trev would play with his tractor, sleep with his tractor, eat with his tractor, he did everything with it. It was his best friend. Then came Trev Jrs second birthday, and Trev decided to give his son a slightly bigger, red tractor. And Trev Jr loved it even more! He could have tractor battles, tractor wars, tractor tea parties, he could do anything! And on Trev Jrs third birthday, you guessed it, Trev got his son a slightly bigger, blue tractor! To Trev Jr, it was almost a dream come true! He loved it. It was everything he wanted. And as Trev grew up his love for tractors just kept building up, he got tractor blankets, tractor wallpaper, tractor underpants, his life revolved around tractors.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years passed, and Trev was now around the age of nineteen. One day he was walking to Farmers (where all the farmers go) and something caught his eye. A beautiful girl. Long flowing ginger hair, big blue eyes, a slender body, she was exactly Trevs type. There was no way Trev was gonna let this opportunity slip through his fingers. He approached this girl, her named he found out was Trevett, and her personality held up to her beauty. Trev was instantly hooked. And luckily for him, things started working out. Before they knew it they were dating, and falling in love.

&amp;#x200B;

Two years passed, and it was Trevs 21st birthday. They were having a big party at the farm with all of Trevs friends and of course Trevett. But as the party started dying down and people started to leave, Trev Senior tapped Trev on the shoulder and said,

""Follow me, I've got something to show you""

He took Trev down to the garage, where there was a large blue tarpaulin draped over a big object almost taking up all the space in the garage.

""What's this?"" Trev asked

Then Trev senior simply said,

""I hope you like it""

And with one swift motion, he pulled off the tarp, and there, standing before him in all its glory was Trevs very, own, tractor. Trev runs over to his father and they fall into a tight embrace,

""I love you, dad!""

&amp;#x200B;

Every day Trev would spend time with his tractor, polishing, cleaning, riding it around the farm, riding it around town and even taking Trevett for a ride sometimes. But his tractor wasn't the only thing Trev was falling deeply in love with, so he decided he would do something about it. One Saturday evening when the sun was setting, Trev drove Trevett to the far corner of his farm on his tractor, to a beautifully set up picnic, with champagne, candles, the works. After a long talk and the sun was disappearing behind the horizon, Trev turned to Trevett and said,

""Trevett, every second I spend with you are the best times I've ever had in my life, and after a long time of thought I have decided that I want to spend the rest of my life with you, will you marry me?""

Trevett was astonished. She loved Trev, but there was one thing about him she despised, hated and loathed with every bone in her body, she hated tractors. Everything about them, how loud they are, how slow they are, she hated them with all her guts. So she came to a decision,

""I love you Trev, but if you want to marry me, you must get rid of all your belongings related to tractors. Your tractor blankets, your tractor wallpaper, your tractor underpants, your real tractor and even your love for tractors. I wish for you to do this, but if you can't, I'm sorry.""

Trev was shocked. This was too sudden. How could he choose between the two loves of his life? He needed time. Therefore, they came to an agreement, he had two weeks to decide, and by then he has to come to a decision, her or the tractors.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks passed, and it was time for the decision to be made. Trev picked up Trevett on the bus, and walked her to the same corner of the farm, with the same picnic and the same sun setting in the background. They sat down, Trev turned to Trevett and said,

""I did it! I destroyed everything, I burnt the blankets, tore off the wallpaper, threw away the underwear, and I've even completely lost my love for tractors.""

""But what's that over there?"" Trevett asks as she points to Trevs tractor in the middle of the farm,

""Nothing,"" Trevs says, as he pulls out a remote from his pocket, presses a button...

&amp;#x200B;

BOOM

&amp;#x200B;

A giant ball of fire appears where the tractor once stood. Tears rolled down Trevs cheeks, but he knew he did the right thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Six months pass and Trev and Trevett are stood facing each other in a beautiful white church, it was the wedding day. All of the couple's friends and family are here to celebrate rejoice this wonderful day. But as the newlywed were reciting their vows something strange started happening, all the windows and doors suddenly slammed shut, and thick black smoke started pouring out of the vents at a rapid pace, filling the room with black smog. Panic erupted in the church, but one man held his cool, Trev. He stood up, lifted his chin and with one huge breath he sucked all the black smoke into his lungs, he then walked up to a window as smashed it open with his elbow and again with one big breath blew ALL the smoke out, saving himself and all the people inside. Astonished, Trevett looks up at Trev and says,

""Trev, h-how did you do that?""

&amp;#x200B;

""well you see my love, I'm an ex-tractor fan""

At the oral exam, he gave the student the hardest questions, but the student had amazing answers for everything. Therefore, hoping he could still fail his victim, the teacher asked him a trickier question:

'You're walking on a road and you find two bags. One contains gold, the other cleverness. Which bag do you choose?'

'The gold.'

'Unfortunately, I don't agree. I'd choose cleverness, because that's more important than money.'

'Everyone would choose what they don't have,' says the student.

So there was this fly flying around above this river, with a fish in the river nearby.
 
 The fish thought to himself that he could get that fly and have a nice snack if it would just drop 6 inches. On the side of the river, there was a bear nearby watching the fish.
 
 The bear thought to himself that he could get that fish and have a nice snack once it goes for the fly after the fly drops 6 inches.
 
 Across the river, there was a hunter eyeing the bear and he saw what was happening. He thought to himself that if the fly dropped 6 inches, the fish grabbed the fly, and the bear grabbed the fish, then he could shoot the bear and have himself a nice pelt.

The hunter had a lunch box next to him with a cheese sandwich in it that a mouse was eyeing nearby. The mouse thought to itself that if the fly drops 6 inches, the fish goes after the fly, the bear goes after the fish, and the hunter shoots the bear, then the mouse could go after the sandwich while the hunter is distracted and have itself a nice meal.
 
 Watching all of this back in a bush on the Hunter's side of the river was a cat nearby. He, too, saw what was happening. He thought to himself that if the fly dropped 6 inches, the fish jumped up and ate the fly, the bear grabbed the fish, the hunter shot the bear, and the mouse grabbed the cheese sandwich, then he could grab the mouse and have himself a snack.

Well, the fly did drop 6 inches, the fish was able to grab the fly, the bear was able to grab that fish, the hunter shot the bear, and the mouse was able to get his share of the cheese sandwich when the hunter wasn't looking. However, the cat was unsuccessful in grabbing the mouse and fell into the river.

A British soldier walks in, bites into his bread, and then gags and coughs it up onto the ground. “Blimey! This is bloody disgusting! Is this really the only food we soldiers will be given to eat while stranded here? Well, if that’s the case, I refuse to eat any of it. Good day to you, sir.” And he storms out the door, behind the American.

A Russian soldier walks in, picks up all the dropped pieces of bread and gobbles them up. “FOOD! Wonderful food, comrades! I have never seen so much food in my life!!! Praise glorious leader Stalin!!!”","The year is 1943, and an Allied encampment is surrounded by German forces.",11

Warning: This is extremely offensive, do not read if you're easily offended.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Friend,

We have the distinguished honor of being members of a committee to raise $50,000,000 to be used in placing a statue of Lyndon B. Johnson in the Hall of Fame, Washington, D.C.

The committee was in quite a quandary about selecting a proper location for the statue. It was thought not wise to place it beside that of George Washington, who never told a lie, nor beside that of F.D.R. who never told the truth, since Lyndon could never tell the difference.

After careful consideration we think it should be placed beside the statue of Christopher Columbus, the greatest new dealer of them all, in that he started out not knowing where he was going, and in arriving did not know where he was, and in return did not know where he had been, and did it all on borrowed money.

The inscription on the statue shall read:

I pledge to Lyndon B. Johnson and the national debt for which he stands on man expendable with graft and corruption for all.

Moses said to the children of Israel five thousand years ago, “Pick up your shovels, mount your asses and camels and I will lead you to the Promised Land.” Nearly five thousand years later Roosevelt said, “Lay down your shovels, sit on your asses, and light up a camel, this is the Promised Land.”

Now, Johnson is stealing your shovels, kicking your asses, raising the price of camels, and taking over the Promised Land.

If you are one of these citizens who had money left over after taxes, we will expect a generous contribution from you for this worthwhile project.

Sincerely yours,",Vintage Political Joke from Lyndon B. Johnson Administration,3

The bloke replied, ""Oh, I just told her I wanted to fuck her in the arse.""

The driver thought for a minute, then said ""Well, if you're still interested, I happen to know she walks through the park down the road there every night at about 6 o'clock."" The bloke thanked the driver for the info then went on his way.

When he got home, he thought to himself ""She'll never fuck a scumbag like me."" So he got dressed up as Jesus.

That evening he was hiding in the bushes when the nun came wandering through the park. He leapt out and cried, ""Gday. I'm Jesus, and I want to fuck you in the arse!""

The nun replied, ""Well, seeing as how you're Jesus, I suppose you'd better.""
So the bloke got his cock out, and proceeded to fuck the nun up the arse. But after he'd finished, he was feeling a bit guilty. So he said, ""Actually love, I'm not really Jesus, I'm that rude bloke off the bus earlier.""

1. The bartender is blond girl who’s holding a baseball bat.

3. I’m a 6-foot tall, 175-pound blond woman with a black belt in karate.

He started his journey full of excitement and hope. he'd purchased his 2,000lbs of gear and supplies and two fine stock horses to help him carry it.

The voyage to Skagway was difficult. The seas were rough and he spent many hours at the rail, emptying his stomach into the frigid, frothing waters.

His journey from Skagway to the Klondike wasn't any easier. Halfway through the journey, a blizzard caught him by surprise. One of his two pack horses didn't survive the frigid night. Wolves took care of the other three days later. 

Pressing on he finally arrived in the Yukon, pulling his sled by hand. There, he discovered that all the claims had been taken, except for one on the outskirts of the town. The claim hadn't been taken as it seemed to have little promise. 

He worked the claim for weeks, with his gold pan, his pick, and his shovel. Day after day he toiled, his supplies and hope dwindling with each shovel-full of frozen soil lifted from the earth. 

After 9 months, his food supplies were exhausted, as were his mind and body. For all his labor, he still had nothing to show for all his labor. Dejected and despairing, he made his way back to Dawson and spent his last dollar on a shot of watered-down whiskey. He'd brought his gold pan with him to use as a plate for a meal, but he didn't have the means to purchase even a cup of caribou stew. 

With tears welling in his eyes, he left the bar and slumped to the muddy boardwalk outside the blacksmith shop. The pan dropped from his dejected fingers onto the ground in front of him. 

After all his labor, sacrifice, sweat, blood, and tears, he had nothing to show for it. Full of shame and despair, he wept in bitterness unabashedly, heedless of the men passing by on the boardwalk. 

A few minutes later, a prospector in a fine broadcloth suit and a bear skin coat passed by young man. Looking down at him, he took pity on the broken young man. From his pocket he pulled forth a nugget the size of an acorn. Bending low, he dropped it into his discarded pan with a loud clang. 

The young man, aroused by this sound, shook himself free of his stupified state. He stared down into the pan, disbelief dawning on his tear stained face. 
 
Looking up at the prospector, with gratitude in his eyes, he said in a breaking voice, ""Thanks for my first gold, kind stranger!"" ",Staking a claim,22

God: Yo Devil, how's it going down there?


Devil: We're doing great! We have this engineer and he's very hard working. He's built escalators, jacuzzis, toilets.


God: What? There must have been a mistake. You are not supposed to have engineers in Hell, send him back to Heaven immediately.


Devil: No way! We've made plans for building pools, stone barbecues, the engineer is staying in Hell.


God: You are in breach of contract. If you don't send him back, I will sue you.

Amoxil is also called Amoxicillin and Advil is also called Ibuprofen.

The FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra.   

After careful consideration by a team of government experts, it recently announced that it has settled on the generic name of Mycoxafloppin.  

Also considered were Mycoxafailin, Mydixadrupin, Mydixarizin, Dixafix, and of course, Ibepokin.     

Pfizer Corp. Announced today that Viagra will soon be available in liquid form, and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage suitable for use as a mixer…. 
It will now be possible for a man to literally pour himself a stiff one. 

Obviously we can no longer call this a soft drink, and it gives new meaning to the names of 'cocktails', 'highballs' and just a good old-fashioned 'stiff drink'.   

Pepsi will market the new concoction by the name of: MOUNT &amp; DO.    

Thought for the day: There is more money being spent on breast implants and Viagra today than on Alzheimer's research.   

This means that by 2030, there should be a large elderly population with perky boobs and huge erections and absolutely no recollection of what to do with them.","All drugs have two names, a trade name and generic name",2148

-The client: is room 39 empty?

-The boss: yes, sir.

-The client: can I book it?

-The boss: of course you can.

-The client: thank you.


Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to
provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and
an orange 73g.
The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird
things the client asked to have.


The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or
anything else.
Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.
After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in
that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils
and dishes being thrown on the floor.


The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and
wondering what might be the source of the noise.
In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the
boss, the latter asked to see the room first.


He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing
unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the
orange on the table.
The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good
tip and left the hotel smiling.


The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he
heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.
After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to
see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.


The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife,
white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.
This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means
possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something
to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises
started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the
year before.


Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large
tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his
face.
The boss started searching for the meaning of everything
the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why
the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss
didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these
questions.


The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March,
the month in which the client showed up.
To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client
showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to
book the same room, wanted to have the same things as
before.


The boss again heard the same noises, this time more
louder than before.
In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the
boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know
the secret behind the noises in the room.


-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it
to anyone else?''

-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.

-''Swear''

-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''


So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss.
Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now
he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.
When he does, I will let you know...","A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss. When the boss came, the story began.",1

He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",The Bulgarian Electrocution,15

'I'll have the same,' says the ostrich. 

A short time later the waitress returns with the order 'That will be $9.40 please,' and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment. 

The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke' 

The ostrich says, 'I'll have the same' 

Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. 

This becomes routine until the two enter again. 

'The usual?' asks the waitress. 

'No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and a salad,' says the man. 
'Same,' says the ostrich.

Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. 

The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer.
 
""Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time?"" 

Says the man, ""Well, several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. 

The first wish I asked was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.""

The waitress said ""That's brilliant! Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live. How smart of you!''

""That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact amount of money is always there"" says the man proudly.

The waitress asks, ""But, what's that ostrich all about?""

The man sighs, pauses and answers with a heavy heart, *""My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who accompanies me wherever I go and agrees with everything I say"".*

After about 9 months of not seeing another human being, dead in the middle of a rough Canadian winter, he begins to get a little lonely. Lo and behold, one evening there's a knock on his door. 

Standing at the door was a Grizzly Adams look-a-like, except bigger and uglier. He extended his hand, saying ""I'm John, but they call me Moose. I'd like to invite you to a party I'm having Saturday night at my place"". 

Well, the man is pretty pumped and introduced himself as Dave. ""That's awesome-I HAVE been getting a little lonely over here"", admitted Dave. 

""Great"", says John-""there's gonna be some dancin'"".  So Dave says ""I like dancing well enough, sounds good"".  John says, ""There's gonna be some fightin'"". Dave pauses and says ""Hmm, I'm not much on fighting if I don't have to"". But he thought to himself that he would just avoid the fighting and focus on the dancing. 

""And they gon' be some fuckin'"" says John. Dave bursts out smiling, imagining himself with a woman for the first time in  a LONG time.  John turns to leave and Dave asks, ""What should I wear?"".

John looks back over his shoulder at Dave and says ""It don't matter - ain't nobody gonna' be there but me and you"".

""You have such an honest face Father, I am sure they will not ask you any questions"", and she gave him the ""hair remover"".

""From the top of my head to my sash, I have nothing to declare, my son, he replied.

Finding this reply strange, the customs officer asked, ""And from the sash down, what do you have?""

However, he found it quite difficult, since playing the piano did not equate to sculpting. But he did not give up. He then tried writing -- after all, his typing speed ought to be immense and immeasurably godly compared to most other people. However, writing had the problem of needing to come up with stories and ideas. He was used more to following sheet music and maybe a little improvisation, but he was surely no Beethoven when it came to composing, and even less when it came to coming out with a novel. He then thought, what if I try a different, more rigid type of typing -- yes, coding. You had to mathematically and logically solve a problem. Even if he would be on his own, he could surely do it, as he was very skilled at mathematics as well. So he tried out basic exercises and was able to handle them. But as he moved on to more creative prompts and open-ended ideas, he was stumped, as before. He was exasperated at this point, but he remembered that when he was very young, he was quite decent at telling jokes to his family. Perhaps he should try out comedy. So he went up as a stand-up comedian and with the combination of his fame, people roared with applause. However, he couldn't help but feel as if people were praising him due to his previous achievements. In addition, he was mostly just reciting other people's stand-up attempts too, rather than coming up with something creative. He sat down and thought quite hard, and remembered genuinely humorous stories that occurred to him many years before he officially grew to worldwide stardom. So he traveled far and wide to a very rural location with few connections and isolated from famous people, even ones as well-known as him. He told his usual jokes, but it didn't seem to touch them as they did with the other people. He spent quite some time elaborating them, but he got nothing more than a few awkward coughs. He was quite confused. As a surprise, one audience member met him afterwards, revealing him to be his friend who had followed him throughout his journey. ""Ah, don't worry, man, "" he said, ""They couldn't have sympathized with you and laughed along, since they don't know the whole life.

As he approaches the tallest tree in the forest a voice yells down, “Heyyy mannnn!!”.

“Yes?” asks the Lizard.

The Koala responds, “Hey mannn.. I have ALL of this weed to smoke, but nobody to help me smoke it. Care to join me?”

The Lizard thinks for a moment and agrees. He climbs the tree all the up to the branch and settles in next to the Koala. As hours go by, joint after joint is passed back and forth. Eventually, the Lizard realizes just how high he is, turns to the Koala and says “I am so fucked up right now. I’ve got cotton mouth real bad. I’m gonna head down to the river and get a drink of water.”

“Okay, I’ll be right here when you get back.” says the Koala.

The lizard climbs off the branch, down the tree, walks back through the forest until he gets to the edge of the river. By the time he approaches the water, he’s so high that he loses his footing and falls in.

A nearby crocodile sees all of this happen. He swims over to the lizard, picks him up and drops him off safely on the shore.

“What were you thinking?” questions the Crocodile.

Lizard responds, “Thank you for saving me! I’m just so high right now. You see, I was minding my own business in the forest until I was invited up into a tree to smoke weed with a Koala until I got cotton mouth and needed a drink from the river but by the time I got down here I was too high and well..”

“Hold up! Hold up!” yells the Crocodile. “You mean to tell me there’s a Koala in that forest sitting up in a tree getting high right now?”

“Absolutely! Tallest tree in the forest. Go see for yourself!” says the Lizard.

So the Crocodile starts walking through the forest until he reaches the bottom of the largest tree. He looks up, spots the Koala and says “Hey YOU!”

I am a single guy looking for love, and yesterday I saw an ad in the 'Singles' section of the local newspaper that immediately grabbed my interest. It read like this:

&amp;#x200B;

*Single white female seeks male companionship. I'm a good looking French girl who LOVES to play. I love long walks and fishing trips and cozy winters nights lying by the fire. Candlelit dinners will have me eating out of your hand. I'll be at the front door every day when you get home from work wearing only what nature gave me ;-)*

*Call (xxx)xxx-xxx and ask for Camille!*

&amp;#x200B;

She sounded like just the girl for me, so I called the number. Turns out &gt;!Camille is a white fucking poodle.!&lt;",To all the single men out there - a warning,5
