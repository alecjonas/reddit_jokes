As the midget pulls up into the guy's driveway, the dude selling the horse is already thinking that one of his friends sent this midget as a joke to mess with him.

As he walks out to the midget's vehicle to meet him, the midget goes, ""Hello, my name is Thteve (Steve) and you probably noticed that I have a bit of a lithp (lisp)."" They exchange names and begin to walk to the barn where the horse is.

At first sight, Steve is just blown away by this horse. He thinks it looks very healthy and strong but wants to get a closer look at it. He looks at the horse owner and goes ""Could you pick me up so I could look at its mane?"" The horse-owner, who still thinks he is being played by one of his buddies, reluctantly picks him up and lets him pet the mane. 

Then Steve the midget goes, ""Would you mind showing me his hooves?""

The horse-owner is starting to get pretty angry and is tired of being played with but again he lifts up the hooves for Steve the Midget and Steve goes, ""Oh wow, those are some lovely hooves.""

Finally, Steve the Midget asks, ""Can I see it's twat?""

This pushes the horse-owner past the boiling point so he picks up Steve and shoves him shoulder deep into this horse's vagina and leaves him there for about 20 seconds. 

He then pulls him out and Steve is mortified and manages to say, ""No! No! No! I want to see it *twat* around the twack!""

He had just lost his gun and was deathly afraid to tell the general. He gathered his courage and went up to him and said ""Sir, I've lost my rifle, so I need a new one"".
The general takes a mop from the corner and gives it to Bob.
""What the hell am I supposed to do with this?"" he asked.
""Point it at the enemy and say BANGETY BANG BANG, BANGETY BANG BANG!!!""
""Well what if they get to close?"", the man questioned
""Tap people with it yelling STABETY STAB STAB, STABETY STAB STAB!!""
Bob went out into the battlefield and reluctantly pointed the mop saying ""BANGETY BANG BANG!"" and to his surprise the men started falling down dead. They started getting up close, so the man yelled ""STABETY STAB STAB!"" and they fell down dead. Now there was one man coming down. Bob fired his mop at the man, but nothing happened. The man got closer so Bob started stabbing him with the mop. The man completely ran over and crushed Bob. Bob was confused until he heard in the distance ""TANKETY TANK TANK!""",An army man and a mop,7

Every women I see I imagine them naked and I imagine having sex with them...except for my wife. I have no sexual feeling for her at all. Please help me doctor, I still love my wife very much.
The doctor responds, "" Please, call me Mike. I can help you but my treatment is unique. Now I'm going to say a word and you tell me the first person you think of....lets start with *BREASTS*.""

""My neighbor Jill."" Steve said.

""Alright...how about *LEGS*..."" Mike said.

""Mrs.Prejean, my daughter's ballet teacher."" The man replied quickly.

""*DISHES*"" Mike said casually.

""My wife, Sara."" Steve said. As soon as he did Mike shot out of his seat, ""Very good! Quick, grab onto my belt.."" And the man grabbed the back of Mike's belt as the doctor started conga dancing through his office.
For weeks it went like this. Whenever Mike would say a word and Steve thought of his wife, he would grab onto the doctors belt and they would dance through the office. After months and months of treatment, Steve had changed. When ever Mike would say a sexual word, Steve would say his wife's name, then he would grab onto Mike's belt and conga dance. The doctor proclaimed him cured.

""I think we've done it Steve,"" he said. ""The only women you want now is your wife. I think we can stop our sessions. Your ready. Be careful out there, there's lots of temptations to set you back....in fact here.."" the doctor removed his belt and gave it to Steve. ""Keep a hold of this and when ever things get rough I want you to grab onto it and remember your treatment.""

That night Steve decides to come clean to his wife about his sex addiction. He tells her about his problem, his lusts, he tells her everything. 

""So when he would say *Breasts* you'd think of our neighbor?"" She said in tears.

""Yes, but not now. Now I think of only you."" He said.

""Oh yeah,"" his wife shot back."" What if I said *Jill's Breasts* huh?""

Mike pulls out the belt. ""I only think of you my love.""

""Why did you pull out a belt just now."" She asked.

""Because,"" Steve replied.""I don't want anybody else, when I think about you I touch Mike's belt.""

Unfortunately, she has her eyes on a very expensive Blue Macaw that costs several thousand dollars. In a cage next to it is a smaller, rough looking parrot. The parrot looks at the man and whispers :

""Hey buddy, you should buy me instead of that other parrot, I'm way less expensive!""
The man then asks the parrot why he is so much less expensive, and the parrot says ""well I haven't got any legs.""
The man says ""how do you stay on your perch without any legs?""
The parrot replies ""easy, I just wrap my cock around the perch!"" 

The man convinces his wife to buy the poor leg-less parrot, because nobody else would want him. Things are going well until one day the man comes home from work and the parrot says: ""hey buddy, I think your wife is having an affair!""
The man asks the parrot what happened and the parrot says ""well after you went to work a man came over""
""Then what happened?"" Asks the man
""Well they sat on the couch and started making out"" 
""Then what happened?"" Asks the man, getting angrier
""Well then he took off her shirt and started fondling her breasts"" says the parrot. 
""THEN WHAT HAPPENED?"" Says the man, irate at this point
The parrot looks at the man and says ""I don't know, I fell off my perch!""",Parrot with No Legs,295

In a bid to break the ice he asks if anyone has a request.
One chap jumps out of his seat in the 1st row and shouts at the top of his voice ""Play a jazz chord ! Play a jazz chord!""
Amazed that this guy knows about the jazz influences in Stevie's career, the blind impresario starts to play an E minor scale and then goes into a difficult jazz melody for about 10 minutes. When he finishes the whole place goes wild.
The chap jumps out of his seat again and shouts - ""No, no, play a jazz chord, play a jazz chord..."".
A bit cheesed off by this, Stevie, being the professional he is, dives straight in to a jazz improvisation with his band around the B flat minor chord and really tears the place apart. The crowd go ballistic with this impromptu show of his musical expertise. But, still the little Chinese man jumps up again and shouts ""No, no. Play a jazz chord, play a jazz chord!!!"". Stevie is really peed off now that this chap doesn't seem to appreciate his playing ability and shouts to him from the stage -
""OK smart ass, you get up here and do it""..

All communications on open channels is at a minimum with respect to the seriousness of the days events.

But as with all things, fear begins to be replaced by boredom. Hours of sitting idly on the ramp, just waiting for news of what to do next. Dozens of aircraft with thousands of people just sitting there. Waiting.

Suddenly the silence is pierced by a single voice over the open frequency: ""I'm fucking bored!""

The controller, booming with contempt and a strong sense of duty to instill some respect into the foolish young pilot, came back with, ""Last aircraft, say call sign.""

Cold, hungry, and feeling sorry for himself, he eventually decides that warming up in front of a fire with a tall glass of ale sounds appealing.

Almost right on cue, he sees a light shining through the darkness.  The bear, by almost complete chance, has stumbled across a small, remote roadhouse.

The bear staggers in from the cold and pulls up to the bar.  ""Give me a beer!""  the bear barks, shaking snow from his muzzle.

But the bartender shakes his head.  ""We don't serve beer to bears in bars in Alaska.""  

""But I'm cold and hungry, and I can pay!"" the bear stammers, but the bartender repeats himself, ""we don't serve beer to bears in bars in Alaska.""

The bear, angry, staggers back into the cold.  But no more than a few minutes later, he decides that he's going to go back to the bar and insist upon getting his beer.

The bear marches up to the bar and slams a hefty paw down.  ""Give me that beer or else!"" he growls.  But the bartender shakes his head, crosses his arms, and repeats, ""we don't serve beer to bears in bars in Alaska.""

The bear eyes a woman sitting at the far end of the bar and points at her.  ""If you don't give me that beer, I'm going to EAT HER!""

But the bartender repeats: ""we don't serve beer to bears in bars in Alaska.""

Well, that clinches it.  The bear stands up on his hind legs and goes after the woman.  It's a horrific sight, filled with claws and screams and gore.  The terrible deed done, the bear stands over the bartender with blood dripping from his fangs: ""you going to give me that beer NOW?""

The bar tender shakes his head.  ""We don't serve drug users here!""

""Drugs?  What drugs?"" the bear demands.

The bartender responds, ""I saw you with that bar bitch you ate!""",Serving beer to bears in bars.,2

The urinal is one of those long trench types without walls to separate people.  The man unzips and assumes the position when in walks a very short red-bearded man wearing a green suit and green bowler hat with a clover in it.  There was no mistaking that this was, in actual fact, a walking, breathing leprechaun.  The wee man steps up not too far from the other guy, whips it out, and starts to urinate.  

The first man, observing the unwritten laws of urinal use, stares straight forward; however, he can't help but notice out of the corner of his eye that the leprechaun is incredibly, almost unbelievably, well-endowed - so much so that the man turns and stares in amazement.  The leprechaun looks up at the man, down at his penis, and back up at the man again, and asks, ""Would ye fancy havin' one this size, laddie?"" The man is shocked and embarrassed, but, can't help replying, ""Y-y-yeah! You could grant me that wish?""  The little person says, ""Aye! I'm a leprechaun after all! There's just one thing ye hav to do fer me, though.  Ye gotta let me fuck ye in the arse."" The man considers it for a moment, cringing at the thought, but reluctantly agrees.  

The man drops to his knees on the bathroom floor, pants down, and the leprechaun wastes no time in getting down to business.  In the middle of the action, the leprechaun asks, ""What might yer name be, laddie?"" The man, groaning and squinting and grimacing manages to squeeze out, ""Tiiiimmmmyyy.""  The wee man says, ""Ah, and how old might ye be, Timmy?"" Reluctantly, grunting, Timmy manages to groan, ""Thiirrrttyyy.""

post,6rfeyf,2qh72,jokes,false,1501793663,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6rfeyf/avengers_premiere/,self.jokes,,"A few years back I went to the Avengers premiere at Leicester square. Red carpet event. Had to rent a tux and everything. I had a good time, slightly overwhelming being in the cinema with so many famous actors but it was a cool experience. Thanks to a friend pretending I was a celebrity I got invited to the after party. Just a room with food, drink and most of Hollywood. I was sitting, chatting to some set designers when pretty much the entire room groaned. A guy called Jack had arrived and nobody was happy. Jack was an asshole. The biggest. Turns out he had been around ages and had basically made himself untouchable. Well known family too.The conversation continued but after a while a commotion was heard. Jack was being loud and pissing everyone off. People started to leave. The set designers call it a night and I'm left sitting there watching this guy. I can't hear him but he looks asshole-ish, you know? Then, out of nowhere, some guy just flies out of the crowd and takes him out. Huge punch. He goes down like a sack of shit. Cue bedlam. Some people scream, others rush over. Shitty journalists whip out phones and take pics. Party's over. Then, and I'll never forget this, I catch a glimpse of the guy who hit him. It's fucking Tim Cook! He's yelling something so I go over and take a look. Dude's CEO of Apple, I've gotta see this!I get closer and hear Cook yelling this ""... and don't give a shit if your dad was Serial, you're a piece of shit and you're finished!"" At this point Jack's brother, USB comes over and breaks it up. He's still got respect in the industry so the crowd soon disperses. I went home. I had a good time but seeing that was so unreal. I wondered if the guy could ever pull his life around. He didn't. Pretty much dropped off the face of the planet that night. Apple stopped working with him, HTC and Samsung followed soon after. Now I hear today that even Google have dropped him. Such a shame, he let all the fame and money go to his head. Anyway, thought that might be an interesting insight into why everyone's abandoning the guy. You're never too big to fall.And nobody knows that like Headphone Jack.

""Sister, I know you are not supposed to, but I find you to be the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I would not forgive myself if I did not try. Would you grant me the honour of sleeping with you?""

Obviously, the nun says no, and reaching her destination, she exits the bus.

The next day, the man enters the same bus, hoping to find the nun there, and does. He begs her again to give him the sex, but is once again refused.

On the third day, he sees her on the bus again, proposes a night of passion, and is once again rejected. When the nun leaves the bus, the bus driver turns to the man and says :

""Hey dude, I've seen you get rejected three times already, if you really want her, I could help you out. She goes to this graveyard every night and lights a single candle there, praying and offering her body to God. If I were you, dressing up would be a decent idea.""

So, that night, the man dresses up as God and enters the graveyard and searches for the nun. In the distance, he sees a faint light and as he gets closer, he sees the nun kneeling beside the candle, mumbling words, probably praying. 

He appears before the nun and commands her to offer her body to him. She is surprised, and drops to her knees, saying

""Oh great one, I have spent my entire life devoting myself to you. My mind, body, and soul are yours to take as you please. However, i am still in this mortal form, so to preserve my sanctity, if you must take me, do it with my behind.

So the man had the best night of his life (only anal), they made love over and over again until the sun rose over the horizon. Wanting to brag to the woman who turned him down three times, the man removed his disguise.

""AHAH !! I AM THE MAN FROM THE BUS !!""

The nun removes his gown.

post,6rdpk3,2qh72,jokes,false,1501779723,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6rdpk3/the_blue_marble/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Thomas. Thomas was watching his favorite show one night and a commercial came on for something called the blue marble. Needless to say, due to the exciting nature of the commercial and the amount of fancy effects utilized Thomas got very excited. He did, however, realize after a little bit of thought that he had absolutely no idea what it was or how it was used.

Thomas decided that since his father was the wisest man he knew, he should ask him about the blue marble. Well, Thomas's father worked a late shift at the factory on this particular day so Thomas had to wait an excruciatingly long time before his father would be home.  

When his father finally made it home, Thomas quickly rushed up to him and asked:

""Father, I saw a commercial today and I was hoping you would know; what is the blue marble?""

Thomas's father got visibly upset and his face turned a bright crimson. Vein in his forehead puksing, he screamed:

""How dare you ask me that you ungrateful little bastard! You get out of this house. I never want to see you again!""

Thomas, shocked at this reaction, burst into tears and ran out of the house. 

As he was aimlessly wandering the streets of his hometown trying to figure out what had just happened; Thomas realized it must be a misunderstanding. If he could find the truth about the blue marble, maybe his father would forgive him. Wracking his brain, he remembered his father (the wisest man he knew) used to speak highly of the mayor of his town.  Thomas decided maybe the mayor could answer his question. 

Thomas remembered where the city hall was because a year ago his class had taken a field trip there for their social studies class. So Thomas made his way there. When he arrived, he was stopped by the mayor's secretary who wanted to know why he wanted to see the mayor.

When Thomas explained how important it was that he see the mayor, for reasons lost to the past she actually buzzed him in. The mayor was sitting behind his large oaken desk wearing a business suit and smoking a big cigar. He looked up from his paperwork and his eyes locked on Thomas.

""Why, hello there son. What is it I can do for you today?""

Thomas, feeling quite uncomfortable under the mayor's intense, piercing gaze, started to fidget. 

""Well, come on son, I'm a very busy man""

Finally Thomas managed to pick up the courage and stammered:

""S..s..sir, I saw a commercial today that confused me. I asked my father about it and he got very very angry and threw me out. So I'm here hoping that you can answer my question. Sir, what is the blue marble?""

At the mention of the marble, the mayor's gaze finally wavered. He became visibly angry just like Thomas's father before him.

""How dare you ask that?"" He bellowed. ""Do you not have a shred of decency?""

And, with that, he called for the sheriff and had Thomas escorted out of town. As the sheriff dropped Thomas outside the city limits he told Thomas not to ever show his face in town again.

Thomas, now alone and bereft of everything he'd ever known, once again wracked his brain. He remembered watching the news with his father and hearing them praise the new president for his wisdom and kindness. Thomas decided that the president would be his best chance at finally getting the answer he needed.

At first the going was slow. Thomas had never been in his own before. But pretty soon he figured out that through a combination of strangers kindness and his own ingenuity it was possible to get by. Months passed. But, ever so slowly, he made his way towards Washington DC. 

The one strange thing in his travels, that he quickly noticed, was; no matter where he went or who he asked about the blue marble, the reaction was always the same. 

Finally, right around his birthday as it so happens, Thomas made it to Washington and to the Whitehouse. He was once again stopped at the reception desk.

""Why hello there young man"" the person behind the counter said while eyeing Thomas's admittedly rough appearance. ""What is it we can do for you?""

Now, Thomas had been in his own for quite awhile at this point, and he had learned how to be pretty crafty. It was actually surprisingly easy to convince them to let him in to see the president.

Thomas walked in to the oval office, and sitting before him in the nicest suit he had ever seen was a middle aged man with close cropped grey hair and piercing blue eyes; the president of the United States of America. Who slowly looked up from the paperwork on the desk to take in the disheveled boy before him.

""And who might you be?"" He asked in a surprisingly gentle voice.

""My name is Thomas, and I've traveled a very long way to ask you a question."" Said Thomas 

The president, obviously intrigued cocked an eyebrow.

""And what, pray tell, is so important that you would come all the way here and interrupt my duties?""

""I have traveled across plains and mountains I have slept under the stars, I have scrounged for food; all so I can ask you, the wisest man in the country, what is the blue marble?""

Thomas braced himself, and rightfully so, because at the mention of the blue marble the pesident got very still and quiet. A scarlet hue crept it's way up from the collar of his suit.

""Have you no tact or decency whatsoever?"" He snarled between gritted teeth. ""No citizen of this country can speak to me that way! Get out. Out of my office and out of this country!""

And so it was. Armed men came and slapped Thomas into handcuffs. They threw a bag over his head and put him on a ship bound for Europe.

Thomas travelled for many years always in search of his answer. Over Hill and Dale his journey took him. No matter where he went or who he asked the answer was always the same. Get out. 

Finally after many many years and many many miles Thomas heard a take about a Yogi in India. A holy man who, twas said, had discovered the answers to every single riddle in the cosmos. It took a few more years and many adventures but Thomas finally found the ascetic in a remote village in India. 

Upon entering the village Thomas quickly found out that the Yogi lived in a small shack at the edge of town. Upon finding the shack Thomas noticed how small and run down it was. He had slept in nicer places while he was homeless. It was exactly where he figured such an enlightened person would call home. He entered the shack.

The inside of the building was dark and smoky. There were rags strewn about the floor. One of the bundles of rags sat up and addressed Thomas in surprisingly good English.

""It's been a long time since I had a visitor.""

Thomas realized this was the man he had sought all this time. The diminutive elderly man smiled a toothless smile at Thomas.

""So what is it that brings you to my humble home?"" He asked softly.

""I have traveled many years and over much of our world seeking the answer to a question. I was told you know the answer to every riddle in the cosmos."" Said Thomas.

""I cannot proclaim to know everything, but I do indeed know many things. What is your question?"" 

""What is the blue marble?"" Thomas asked bracing himself for the anger he had gotten from everyone he had ever asked.

The anger never came. The old man started laughing softly to himself.

""Oh such a simple thing. And fortuitous that you would come here for the answer."" Said the tiny man as gingerly he stood up and moved to the door.

""The answer you seek"" said the man pulling open the flap across the entrance, ""lies in that building.""

He pointed at a rather large structure directly across the road. Excited to finally be so close to the answer he had spent a lifetime searching for; Thomas thanked the Yogi and immediately jogged toward the building.

He never saw the tour bus that ran him down.

And that's why you always look both ways when you cross the street.

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.

The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.

The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.

And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",Once upon a time...,48

Okay, another one of my favorites.
A woman is trying to get a flight on a plane to Australia for her and for her pet parrot. She finds that the airlines are very expensive. There is one airline that is having a special on tickets to Australia. She sees, however, that there is no smoking allowed on the plane, and that there are no pets allowed on the plane. In large letters it says ""ESPECIALLY PARROTS!"" The woman thinks she can sneak the parrot onto the plane, so she books the ticket.
On the day of the flight, she stuffs the parrot into her jacket and boards the plane. Airport security, gate attendants, and flight attendants all fail to detect the parrot, so the woman gets to her seat on the plane and sits. The plane takes off and she thinks she is home free.
A couple hours into the flight, though, the captain comes walking down the aisle to check on passengers. He's shaking hands and chatting with passengers but is also smoking a huge cigar. When he gets to the woman he says, ""Are you enjoying your flight, ma'am?"" and teaches to shake her hand. The woman goes to shake his, but accidentally pinches her parrot, who makes a ""SQUAK!"" sound.
The pilot rips off her jacket and sees the parrot. He is very angry. ""Ma'am, there are no parrots allowed on this plane!"" He grabs the parrot, opens the plane window, and throws the parrot out. The woman becomes very distressed and grabs the cigar out of the pilot's mouth. ""There is also no smoking allowed on this plane!"" she screams, and throws the cigar out of the window, then slams it shut.
The pilot is so angry that he turns around and goes back to the cockpit, refusing to check on the other passengers. He takes his seat at the controls and looks out the window. He can't believe his eyes. The parrot is there on the windshield, and what do you suppose is in his mouth?
No, not the cigar. It's the brick.

They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. 

The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore.""

post,6r7wc1,2qh72,jokes,false,1501713024,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6r7wc1/abducted/,self.jokes,,"   In a small country town, the most exciting thing that happened was the occasional drunk stumbling down the street. Life was slow, calm and everyone who lived there preferred it that way. However, the biggest story in a decade was about to tear through this quaint little area.

   A young woman, well loved by most all in the area as is often the case in close knit towns, was on her way to meet her friends at the coffee shop but never arrived. Things happen, her friends were not too worried about it at the time, but after they tried to contact her that evening and failed, they realized something was amiss. A missing person report was filed with local police, but there were no leads. The single channel of local news shared her story hourly on the TV and local radio broadcast what they knew about the case, which was sadly almost nothing.

   A week passed, and this town which was formerly happy and trusting of all people received another blow to their reality. A second young woman disappeared, this one while walking her dog down a wooded trail. Her dog was found still on the leash, wandering aimlessly, searching for food. The people who found the dog knew something was wrong immediately, as he was never allowed far from her side. Again, a missing person report was filed but with no leads. It was as if these two women simply stopped existing. No tracks, no clues, no evidence was found.
The town was torn apart. Their way of life would never be the same. No longer did women walk the streets alone without a care in the world. Neighbors began to not trust each other, tasers and pepper spray sold out and the local home security system installer had to hire four new employees just to keep up with new clients.

   After a month, when all hope was lost and most secretly suspected the women were dead while trying to keep a positive outlook, the incredible happened. As a woman walked alone to check the mail at the end of her street, nervously glancing into the bushes due to her new found fear, a man came up behind her, covered her mouth with one hand, pinned both arms with his free arm and started dragging her into the bushes. She was sure she was soon to be the third victim, and this thought led her to find new strength. She wrestled as mightily as she ever had in her life, and managed to slip one arm free of his grasp. With a quickness born of desperation, she was able to grab and deploy her taser. Immediately he flopped to the ground, writhing. Now freed, she shouted for help, all the while still pumping the volts into her would be abductor. There was no way she would let him escape, only to do this again to another woman.

   The townspeople came quickly, and the man was surrounded. A policeman had been nearby, and quickly placed the man in handcuffs. A cheer went out, the town knew they had their man. Already they hoped their lives would return to normal. They missed the peace and tranquility they had enjoyed just a month previous.

   However, it would not be so easy to return to normal. You see, the two women he abducted were still missing. The man would not disclose their location. Multiple investigators questioned him, and he never would give a straight answer as to where they could be found. Sometimes he seemed about to give the location, only to stop and talk about something else. Frustration set in, and while you'll never read it on a official report, the local police got physical with him. Many of them were fathers and had daughters who were now young women, they were all too aware that one of their daughters could be one of the missing. The man still wouldn't tell the truth, he just kept following the pattern of starting to explain where they were, but then stopping and saying something else.

   Hope was pretty well lost, after three days the town was afraid the women would have possibly been without food or water for too long to survive, if they were even still alive. But then a miracle happened. A man was driving down a back road to his house and saw two bodies by the side of the road, one unconscious and one nearly so, each wearing only underwear. It was the abducted women. They had obviously been beaten. They were bruised on their inner thighs, the front of their hips and around their bellybutton area. The conscious woman stayed with it long enough to let their rescuer know they were indeed the women who had been abducted earlier but had managed to escape after the abductee didn't return for days, then she too lost consciousness. The person who found them called 911 as he picked up their bodies and placed them into his car, letting them know to expect them soon at the hospital.

   The medical staff was waiting and brought the women immediately into the intensive care unit. Due to their lack of almost all clothing and significant bruising all around the pubic area, they feared these women had been raped for the last month. As they worked to get the women conscious again, someone called the police chief letting him know the women were found, that they were alive, and their physical condition including the suspected rapes.
The police held nothing back, they each took turns pummeling the man until he was nearly unable to speak. They wanted to know what transpired in the month he had the women at his mercy. But yet again, the man would start to tell the story, then talk about something else. They never could get a good answer out of him. Finally, one policeman couldn't take it any more and punched the man with such force, his neck broke and his miserable life ended there in the cold interrogation room. Small towns have a way of sticking together, and the other police assured him they would contrive a story which kept him from ever seeing prison time for killing the man.

   In two days, one of the women regained consciousness. She immediately asked where she was and if she was safe, and when the nurses assured her she was, she burst into tears. Her ordeal was over. All she was left with was massive bruising from the time she was captive. The tests done while she was unconscious indicated there was no sexual abuse during her time with the man, all signs indicated she was not raped and yet the bruises seemed to indicate otherwise. A doctor and a policeman questioned her together, and she adamantly denied ever being sexually abused by the man. She was quite positive that all he ever did was hit her and the other woman on their inner thighs, their hips and the lower part of their stomachs. He never even acted like he wanted to have sex with them, they only had their clothes removed because he seemed to get a thrill from watching their flesh turn red as he hit them with his hands and other objects. It was a puzzle, no one could determine why he did this.

   Later that day, the other woman awoke and told the same story. He had never raped either of them, never acted interested in anything other than hitting them all in the general area of their genitals. Other than that, he actually took good care of them. During that month, he fed them and gave them water whenever they asked. Emboldened by his kind attitude except during the times he was beating them, they finally asked why he was doing this. Why does he treat them so well, but then cause them so much pain and bruising? Showing the typical behavior as he did during police questioning, he never gave them a straight answer. He would start to, but then talk about something else. This became an almost daily occurrence, and they never could figure out his motive.

   When it came down to it, no one really knows why the man did what he did. It seems he just really liked to beat around the bush.",Abducted,25

One day the great philosopher came upon an acquaintance, who ran up to him excitedly and said, ""Socrates, do you know what I just heard about one of your students...?""

""Wait a moment,"" Socrates replied. ""Before you tell
me, I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called
the Test of Three.""

""Test of Three?""

""That's correct,"" Socrates continued.

""Before you talk to me about my student let's take a
moment to test what you're going to say. The first
test is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what
you are about to tell me is true?""

""No,"" the man replied, ""actually I just heard about it.""

""All right,"" said Socrates. ""So you don't really know
if it's true or not. Now let's try the second test,
the test of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me
about my student something good?""

""No, on the contrary...""

""So,"" Socrates continued, ""you want to tell me
something bad about him even though you're not certain
it's true?""

The man shrugged, a little embarrassed.
Socrates continued, ""You may still pass though because
there is a third test - the filter of Usefulness. Is what you
want to tell me about my student going to be useful to me?""

""No, not really...""

""Well,"" concluded Socrates, ""if what you want to tell
me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell
it to me at all?""

The man was defeated and ashamed and said no more.

This is the reason Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.

It also explains why Socrates never found out that Plato was banging his wife. ",Socrates Gossip,18

A life spent with a woman who never listens to me and doesn't even know my likes and dislikes. This life is for nothing. It's a failure.

The Scot then bites his sandwiches and he says ""As if it were a fucking scripted joke, I've got gherkins on mine again. Same story! I tell you what, if I get gherkins again I'll jump with you."" 
Then the Irish fellow bites his sandwiches and says ""Turkey! I'm a vegetarian! I tell you what lads, we got this high together, let's all go down together. If I've got turkey tomorrow, I'll jump too.

So the next day comes and it's lunch time. The Englishman opens his sandwich and drops his head, ""Sorry lads. It's my time."" He throws his cheese and onion sandwich to the ground, walks to the edge and jumps. The Scot follows by checking his sandwich. Sure enough there are gherkins, ""Right Paddy, I'll see you on the other side."" and he jumps too. The Irish man checks his: turkey. ""Unbelievable."" He walks to the edge and jumps too.

There is a wake held for the men and their wives meet. The Englishman's wife is crying as she says ""I don't understand it, we were so close and so open with everything. If he'd only said he didn't like onions I wouldn't have put them on his sandwiches.""

Since it was the beginning of the month, John started working harder than usual to gain more trust from his boss. At the end of the 29th day, he was very excited. On the next day, without even having breakfast, he jumped right onto his car and drove to work. He was a bit late, but he arrived relatively quickly.

Upon arriving, he noticed a truck loaded with about 50 kilograms of fruits parked next to the building. He did not understand what was going on, but kept going and entered his workplace. As he went inside the building, he saw his boss and a bunch of other employees gathered around a discussion table. Here, John started to feel confused.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around.  I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before for this homeless man.

""I want a nine inch dick. What do I have to do?""

""It's simple,"" said the shaman. ""Look down at the jungle. Do you see that tree with the white bark?""

""Yes, I see it.""

""Pry off some of the bark from that tree. About two handfuls will do.""

""Is that it?""

""No. Do you see that creek down there? Take this bottle and fill it to the top with water from that creek.""

""Ok, so the tree bark and the water. Anything else?""

""One last thing. On your way up the mountain, did you see a bush with purple berries on it?""

""Yes, several of them.""

""Bring me three of those purple berries, and then we'll get to work.""

So the man goes down the mountain. He collects two handfuls of the tree bark and stores them in his bag. He fills the bottle with water from the creek and puts it in his bag. On the way back up the mountain, he picks three of the purple berries and carefully puts them in his shirt pocket.

After reaching the mountaintop for the second time in a day, the man is exhausted. Gasping for air, he hands his bag to the shaman. He fishes the berries out of his shirt pocket and places them in the shaman's hand. 

""Good,"" says the shaman. ""Now you can rest. I will take care of the next part.""

The shaman sits down and puts the tree bark into a stone bowl. Over the course of an hour, he grinds all of the bark into a fine powder. He slices the three purple berries in half and squeezes the juice over the powdered tree bark. He uncorks the bottle of water from the creek and he pours it into the bowl, little by little, as he stirs it with a wooden spoon. Once he has stirred in all of the water, the mixture reaches a pudding-like consistency.

""Ok,"" says the shaman. ""You'll need to disrobe for this next part.""

The man, still weak from his climb, stands up and slowly strips down to his birthday suit. The shaman stands and hands him the bowl.

""Take this.""

The man looks at the contents of the bowl for a second. He asks ""So do I just rub this on my penis?""

While Tyrion and Cersei are trading insults, Jaime notices the glitter of gold in the distance.

""Do you see that?"" he interrupts. The three of them go and investigate. Lo and behold, they find a golden lamp. Tyrion, having read about such treasures, cannot overcome the urge to rub the lamp. As expected, a genie comes out.

""Thank you so much!"", the genie says, ""I've been trapped in that lamp since before the doom of Valyria. To thank you all, I will grant each of you one wish. Who will go first?""

Tyrion begins to speak, but Cersei immediately interrupts, ""I am the eldest. I should go first!""

The genie agrees, ""Very well then. Cersei, what is your wish?""

Cersei gives Tyrion an evil look and says confidently, ""I wish Tyrion had never been born!""

Tyrion then speaks, ""Wait a minute, I..."" but the genie makes some magical gestures and Tyrion disappears.

""That is horrible!"", Jaime exclaims, ""How could you do that to our brother?"" Cersei shrugs and smiles.

""Your wish, Ser Jaime?"", the genie intervenes.

""I would like to undo Cersei's wish... I wish for you to bring my brother back,"" Jaime quickly responds.

After some magical gestures, Tyrion reappears. An expression of disappointment on Cersei's face soon becomes one of worry as she realizes that Tyrion still has a wish. Jaime soon makes the same realization and also begins to worry.

""It is your turn to make a wish, Tyrion,"" the genie says.

Tyrion thinks for a moment, looks at Cersei, and then makes his wish.

The second of the men thinks for a moment, then rushes forward. Upon leaping from the cliff's edge, he yells ""A billionaire!"" There is another flash of light, and the man's landing is cushioned by an enormous pile of cash.

Several hours pass as the third man contemplates his situation. The sun starts to set as he makes lists of animals and abstract concepts, weighing the pros and cons of each. He considers how his life might change, and what his future might hold.

After following the voice through the dense vegetation he finds a mouse stuck in quicksand. The mouse desperately begs the elephant for help. Knowing that the mouse will die if he does nothing, the elephant whips out his dick, tells the mouse to grab the head, and slowly backs up, pulling the mouse out of the quicksand. The mouse, being overjoyed with just being saved promises the elephant he will return the favor. The elephant simply walks away, thinking ""what could a tiny mouse ever do for me"".

A few days later that same mouse is walking down the same path, when he hears a loud voice cry for help. The mouse follows the voice through the jungle, only to find the same elephant stuck in the same quicksand. The elephant begs for help, pointing out that the mouse owes him. The mouse, agreeing to help, quickly runs away, only to return a few minutes later with a beautiful brand new corvette. The mouse attaches a rope to the back of the corvette, tosses the other end to the elephant, and slowly pulls the elephant out of the quicksand.

The moral of the story: if you have a big dick you don't need a corvette.

The man moves to an island in Northern Europe with pasture as far as the eye can see and no other houses for miles. After a year of writing he starts to feel lonely. Then, he hears a booming knock on his door. When he opens it there is a giant mountain of a man standing at his doorstep; his beard reaches to his belly and his arms are as thick as tree trunks. The huge man speaks and it sounds like thunder:

""I see you've been living here awhile and I thought you might be feeling a wee bit lonely. So, I thought I'd invite you to a party.""

The writer is very intimidated by the man but the thought of this party does get him excited. He just wants some details before he agrees. He asks, ""Will there be food?""

""Aye!"" the giant replies, ""Your gut will be next to bursting and you'll need to buy a new belt before the night is through.""

""Well that sounds great, but what about drinks?"" the writer asks. 

The giant laughs, ""Aye, you'll drink so much you'll forget your own name.""

The man is starting to really get excited now, ""Oh boy,  will there be dancing?""

""You'll spin and twirl all night until you can no longer stand"" the giant explains. 

The man, now getting into it and feeling a little bold asks, ""What about sex?""

""Of course!"" the giant yells, ""All kinds of hair pulling, squealing like a pig sex that will make you walk weird for a month!""

The man is now practically glowing with excitement, ""Oh wow, that sounds like a blast. Do you need me to bring anything?""

The giant then leans down and says, ""No I think I should have enough. It will just be the two of us""",A New York writer is tired of all the people and noise of the big city,120
