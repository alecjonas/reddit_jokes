The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50.  
 The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.   
The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.   


The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. The first guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.   
The second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.   
The third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.   


The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. The first guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him anymore.   
The second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.   
The third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.   


The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. The first guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.""   
The second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

He couldn’t talk nor ask for another wish, so the boy was stuck this way. DJ Khaled returned to his son’s room to find that he had been turned into an instrument, and vowed to help him however he could. Days of physical therapy turned to weeks, and weeks to months as the boy tried to move anything at all.

'Well, I suppose the blessed Saint Peter himself was a fisherman. Perhaps I'll try my hand,' says the priest.

Father Conor sits down and casts his line. After a few minutes he gets a bite and reels in a fat ten-pounder. He's pleased as punch as his parishioner slaps him on the back and says, 'That's a great big fucker, Father!'

'Language!' replies Father Conor. 'I am a priest.'

'No, Father, this fish is called a fucker,' explains the angler, thinking on his feet.

Laughing at the misunderstanding, the proud priest takes his catch home and finds the bishop waiting in his front room.

'That's a splendid looking fish, Father,' exclaims the bishop.

'Aye,' replies the priest, 'it's a great fucker.'

'Please, Father! Such language,' says the bishop. 

'No, no, Your Grace,' replies the priest, 'fucker is the name of the fish.'

It being Friday, the reassured bishop suggests they repair to his residence for a fine fish supper. Once there the bishop goes to the kitchen to clean and gut the fish. They are then joined by the mother superior of the local convent. Being no great cook himself, the bishop says, 'Reverend Mother, would you mind poaching this fucker for us?'

'Bishop, you cannot say that in the house of God,' gasps the horrified nun.

'You misunderstand, Reverend Mother,' explains the bishop, 'this fish is called a fucker.'

Calm again, the Mother Superior sets to cooking the fish. Shortly they are joined by the Pope, who is making a surprise visit (as he does). Delighted, the bishop invited him to supper.

They sit down at the table and the Pope says grace. Then the mother superior brings in the fish on the finest silver platter. Eagerly the three of them await the opinion of God's Mouthpiece on Earth. 

'That is a fine fish,' remarks the impressed pontiff.

'That it is, Your Holiness. I caught the fucker,' says the beaming priest.

'I cleaned the fucker,' adds the bishop.

'And I cooked the fucker,' chips in the mother superior.

The bank officer told him that the bank would need some form of security for the loan, so the old cowboy handed over the keys to a new Ferrari. The car was parked on the street in front of the bank. The ole cowboy produced the title and everything checked out. The loan officer agreed to hold the car as collateral for the loan and apologized for having to charge 12% interest.

Later, the bank's president and its officers all enjoyed a good laugh at the cowboy from the south for using a $250,000 Ferrari as collateral for a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drove the Ferrari into the bank's private underground garage and safely parked it.

Two weeks later, the ole cowboy returned, repaid the $5,000 and the interest of $23.07. The loan officer said, 'Sir, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out on Dunn &amp; Bradstreet and found that you are a Distinguished Alumni From Texas A&amp;M, a highly sophisticated investor and a multi-millionaire with real estate and financial interests all over the world.

He calmly told them, “I bought it today.”

“With what money?” Demanded his parents. “We know how much a Porsche costs!”

“Well,” said the boy, “this one cost me fifteen dollars.”

The parents began to yell even louder. “Who would sell a car like this for fifteen dollars!?” They asked.

“It was the lady up the street,” said the boy, “don’t know her name— they just moved in. She saw me ride past on my bike and asked me if I wanted to buy a Porsche for fifteen dollars.”

“Oh my goodness!” Gasped the mother, “she must be a child abuser! Who knows what she will do next? John, you go right up there and see what’s going on.”

So the boy’s father walked up the street to the house where the lady lived and found her out in her yard calmly planting flowers. He introduced himself as the father of the boy she sold the Porsche to for fifteen dollars and demanded to know why.

“Well,” she said, “this morning I got a phone call from my husband. I thought he was on a business trip, but I learned from a friend he has run off to Hawaii with his secretary and really doesn’t intend to come back. He claimed he was really stranded and asked me to sell his new Porsche and send him the money. So I did.”",A 15 year old boy comes home with a Porsche,22252

A week later the monkey and the man returned to the bar. He orders a beer and just like the last time, the monkey starts jumping all over the place, grabs a maraschino cherry off the bar, sticks it up his butt, pulls it out and eats it.

I hadn't put my own picture up on my dating profile, just a picture of my pickup. But that's okay, because she'd just put a picture of her dog. I sent her a message, something almost-clever like ""your dog can ride in my pickup any time,"" and she responded.

We clicked pretty quickly, and started chatting regularly. Every day, sometimes throughout the day. Slowly we learned more about each other. Her dog's name was Daisy. My truck's name was Dodge Ram (I apologized for my lack of creativity). She was a CPA. I was a beekeeper.

And at this, she stumbled. ""If we ever meet in real-life, I want you to know that I could never date a beekeeper."" But we were still far away from that point, so it was moot.

But time went on, and we gradually became closer to that point. More personal information. What firm she worked for. Where my farm was. Names of relatives. Names of high schools. All the things that just come up in conversation eventually if you talk to someone long enough.

But, oddly, after all this time, neither of us had thought to send any pictures. Until one day I got a message from her: ""I never thought I'd say this, but I really do want to meet you in person. I think we have a rare connection, and I don't want to squander it. I want to send you my picture, and I want you to send me yours, but I'm telling you, I can never date a beekeeper.""

I couldn't imagine a life without my bees. But I also couldn't imagine a life without her. Tentatively, reluctantly, I clicked on the image attached to her message.

Then I saw her face. Now I'm a bee leaver.",The Bee Story,34

No matter what the crowd tried the trapeze artist could not be forced to fall off the trapeze rope. The line slowly dwindled down to two people-Muhammed Ali and a German who spoke poor English. 
Muhammed Ali stepped close to the trapeze rope and started punching it. His punches were so quick that no one could follow them, like blurs in the air. To everyone's shock the trapeze artist Ali held his position even though the rope was swinging through very big arc. 
After 10 minutes of punching, Muhammed Ali finally gave up. The German immediately stepped up. The crowd now in complete awe of the artist, believed the German had no chance. 
The German went below the artist reached up, caught his legs and pulled him down. The crowd was completely shocked at such a move. 
The German turned around, looked at Muhammed Ali, and said,"" Sometimes you don't need a punchline""",A trapeze artist bet a crowd of people that no matter what they did he could still remain perfectly balanced on his rope.,1

You could not find one without the other two nearby. But, as so often happens, after graduation, they all went their separate ways.  
One of the friends went on to become a very successful defense attorney. Top of his class at Harvard Law, opened his own firm, made everyone back home very proud. Second friend went to business school, did alright, works a pretty standard white-collar office job. Last friend kind of became a burnout. Doesn't really do anything except smoke, drink, and live in his mom's basement. We'll call them Lawyer, Business School, and Burnout.  


Well, ten years has pass, and then their school throws a High School reunion. For the first time since high school, all three are going to be in the same town at the same time. So, naturally, they decide to get together. The plan is to go grab some drinks the night before the Class Reunion, but in ten years they have become very different people, with very different tastes. Lawyer only wants to drink wine. Business School only wants to drink beer. And Burnout, true to form, only wants to drink spiked punch.  


So, they first go to a bar. The bartender has beer, but no wine, and no spiked punch. Then they go to a lounge. The lounge has beer and wine, but no punch to drink. They drive all over town, but no matter where they go, no business has the combination of all three. After about two hours of this, Burnout has an idea. He thinks they should find a college party to crash, since there is bound to be all sorts of alcohol there. It takes some hemming and hawing, but eventually he convinces the other two. After all, it's the first time in ten years they have seen each other. Why not?  


So, they drive to the college district, and they find a frat house with an insane party going on. This thing is so crazy people are lining up out the door just to get in. They know this is the one. So they get in line, and after a while, they make it inside the house.  


The inside is even crazier. People everywhere, lights and music, guys hanging from chandeliers. This is DEFINITELY the right place. They are really excited to finally live it up after a night of searching. Thing is, there are so many people here that there are queues just to get the drinks. The Lawyer still wants wine, so he gets in the wine line. Business School still wants beer, so he gets in the beer line. And Burnout still wants punch, but there is no punch line.",There were once three friends who were absolutely inseparable in high school.,26

She said yes!

We were so happy together and we stayed together through high school. We both finished college together, we both got jobs together and eventually we both bought a house.

One day at work this new guy comes in called joe and it says he has a confidential past and he never seemed to want to talk about where he was from so me and my coworkers never found out where he was from. Me and joe both talk together but I wouldn’t say we were best friends. A couple weeks later joe comes in late and sad. He explains that he was evicted from his last house and was broke. Feeling bad for him, I offer to let him stay at our place in the guest room to which he accepts immediately and looks like he just won the lottery.

Now, I worked 9-5 and joe worked 8-4 so he would get home before me and chill in his room trying to find an apartment somewhere.

One day I decide I want to pop the question to my girlfriend so I buy a ring and invite her out to a nice restaurant. Once we finish desert I get down on one knee and pop the question to her. She tears up but explains how joe had been sexually touching and abusing her while I was away.

Furious I pay and bolt it back to the house where he’s sat in the living room watching tv. I walk up to him and punch him right in the eye. His eye swells up like cotton and I yell at him to pack up and leave immediately.

Over the next couple months I help her recover from it and about a year later we get married and she accepts.

About two years after joe left we had moved to another town about an hour away and while walking to work I run into an old friend and we have a little chat about our workplaces. He explains he works at a company as a manger and recruits new people often. I ask about any new people he’s signed and he explains a man called joe that came in. I ask about the last name and yep. It’s THAT joe.

My mind starts wizzing and I tell my friend,

He said I’ll tell y’all what. “I’ll take y’all up and if y’all don’t make a peep,I won’t charge y’all a dime” I looked at Deb and said come on! So this guys takes just Deb and I up and start doing some crazy stuff,doing loops,flying sideways and going nutz. As we are landing he says “I can’t believe it! Y’all didn’t make a peep” Well then I chime in and say “ well I thought about saying something when Deb fell out of the helicopter but a hundred bucks is a hundred bucks”",My first helicopter ride,6

A man, about 50, came in with walking difficulties - you could tell he was really struggling when he arrived at the surgery and even looked uncomfortable when he sat down. I was expecting a leg, hip or even back complaint but once the door was shut he admitted that it was his testicles. I got him to undress and the problem was immediately obvious - his balls were huge!

Initial examination showed they were highly tender and I was thinking it could be my first case of elephantitis. However, when asking him about his sexual history I soon realised the issue was psychological - he was so anxious about sex that he'd never ejaculated, which had then lead to his balls becoming hugely swollen. I was a bit unsure but decided the best thing to do was dose him up on diazepam, give him some kj jelly and leave him in a cubicle with the Internet and a box of tissues to ""relieve the pressure"".

Ten minutes went by during which I heard some little whimpers then eventually what sounded worryingly like a clogged sink coming unblocked. He called me in sheepishly and the scene that greeted me was something I'll never forget. There was ejacuate all over the chair, himself, the curtains. It's was crazy, i'd never seen anything like it. I managed to keep my professional face on just long enough to assure him it was okay and for him to explain that much of the pain had gone. 

I gave him a prescription for mild painkillers and asked him to come back in a month. That was 20 years ago and I often wondered what happened to him. However, sadly I saw in the obituary pages that he'd recently died of testicular complications.

In fact, you can no longer effect your political opinion by choosing a candidate who is not racist, because, well, they all are, according to fox.

Ten years ago sexism was something people cared about. But hearing about it enough would make anyone apathetic, and that's pretty much what happened.

We're distracted, America. What seems like a big deal to us - probably isn't. Not when a decade lasts only ten years and empires rise and fall in that time. What seems like it goes on forever quickly diminishes as soon as it's noticed it is there. What goes up must come down.

People are starving. People are ACTUALLY being raped and murdered. And you want to complain about something someone said? Grow the fuck up, ""liberals"". ""Democrats"". ""Republicans"". All words that mean the same thing over time: give us control. As if that were possible.

Did you come here looking for a joke? Of so, don't look at the president. Look at everyone talking shit about their own blessed country. Haha. Stupid af. Grow up.",Ten years ago racism was something everyone took seriously.,0

But that's okay, because she'd just put a picture of her dog.  I sent her a message, something almost-clever like ""your dog can ride in my pickup any time,"" and she responded.

We clicked pretty quickly, and started chatting regularly.  Every day, sometimes throughout the day.  Slowly we learned more about each other.  Her dog's name was Daisy.  My truck's name was Dodge Ram (I apologized for my lack of creativity).  She was a CPA.  I was a beekeeper.

And at this, she stumbled.  ""If we ever meet in real-life, I want you to know that I could never date a beekeeper.""  But we were still far away from that point, so it was moot.

But time went on, and we gradually became closer to that point.  More personal information.  What firm she worked for.  Where my farm was.  Names of relatives.  Names of high schools.  All the things that just come up in conversation eventually if you talk to someone long enough.

But, oddly, after all this time, neither of us had thought to send any pictures.  Until one day I got a message from her: ""I never thought I'd say this, but I really do want to meet you in person.  I think we have a rare connection, and I don't want to squander it.  I want to send you my picture, and I want you to send me yours, but I'm telling you, I can never date a beekeeper.""

I couldn't imagine a life without my bees.  But I also couldn't imagine a life without her.  Tentatively, reluctantly, I clicked on the image attached to her message.

Then I saw her face.  Now I'm a bee leaver.

She paused for a few moments, needing time to reflect on all those years. After a short time, a smile came to her face and she answered proudly, explaining that she had first married a banker when she was in her early 20's, then a circus ringmaster when in her 40's, and a preacher when in her 60's, and now in her 80's, a funeral director.

The interviewer looked at her, quite astonished, and asked why she had married four men with such diverse careers.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living. (Long but worth the read),9

Before he re-entered the lander, he made the enigmatic remark “Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.”Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut. 

However, upon checking, [they found] there was no Gorsky in either the Russian or American space programs.

Over the years, many people have questioned him as to what the “Good luck, Mr. Gorsky” statement meant. 

On July 5, in Tampa Bay, FL, while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26- year-old question to Armstrong. He finally responded. It seems that Mr. Gorsky had died and so Armstrong felt he could answer the question. When he was a kid, Neil was playing baseball with his brother in the backyard. His brother hit a fly ball which landed in front of his neighbors’ bedroom window. The neighbors were Mr. and Mrs. Gorsky. As he leaned down to pick up the ball, he heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky, “Oral sex? Oral sex you want?

Billy comes up to Steve and says, ""Yo steve, you know you can't say purple socks anymore?""

In disbelief, Steve says, ""What? Yes I can.""

So Steve goes up to his teacher and asks, ""Miss, why is Billy saying I can't say purple socks anymore?""

Shocked, the teacher turns to Steve and expels him on the spot.

Confused, Steve calls his mom to ask for a ride home.

""Why do you need picking up from school?"" asks Steve's mom.

""I was expelled for saying purple socks,"" replies Steve.

Instantly, his mom hangs up.

Steve now has to walk home, but on the way back he sees a police car.

The policeman asks Steve, ""Why aren't you in school kid?""

""I was expelled for saying purple socks,"" replies Steve.

The policeman instantly arrests Steve. He goes to trial, everyone hates him and he gets sentenced to 60 years in prison.

Steve gets to prison and decides that he's never going to say purple socks again, it's got him into enough trouble, he doesn't want anymore, never saying it again.

He serves his 60 years in prison and is finally let out. The first thing Steve does is track down Billy and goes to his house to find out why he was sent to prison.

""Is that you Steve?"" asks Billy, ""I haven't seen you in ages.""

Steve angrily says to Billy, ""I was arrested for saying purple socks and I want to know why!""

""Well why didn't you listen to me when I said you can't say purple socks anymore?"" replies Billy, ""Anyway, if you want to find out why you can't say purple socks, you're going to have to go the bakery opposite the school. The woman in there with the purple hair will tell you everything.""

Steve quickly proceeds to the school. His curiosity and excitement grows as he's finally going to find out why he was put in prison for saying purple socks.

He gets to the school and sees the bakery opposite the school. He's looking from across the street to try and see the woman with the purple hair.

Just as Steve is about to give up hope, a woman with purple hair comes out from the back.

Steve now knows that this is the right bakery, all his questions are going to be answered.

Without hesitation, he quickly starts to make his way across the road towards the bakery as a car is coming down the road, which hits Steve and he dies.",Purple Socks,0

The king asked his swordmaster once more.

""That's a flèche your Majesty.""

The king nodded.

The first fencer did another attack. This time, the crowd booed, jeered and abused him viciously.

The king, puzzled, asked his swordmaster about the crowd's reaction.

""Well, your Majesty. It's a riposte.""",A king was visiting the training grounds with his swordmaster,34

A rollercoaster with 110 foot drops at 75mphs baby. 
Lets get excited!!! 

I Start off yelling at the car ahead of me, noticing his license plate, I give em a good... 

HEY!... 
FROM WISCONSIN HUH? Thats cool...
And Ill do my best to keep that going with the always great.
ITS A NICE DAY FOR THIS.
Prime time for this rare conversation is when Mr. Wisconsin is ordering.
Welcome to burgers n shit how may take your order?
Yeah ill have..
HEY! FROM WISCONSIN HUH? Thats cool...

Guy's looking back at his passenger like what the fuck? 

This ensures a 90% chance of safety. 
I mean who leaves the intercom after you've finally made it there.

Usually you got that one guy thats just had it with waiting and decides to pull out.
He'll have to slowly drive around all the cars ahead of him to leave. 
Just like when someone gets scared at the park taking that shameful walk out of line. 

Passing all the dicks shouting out their brand new nickname, PUSSY!!!
I always hated that shit. 

So as he's passing me I like to shout 
HEY!!! 
HANG IN THERE MAN I BELIEVE IN YOU!!!

Sometimes you'll get that road raged loose cannon type. 
He'll slam on his brakes and get out like,
What did you say to me?

Pull through because after you clarify you said I believe in you whats he going to do besides say thank you.
A guy that got out to beat your ass at the drive through hasnt heard some one say they believed in them since before they started smoking meth.

Its always nice when you get that one fast food spot with two intercoms. Now that is your only chance at cutting in line.
Its way too difficult to do a rollercoaster cutsies in a single line but if you aim towards right after you order you can land it where the two lines merge back together.
    and you always have to cut at an angle too, to the point when the guy you just cut  gets to stare at you awkwardly through your passenger window for the next two minutes waiting for the line to move.

Definitely watch for the bird and a fierce gaze.

After you let him stew for a minute just look over and say... 
Hey!... 
From Denver huh? Thats cool...

As the door opens, he glimpses next to the roof a small fish moving its tail gracefully.

**Tenant**: Oh here you are, how dare to ask such a rent for this crappy house??

**Landlord**: I'm not following you. What seems to be the problem?

**T**: Are you kidding me? This place is a living zoo, all sorts of pests and bugs keep me company day and night. This is a glorious breeding ground, I'm not even sure who should pay the rent, me or the bugs?

**L**: I'm shocked at what you say, I'm sure you are overreacting. Surely its not the cleanest place around but as I see this right now, it looks very clean...

**L**: Really? Watch this...

The tenant takes a small piece of cheese, moves to the center of the room and lets it drop to the ground. The very moment the small piece bounces to the ground, the place bloats in spiders, cockroaches, mice, worms, ants and every other living creature of nature coming out from everywhere. In a couple of seconds, the pests and cheese disappear and everything looks normal again.
The landlord's dismay over that shocking view was evident and try to apologize.

**L**: I'm so sorry, I really had no idea about this. I'll certainly cut down the rent you pay, hope this settles the problem for now perhaps?

**T**: That's a good start. I have to go now to eat something outside, I can't really eat in here, no food survives.

**L**: Good... I have one more
