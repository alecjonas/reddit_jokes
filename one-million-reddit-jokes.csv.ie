He asks his friend how to spot a hooker, to which his friend says,” I know the perfect place, just meet me at the old Riverside Run Bar and Grill tonight.”

Although he was hesitant, his hormones get the best of him so that night he goes and meets his friend at the bar.

They’re hanging around when they spot a very beautiful woman, dressed in all red, who keeps walking outside with men and coming back in with wads of cash. 

Finally after working a bit of courage he goes to the woman and asks if she’s available for work tonight. 

The woman replies,”Yes, it’s $500 for hand job.” 

“$500?! You’ve got to be kidding me!”

The hooker grabs him by his arm and leads him outside in front of the bar. “You see that new Corvette? I bought that with the money from my handjobs alone.”

The man thinks for a second, finally agreeing to it.

He hands her $500, they get into the Corvette and he gets the best hand job he’s ever had in his life, he has the biggest orgasm he’s ever had and is completely satisfied.

A few weeks ago by and the man is getting desperate again as dating is still going nowhere, so he decides to hit her up once again. 

“Are you available for work tonight? The handjob was great but I’d love to see how you are with your mouth.”

“Of course,” she says. “It’s $2,000 for a blowjob.”

“$2,000?! You can’t be serious! That expensive hand job is one thing, but $2,000 is almost my entire take-home pay for a month!”

She grabs him by the arm and takes him outside. “You see this bar here? I bought the Riverside Run Bar and Grill with the money from my blowjobs alone.”

Shocked, but in belief from their first encounter, he hands over $2,000. She takes him to the alley next to the bar and gives him the best blowjob he’s ever had. He cums even harder this time and can barely walk. He’s completely satisfied. 

A few months go by and he shows up one night at the bar and sees the hooker again. 

“I’ve saved up for three and a half months, I have about $5,000. I’ve gotta have some of that pussy! If I need more I can get it.”

She grins devilishly and grabs him by the arm and leads him outside once again. 

She looks across the river next to the bar. You see the new island where they’re building that new theme park and shopping plaza?”

“Holy fuck...” he gasps. You mean to tell me...”

“Nah,” she says,”But if I had a pussy I’d own that motherfucker.”

I am well. Hope youse are too. Tell me big brothers Doug and Phil that the Army is better than workin’ on the farm - tell them to get in quick smart before the jobs are all gone! I wuz a bit slow in settling down at first, because ya don’t hafta get outta bed until 6am. But I like sleeping in now, cuz all ya gotta do before brekky is make ya bed and shine ya boots and clean ya uniform. No cows to milk, no calves to feed, no feed to stack - nothin’!! Ya haz gotta shower though, but its not so bad, coz there’s lotsa hot water and even a light to see what ya doing!

At brekky ya get cereal, fruit and eggs but there’s no kangaroo steaks or possum stew like wot Mum makes. You don’t get fed again until noon and by that time all the city boys are dead because we’ve been on a ’route march’ - geez its only just like walking to the windmill in the back paddock!!

This one will kill me brothers Doug and Phil with laughter. I keep getting medals for shootin’ - dunno why. The bullseye is as big as a possum’s bum and it don’t move and it’s not firing back at ya like the Johnsons did when our big scrubber bull got into their prize cows before the Ekka last year! All ya gotta do is make yourself comfortable and hit the target! You don’t even load your own cartridges, they comes in little boxes, and ya don’t have to steady yourself against the rollbar of the roo shooting truck when you reload!

Sometimes ya gotta wrestle with the city boys and I gotta be real careful coz they break easy - it’s not like fighting with Doug and Phil and Jack and Boori and Steve and Muzza all at once like we do at home after the muster.

Turns out I’m not a bad boxer either and it looks like I’m the best the platoon’s got, and I’ve only been beaten by this one bloke from the Engineers - he’s 6 foot 5 and 15 stone and three pick handles across the shoulders and as ya know I’m only 5 foot 7 and eight stone wringin’ wet, but I fought him till the other blokes carried me off to the boozer.

I can’t complain about the Army - tell the boys to get in quick before word gets around how good it is.

The mechanic says to the penguin, “Unfortunately our ice machine is broken, pal... but there is an ice cream shop just down the road and around the corner. That should cool you off!”

The penguin begins waddling down the street to the ice cream parlor, buying the biggest amount he can, FIVE SCOOPS!!! He’s waddling back down to the dealership, just going to town on this ice cream, lapping it up and slobbering it down before re-entering the dealership.

“Boy, that ice cream was delicious!! It really cooled me off!” Said the penguin.

“We looked over your car.” The mechanic said. “It looks like you blew a seal.”

He ate his breakfast, he brushed his teeth, and he packed up all of his homework from the night before.  Little Johnny got himself dressed for the day, kissed his mom on the cheek, and headed out to his regular bus stop.

Little Johnny's best friend was there waiting for the bus as well. 

""Did you finish your project?"" Little Johnny asked as he approached the street corner.

""No,"" his friend replied, ""I uh.. I got caught up on my paper route this morning..it actually was really we-""

""Hey where's the bus?"" Little Johnny interjected, ""I have to present my project on Albert Einstein first thing.""

""I'm not sure Johnny"", his friend offered without much enthusiasm.

""Well we can't just stand here!"" Johnny retorted, as he grabbed his friends hand and headed off up the hill toward school.

After a frantic five minutes of intermittent speed walking and running Little Johnny and his friend approached the next bus stop in the route.  There was a large group of school kids and a general sense of excitement in the air.

""Well look who it is,"" Little Johnny's bully called out as Little Johnny stepped up onto the sidewalk ""if it isn't Little Johnny.""

""Look I don't have time for your shit today, where's the bus? I have to present my report on Albert Einstein."" Johnny snapped back, not wanting to deal with any shit today as he had to present his report on Albert Einstein.

""Listen, if I knew where the bus driver was do you think I'd be standing here waiting around?"" the bully replied.

As Little Johnny considered the validity of this notion, as well as his options for getting himself to school, a kind voice spoke up louder than the rest of the growing, and increasingly restless collection of school kids,

""I JUST GOT A TEXT!"" a girl yelled as she literally lost her mind.  She somehow managed to read the note she had received.

""SCHOOL IS CANCELLED FOR THE DAY, AS THE BUS DRIVER HAS QUIT HIS JOB!""

and the crowd went wild.  woohoo! huzzah! three cheers for the bus driver!

""Man I wonder why he quit."" Little Johnny wondered aloud to nobody in particular amidst a celebration. ""To think I stayed up all night reading and writing about Albert Einstein and now I can't even show how good of a student I've been.  I hope he's fucking sorry. ""

""Oh he's not fucking sorry"" an upper classman offered.  He had been standing against the fence smoking a cigarette, generally forgotten and unseen.  Eventually, he continued,

""plus haven't you heard? the bus driver is fucking rich!""",Little Johnny's walk to school,1

The man wished for the biggest cock, the strongest toned finest ass, and softest pussy. With a snap of the genie's finger all three wishes were granted. The genie told him to wait for tomorrow for all wishes to take effect. 

The next morning. Upon going outside to the water closet he had to do a double take for his mind couldn't comprehend. Sure enough, he had the biggest cock with girth to match it's size. He also checked his ass and what beauty is was. Strong and toned. The finest he has ever seen. All his friends were in shock from hearing the news. Word spread to all respected professionals in their field they had to see in person. The professionals foamed in their mouths because nothing has been recorded of a great gift bestowed to humanity. Just before the night came the softest pussy arrived at his door. It was a night for the man to remember. Three wishes the genie gave as desired. 

It was a hard decision after a few days thinking but it was well worth the man's time for it was gift more than asked. He auctioned his cock and ass to the highest bidder of the land. The auction winners were in delight to report the ass they bought was the best so much it out classed a team of Clydesdale. The cock produced the best chicks to the farmers delight.

The pussy was soft and beautiful. Giving him comfort every night. A two toned neko of a charcoal gray color. Playful too especially with scritches.

Ojiisan says you a sick person to be thinking what this joke was about. Especially with that pussy.

While on holiday in Kenya and walking through the bush a man comes across an elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seems distressed so the man approaches very carefully. He gets down on one knee and inspects the bottom of the elephant's foot only to find a large thorn deeply embedded. As carefully and as gently as he can he removes the thorn and the elephant gingerly puts its foot down. The elephant turns to face the man and with a rather stern look on its face, stares at him. For a good ten minutes the man stands frozen - thinking of nothing else but being trampled.

Eventually the elephant turns and walks away.

For years after, the man often remembers and ponders the events of that day. Years later the man is walking through the zoo with his son. As they approach the elephant enclosure, one of the elephants turns and walks over to where they are standing at the rail and slowly lifts one leg before lowering it back to the ground. It stares at him and the man can't help wondering if this is the same elephant. The man climbs tentatively over the railing and makes his way into the enclosure. He walks right up to the elephant and stares back in wonder. Suddenly the elephant wraps its trunk around one of the man's legs and swings him wildly back and forth along the railing, instantly killing him.

Probably not the same elephant then.",An Elephant's Memory,25

He stops into a shop one day and when he's finished, he finds that his camel is missing its legs. Shocked, he approaches a bystander and asks if he saw who took his camel's legs. The bystander squints at him, looks at the camel, and says to Shaun ""ah, that would have been the Camel Leg Thief, you can find him that way"".

Shaun sets off in the direction the bystander pointed him in, he walks along desert roads, after an hour he comes across a traveller going in the opposite direction. He tells the traveller his story and asks how much further until he reaches the Camel Leg Thief. The traveller replies ""a long way along the desert, you will need a car"". Shaun walked back to the town, found a car rental branch, hired a car and set off again along the road.

He travels down the road until he reaches a huge lake. A sailor stands by his small rowing boat nearby. Shaun says ""I am looking for the Camel Leg Thief"". The sailor replies ""the Camel Leg Thief lives across the water, but you can rent a boat back in the town"". Running out of patience, Shaun drives back to the town, rents a boat, attaches it to the back of his car and goes back to the water. He gets in the boat and begins rowing across.

He rows for over an hour until he reaches the other side. On the other side is a mountain range. ""I am looking for the Camel Leg Thief"", Shaun tells a local. The local replies ""the Camel Leg Thief lives over the mountains, you can rent hiking gear back in the town"". Shaun is exasperated. ""For fucks sake!"", he exclaims. He gets back in the boat, rows across the water, gets in his car, and drives back to town. He finds a shop and rents hiking gear. He sets back off in the car, to the water, rows back to the mountain range and prepares his climb.

He begins hiking over the mountains, losing track of time as he crosses, and gets to the other side. There he is faced by desert plains, he asks a nomad, ""are you the Camel Leg Thief?"". The nomad tells him ""no, the Camel Leg Thief lives across these plains, but it will be dark soon and you can't cross the plains without warm clothing. There's a clothes shop in the town"". Shaun can't believe it. He hikes back across the mountains, rows across the water, drives back to the town, and finds the clothes shop. There, he buys warm clothing for night time.

He drives back to the water, rows across, hikes over the mountains, and gets to the plains. It is getting dark, so he pulls on the clothing and begins to walk the plains. He walks all night. As the sun rises, he sees a huge palace ahead of him. He enters through the large doors. Inside is a huge room, the grandest room you'll ever see. On a throne, sits a man. ""I am the Camel Leg Thief"", proclaims the man, ""what have you come for?"".

who'd just died is delivered to a local mortuary wearing an expensive, expertly tailored black suit.
 
The female blonde mortician asks the deceased's wife how she would like the body dressed. She points out that the man does look good in the black suit he is already wearing.
 
The widow, however, says that she always thought her husband looked his best in blue, and that she wants him in a blue suit. She gives the Blonde mortician a blank check and says, 'I don't care what it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing.'
 
The widow returns the next day for the wake. To her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly...
 
She says to the mortician, 'Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied... You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?' 

To her astonishment, the blonde mortician presents her with the blank check.
 
'There's no charge,' she says.
 
'No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit!' she says.
 
'Honestly, ma'am,' the blonde says, 'it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit. I asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice.'

-Umm... Two more!

The next second, he had 4 testicles. He quickly got out of the lake and went to the doctor and explained what happened. The doctor said:

-Well, good thing that you chose to have 2 more instead of none at all, since getting a new pair of testicles is impossible. But, unfortunately, because of the way they are connected, if I removed 2 of them, the other two would also fall off. So you either live with 4 fully functional testicles or try to go at the lake and ask for two less this time.

The man took his time and decided to go at the lake again, since no woman would like a guy with 4 balls or no balls at all. So he goes to the secluded lake, gets naked and jump in. After several minutes of swimming, he feels the gentle touch on his balls again. Needless to say, he was relieved that he's gonna get back to normal. And a few seconds later, the voice said:

One day while on one of their walks, the horse fell into a mire, and was steadily sinking.  The horse was getting very afraid and asked the chicken to please hurry and go get help! 

The chicken, thinking quickly, said to the horse, “Don’t Worry!  I’ll go get the Lamb!” and she ran to the barn where the farmer kept an old tractor, and quickly drove it over to where the horse was now neck deep in the mire.  Quick as she could, she tied a rope to the back of the tractor and then tossed the other end to the horse and said, “Here! Grab onto this with your teeth!” The horse did and the chicken pulled the horse out of the mire with the tractor, saving his life.

“Thank you so much!  I knew I could count on you--you’re the best friend a horse could ask for!” the horse cried, happy to be out of danger.

“Of course,” the chicken replied, “I know you would do the same for me.”  And they finished their walk and called it a day.

As it happened, a few months later, it was the chicken that fell in a mire during one of their walks.  Terrified, she cried out, “Quick! Go get the Lamb and help pull me out!”

But the horse didn’t move, he was sizing up the mire, which appeared to be smaller than the one he got stuck in.  “Hold on, I think if I go for the Lamb you’ll be swallowed up by the time I get back. Instead, I think I can stand across this mire, and when I do you should grab that dangly thing between my legs and I’ll pull you out.”  The chicken was dubious, but did as the horse said and in no time flat the chicken was out and back on solid ground.

“Whew, that was good thinking there, friend.  I knew I could count on you!” the chicken exclaimed.

“Well, it just goes to show you,” the horse replied, “you don’t need a Lamborghini to pick up chicks, you just need to be hung like a horse!”",The Chicken and the Horse,10

Naturally, the man was skeptical, but he decided to give it a shot - what did he have to lose, after all? So that very same day he drove south to the swamps, beginning his search for the elusive golden frog. He spent all afternoon, all evening, then all night searching for the frog, to no avail. And then, as if by some miracle, he spotted something gold and shiny perched up on a log. No question about it, it was the golden frog! Ecstatic, the man sneaked up on the frog to make sure he didn't scare it, and when he was close enough asked:

""Golden frog, will you marry me?""

""No,"" responded the frog with a human, female voice. 

The man looked inside his pants and, lo and behold, his penis had visibly shrunk! If the doctor was right, then he was now sitting at 16 inches. It was still unmanageably large, but he was on the right track!

""Golden frog, will you marry me?"" He repeated.

""No,"" the golden frog replied in turn.

Looking inside his pants again, the man noticed another visible shrink! This was amazing! If the doctor was right, then his penis was now only 12 inches! The man decided to ask just once more, since while an 8 inch penis was still very impressive, it was going to be small enough to not interfere with his every day life.

""Golden frog, will you marry me?"" 

""How many times do I have to tell you?"" The frog turned to him, annoyed. ""No, no, no!!!""",A man with a 20 inch penis goes to the doctor,2420

A bored, nearby trooper waiting in his patrol car near the highway hears the gunshot, gets out, and runs into the woods to find Dave holding the duck. 

The trooper yells, pointing at Dave, ""You stop right there! Lemme see that duck!"" 

Dave gives the duck over to the trooper, who proceeds to stick his finger in the ducks ass, pull it out, and sniff it.

""You know... This is a California duck. You need to have a California license to hunt this duck.""

Dave pulls out a California license and hands it to the trooper, who inspects it closely. 

Surprised, the trooper says, ""Well, looks like this is your lucky day, ""Dave"". But I've got my eye on you.""

The trooper leaves, almost making it back to his car, when ***BAM!***, he hears another gunshot. 

""I've got that fucker now."" the trooper said to himself, and runs back out to find Dave, yet again holding up a duck. 

""Stop right there, Dave! Gimme that!"" 

He yanks the duck away from Dave, jams his finger deep into the ducks anus, pulls out his finger, and gives it a big ole whiff. 

He points at Dave with his stinky finger, ""This is a Canadian duck. You better have a Canadian license."" 

Confidently, Dave pulls out a license and hands it to the trooper. The trooper looks at it, and lo-and-behold, it's a Canadian license. 

""Well, ""Dave"", looks like you've skirted by again, but you can't escape the law, forever.""

The trooper grumbles and starts making his way back to his car, when ***BAM!*** he hears yet another gunshot, right behind him. 

He turns around and runs over to Dave, who is, of course, holding another duck. 

The trooper doesn't say a word and storms over to Dave, who calmly hands him the duck as the trooper grabs it, frustratingly. 

The trooper slides his finger into the limp duck's balloon knot and feels around. He slowly pulls his finger out, waving it around and takes in its scent as if he's sampling some new, high-class perfume. He stops and looks at Dave, wearing an impish grin. 

""Now, ""Dave"". This is a..."", he sniffs the air again, ""... this is an almost extinct, Trans-Siberian Duck. If you don't have a Trans-Siberian, Class-A duck-hunting license, I'm going to put you away for a long, long time.""

Dave stops for a moment, pulls out a license, and hands it to the trooper. 

The trooper looks down. Sure enough, it's a Trans-Siberian, Class-A duck-hunting license. 

The trooper collapses to his knees, the license crumpling out of his hands. The trooper is almost speechless and has a bewildered, twisted look on his face. Silence. The wind blows a leaf by, and it is just the two of them, the violated duck by the trooper's side. 

""But... How? Wh--who are you? WHAT... *are you*?"" 

Slowly, Dave turns around and bends down, as if reaching for something. 

But he just turns his head back towards the trooper and finally says, ""I don't know, officer...""

... pulling down his pants, exposing his asshole.

They rub it and a genie appears, the genie is so relieved to be free that he offers each of them three wishes, with the one condition that each man have at least one month between their wishes, they see this as fair and begin to take their first wishes.

Bob wishes to be ten years younger, and boom all of a sudden, he is 27 again and fitter than ever. 

James wishes to never age, and nothing appears to be different, but the genie reassured him that it definitely worked.

Albert gets a sly look on his face and wishes that his left arm will forever rotate counter-clockwise, and immediately it does. 

One month later they all meet up back at the bottle and start the second round of wishes. 

This time Bob wishes for ten billion dollars to be deposited immediately into his bank account, the genie agrees and Bob checks his phone and indeed it worked. 

James then wishes to always be the richest man in the world. Instantaneously hundreds of billions of dollars are in each of his bank accounts. 

Albert, still with his arm spinning, gets the same sly look as before onto his face and wishes that his right arm will forever rotate clockwise, it begins and Albert can barely contain his excitement. 

The three friends go their separate ways and meet up at the same spot exactly one month later. 

This time Bob wishes to be married to the most beautiful wife in the world, instantly an incredibly gorgeous woman appears and declares that she is his wife.

Next James wishes to be so charming that he can get any woman he wants, Bob’s wife then suddenly walks over to James and they begin to make out. 

Albert has the same look on his face as the last two times he got a wish and then wishes that his head would constantly nod back and forth forever. 

The three me once again go their separate ways, after James had gotten the phone number of Bob’s wife, and then don’t see each other for a while. Five years pass and the Bob remembers the incident with the bottle and wants to catch up with his old friends so he invites them over. 

Once James arrives with his entourage of beautiful women, and Albert arrives, still rotating and bobbing, Bob tells them about what has happened in the last five years. 

“Well I invested my money wisely and now I own a tech company that rivals Microsoft and Apple with their profit and customer service, and also my wife is great.”

James speaks next

“Well I have had no need to invest and have continued to be the most sought after man in the world. And you’re correct, your wife *is* great.”

Albert is the last to speak, James and Bob are so confused as to why his wishes had been the way they had been. 

Albert looks them dead in the eyes and says,

“Guys... I think I may have made a mistake!”",Three wishes,12

post,999pza,2qh72,jokes,false,1534906789,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/999pza/lizards/,self.jokes,,"Lizard Birth
 
If you've raised kids (or been one), and gone through the pet syndrome, including toilet flush burials for dead goldfish, the story below will have you laughing out LOUD!
 
 
I had to take my son's lizard to the vet.
 
Here's what happened:
 
Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there was ""something wrong"" with one of the two lizards he holds prisoner in his room.
 
""He's just lying there looking sick,"" he told me. ""I'm serious, Dad. Can you help?""
 
I put my best lizard-healer expression on my face and followed him into his bedroom. One of the little lizards was indeed lyingon his back, looking stressed. I immediately knew what to do.
 
""Honey,"" I called, ""come look at the lizard!""
 
""Oh, my gosh!"" my wife exclaimed. ""She's having babies..""
 
""What?"" my son demanded. ""But their names are Bert and Ernie, Mom!""
 
I was equally outraged.
 
""Hey, how can that be? I thought we said we didn't want them to reproduce,"" I said accusingly to my wife.
 
""Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?"" she inquired. (I think she actually said this sarcastically!)
 
""No, but you were supposed to get two boys!""
 
""Yeah, Bert and Ernie!"" my son agreed.
 
""Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, you know,"" she informed me. (Again with the sarcasm!)
 
By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on. I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it.
 
""Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience,"" I announced. ""We're about to witness the miracle of birth.""
 
""Oh, gross!"" they shrieked.
 
We peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked like a tiny foot would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later.
 
""We don't appear to be making much progress,"" I noted.
 
""It's breech,"" my wife whispered, horrified.
 
""Do something, Dad!"" my son urged.
 
""Okay, okay."" Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next appeared, giving it a gentle tug. It disappeared. I tried several more times with the same results.
 
""Should I call 911?"" my eldest daughter wanted to know.
 
""Maybe they could talk us through the trauma."" (You see a pattern here with the females in my house?)
 
""Let's get Ernie to the vet,"" I said grimly. We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in his lap.
 
""Breathe, Ernie, breathe,"" he urged.
 
The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the little animal through a magnifying glass.
 
""What do you think, Doc, a C-section?"" I suggested scientifically.
 
""Oh, very interesting,"" he murmured. ""Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I speak to you privately for a moment?""
 
I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside.
 
""Is Ernie going to be okay?"" my wife asked.
 
""Oh, perfectly,"" the vet assured us. ""This lizard is not in labor. In fact, that isn't EVER going to happen. .
Ernie is a boy. You see, Ernie is a young male.

He blushed, glancing at my wife.
 
We were silent,absorbing this.
 
""So, Ernie's just, just . . . excited,"" my wife offered.
 
""Exactly,"" the vet replied, relieved that we understood.
 
More silence. Then my vicious, cruel wife started to giggle.
 
And giggle. And then even laugh loudly.
 
Tears were now running down her face. ""It's just ... that ...I'm picturing you pulling on its . . . its . . . teeny little . . .""
 
She gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more.
 
""That's enough,"" I warned. We thanked the vet and hurriedly bundled the lizard and our son back into the car.
He was glad everything was going to be okay.
 
""I know Ernie's really thankful for what you did, Dad,"" he told me.

Dave hesitantly opened it and tried one, they were mints, but there was something peculiar about them, there was a bit of meat right in the middle.

Dave turned around to see the impostor Joe. ""What did you do to him!"" he shouted

The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.

Every day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, ""SWIMMING LESSONS"" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.

Yuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, ""If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough..."" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.

Every day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri's.

A few months had passed, and Yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.

Later that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words ""DIVING PRACTICES"" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles. Yuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.

The practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.

Many people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. ""It is only something I am fond of, a hobby"" Yuri would say. ""I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy."" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.

For yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. ""TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!"" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.

Yuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.

Finally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. ""It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life..."" Yuri would always respond to his fans.

One day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. ""Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!"" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, ""And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!"" Yuri replied, ""Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.""

Yuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.

Unfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. ""Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!"" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.

""It is OK, everybody"" Yuri yelled back. ""I have endured many hardships in my life.""",The inspiring and motivating tale of Yuri,3

A Jewish man was leaving a convenience store with his espresso when he noticed a most unusual Italian funeral procession approaching the nearby cemetery. A black hearse was followed by a second black hearse about 50 feet behind the first one. Behind the second hearse was a solitary Italian man walking a dog on a leash. Behind him, a short distance back, were about 200 men walking in single file.

The Jewish man couldn't stand the curiosity. He respectfully approached the Italian man walking the dog and said: ""I am so sorry for your loss, and this may be a bad time to disturb you, but I've never seen an Italian funeral like this. Whose funeral, is it?""

""My wife's.""

''What happened to her?""

""She yelled at me and my dog attacked and killed her.""

He inquired further, ""But who is in the second hearse?""

“My mother-in-law. She came to help my wife and the dog turned on her and killed her also.""

It was a very poignant and touching moment of Jewish and Italian brotherhood. Silence passed between the two men.

The Jewish man then asked ""Can I borrow the dog?""

The Italian man replied, ""Get in line.""

'""Oh, great Bastet, please show mercy on us, your humble servants!  A stranger with a strange god has come and is making demands of the Pharaoh, and when he refused, the stranger turned the river into blood! Without water to drink, we have been in chaos!""

'Bastet considered this and decided that rivers turning to blood were a pretty decent excuse, all things considered, and forgave her priests their lateness.

'The next day, Bastet returned to her temple expecting everything to be back to normal.  But once again, the sacrifice was not prepared.  Suddenly the doors burst open and her priests poured in, looking disheveled and pathetic.

'""Oh, great Bastet!  Please, show mercy on us, your humble servants!  The stranger from yesterday is still here, and the Pharaoh is still refusing him.  This time, when he called upon his god, a plague of frogs descended upon us!  They are everywhere!  You cannot take two steps without crushing one beneath your feet!  They eat everything and are constantly in the way!  It took us twice as long to prepare your sacrifice!""

'Bastet was, understandably, annoyed but when she looked out of her temple she found that, yes, indeed, the streets were covered in frogs, so she forgave their tardiness, consumed her sacrifice, and went about her day, expecting that, now that this nonsense was done, things could get back to normal.

'But they did not.  The next day, her priests were late because they were covered in lice, and the day after that they complained of attacks by wild animals.  Each day they had some new source of suffering, whether it was boils or diseased livestock, or terrible weather.

'Finally, one day Bastet came to find her temple deserted.  She waited and waited and waited, for hours.  Finally, one of her priests entered, wailing in despair and crawling on the ground.

'""What now?"" Bastet asked.

'""Our children!  Great Bastet!  Every firstborn child has died!  No home has been left untouched, all of your servants have lost someone in their lives.""

'Now, tell me my child, what have you learned from this tale?'

he can find. Finally, he gets a lead, a classified ad that says, ""Actor Needed To Play
An Ape."" ""I could do that,"" says Moishe.
To his surprise, the employer turns out to be the Central Park Zoo in New York.

An ape has just died, and owing to the recent budget cuts and the recession, they
can no longer afford to import an ape to replace the deceased one, so, until they
can get the money, they'll put an actor in an ape suit instead.

Out of desperation, Moishe takes the offer. At first, his conscience keeps nagging
him, that he is being dishonest by fooling the zoo-goers. Moishe also feels
undignified in the ape suit, stared at by the crowds who watch his every move.
But after a few days on the job, he begins to enjoy all the attention and starts to
put on a decent show for all the zoo-goers. Moishe hangs upside down from the
branches by his legs, swinging about on the vines, climbing up the cage walls and
roaring with all his might while beating on his chest. Soon, he's drawing a sizable
crowd.

One day, while Moishe is swinging on the vines to show off to a group of school
kids, his hands slip and he goes flying over the fence into the neighboring cage,
the lion's den. Terrified, Moishe backs up as far from the approaching lion as he
can, covers his eyes and prays at the top of his lungs, ""Sh'ma Yisroel, Adonoi
Elaheinu, Adonoi Echud!""

The lion opens his powerful jaws and roars; ""Baruch Shem K'vod Malchuso, L'olam
Va'ed! ""

From a nearby cage, a panda yells, ""Shut up you schmucks, you'll get us all fired!"" ",Moishe the actor,51

post,98zrvd,2qh72,jokes,false,1534822532,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/98zrvd/when_i_first_became_an_ancap/,self.jokes,,"&gt;When I first became an Ancap, I was just an unemployed high schooler who had never worked a labor job in his entire life. I had that whole ""welfare recipients are parasites, just pull yourself up by your bootstraps, forcing people to subsidize your shitty life choices is morally wrong, nobody is entitled to anything they don't own"" mentality, but then my parents made me get a job.   




&gt;For the most part, I still kept my same views. My job was still pretty much Voluntary, I could quit and it would only disappoint my parents. But come this year, when I graduated high school, it began to sink in that I'm going to have to keep doing this, or God willing some other job, for the majority of my life if I want to have access to basic necessities, like food, water, shelter, etc.   




&gt;I work at a grocery store, and it's usually a comfy job. Comfy enough that I was able to sincerely hold on to my Ancap beliefs, until today. Today, a line was crossed that made me see the error of my ways.   




&gt;They were doing inventory, and they needed us, or more specifically, me alone to push all the items in every shelf in the entire store all the way back, and then dust the shelf off.   




&gt;At first it didn't seem all that bad, but then I realized I was the only one doing it, and I would have to spend the rest of my shift on this. After only about five minutes, I felt like I was going crazy.   




&gt;Push, spray, dust, move down, push, spray dust, move down, push spray, dust, move down, push, spray dust, move slightly to the left, and repeat.
I had to do that at least 30 times to only get one side of one aisle done. Took me at least half an hour to do that, and there were still 20 more aisles left in the store. The repetitive motion, the maddeningly slow progress, and being alone for the entire 8 hour shift (including an hour of overtime) was exhausting in every way imaginable.   




&gt;By the time I was done, I was infuriated, not just with the fact that I had to do this, but because of how little I got out of it. $9.30 / hour of that insanity? What kind of heartless monster would tell someone in severe poverty doing this kind of work, to just ""pull himself up by his bootstraps""? A sociopath, that's who.   





&gt;I finally understood what socialists have been talking about all this time.
""If only I were in a socialist country,"" I thought, ""the shelves would be completely empty and I could have finished this in like, an hour.""",When I first became an Ancap.....,89

Again, she tried to make the step only to discover she still couldn't.

So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more, and for the second time attempted the step, and, once again, much to her dismay, she could not raise her leg.

With a little smile to the driver, she again reached behind a third time to unzip a little more and again was unable to make the step.

About this time, a large Texan who was standing behind her picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus.

She went ballistic and turned to the would-be Samaritan and yelled, ""How dare you touch my body! I don't even know who you are!""

The Texan smiled and drawled, ""Well, ma'am, normally I would agree, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured we were friends!""

In order to not disturb the sisters, the priests went all together to take their showers around midnight. On one of those nights, at the bathroom and already naked, one of the priests exclaims: ""Heavens - we are running out of soaps. See, there's two missing.""

""Worry not my brothers"" - said one of the other priests - ""I will get the rest for us in our accommodations. It is quite late so the sisters are sleeping right now."" And saying so, completely butt naked, off the priest went to fetch a pair of soaps bars.

Coming back, passing through a big hallway full of priest statues, he suddenly hears three sisters coming from a night walk and chit-chatting down the hallway. The priest is now desperate. 

""Lord! What do I do?! What do I do?!"" - he desperately thought. The sisters were getting close. There was no time to run back.

Then he had an idea. Pretending he was a statue, he quickly struck a pose and froze there, near the other real statues, holding one soap bar in each hand.

""They will never notice me!"" - he thought.

When the sisters passed by him, one of the sisters stopped walking.

""Sisters"" - she said - ""have you ever noticed this statue before?""

""It is so realistic!"" - said the second one.

""And... Wow, is that..."" - said the other, poking at the priest's private parts.

When she did that, as a reflex, the priest's could not help but to let go one of the soaps right on the sister's hand.

""It's a miracle!... The statue gives soap bars!"" - she naively exclaimed.

""I want one too!"" - said the other, this time holding the father's dick briefly.

The father, now sweating bullets, lets go of the second soap bar as a reflex.

""Oh my!.. It really IS a miracle statue!.."" - said the sister, looking cheerfully at the others and holding the soap bar.

Then the third sister quickly went to get her soap bar, again holding the father's private parts.

""Oh.. Why is not giving any?..."" - and then she holds it stronger and starts to shake it - ""...it's not... Working... Hmpf! C'mon!.. PRAISE THE LORD!..."" - she shouts holding her hands in the air - ""...liquid soap!!..""",In a small convent,10

Sure enough, the farmer wakes up the next morning to find Randy laid out flat in the middle of the yard, buzzards circling overhead.
