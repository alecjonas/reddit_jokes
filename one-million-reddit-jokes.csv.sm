Our man arrives at a pet store who specializes in birds. After browsing he steps up to the owner of the store, 
""Excuse me, ma'am. I... I was wondering if y'all had any of those neat talking birds I heard so much about?""

Owner says, ""yeah. Theyre a hot ticket right now. I have one left. Hes a beautiful bird, a bit shy but boy does he love to sing. tv jingles, dean martin songs, elvis, you name it.""

""Oh boy! How much is he?"" 

""Well, with the cage, he's 400 dollars. Trust me, we have the best places in town."" She replies.

After some quick thought he pulled out his credit card and let her swipe it. Took the bird home, even named him Elvis because, well, he wasnt very creative. The bird did have sort of a stylish hairdoo.

Once he gets the bird set up in the living room he stands by the cage trying to get Elvis to talk. to no avail. The bird just stares at him. Turning his head from side to side as the man says the things he thinks the bird wants to hear. This goes on for a day. He gets angry and takes the bird back to the store. 
""Ma'am I'm sorry i have to return this bird. It refuses to talk.""
The owner replies, ""well, did you buy the little ladder?""
""The little ladder."" Says our man. 

""Yeah the little ladder,"" the store owner replies, ""you buy the little ladder and he climbs up to the top of it and he feels like hes on top of the world and it makes him want to sing. The little ladder is necessary. He loves the little ladder""

The man, now feeling ignorant, says ""okay ill take it""

""30 bucks""

He pays and leaves

At home the bird is happy to have the little ladder, he loves the little ladder. Hes climbing up and down the little ladder. But hes still not saying a,word. 

The next morning the bird is still scilent and the man is back at the store ""look this bird is not gonna talk. I want my money back."" 

""Sorry no refunds. Also, i notice you dont have the little bell in your cage. You buy a little bell for the top of your little ladder and the bird rings the little bell and then he knows what key to sing in for you. He wouldnt want to be flat. Without the little bell the little ladder is useless."" Said the owner.

""How much?""

""$47.99"" 

He reluctantly pays and returns home. 

This bird is just climbing the little ladder and ringing the bell but not singing a single note.
Up, *ding*, down. Up. *ding.* down.

Last time. Hes at the store. Trying to contain his frustration he says, ""why isnt this bird talking. I paid for a talking bird and it doesnt talk. I bought the little ladder, the little bell and he still wont talk to me.""

""Sir, please reamin calm. This will all be fine. You just need a little mirror.""

""A LITTLE MIRROR?""

""Yes sir, he climbs the little ladder, rings the little bell, looks in the mirror and thinks *'oh thats a good lookinf bird'* and stars to serenade its new friend. I know youre upset so ill give you 25% off this mirror, it will only be 75 dollars.""


At this point the man is desperate and will do anything to get this damn bird to talk. He buys the damn mirror and leaves.

He gets home and sets the little mirror up next to the little bell at the top of the little ladder. 

""Okay bird, *Elvis*, say something. Say anything. Talk. To. Me.""

Elvis climbs the little ladder. Rings the little bell. Looks in the little mirror long and hard just before he collapses to the cage floor. Elvis locks eyes with the man and says ""hey, they have a little bird seed at that store?"" And dies.



Holy shit im so sorry.

He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.

He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.

He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right.

He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.

He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.

By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.

As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.

Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.

He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.

He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.

He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.

Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.

Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.

As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.

He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference and keep himself from passing out.

He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.

He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills, dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water. Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.

After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.

After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.

He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.

He walks through the sand.

After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.

But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.

Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.

While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape - shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.

He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.

Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look.

He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune. After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.

He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.

So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance.

He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just keeps crawling.

Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center, where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area.

His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface.

Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.

He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling.

It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's hearing. He would swear that someone just said, ""Greetings, traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?""

He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again. Better this time.

Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet out of the stone, at an angle.

And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.

He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from this spot.

Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.

Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet - that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.

He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.

He tries to clear his throat to say, ""Hello,"" but his throat is too dry. All that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out, almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes out.

He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips, and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk now.

He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, ""Hello? Is there anyone here?""

He hears, from his side, ""Greetings. What is it that you want?""

He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides to try asking for help.

""Please,"" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, ""I'd love to not be thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?""

Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he falls forward, face first on the stone, ""Very well. Coming up.""

A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped around the tilted white post, still looking at him.

He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet. He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes - they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been bitten. By the snake.

""It'll feel better in a minute."" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!

""Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?""

""Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,"" says the snake. ""That's the way I work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.""

""You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?""

""No,"" says the snake, ""I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting around here.""

The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst.

""I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request,"" continued the snake. ""I can guess why you drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two, if you drank enough of it.""

""Ummm, n-next request?"" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.

""That's the way it works. If you like, that is,"" explained the snake. ""You get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish."" The snake grinned at his own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.

""But there are rules,"" the snake continued. ""The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility."" The snake looks at the man seriously.

""By the way,"" the snake says suddenly, ""my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into names. You can call me Nate, if you wish."" Again, the snake grinned. ""Sorry if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds somewhat threatening."" The snake give his rattle a little shake.

""Umm, my name is Jack,"" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. ""Jack Samson.

""Can I ask you a question?"" Jack says suddenly. ""What happened to the poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What do you mean by that's how you work?""

""That's more than one question,"" grins Nate. ""But I'll still try to answer all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question."" The snake's grin gets wider. ""Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert. You've been changed.

""For the third question,"" Nate continues, ""you are still dying. Besides the effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years. Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is."" Nate seemed vastly amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.

""As for the fourth question,"" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, ""first you have to agree to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you.""

""Wait,"" joked Jack, ""isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?""

""I thought that was implied."" Nate continued to look serious.

""Ummm...yeah."" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a nasty temper. ""So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really stop the effects of the methanol?"" Jack thought for a second. ""And, what do you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper fluid, and just denature it?""

""They may, I don't really know,"" said Nate. ""I haven't gotten out in a while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume that they still color wiper fluid blue?""

""Yeah, they do,"" said Jack.

""I figured,"" replied Nate. ""As for being bound by secrecy - with the fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me, this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me, write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding anyway, so you won't notice."" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.

Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a little nervous at this. ""Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?""

Well, Jack,"" said Nate sadly, ""I can't tell you that, unless you make the second request."" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.

""Umm, well, ok,"" said Jack, ""what is this about a second request? What can I ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?""

""Sure!"" said Nate, brightening. ""You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very useful, at least in my opinion."" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was staring at him.

""Well, anyway,"" continued Nate, ""I'd probably suggest giving you permanent good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a request to me.""

""Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?"" said Jack. ""And keep me healthy for a long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not really a change to me?""

""Right,"" nodded Nate.

""Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?"" Jack asked, hopefully.

""That takes two requests, Jack.""

""Yeah, I figured so,"" said Jack. ""But I could ask to be a genius? I could become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?""

""Well, I could make you very smart,"" admitted Nate, ""but that wouldn't necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either. You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It all depends on what you decide to do with it.""

""Hmmm,"" said Jack. ""Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request, after this one?""

""Maybe,"" said Nate, ""it depends on what you decide then. There are more rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second request. You know how it goes."" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had shoulders.

""Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially. Do I need to sign in blood or something?""

""No,"" said Nate. ""Just hold out your hand. Or heel."" Nate grinned. ""Or whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said, that's how it works - the poison, you know,"" Nate said apologetically.

Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.

""Hey, Jack,"" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind him, ""is that someone else coming up over there?""

Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of nowhere? And did they bring food?

Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...

Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through his jeans...

Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. ""I would have decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to hoodwink me like that.""

""I've been doing this a long time, Jack,"" said Nate, confidently. ""You humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you - especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.""

""Yeah, well, still,"" said Jack, ""it's the principle of the thing. And nobody likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or something instead?""

""More meat in the typical human butt,"" replied Nate. ""And less chance you accidentally kick me or move at the last second.""

His buddy looks at him and says, ""Well, you're obviously taking the wrong approach. I screech into the driveway, slam the door, storm up the steps, throw my shoes into the closet, jump into bed, rub my hands on my wife's ass and say, 'How about a blowjob?' ....And she's always sound asleep.""

Due to said dress policy, the girl sprayed diarrhea into her toilet before the date. The issue was that she got some on her hand, which she rubbed onto her dress by accident. This made her cry. So she called her father and cried on the phone while she masturbated on her bathroom floor in a pool of her diarrhea.

Johnny: no problem mom.

Johnny is on his way to the baker, when he sees a dispenser. 

In the middle of the dispenser there is a hole, with written next to it : ""Put your cock here, £2.""

Out of curiosity, johnny puts £2 in the dispenser, and sticks his tummy into the hole.

He never felt such a sensation, he moaned so hard and cummed on the ground.

Back home, his mom asked him : 'Where is the bread ?!'

He lies and says : 'I am sorry mommy, but I got robbed.""

His mom gives him £2 again and adds : ""...and be careful this time !""

Johnny goes back to the baker, and on the way he sees the dispenser. He says to himself not to go to it, but he couldn't take it anymore when he saw his sperm on the ground.

He quickly put £2 in the dispenser and put his dong in the hole.

He felt that same sensation, he did not know what the fuck was happening but it still felt good, and he cummed a second time on the ground.

Back home he lies again and says : ""I GOT ROBBED A SECOND TIME!!!!!!!!"" 

His mom becomes angry and says : "" That's already £4 wasted. Now I give you only one dollar.  Its from our trip to america but That's the only cash I currently have in my wallet, but I will go to the ATM today don't worry""

Johnny goes back to the baker, angry against himself. 

He sees the dispenser again and the river of schdnonk next to it.

He wonders if it still works with 1$, and he put his dollar (and his dick) in the dispenser.

He feels nothing.

Suddenly he sees Nigel Farage come from the top of the dispenser.

Nigel Farage : 'Do you really think I will suck your dick for one miserable dollar, you yankee !?'

In a fury he rushes to the bedroom to see his wife laying in bed naked begging him to calm down.

The man in a furious rage ignores his wife trying to find the man who had banged his wife.  He goes to the balcony and finds a man hanging from the edge 6 stories up completely naked.  The naked man pleads with him to pull him up but the husband forces the man's hands free causing him to fall.

Miraculously the naked man's fall was cushioned by the bushes below only giving him a few scraps.  In a blind rage the husband runs back into the room and grabs a large trunk and tosses it over the balcony where it proceeds to fall on the man below killing him.  Right after the husband tosses the trunk over the balcony he dies from a heart attack from all the strain.

In Heaven, Peter greets new arrivals.  The husband walks up to him and tells him about the incident and begs Peter to show forgiveness and let him in.  Peter smiles at the man and tells him that if a person dies while having a really bad day then they are allowed immediate access to heaven.  The husband enters into the pearly gates behind him.

Next in line the naked man steps up.  Peter laughs and asks what happened to him.  The man told Peter ""You won't believe this, I was practicing naked yoga on my balcony on the 9th floor of the apartments I live in when I slipped and fell off the edge.  Thankfully I grabbed the sixth floors balcony edge on the way down trying to save myself.  Suddenly a man in a furious rage came outside and threw me off his balcony.  If it wasn't for the bushes below I would have died for sure but again I was saved.  I guess the guy didn't like that so he threw a huge trunk at me and here I am.""  Peter laughed and told him to go on in.

A third man walked up to Peter and told him ""Man I was having a great day, started banging this really hot chick I met at the bar and then suddenly she tells me to hide in her trunk.  I panicked and did as she asked but next thing I know it felt as if I was falling and I woke up here.""",Get into heaven on a bad day,46

The men she met could not hold her interest, and even if they could they never called her back. Her therapist told her what she needed to here:

""Jill, you're just too damned smart,"" she told her. ""Men really do want an intelligent woman, if they're any good at all, but you intimidate them. Your brain works in a way that is incomprehensible to even very smart men. You need to find someone who is smart enough to keep up with you, though that won't be easy.""

So Jill began her search, using ways that only smart people would know (I don't know either), and finally found someone she thought might be her intellectual equal (or close enough.) She contacted him and he agreed to go on a date with her (his name is immaterial, but it's Joshua), and they met at a nice, but not too expensive, restaurant in a good part of town.

Unfortunately, as smart as Joshua was (and again, his name is immaterial so don't focus on that), he was a complete slob. His hair was a tangled mess, his clothes looked like he slept in them regularly, and he stank! Jill could have forgiven him many things, but that stench was just too much!

At her next session she told her therapist what happened. ""Look, I wasn't trying to be overly choosy,"" she assured her therapist (who's name is also immaterial.) (But it's Linda, if you must know.) ""I didn't care about his looks or how much money he made, but he stank! I couldn't get past that. And he's the only male I've found, after exhaustive research, who could even come close to me intellectually. I just don't know what to do!"" she wailed.

Linda (the therapist) studied Jill thoughtfully, then finally sighed and put her notebook down. ""Jill, you have to promise me you won't tell anybody I told you this,"" she began. ""I know a brain surgeon who can make a few... tweaks here and there, and bring your intellect down to a level that won't be so intimidating. It would mean you won't be as smart as you are now, but you'll be able to meet someone.""

Jill said she'd need some time to think about it, but the truth was she had already decided. She'd accomplished everything that she really needed to with her top-rate intellect, and now she just wanted to find some companionship. She told her therapist the next week that she wanted to talk to the surgeon.

The surgeon explained in detail the procedure (and Jill, being so smart, corrected a few errors in his plan) and they agreed on a date for the surgery. ""Just tell me this,"" Jill said before she was put under. ""Will I still be somewhat intelligent?""

""Oh, of course,"" the surgeon reassured her. ""We're only going to dial it back, as it were, but a few notches. You'll still be smarter than the average person, just not so much so that you're miles above everyone else.""

""Okay, that's perfect!"" Jill exclaimed as the mask was lowered over her mouth and nose.

The doctor had told her that the surgery would last several hours, but, as it goes with surgery, from Jill's perspective she was out hardly any time at all. Her first waking memory was of the doctor coming into her room, looking very concerned.

""Jill,"" he said. ""I made a terrible mistake during the surgery. I intended to decrease your intelligence by roughly 5 percent, 10 at the outside. Somehow I overshot my target, and I decreased your intelligent by about 93 percent. I'm so terribly sorry. Can you ever forgive me?""

Jill looked at the doctor with a puzzled expression on her face. Finally, she spoke. ""You know what I'm going to do, Doctor? I'm going to build a WALL! A yuge wall! It's going to be the best wall, believe me!""",A Very Smart Woman,0

He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""","A man wakes up in a dingy slum,",788

For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.""The dog said, ""That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?""

So God agreed...... On the second day, God created the monkey and said, ""Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.""

The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""

And God agreed......

On the third day, God created the cow and said, ""You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.""

The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""

And God agreed again...... On the fourth day, God created humans and said, ""Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.""

But the human said, ""Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?""

""Okay,"" said God. ""You asked for it.""

So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves. For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.

Which, is exactly what they needed - in private. Ain't no kids coming without a good hard dicking first. But let's be honest, when it came to the vote or the right to work, women had a point.

Doesn't mean men don't face stereotyping either though. Just last Wednesday afternoon I took my little boy to the park. And wouldn't you know it, every woman there gave me the weirdest stare. Like I was some pervert criminal kidnapping my own son.

So I plop the kid in a swing. Pull him way back - because he likes it fast - and give a good push. Thwap! Thwap! Thwap! it spins around up and over the poll - kid holding on for dear life. Swing seat creeping upward as the chain wraps around. Until, bang! Kid hits his head. 

Hey, it's a life lesson!

But there's blood. And a crying baby. And every goddamn mother's eyes in the park sear at me with this evil stare. A woman comes up and asks if I have a bandage. 

No. What, I expect the kid to get hurt at a park? Isn't that the safest place in the world for a kid? So no, I don't have no bandage. But I realize there's a diaper. She agrees it's a good idea. So I start pulling the kid's pants down to get it. Hey, at least he hadn't taken a dump!

Whoa! You'd think it was some kind of child assault. Women from all over the park come rushing at me like offensive linebackers. 

Holy shit, it's a fucking twat posse! Each of them dragging their kids behind. Which, fortunately, did kind of slow them down.

So I grab my kid, stuff him in the carriage, and book the fuck out of there. This linebacker posse of female rage dragging their snot nosed kids at the hand, trailing behind. But I've got wheels so I'm faster. 

I get a good fifty yards ahead and turn to see them falling behind. Their fists raised in revolutionary spirit. And I thumb my nose with a raspberry to tell them what I think of their bullshit double standards. I mean, here I am just trying to be a good father! And they got to ruin it all with their self-righteous politics. 

Then I turn around and there's a cop. And I think, thank God! Someone to stop this mob. Officer, I say, help! I point at the women, 'they're chasing me!' But see all of them hit the ground to take cover.

Oh fuck. 

""Raise your arms or I'll shoot!""

""But I'm holding a baby carriage!"" 

BANG! 

No problem, my arms go up. But then the baby carriage starts wheeling away down a hill toward a heavily trafficked intersection. I'm frantically pointing at it with my arms above my head. 

""GET ON THE GROUND AND SURRENDER!""

""But my baby!""

BANG!

At this point the carriage is actually speeding, illegally careening down the street, as the officer protects and serves my wrists into handcuffs. The women are standing there with wicked grins, triumphant in fully ejecting from their turf this masculine invader. 

The baby rushes toward the intersection and is almost there when a construction worker runs out to catch him. By this point there are sirens everywhere, blue and red lights flashing, and a helicopter hovering overhead. 

Then a news truck arrives and a guy stands in front of a camera telling the world how a baby was just saved in the park from a kidnapping molester.

If it weren't for my wife, who arrived just in time to explain, I'd have been shimmed in a holding cell by Bubba the felon of extrajudicial justice.

There was a brand identity project for a new company, and I was in charge of typography, but those two disagreed with my choice of font.

The first one was this stony-looking Peruvian-American man named Esteban Ferrero, but since that's Spanish for Steven Smith, and our company had a rule that everyone has to call each other using nicknames instead of last names, everyone, including himself, just called him Steve. The second one was a Dutch woman with a sharp glare named Evelien van der Berg. She was famous for giving designers a hard time convincing her that their design choices work better than hers. In accordance with the company rules, we called her Eve.

Anyway, I showed Steve my first draft, and he wasn't convinced that I chose LinoLetter as the main font, and told me that I should use a sans-serif font. But I stood by my position that serifs add legibility to printed and digital material, that it fits the company's identity as an organic store, and that it is hard to stand out with a sans-serif. It took a lot of debate, but in the end, Steve was convinced that LinoLetter was acceptable.

A few days later, I showed Eve a more elaborated version, as for the sizes and styles of the font, and the pairing of LinoLetter with Century as the headline font. She insisted that I should have used a sans-serif font for the headline.

The white dude snickered, ""Ha, blacks thinking dick size means everything, I will show her my romantic skills and get her to orgasm with just my foreplay!"" 

After a good while the white dude comes out sweating like a fountain as well, ""Well fuck! That was the best foreplay and fucking I ever delivered but she didn't even flinch, she even looked bored!"" So he went and sat next to the black dude waiting for the Asian to fail even more miserably.

The young man paused a moment, and then said, ""You know, Dad, I've been thinking about that, and I've noticed in my studies of the Bible that Samson had long hair, John the Baptist had long hair, Moses had long hair and there's even a strong argument that Jesus had long hair also.""

post,4umhjj,2qh72,jokes,false,1469501934,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4umhjj/why_i_fired_my_secretary/,self.jokes,,"Last week was my birthday
and I didn't feel very well
waking up on that morning.

I went downstairs for breakfast
hoping my wife would be pleasant
and say, ""Happy Birthday!"", and
possibly have a small present for me

As it turned out,
she barely said good morning,
let alone ""Happy Birthday.""

I thought...
Well, that's marriage for you,
but the kids....
They will remember.

My kids came bounding down stairs to
breakfast and didn't say a word.
So when I left for the office,
I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.

As I walked into my office,
my secretary Jane said,
""Good Morning Boss,
and by the way Happy Birthday! ""
It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.

I worked until one o'clock,
when Jane knocked on my door
and said, ""You know,
It's such a beautiful day outside,
and it is your Birthday,
what do you say we go out to lunch,
just you and me.""
I said, ""Thanks, Jane,
that's the greatest thing
I've heard all day.
Let's go!""

We went to lunch.
But we didn't go
where we normally would go.
She chose instead a quiet bistro
with a private table.
We had two martinis each
and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.
On the way back to the office,
Jane said, ""You know,
It's such a beautiful day...
We don't need to go straight back to the office, Do We ?""

I responded,
""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""
She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment,
it's just around the corner.""

After arriving at her apartment,
Jane turned to me and said,
"" Boss, if you don't mind,
I'm going to step into the bedroom
for just a moment.
I'll be right back.""
""Ok,"" I nervously replied.

She went into the bedroom and,
after a couple of minutes,
she came out carrying a huge birthday cake .
Followed by my wife, my kids,
and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy
Birthday.

And I just sat there...

On the couch...

Naked....

The couple find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven.

While waiting, they begin to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? When St. Peter showed up, they asked him.

St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.

The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.
'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'

'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'
St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.
