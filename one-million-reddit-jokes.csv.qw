s."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003,50
The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.
The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.
First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.
Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.
Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.
First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.
Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.
The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family are among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""
Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says: ""Guys, I think I fucked up""",3 guys find a lamp in the woods,0

""Don't waste your time and money,"" Steve replied. ""Walmart has a diagnostics machine... Just pee in a cup and insert $2 dollars, and it'll tell you everything that's wrong with you.""

Bill didn't believe Steve but, on his way home from work, he stopped by Walmart to give the diagnostics machine a try anyway. He pissed in a cup, dumped it into the machine, and inserted $2. The lights on the machine flashed and then printed out the following:

""You have tennis elbow. Avoid strain and soak in warm water for 15 minutes twice a day.""

Bill was amazed. As he drove home, he wondered if the machine could be fooled. So, after dinner, he collected urine samples from his wife and daughter, and a stool sample from his dog. He put everything in a mason jar, including some semen. 

At Walmart, he poured in the contents of the mason jar, inserted $2, and excitedly read the piece of paper the machine printed. It read:

""1. Your dog has ringworm. Medicated shampoo on aisle 16. Wash him 3 times a week.

2. Your daughter has a drug problem. Get her into rehab ASAP.

3. Your wife is pregnant. Twins. They're not your's. Call a lawyer tomorrow morning.

There comes a point when the man is truly annoyed and breaks past his sanity barrier. When asked the question again, he jumps off his balcony. 

The roommate jumps after him and asks the same question while still falling. 

""Are you Asian?""
The man, truly angry, ""Even if I am, what can you fucking do about it?""

It is raining, and the little town looks totally deserted. De-monetization of 500 and 1000 Rupee notes has been announced and no one has cash.

Suddenly, a rich tourist comes to town. He enters the only hotel, lays a 2000 Rupee note on the reception counter, and goes to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one.

The hotel proprietor takes the 2000 Rupee note and runs to pay his debt to the vegetable seller. The vegetable seller takes the 2000 Rupee note and runs to pay his debt to the farmer. The farmer takes the 2000 Rupee note and runs to pay his debt to the supplier of his seed and fertilizer. The supplier of seed and fertilizer takes the 2000 Rupee note and runs to pay his debt to the town’s prostitute that, in these hard times, gave her “services” on credit. The hooker runs to the hotel, and pays off her debt with the 2000 Rupee note to the hotel proprietor to pay for the rooms that she rented when she brought her clients there.

The hotel proprietor then lays the 2000 Rupee note back on the counter so that the rich tourist will not suspect anything. At that moment, the rich tourist comes down after inspecting the rooms, and takes his 2000 Rupee note after saying he did not like any of the rooms, and leaves town.

No one earned anything. However, the whole town is now without debt, and looks to the future with a lot of optimism.

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you asked! There are 145,256,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,929,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door, he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.",A man walks into a monastery...,164

He tells the American he is in charge of cleaning up the inside of the house while he is gone,washing the windows and throwing all the trash away. He tells the German that he is in charge of sweeping outside and picking up things lying around and throwing it all away. He tells the Chinese man that he is in charge of supplies.

When the Forman returns he notices a pile of larger debris in the back yard, but nothing else is down outside, when he walks into the house he sees that the windows were not cleaned and that the American and German are sitting on buckets just talking. He is pissed and asks the American why the windows are not clean. He tell him that he sis not have the stuff he needed to clean them. The Forman looks at the German and also why he just piled everything up and didn't do anymore. The German states that he also did not have what he needed to get the job done. At this point the Forman is fuming, and wants to know where the Asian man is as he was in charge of supplies. They look everywhere for him.

They are about to give up when they decide to look in the shack in the back yard. As they approach the Asian man jumps out of the shed smiling and startling the others, then he yells.....""supplies"".

A week passed. Eventually, that mole began to grow, and seemed to bleed into the skin around it. The man asked his wife about it, and she said he should probably get it checked out, but he ignored the advice, assuming it was just a cyst. Another week passes, and it starts to hurt every time he flexed his elbow. Finally, he decided to get it checked out.

The doctor shook his head empathetically as he told them the bad news. It was malignant melinoma - skin cancer.

In less than a month, the man had been reduced to a shell of his former self. His teenage son was hit hard by the news and his grades had begun to slip. They hadn't caught it in time, and it was fatal.

Eventually, as his strength began to fade, he called his family to his bedside.

""I'm sorry,"" he whispered. ""I didn't listen to you, honey. I thought I would know whether it was cancer.""

He beckoned for his son to lean in, which he did, tearfully.

3) If so, does each body have a distinct frequency pattern (like how a station at 102.3 FM and another at 102.7 are distinct in their respective transmissions)?

When I went to city hall to renew his dog license, I told the clerk I would like a license for Sex. He said, ""I'd like one too!""

Then, I said, ""But this is a dog."" He said he didn't care what she looked like. Then, I said, ""You don't understand, I've had Sex since I was 9 years old."" He winked and said, ""You must have been quite a kid.""

When I got married and went on my honeymoon, I took the dog with me. I told the motel clerk that I wanted a room for my wife and me and a special room for Sex.

He said, ""You don't need a special room. As long as you pay your bill, we don't care what you do."" I said, ""Look, you don't seem to understand. Sex keeps me awake at night."" The clerk said, ""Funny -- I have the same problem.""

One day, I entered Sex in a contest, but before the competition began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just standing there, looking disappointed. I told him I had planned to have Sex in the contest. He told me I should have sold my own tickets. ""But you don't understand,"" I said, ""I had hoped to have Sex on TV."" He said, ""Now that cable is all over the place, it's no big deal anymore.""

When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, ""Your honor, I had Sex before I was married."" The judge said, ""The courtroom isn't a confessional. Stick to the case, please.""

Then, I told him that after I was married, Sex left me. He said, ""Me too.""

Last night, Sex ran off again. I spent hours looking all over town for him. A cop came over to me and asked, ""What are you doing in this alley at 4 o'clock in the morning?"" I told him that I was looking for Sex. My case comes up Friday.

You will surely understand that I have certain needs that you, being 57 years old can no longer satisfy. I am very happy with you and I value you as a good wife. Therefore, after reading this letter, I hope that you will not wrongfully interpret the fact that I will be spending the evening with my 19 year old secretary at the comfort inn hotel. Please don't be upset - I shall be home before midnight.

*When the man came home late that night, he found the following note on the dining table...*

My dear husband,

I received your letter and thank you for your honesty about me being 57 years old. I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that you are also 57 years old. As you know I am a maths teacher at our local college. I would like to inform you that while you read this, I will be at the Hotel Fiesta with Michael, one of my students, who is also the assistant tennis coach. He is young virile and, like your secretary, is 19 years old. 
As a successful businessman who has an excellent knowledge of maths, you will understand that we are in the same situation, although with one small difference - 19 goes into 57  more times than 57 goes into 19.

""The one with that smokin' body? Yeah, what was her name? Jenna?""

""Yeah, that's the one,"" Henry says. ""I, uh, asked her out on a date and she said yes."" 

Jim nearly chokes on his beer and slaps Henry's back. ""Attaboy! I didn't know you had it in you. If she's as perfect as you say she is then you're the luckiest dog I've ever met. So what's the problem?""

Henry looks around the bar and leans in. ""That's exactly the problem. She's too attractive. This is embarrassing, but whenever she comes into my office I have to stay behind my desk. I get an instant erection, every time.""

Jim tries to swallow his laughter but sees in Henry's eyes that he means every word. ""I'm serious,"" Henry continues. ""How the hell am I supposed to go on a date with this woman if I'm at full mast the whole time?"" 

Jim leans back on his barstool and takes a swig of beer. ""Easy, before you go on the date, tape your dick to the inside of the leg. She'll never notice and you won't make a jackass of yourself.""

Date night comes and goes and the next day Jim finds Henry back at the bar with a half dozen empty beer bottles scattered in front of him. ""So...the date. You did remember to tape it down, didn't you?""

""Yeah I remembered,"" Henry said, still looking down. ""I taped it down before I went over, and when I got to her house she opened the door wearing nothing but a skimpy little robe. She pulled me through the door and slid the robe off. Right then and there."" Henry sighs and takes a chug of his beer. 

""That is the most incredible thing I ever heard,"" Jim says. ""So she was naked from the moment you got to her house?""

""Yep."" Henry sighs and motions for another beer. 

Jim shakes his head. ""You got to see the woman of your dreams naked, so what the hell is your problem today?""

First guy is ecstatic ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family are among the richest of the rich. My wife is a freak under the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years""

I am usually very awkward around girls, but I was on my A game and managed to get her number.

The very next day, a new girl showed up at my workplace.  She was a solid seven.  We started chatting and I managed to hit if off with her too! She was a gamer just like me, and we had a lot in common. I was ecstatic at this point, because I'm a six at best.  I decided to take each of the girls out on a date, and see who I would rather continue with.  

Both dates went really well, but, being attracted more to the nine, I decided to take her out again. We went out a few times, and I thought it was going great. I was really proud of myself, because, once again, I'm a six at best. One day, though, I stopped hearing from her altogether.  It seemed like she had just vanished.  I naturally assumed she had lost interest in me, and moved on with my life.

About a week later, I got a text from the seven.  She said that she would like to go out again. I accepted, since apparently the nine was no longer a factor. We agreed to meet for coffee, but she never showed. I thought it was strange, but figured maybe something had come up.

The next day, I discovered that the seven had been arrested for murdering the nine. Apparently, she had found out that I chose the nine over her and had decided to take revenge. She had some serious mental instability and jealousy issues, as I found out that day. She had lured the nine to her apartment, killed her, sliced her up, and appeared to have eaten part of the nine's dead body before the cops tracked her down.

So all this begs the question, why is six afraid of seven?

with a sign to announce:

""Today, the unbelievable Bob"".

The couple decides to come in and the show begins with Bob, 39, in a bed with a blonde, a brunette and a ginger,
which he fucks one by one ... and then repeats.

The three women, exhausted, leave the stage, while Bob thanks the audience, who applauded effusively on their feet. 

Drum roll and 3 walnuts are placed on the table in the middle of the scene.

Bob breaks the 3 nuts with his cock, with precise strokes.

The audience goes crazy and he is cheered for several minutes!

After 25 years, to remember the old days, the couple decided to celebrate the silver wedding in the same city.

They walked through the same places and, before the same house come, surprised, the poster:

""Today, the unbelievable Bob"".

They go in and on the stage, who's there? Bob, now 64 years old, with wrinkles and white hair but still fucking 3 women with the same mastery and strength. 

The couple could not believe it!

And when the drums begin to drum, the table is there, now with 3 coconuts, which he breaks with the penis, with the same precision.

Gaped open, the couple go to the dressing room to greet the unbelievable Bob and, curious, ask him the reason for the change of walnuts for coconuts.

The dog instantly became a good friend to the pub regulars and was not long officially made the pub mascot. The mutt became a part of the pub, and everyone who went there was greeted by the licks and unconditional love of the creature. 

One cold winters morning, the bar owner woke up to see heavy snow falling outside his window. He hurried down to the bar and out to the garden where his dog slept in his little kennel, but found him frozen solid. He broke the news to the bar regulars that day and there was an atmosphere of depression, when suddenly one of the men drinking shouted ""I know! How about you get a taxidermy done and display him in the bar so everyone can remember him!"" The bar owner instantly praised the idea and as soon as the day ended he went out to his local taxidermist.

After a discussion with the taxidermist the bar owner found it was too expensive to stuff the entire dog, so instead he decided to simply stuff the tail and bury the rest of the dog in the garden of the pub. A small funeral was held where all the people who had met the lovely mutt shed a tear or two, but were glad that its tail was hanging above the bar in remembrance.  

Meanwhile, the soul of the dog raised before the gates of heaven and was met by St Peter. St Peter opens his book and gladly says ""You have been a loving dog, showing unconditional love and affection to everyone you meet, as well as strong companionship to your owner."" However, St Peter pauses and a frown appears on his face ""It says here that part of you isn't buried.""
""That's because my owner stuffed my tail so he could remember me."" replied the Labrador in a high pitched voice. St Peter sighed and stated ""In order to enter heaven you need to have all of your body buried, I will send you back to earth as a ghost in an attempt to bury the last part of your body."" 

Instantly, the dog is sent back down to earth in the very early morning outside the bar. The dog scratched the door with little success, so howled as loud as he could in order to wake the bar owner up. The bar owner soon opens the door to see the ghostly spirit of his beloved Labrador, and continues to faint after it lets out a joyous ""Why hello there master!""

When the bar owner comes to and both of them are together in the bar, the dog explains his situation to him. ""So basically I just need my tail buried and I can get into heaven."" The bar owner, still shocked that his dog is now a talking ghost, looks puzzled and scratches his head, letting out a long sigh ""I'm sorry my friend, I don't think I can help you there."" The dog looks confused and replies ""Why not? All you need to do is bury my tail."" Then, the bar owner points up to a sigh above the bar

""I left for work this morning, leaving my husband in the house watching TV. My car stalled, about a mile down the road, and I had to walk back to get my husband's help. When I got home, I couldn't believe my eyes. He was in the bedroom with the neighbor's daughter! 
When I confronted him, he broke down and admitted they had been having an affair for the past six months. We've been married for 10 years and I love him, but he won't go to counseling, and I don't know what to do!""

John waits patiently for her to finish, ponders his response for a few moments and replies, ""A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults with the engine. Start by checking there is no debris in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold and also check all grounding wires. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors.""","Sheila shows up to work one day, in tears and looking for comfort.",28

He had been doing this for years, and rarely deviated from his two little routines, making balloon animals, and the honk to flower squirt combo. 

One day, Bozo was setting up for a little boys party when the birthday boy asked him to do some magic. Bozo says, ""Listen kid, I honk my horn and make balloon animals, that's all I do."" The boy seemed satisfied and walked off.

The party soon starts getting in full swing, some little boys friends running around the big yard, while others are watching Bozo make balloon animals. In the middle of making a giraffe, the birthday boy asks Bozo to do a magic trick. Bozo, who is a little irritated at the repeated question, calms himself before saying, ""Listen kid, I honk my horn and make balloon animals, that's all I do."" The boy is obviously disappointed and walks back to the boys playing in the yard. 

After the birthday boy opened up his presents, he tried his luck again with Bozo, who was taking a break while the kids were distracted. The birthday boy goes up to Bozo and asks him to do a magic trick. Bozo is now extremely annoyed, decides to shut up the boy. ""Ok kid, you got me.

He was, by all accounts, a terrible gunner. He struggled to hit enemy tanks and even if his shell did hit, as if some curse was upon him, the shell would either be a dud or fail to pierce through the enemy's armour. Despite this, his crew still managed to survive the initial onslaught. He was there when the army finally pushed the North Koreans back. 
However, they had to face a new enemy, the Chinese, who were threatened by American military presence on their border. For some inexplicable reason, when the Chinese tanks came, my grandfather suddenly became a sharpshooter. He hit almost every enemy tank his crew came upon and destroyed enemy tanks from record-breaking distances. His crewmates were a little shocked, and asked him what caused the sudden change. ""This time,"" my grandfather replied, ""there's a chink in their armour.""",During the Korean War,145

I also asked her to cover the floor with soundproofing material and place a chessboard-style carpet on top of it. 

The woman agrees and gives me a quote of $2000. Finding the price to be reasonable for what I order, I agree. Soon men from the agency are in my house, taking measurements and adding decor. Amidst this, I get a call from my boss asking me to rush to the office to discuss the multi-million deal our company was planning to make with an MNC. I happily rush to the office, leaving my 14 year old nephew in charge with the lady. 

I finish all my paper work and enter the meeting with the MNC's representatives. The meeting doesn't go well since they ran a background check on our company and found some instances where we couldn't complete our projects on time. We assure them that these cases were due to unforeseeable circumstances and we wouldn't repeat them. They don't buy it and we end up losing the deal. As I walk out of the meeting I get a call from the nephew saying that the home decor team left without doing the soundproofing and placing the carpet.

work. Her 9 year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them and hides in the bedroom closet to watch.
The woman's husband also comes home.
She puts her lover in the closet, not realizing that the little boy is in
there already.
The little boy says, ""Dark in here.""
The man says, ""Yes, it is.""
Boy - ""I have a baseball.""
Man - ""That's nice.""
Boy - ""Want to buy it?""
Man - ""No, thanks.""
Boy - ""My dad's outside.""
Man - ""OK, how much?""
Boy - ""$250""
In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the lover are
in the closet together.
Boy - ""Dark in here.""
Man - ""Yes, it is.""
Boy - ""I have a baseball glove.""
The lover remembering the last time, asks the boy, ""How much?""
Boy - ""$750""
Man - ""Fine.""
A few days later, the father says to the boy, ""Grab your glove, let's go
outside and have a game of catch."" The boy says, ""I can't, I sold my
baseball and my glove."" The father asks, ""How much did you sell them
for?""
Boy - ""$1,000""
The father says, ""That's terrible to overcharge your friends like
that...that is way more than those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you confess.""
They go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the
confession booth and he closes the door.

post,5dkoh1,2qh72,jokes,false,1479445245,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5dkoh1/the_difference_between_men_and_women/,self.jokes,,"Let's say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named Elaine. He asks her out to a movie, she accepts, and they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves. They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else.

And then one evening when they're driving home, a thought occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: ""Do you realize that, as of tonight, we've been seeing each other for exactly six months?"" And then there is silence in the car. To Elaine, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: Geez, I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he's been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I'm trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn't want, or isn't sure of.

And Roger is thinking: Gosh. Six months.

And Elaine is thinking: But, hey, I'm not so sure I want this kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I'd have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward... I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person?

And Roger is thinking: ...so that means it was...let's see...February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer's, which means... lemme check the odometer... Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here.

And Elaine is thinking: He's upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I'm reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed - even before I sensed it - that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that's it. That's why he's so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He's afraid of being rejected.

And Roger is thinking: And I'm gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don't care what those morons say, it's still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It's 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600.

And Elaine is thinking: He's angry. And I don't blame him. I'd be angry, too. I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can't help the way feel. I'm just not sure.

And Roger is thinking: They'll probably say it's only a 90-day warranty... scumballs.

And Elaine is thinking: Maybe I'm just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I'm sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy.

And Roger is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I'll give them a warranty. I'll take their warranty and..........

""Roger,"" Elaine says aloud.

""What?"" says Roger, startled.

""Please don't torture yourself like this,"" she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. ""Maybe I should never have... Oh God, I feel so..."" (She breaks down, sobbing.)

""What?"" says Roger.

""I'm such a fool,"" Elaine sobs. ""I mean, I know there's no knight. I really know that. It's silly. There's no knight, and there's no horse.""

""There's no horse?"" says Roger.

""You think I'm a fool, don't you?"" Elaine says.

""No!"" says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer.

""It's just that... it's that I... I need some time,"" Elaine says.

There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work. ""Yes,"" he says. Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.

""Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?"" she says.

""What way?"" says Roger.

""That way about time,"" says Elaine.

""Oh,"" says Roger. ""Yes.""

Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks. ""Thank you, Roger,"" she says.

""Thank you,"" says Roger. Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Roger gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis match between two Czechoslovakians he never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it's better if he doesn't think about it.

The next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification. They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it, either.

Meanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Elaine's, will pause just before serving, frown, and say: ""Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?""

And that's the difference between men and women.

The next thing Joe knew, the doctors rushed him to the Emergency Room where they said that they had to urgently perform a procedure or else he would die. Before he could even question anything, Joe was put to sleep by the surgeons. 

When Joe woke up, both of his legs were amputated. He screamed at the top of his lungs and demanded that the doctors tell him what happened. They told him that they thought he was another man named Joe Smith who needed to get his legs amputated to prevent the cancer in them from spreading and killing him. 

After recovering from the hospital, Joe sued the hospital staff and went to court the next year.

After a long two year process and after all the evidence was presented, the judge asked for a verdict from the jury. They replied,

""We the jury find the hospital staff of St. Mary Hospital not guilty.""

After a huge shock from everyone in the room, the judge demanded that they give their reason for their verdict.

""Well your honor, the prosecutor just didn't have anything to stand on.""",Joe Smith Went To The St. Mary Hospital To Cure His Nasty Cold,2
