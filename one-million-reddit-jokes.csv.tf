He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. 

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. 

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. 

He made it out, but a single person died. 

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. 

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. 

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. 

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. 

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. 

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. 

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. 

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. 

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. 

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. 

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. 

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. 

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. 

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" 

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. 

But suddenly the executioner decided to pick up the chair, walk outside, and throw it into the nearby ocean, drowning the man.

The judge, hearing of this, came running outside. ""But how did you know the chair wouldn't kill him?"", he asked.

""Well"", the executioner replied, ""I see this joke posted here every day.""

I'm 25 this year. I'm very pretty, have style and good taste. I wish to marry a guy with 100 crore annual salary or above.

You might say that I'm greedy, but an annual salary 2 crore is considered only as middle class now days..

My requirement is not high. Is there anyone in this forum who has an income of 100 crore annual salary? Are you all married?

I wanted to ask: what should I do to marry rich persons like you?

Among those I've dated, the richest is 50 crore annual income, and it seems that this is my upper limit.

If someone is going to move into high cost residential area on the west of New York City Garden(?), 50 crore annual income is not enough.

I'm here humbly to ask a few questions:

1) Where do most rich bachelors hang out? (Please list down the names and addresses of bars, restaurant, gym)

2) Which age group should I target?

3) Why most wives of the riches are only average-looking? I've met a few girls who don't have looks and are not interesting, but they are able to marry rich guys.

4) How do you decide who can be your wife, and who can only be your girlfriend? (my target now is to get married)


Ms. Pooja i Chohan.

**A philosophical reply from Indian Billionaire Mukesh Ambani**

Dear Ms. Pooja,

I have read your post with great interest. Guess there are lots of girls out there who have similar questions like yours. Please allow me to analyse your situation as a professional investor.

My annual income is more than 100 crore, which meets your requirement, so I hope everyone believes that I'm not wasting time here.

From the standpoint of a business person, it is a bad decision to marry you. The answer is very simple, so let me explain.

Put the details aside, what you're trying to do is an exchange of ""beauty"" and ""money"" : Person A provides beauty, and Person B pays for it, fair and square.

However, there's a deadly problem here, your beauty will fade, but my money will not be gone without any good reason. The fact is, my income might increase from year to year, but you can't be prettier year after year.

Hence from the viewpoint of economics, I am an appreciation asset, and you are a depreciation asset. It's not just normal depreciation, but exponential depreciation. If that is your only asset, your value will be much worse 10 years later.

By the terms we use in Wall Street, every trading has a position, dating with you is also a ""trading position"".
If the trade value dropped we will sell it and it is not a good idea to keep it for long term - same goes with the marriage that you wanted. It might be cruel to say this, but in order to make a wiser decision any assets with great depreciation value will be sold or ""leased"".

Anyone with over 100 crore annual income is not a fool; we would only date you, but will not marry you. I would advice that you forget looking for any clues to marry a rich guy. And by the way, you could make yourself to become a rich person with 100 crore annual income.This has better chance than finding a rich fool.


Hope this reply helps.

The three of them are informed by an alien in a lab coat that standard procedure when contacting an unfamiliar species is to subject them to the standardized intergalactic intelligence test.

""You will be put in an airtight vault for three minutes,"" says the alien. ""It's 3x3x3 meters and completely empty. You'll be given two balls made of a superstrong titanium alloy and no tools. Do something in the vault that will convince us that you're more interesting to us alive than dead, because if you fail to demonstrate your intelligence, we'll dissect you.""

First goes the German engineer. After five minutes, the scientist alien walks into the cockpit with a disappointed look on his face.

""So we open the vault and he has managed to balance one ball on top of the other,"" reports the alien to the captain. ""I ask him how, exactly, is this supposed to convince us that humans are an advanced species. Apparently ""knowledge of basic physics"" and ""manual dexterity"" are good enough for a human. Meh. We're dissecting him as we speak, bring in the next one.""

They put the guru in, five minutes pass and the scientist alien walks into the cockpit even more disappointed.

""So we open the vault and he's sitting there in a lotus position, the two balls floating in the air around him. He even gives me the ""Are you impressed?""-look, can you believe that? Apparently, lifting heavy titanium balls is impressive for the human mind. So yeah, they struggle with basic levitation; we're dissecting this one as well. Send in the last one.""

The Bulgarian is put in the vault, the vault is sealed. Five minutes pass and the scientist alien bursts into the cockpit, flailing his arms and shouting excitedly at the captain and crew.

""Guys, you need to see this! Come, leave the saucer on autopilot and come! I swear, I have not seen such a thing in my entire career!""

""Calm down, what has he done?"" asks the captain.

""It's unbelievable,"" continues the scientist, ""in three minutes inside the vault he has managed to lose one of the balls and break the other.""

***

EDIT: Hey guys, I'm going to bed now, but I'm troubled by the ""I don't get it""-comments. The sub doesn't let me comment with a shitty joke explanation for whatever reason, so I'll put it here:

The Bulgarian manages to leave the **cockpit unmanned**, thus giving the forces of Earth a **significant tactical advantage** over the aliens. The latter are fooled because they have failed to **discover the anal cavity** despite the previous two **dissections**.",So how about a real joke about Bulgarians for a change?,255

The lawyer ran back to his Mercedes, tore into town as fast as he could, and got the local sheriff. The sheriff grabbed his shotgun and dashed back to the berry patch with the lawyer. Sure enough, the two bears were still there. 

""He's in THAT one!"" cried the lawyer, pointing to the male, while visions of lawsuits from his friend's family danced in his head. He just had to save his friend. The sheriff looked at the bears, and without batting an eye, leveled his gun, took careful aim, and shot the female.

""Yes, I'm sure. The duck is dead,"" he replied.

""How can you be so sure"", she protested. ""I mean, you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something."" 

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few moments later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog and took it out and returned a few moments later with a beautiful cat. The cat jumped up on the table and also sniffed the bird 
from its peak to its tail and back again. The cat sat back on its 
haunches, shook its head, meowed softly, jumped down and strolled out of the room. 

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" Then the vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried. ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead?"" 

The vet shrugged. ""I'm sorry. If you'd taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20. But what with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it all adds up.""

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. 

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. 

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. 

He made it out, but a single person died. 

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. 

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. 

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. 

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. 

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. 

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. 

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. 

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. 

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. 

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. 

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. 

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. 

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. 

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" 

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. 

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. 

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living...,30009

He picked it up and rubbed it and out popped a genie.

The genie said: ""You have released me from my lamp… This is the eighth time this month and I’m getting a little sick of granting all of these wishes, so you can forget about three. You only get ONE wish. What's it going to be?""

The man sat and thought about it for a while before finally saying, ""I’ve always wanted to go to Hawaii, but I’m too scared to fly and I get very seasick on boats. Could you build me a bridge to Hawaii so I can drive over there to visit?""

The genie laughed and said, ""That’s impossible. Think of the logistics! How would the supports ever reach the bottom of the Pacific? Think of how much concrete and steel that would require! No, think of another wish!"" The man said ""OK"", and tried to think of a really good wish.

Finally, he said, ""I’ve been married and divorced four times. My wives always said that I'm too insensitive. So, I wish that I could understand women… know how they feel inside and what they’re thinking when they give me the silent treatment. I'd like to know why they’re crying and what they really want from me when they say ""nothing"". I want to know how to make them truly happy.""

The car went and didn't return in time as expected, they knew something must be wrong.

Several hours later and no car, the man became apprehensive.

He dressed up and got ready to lodge a report at the police station. 

As he and his wife stepped outside they saw the car coming with an overload of children.

The car parked right in front of them and said... ""These are your children sir..!""

In the car were their Landlady's two daughters, his wife's best friend's daughter, his secretary's son and their neighbours two sons.

Harry thought about it for a while, and figured out that being a dog is too tiring, but a hen probably has a nice and relaxed life. Running around with a rooster can't be that bad.

""I want to return as a hen."" Harry replied. And in the next second, he found himself in a chicken run, really nicely feathered. But man, now ""he"" felt like the rear end was gonna blow. Then along came the rooster.

""Hey, you must be the new hen on the farm."" he said. ""How does it feel?""

""Well, it's OK I guess, but it feels like my rear end is blowing up.""

""Oh that!"" Said the rooster. ""That's only the ovulation going on. Have you never laid an egg before??""

""No, how do I do that?"" Harry asked.

""Cluck twice, and then you push all you can.""

Harry clucked twice, and pushed more than he was good for, and then 'Plop' an egg was on the ground.

There was once a spaceship Kleeshae that was minding its own business until one day it was shot by a fleet of Zarii alien ships. Although they got away in time, most of the already-small Kleeshae crew had died in the attack, leaving only the first officer Sharon Yule alive, and the captain, who was gravely wounded. Fuel and food supplies were running low and they had to land soon to repair and replenish.

The nearest two possible landing locations presented a tough decision to Captain Dirk. One option was to land on the close-by planet Zarii, which was home to the hostile, power-hungry Zarrs, whose nickname ""the Tsars"" was well-earned. The second option was to use the remaining ship energy to warp to Zarii's only moon, home to the Ringos, the peaceful minority Zarrs who were outcasts from the home planet. However, the moon was on the furthest point of its orbit away from the ship, and the warp drive, having been damaged, would not be all too reliable.

The first officer looked worriedly at the captain and asked for a directive.

The captain closed my eyes in deep thought, only to open them upon his final decision, saying as he clutched his wounded side:

""Shoot for the moon... even if you, Miss Yule, land among the Tsars...""",Aboard the worn-out Kleeshae,1

The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.
The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.
The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.
And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

The two men are brought to the leader and in front of the entrie tribe the leaders states ""you have only two options to get off of this island, you can choose death, or your can choose Ugabuga.""

The bartender can't believe what he just saw, the whole bottle of champagne disappearing and reappearing. All the while, the third woman groaning and moaning louder than ever. 
Amazed at the site, the bartender grabs three glasses for the champagne to celebrate the craziest thing he'd ever seen in his life. He washes off the bottle and pours the champagne into each glass. All the while, the third woman is moaning and groaning louder and hornier than anything he's ever seen in his life. He moves to hand the third woman her glass but she falls straight down to the floor. 
""Oh no! Are you okay? Do you still want this champagne?"" asks the bartender. 
""Sure,"" the woman replies, ""but could you also help me out of this barstool?"" ",Three Horny Women at a Bar (Long and Dirty),4

Life is too short. We could get hit by an ICBM missile tomorrow or find out that I've tested positive for the HIV virus. So instead I got some KFC chicken, listened to some NPR radio on the way home, then read some DC comics.

But then I got an alert on my LCD display: ""Are you putting enough in your IRA account?""

What was I doing? I'm no genius (I didn't score highly on the SAT test - probably because I spent too much time on BBS systems and IRC chat instead of studying), but I knew it was time to go over the finances. Should I refinance the house to get an ARM mortgage? But on the other hand, I didn't want to become one of those crazy people who keeps everything down to the receipts and writes down all the UPC codes and ties everything to the CPI index. Not like I have the attention span to do that anyway, given how bad my ADD disorder can be.

Unfortunately, at that time my computer went out. :-( I don't know what's wrong with it. Other devices on the same LAN network can't see it. It won't even get past the POST test. I don't know if it's a problem with my VGA array or not having enough RAM memory, or maybe my CPU unit is bad.

Then the woman says, ""Well, I'd like some strawberries on top. You'd better write it down because I know you'll forget it."" The man replies, ""I can remember that! You want some cake with strawberries.""

She adds, ""I'd also like whipped cream on top. Now I'm certain you're gonna forget that, so you'd better write it down ok."" Irritated, he says, ""I don't need to write it down woman!

There's plenty of party games, people are about to make a toast. It's a particular social club that consists of fairly average and decent human beings.

Nobody invited their next guest. He's slobbery and tar-brained, foul in breath, foul in mind, he's shambling down the halls, associating colors with generic pills like a madman. He claws at the walls on the way in, spins into the main area, body odor and fluids fly about. He takes off his pants and shits directly into the chocolate cake. A person screams and faints at the sight. He starts plugging his butthole with pudding and fucking it over and over again, shouting nonsense and blathering about directions and polling. His wild eyed expression grows frantic as he slobbers on his own dick, ejaculating on the chips and sweating on the food and drink like he was a fresh-squeezed sponge. His begins terrorizing the disgusted, fleeing guests, shlong flapping in the breeze and yodelling the sounds of a deranged Tarzan impression. The racist, sexist, xenophobic trumpet of deranged language fires in every direction, his little grabby hands start moving around, he's a complete loose cannon and he's willing to tear anyone down with him.

Finally, someone grabs this deranged lunatic by the shoulders and starts shaking him back and forth. ""What is WRONG with you?!"" the party's host cries. ""Do you have anything to say for yourself?!""

The creepy little man's eyes narrow and he takes a handful of his own shit and eats it. Smearing his own fecal matter all over his teeth, rubbing it into the corners of his eyes. Shit, shit, shit.
