This test only has one question, but it's a very important one. 
By giving an honest answer, you will discover where you stand morally. 
The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation in which you will have to make a decision.
Only you will know the results, so remember that your answer needs to be honest.

THE SITUATION: 
You are in Florida, Miami to be specific. 
There is chaos all around you caused by a hurricane with severe flooding. This is a flood of biblical proportions.
You are a photojournalist working for a major newspaper, and you're caught in the middle of this epic disaster.
The situation is nearly hopeless. You're trying to shoot career-making photos.
There are houses and people swirling around you, some disappearing under the water.

THE TEST: 
Suddenly you see a man in the water. He is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken down with the debris.You move closer.
Somehow the man looks familiar. You suddenly realize who it is. It's Donald Trump!
At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him under forever.

YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS: 
You can save the life of  Donald Trump or you can shoot a dramatic Pulitzer Prize winning photo,
documenting the death of one of the world's most powerful Republican men hell bent on the destruction of America.
 
THE QUESTION: 
 Here's the question, and please give an honest answer. 
 
""Would you select high contrast colour film, or would you go with the classic simplicity of black and white?""

""No, get lost! It's half past three. I was in bed,"" says the man and he slams the door. He goes back up to bed and tells his wife what happened and she says, ""That wasn't very nice of you.

By the time it's done, his teeth are gone, his lips are split, his cheeks are torn open, and pieces of his colon hang between his blood-soaked legs. He crawls off towards camp.

The 2nd explorer thinks it over and says ""OK. Bongo-Bongo. At least I'll see my family again.""

""SO BE IT!!"" cries the chief, and the tribe attacks again, and they're now so worked up it goes on for FIVE hours. A pygmy joins in and has his way with the poor guy's *nostrils*. They even have sex with his eye sockets (so much for seeing his family again). By sunset, he's in even worse shape than the first guy, blind, nose split wide open, crawling away with a good part of his lower GI tract dragging behind him in the dust.

St. Peter says ""Listen - we're having a really busy century, so we need to manage admissions tightly. Right now we can only admit people who have died in horrible fashions, and those who have died in a more mundane way will have to wait in limbo, and it could take a decade or two to work you in.""

So St. Peter takes aside the first man, and asks him how he died. ""Well, I'd been suspicious of my wife having an affair for some time now, so today I came home from work early. I just knew the guy was in my apartment, but I couldn't find him. I looked everywhere and was just about to give up, when I went out on the balcony of my 23rd story apartment and there he was hanging over the edge! He was just barely hanging on, there was no way he could climb back onto the balcony. It was a really stupid place to try to hide. I was livid, so I started punching him and clawing at his fingers, but he held on. Finally I went to get a hammer and started pounding on his fingers, and he fell down. But what really angered me was that he landed in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! I was so mad I grabbed the refrigerator, threw it off the balcony and it landed on him. Unfortunately I was so riled up by the incident I had a heart attack and died.""

St. Peter was taken aback, and said ""While you did die in a dramatic fashion, I think we need to look at that whole second degree murder before we let you in - off to limbo with you."" He then approached the second man and asked him how he had died.

""I was riding my exercise bike on the balcony of my 24th story apartment, when the thing broke and threw me over the railing! I grabbed furiously at the railing and slipped, but managed to catch on the balcony below mine. I tried to climb up but it just wasn't possible. I thought I was going to fall but then someone came out on the balcony. I thought he would help me, until he started hitting me! I held on as best I could, but when he got a hammer and started hitting me I finally couldn't hold on anymore and fell. Somehow, though, I fell in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! Just as I'm coming around, I look up and BAM this refrigerator lands on me. So here I am.""

St. Peter immediately admitted this second man to heaven, and pulled aside the third man and asked him for his story.

""Picture this: I'm hiding naked in a refrigerator...",Really busy century in heaven,430

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.
Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.
He made it out, but a single person died.
Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.
He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.
When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.
After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.
The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.
The man was perfectly fine.
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.
And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.
Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.
Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.
The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.
For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.
After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.
The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.
And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.
To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.
And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.
On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""
Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.
The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.
The executioner was speechless.
The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.,64

One summer night, Bob passed away in his sleep after watching the Yankee victory earlier in the evening. He died happy. A few nights later, his buddy Earl awoke to the sound of Bob's voice from beyond. 

""Bob, Is that you?"" Earl asked. 

""Of course it me,"" Bob replied. 

""This is unbelievable!"" Earl exclaimed. ""So tell me, is there baseball in heaven?"" 

""Well, I have some good news and some bad news for you. Which do you want to hear first?"" 

""Tell me the good news first."" 

""Well, the good news is that yes there is baseball in heaven, Earl."" 

""Oh, that is wonderful! So what could possibly be the bad news?""

(It's rare, about 160 made.) After getting  engaged to the love of his life, he decides to find one. After some searching, he finds one for only $500. Immediately, he calls the owner and sets up a time to come look at the bike. 

Upon arrival, Greg meets this old man and asks him about the bike. The old man just smiles as he opens the garage and reveals the Harley in perfect showroom condition. Astonished, Greg asks the man how he kept the bike looking so new. With a chuckle, the old man says, ""it's an old family secret. Every time it's going to rain, I coat every inch of the bike in Vasoline. The water runs right off and keeps the bike looking new."" Greg gives the man the money and loads the bike up. 

After getting it home, he starts the bike up and takes off to pick up his fiancée to have dinner with her parents, stopping to get some Vasoline for the bike. 

When they arrive, she stops him at the doorstep and says, ""there's something you need to know about my family. Nobody talks during dinner. Whoever speaks first has to wash all the dishes."" Greg nods and they go inside. 

He's met with an entryway that has a tiny path leading inside.  On either side of the path are dishes stacked floor to ceiling. As he walks further into the house he sees the living room filled with dishes, floor to ceiling, except for a tiny path to the couch and between the couch and TV. The stairs, the halfway, the rooms, all riddled with dishes floor to ceiling. 

When dinner starts, everyone sits down and starts eating, and sure enough, nobody says a word. 

About five minutes in, Greg thinks, *I can have fun with this* and reaches over and grabs his fiancée's titty. 

The father glares at him, the mother acts like she didn't see anything, but sure enough, nobody says a word. 

Delighted by this reaction, Greg grabs his fiancée, throws her on the table, rips off her pants and begins fucking her right in the table. 

The father is fuming, the mother gasps loudly, but... nobody says a word. 

Greg sits back down and begins to eat again. After several more minutes, he decides to go even further and reaches over and grabs the mother's titty, throws her on the table, and behind fucking her. 

The father clenched his fists, turns multiple shades of red, veins pop out of his forehead. The anger can be felt for miles. 

But, nobody says a word.

Exhausted, Greg begins to eat again, but suddenly hears a loud clap of thunder in the distance. As the old man's words echo in his head, he stands up and pulls out his jar of Vasoline. 

Suddenly, the father slams his hands on the table and shouts, ""Alright, enough! I'll do the goddamned dishes! """,The Harley Davidson (NSFW),103

Saint Peter leads the guy into Heaven and into a long, white corridor. Along the corridor are heavy wooden doors, all shut. Saint Peter motions for the guy to follow and they begin a walk along the corridor. As they pass the first door, the guy hears strange singing and organ music coming from behind it.

""What's in there?"" the guy asks.

Saint Peter responds, ""Those are the Greek Orthodox. Come along.""

They walk further down the corridor and past the second door. Behind it, the guy hears lots of yells of, ""Praise Jesus!"" and ""Amen!"" in a chorus of voices.

""What's that one?"" the guy asks Saint Peter.

""Southern Methodist. Come along, Lutheran is further down the hall.""

As they approach the third door, Saint Peter turns to the guy and puts his finger over his lips and whispers. ""Shhh... don't make a sound. Tiptoe and don't... say... anything.""

post,4yxtmb,2qh72,jokes,false,1471823386,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4yxtmb/the_cushmaker/,self.jokes,,"On Johnny's first day of school, Ms. Patrick assigned the kids to start learning their ABCs. Johnny calmly refused to participate. The teacher let it go for a bit, but then had to take him aside.
""You're going to have to do the work like everyone else, Johnny.""

""Nope.""

""Well how are you going to learn to read and write? You need to learn these things to get a job someday.""

""Don't need it,"" He replied ""I'll be a cushmaker when I grow up.""

Ms. Patrick didn't want to admit to a 4 year old that she didn't know what a cushmaker was, so she sent him to the principal's office. He gave Johnny a good talking to, but Johnny was adamant.
""I don't need to learn this, I'll be a cushmaker when I grow up. Just like my daddy, and his daddy before him.""
The principal decided to let this go, being his first day and all and also not wanting to admit he didn't know what a cushmaker was.

Johnny was pushed along through elementary school and middle school the same way. Every so often, a teacher or administrator tried to reach him, but he was going to be a cushmaker when he grew up. 
When he reached high school, one of his teachers couldn't believe he was so far behind.

""Johnny! What is wrong with you?! You'll never amount to anything if you don't have an education!""

""Don't need it, I'll be a cushmaker. Just like my daddy and his daddy before him. I'll be a 6th generation cushmaker.""

The teacher had enough and decided to get in touch with his friend who was a US Navy recruiter. Johnny went in to see the recruiter and he asked about Johnny's goals.

""I'm going to be a cushmaker very soon."" 

""The Navy can give you the skills you need to be an excellent cushmaker one day."" The recruiter said. He had no clue what a cushmaker was but he was behind on his quota and was ready to make a deal. Johnny liked this idea and enlisted.

On Johnny's first day, the chief ordered the new recruits to clean the bunks, Johnny refused. The chief wanted to make an example of Johnny and chewed him out good.

""You think you're special son?!""

""I'm here to get better at cushmaking, this won't help my abilities!""

He got reported to the superior officers, but for awhile Johnny had enough charisma to slide by. He didn't do much work, and everyone who confronted him got the same response. One day an Admiral was touring the ship and noticed one bunk untidy and started to question the Captain about it. The Captain explained about the struggles they were having with Johnny. The Admiral was shocked to find them not being able to keep one man in line and summoned Johnny. The Admiral chewed him out and Johnny remained steadfast in his resolve.
""I'm just wanting to be a cushmaker, they said the Navy will help me. I'm from a proud line of cushmakers and my children will be too.""

The Admiral didn't know what a cushmaker was, but was intrigued by his spirit. ""Son, when will you be ready to be a cushmaker?""

""I can start right now, sir.""

""Well, if you're going to cushmake, you'll do it for the US Navy, and on the taxpayer's dime. Now what do you need?""

""First, I'll need a ship with a deep hull, so I can have a full workshop.""

""Can't be on land?""

""No sir, has to be on a boat. I'll also need 3,000 sheets of 3/4"" plywood, 200 gallons of rubber cement, and 500 buckets of spackle.""

""Done, what else do you need?""

""Well sir, I'll need men under my command to move the lumber and mix the chemicals.""

""I'll assign you 200 men.""

""Thank you sir, I'll get to work right away.""

Johnny and his team get to work and news of this spreads through out the fleet. The news media starts to learn of it and even the president is intrigued. After a few days, Johnny sends out everyone from the ship and tells the Admiral he will be done in one week. The anticipation builds and everyone comes to the harbor for the big revealing.

Johnny comes out all sweaty and exhausted, he tells the Admiral it's ready. He needs a crane to lift it out of the hull. A crane is brought over and the hook is lowered into the hull. Out comes a perfect white cube. Johnny orders the cube to be lifted and released into the ocean.

The room is filled with a hundred or so of the best looking people the guy's ever seen, men in tuxedos, women in fantastic gowns. He steps into the room and sees the room is lined with leather couches, and waitresses are walking around and handing out champagne. Completely taken aback, the guy decides to go sit on one of the couches, alone, and watch.

After fifteen minutes of watching, the elevator opens and a seven-foot tall goatee'd man in a red tuxedo steps out and starts glad-handing everyone. The guy notices he has small horns on his forehead and a tail out the back of the tuxedo. The red tuxedo'd man comes over and shakes the guy's hand. He says, ""Hey glad you made it! Welcome to Hell. I'm Satan. If there's *anything* I can do for you to make your stay comfortable, let me know.""

Still stunned, the guy nods and continues to sit while Satan goes off to talk to others. He notices the room is walled with tinted glass, but beyond the glass, he can make out fire, brimstone, and shadowed human figures writhing in agony.

When Satan comes back over to the newly deceased guy, he says, ""Hey, I hope you're enjoying your first day here. Is there anything I can get for you? Champagne? Cocaine?""

The guy shakes his head and says, ""Uh, no, thanks, but I was wondering... what's with all the people out in the fire? They're in agony.""

Satan ahs and nods. ""Those are the Christians. They wouldn't have it any other way.""",Guy dies in a car crash...,1538

It must have been a Tuesday because the only other people there were the bartender and a stranger who was drinking quite heavily at the bar.

After taking in the view and snapping some photographs the tourist orders a drink from the bartender and engages the stranger in small talk.

Eventually the stranger turns to the tourist and says ""You know, last week I discovered that if you jump from the top of this building, by the time you fall to the 10th floor, the winds around the building are so intense that they carry you around the building and back into the window.""

Hearing this, the bartender just shakes his head disapprovingly while continuing to clean a glass.

The tourist responds, ""What, are you nuts!? there is no way that is true!"" 

The Stranger says ""No, seriously it is absolutely true, and I'll prove it to you!"" He gets up from the bar, jumps over the balcony, and plummets towards the street below. When he passes the 10th floor, the high wind whips him around the building and back into the 10th floor window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar. He meets the Tourist, who looks quite astonished.

""You know, I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke,"" says the tourist. 

""No, I'll prove it again,"" says the stranger as he jumps over once more. Again just as he is hurtling toward the street, the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window.

Once the stranger get's upstairs again the tourist is adamant that he must try this once in a lifetime experience for himself and insists that the stranger takes his camera to capture the event for his friends back home. The stranger agrees, and the tourist flings himself over the balcony! He rushes past the 12th floor, 11th, 10th...... 9th, 8th floors..... and hits the pavement with a huuuuge splat!

Back upstairs the bartender turns to the stranger and says: ""You know what Superman, you are a real asshole when you're drunk!""",A tourist is visiting New York city for the first time,1

The first man's name was Juan González. He was an incredibly talented man who would challenge people to tell him to play any tune they wanted on any instrument they wanted and he could play the song flawlessly on the spot. He was known all around the country as the man who could play any song on any instrument. The optometrist having a love of music with his daughter decided he could be a good choice as he could play any music that she wanted at any time.

The second man's name was Chu Jiang. He was born into an extremely wealthy family who passed down to him an inheritance twenty times greater than the average american's life earnings. He owned many large estates around the world that he could go to on his private airlines and owned large shares of giant companies.  Being an only parent, the optometrist had never been  able to afford much for his daughter and with this man she would never have to worry about money again in her life.

After a lot of long hard thinking, the optometrist reached the conclusion that he should give this choice to his daughter as she is the one who will be affected by this decision the most. That night he walked into her room as she was about to go to sleep and said:

You have two options and I want you to tell me which one looks better for you,

He knocked on the door and roused the monks. ""I've got a flat tire. Can I use your phone?"" He asked. 

The monks said they were sorry, but they did not have a phone. ""If you stay tonight, you can get a ride on our wagon into town tomorrow,"" they said. So the man stayed the night, and they put him in a small room in the monastery. 

In the middle of the night, the man was awakened suddenly by a noise. Not just any noise, but the loudest, most wonderful, most terrifying, most hair-raising noise ever. 

He sat there, his heart beating for a few minutes, and he heard it again!Getting out of bed, he went running in the direction of the noise. It came again, making the hair on the back of his neck rise and his skin crawl. Finally, he came to a large door where the head monk was standing. The door was at least 15 feet tall, and made of solid-looking wood and metal. It had chains and bars and locks and a deadbolt on it, and was the most formidable door the man had ever seen. 

""What was that sound?"" He asked. ""What made it? Is it behind that door?"" 

The head monk shook his head. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I can't tell you; you're not a monk."" 

As the man turned away, he heard the noise again. ""You have to tell me what it is,"" he begged. 

""I'm sorry, I can't tell you, you're not a monk,"" said the monk. 

The man tried to sleep, but couldn't get the noise out of his head. In the morning, as he was getting ready to leave, he heard the sound again. It made his ears ring and his mind whirl.""Please tell me what made that sound,"" he said.

But the monks wouldn't. ""I'm sorry, you're not a monk"" was all they said. 

The man left, and eventually got his car fixed and went back to his life. But he couldn't get the sound out of his mind. After a few months, he got in his car and drove and drove until he found the monastery again. He got out of his car and found the head monk. ""I can't forget that sound from that night I was here. Please, please please tell me what made that sound."" The head monk just shook his head. 

""I can't tell you; you're not a monk,"" he said.""Then tell me how I can become a monk,"" the man said. 

The head monk said ""It's very difficult. Are you sure you want to do this?""The man said ""I've got to. I have to know what made that sound.""The head monk said, ""To join us, you have to perform several tasks. Your first task is to count all of the stars visible in the sky."" 

The man thought about how hard that would be, but he had to know what made that sound. He sat up every night for a year, counting the stars over and over until he was sure how many stars were visible in the sky. He went to the head monk and told him, and the monk nodded. 

""Very good. Your next task is to count all of the grains of sand on the beaches around the world.""The man knew this would be even harder, but he could not get the noise out of his head. He had to know what, what kind of animal, could make that terrible horrible mind-bending sound. So he left on his journeys. He crawled the length and breadth of every beach in the world, counting the grains of sand, and he returned to the monastery years later.The head monk heard his answer and nodded. 

""Excellent. You are almost done. Your final task is to climb to the peak of the highest mountain in the world, and see yourself in relation to the rest of creation."" And the man knew this would be hard, but he outfitted himself, and he went to the highest mountain in the world, and he climbed to the top, and returned months later, older and wiser and more tired than years before when he had first heard the noise, the noise that would not leave his mind and that echoed in his every waking thought.He returned, and the head monk saw that he was wiser, and said ""At last, you are a monk. Come with me."" 

And they walked through the monastery, its twisting and turning halls, and as they went the man heard the noise again, over and over, and he was no longer sure if it was the noise or merely his memory of it.And finally, finally, he stood in front of the door and the head monk opened it up, and the man saw what had made the noise.
