Esther replied, ""Morris that helicopter is 50 dollars - and 50 dollars is 50 dollars"".

Morris and Esther agreed and up they went. The pilot did all kinds of fancy maneuvers, but not a word was heard. He did his daredevil tricks over and over again, but still not a word.

He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand.

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound. But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",The monastery,44

Several hours pass, and the pilot is getting worried. He's running low on fuel, and doesn't have any idea where he is. He decides that he will land at the next runway/radio tower he finds, but will make sure it's okay to land first.

Fortunately, within ten minutes he picks up a nearby radio tower on his transmitter, and hails them. ""Can you help me, please? I've been flying for hours, my navigation is shot, and I'd really like to land and refuel. First, I need to know what country this is - I don't want to be landing in some hostile area.""

The radio tower operator replies, but the pilot immediately gets very angry. ""Well, of course I do! What kind of country is this where you poke fun at exhausted pilots? If you're going to be like that, I'll just find my own way, thank you very much!"" And he flies off.

Now, the radio tower operator's friend had walked in in the middle of this conversation, and had only heard the pilot's angry response. ""What was that about?"" he asks the operator.

""Well, I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure. The guy said he wanted to know what country we were in because he had been flying a long time and wanted to land.""

I was intrigued! I messaged her about meaning for a coffee and to get to know one another. Given that she was being honest about her desire to not be seen I thought I too would be honest about my hallucinations. To my surprise she agreed to meet me.

We met at a local cafe and when I arrived i saw her sitting in the corner with a large price of cardboard placed on the table, concealing her identity. Despite her appearance being hidden, we hit it off right away.

After that we went on several dates together and each time the cardboard covering her face got smaller and smaller. After a while I no longer cared about the cardboard and had almost no interest in seeing what her actual face looked like.

A little after that I started to notice a change in her demeanour, she became quieter and sounded less cheerful. The cardboard also remained the same size and showed no sign of changing. 

I was starting to get worried about her so during one of our dates I questioned her about her change in mood.

Almost immediately she burst into tears and when I asked her what was wrong she smacked me square in the face. I turned back to her to try and console her but as a brought my head around I saw she no longer had anything in front of her face.

I was very confused. I asked her what had happened to her cardboard. Through her tears she stared at me with a puzzled look.

In between her gulps and sobs she managed to produce a response ‚ÄúI *sob* h-haven‚Äôt used *sob* the c-cardboard in w-weeks *sob*‚Äù

At that point she stood up and ran off.

Suddenly, it clicked with me. I had hallucinated her cardboard! 

I didn‚Äôt care what she looked like without it so when she actually took it away... my brain didn‚Äôt register it.

It‚Äôs a shame really.

I always thought there was something between us.",[Long] Trying to find a date had been really difficult for me recently,8

A guy who purchased his lovely wife a pocket Tazer for their anniversary

submitted this:

 

Last weekend I saw something at Larry's Pistol &amp; Pawn Shop that sparked

my interest. The occasion was our 15th anniversary and I was looking for

a little something extra for my wife Julie. What I came across was a

100,000-volt, pocket/purse-sized Tazer.

 

The effects of the Tazer were supposed to be short lived, with no long

term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to

retreat to safety...??

 

WAY TOO COOL! Long story short, I bought the device and brought it

home... I loaded two AAA batteries in the darn thing and pushed the

button... Nothing! I was disappointed. I learned, however, that if I

pushed the button and pressed it against a metal surface at the same

time, I'd get the blue arc of electricity darting back and forth between

the  prongs.

 

AWESOME!!! Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Julie what that burn

spot is on the face of her microwave.

 

Okay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it

couldn't be all that bad with only two AAA batteries, right?

 

There I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting

little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I

really needed to try this thing out on a flesh &amp; blood moving target.

 

I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second)

and then thought better of it. She is lsuch a sweet cat. But, if I was

going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger,

I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised.

 

Am I wrong?

 

So, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading

glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one

hand,  and Tazer in another.

 

The directions said that:

 

a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant;

a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss

of bodily control; and

a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the

ground like a fish out of water.

Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries.

 

All the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5"" long,

less than 3/4 inch in circumference (loaded with two itsy, bitsy AAA

batteries); pretty cute really, and thinking to myself, 'no possible

way!'

 

What happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best.

 

I'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one

side so as to say, 'Don't do it stupid,' reasoning that a one second

burst from such a tiny lil ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.. I

decided to give myself a one  second burst just for heck of it.

 

I touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and...

HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION !!!

 

I'm pretty sure Hulk Hogan ran in through the side door, picked me up in

the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and

over again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position,

with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles

nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest

position, and tingling in my legs! The cat was making meowing sounds I

had never heard before, clinging to a picture frame hanging above the

fireplace, obviously in an attempt to avoid getting slammed by my body

flopping all over the living room.

 

Note:  If you ever feel compelled to 'mug' yourself with a Tazer, one

note of caution:

 

There is NO such thing as a one second burst when  you zap yourself! You

will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a

violent thrashing about on the floor!

A three second burst would be considered conservative!

 

A minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thing at

that point), I collected my wits (what little I had left), sat up and

surveyed the landscape.

 

My bent reading glasses were on the mantel of the fireplace. The

recliner was upside down and about 8 feet or so from where it originally

was.  My triceps, right thigh and both nipples were still twitching.  My

face felt like it had been shot up with Novocain, and my bottom lip

weighed 88 lbs.  I had no control over the drooling.  Apparently I had

crapped in my shorts, but was too numb to know for sure, and my sense of

smell was gone.  I saw a faint smoke cloud above my head, which I

believe came from my hair.  I'm still looking  for my testicles and I'm

offering a significant reward for their safe return!

 

PS: My wife can't stop laughing about my experience, loved the gift and

now regularly threatens me with it!

 

If you think education is difficult, try being stupid!!!!

So he goes over and says ""How?"" and the Indian says ""How.

Thinking himself lucky to get such a hint, the farmer sets aside a second day for cutting firewood, and by the end of the day he has a massive logpile stacked up at the back of the house, and he notices the same old Indian watching him again. So, unasked, the farmer hands over some tobacco and the Indian helps himself, lights up, and says ""Winter be *plenty* cold this year"".  

So the farmer spends a third day cutting firewood, and by the time he's done his hands  are worked nearly to the bone, his saw and his axe are both in need of a good sharpening, but he has a colossal logpile all around two sides of the house, and when he sees the Indian he goes over, gives him more tobacco, and the Indian comments ""Winter be *heap damn* cold this year.""  

At which the farmer asks the Indian ""Sir, how is it that you know winter will be so cold?"", and the Indian draws afresh on his pipe and gives him a look that suggests still another gift of tobacco would be in order... and when the farmer obliges, the Indian says confidentially, ""Winter always cold when white man cut much firewood"".","One fall, a farmer is cutting firewood",36

Magdalene, had prepared the bath water and towels just the way the old nun
had instructed.

Sister Magdalene was also instructed not to look at Father John's nakedness
if she could help it, do whatever he told her to do, and pray.

The next morning the old nun asked Sister Magdalene how the Saturday night
bath had gone.

'Oh, sister,' said the young nun  dreamily, 'I've been saved.'

'Saved? And how did that come about?' asked the old nun.

'Well, when Father John was soaking in the tub, he asked me to wash him,
and while I was washing him he guided my hand down between his legs where
he said the Lord keeps the Key to Heaven.'

'Did he now?' said the old nun evenly.

Sister Magdalene continued, 'And Father John said that if the Key to Heaven
fit my lock, the portals of Heaven would be opened to me and I would be
assured salvation and eternal peace. And then Father John guided his Key to
Heaven into my lock.'

'Is that a fact?' said the old nun even more evenly.

'At first it hurt terribly, but Father John said the pathway to salvation
was often painful and that the glory of God would soon swell my heart with
ecstasy. And it did, it felt so good being saved.'

'That wicked old Sod, said the old nun. 'He told me it was Gabriel's Horn,
and I've been blowing it for 40 years!",Good Father John,10

This was the first time he had been given such an honor and he wanted to do it right. Before he went to work he decided to call the weatherman to ask what kind of a winter was to be expected. The weather man told him it was going to be a warm and uneventful winter. The boy thought to himself, ‚Äòthis is great. I won‚Äôt have to work too hard and I‚Äôll be able to look good in front of the whole tribe.‚Äô

Just to be safe, he gathered a few of his friends and they went to work for a week. At the end of the week, after chopping and piling the wood, the boy decided to give the weatherman a second call. The weatherman told him it was going to be a very cold winter. Shocked at this sudden change and not wanting to disappoint the elders of his village, he gathered more of his friends and they went to work. For two weeks they cut and piled wood, hoping that it would be enough to last the whole winter.

Once again the boy called the weatherman and this time the weatherman told him, ‚ÄúSon, its going to be a very bitter, cold and long winter. Maybe the worst winter on record.‚Äù

Exasperated, the boy had to ask, ‚ÄúWhat makes you say that, sir?‚Äù

So, he had his secretary send a check for $250 and enclosed the following note:

Dear Madam,  


Enclosed find check in the amount of $250 for rent of your apartment.

I am not sending the amount agreed upon because when I rented the apartment I was under the impression that:  


1) it had never been occupied  


2) that there was plenty of heat  


3) that it was small enough to make me cozy and feel at home.  


Last night, however, I found it had been previously occupied, that there was no heat, and it was entirely too large.

Upon receipt of the note, the woman immediately returned the check for $250 with the following note:

Dear Sir, 

First of all, I cannot understand how you expect a beautiful apartment to remain unoccupied indefinitely.

As for the heat, you probably did not push the right buttons to turn on the heat..  


As for the space, the apartment is, indeed, extremely cozy, but if you obviously did not have furniture of the right size to fill it, please don‚Äôt blame the landlady!",A business man met a beautiful woman and agreed to spend the night with her for $800.,230

I was a geek, used watch sci fi shows, read stories and write about it in my spare time. I had no friends in school except for this one guy and his jerk friends who makes me do their homework, tells me where I can and can't go etc. The guy is twice my size and the principal didn't do anything but insult me.

One day this new kid named Calvin came to our school, says he's from out of town. His uncle is really weird. He starts hanging out with me straight away, won't leave me alone. The one good thing is he pisses off the bully so there is that.

Calvin and I hang out every day, the guy keeps telling me to get with this one girl. He talks so much about her, and she seems more into him than me. But it was nice to think she wanted me, since she was really hot. He comes up with this plan to get with her on prom night. I'm thinking it's a crazy idea, but maybe it could work?

Later in the week it's prom night, me and Calvin set the plan in motion, I'm waiting alone in the parking lot for when the time is right. 

I hear her in her car screaming, the plan is going into fruition, and so I open the door. I was supposed to find Calvin on top, but instead it was my bully. I panicked and socked the guy., knocking him down. This wins the girl over, we go to the prom and kiss.

The bully and his friends left me alone for the rest of high school, me and the girl went out, we got married after school and had 3 kids. I went on to publish several sci fi novels and gain a vast amount of wealth. 

It all seems good but I realized...Calvin disappeared after that night, and my kid Martin looks exactly like him.",I think my son may not be mine...,3

Since she‚Äôs been there so long, the zoo has entrusted her with taking care of the two most valuable exhibits in the zoo. 

First, she is responsible for feeding an ancient lion. This lion is actually so old that all of his teeth have fallen out and the only thing that he will eat is rare steak. 

Second, she must caretake the pool of porpoises. Now these aren‚Äôt just any porpoises... they‚Äôre magical. In fact, as long as these particular porpoises are fed an exclusive diet of live seagulls, THEY WILL NEVER DIE. 

Well, the zookeeper has had a nice long run of it and decides that it‚Äôs time to train a replacement and retire. Knowing how important her job is, the administration of the zoo searches high and low for a suitable replacement and eventually hire a young, upcoming zookeeper apprentice to take over the old woman‚Äôs responsibilities. 

On his first day on the job, the young zookeeper is running behind schedule and, for the sake of feeding the porpoises in a timely fashion, decides to take a shortcut through the lion‚Äôs den. 

His hands are full of squawking seagulls as he tiptoes through the lion‚Äôs den. The lion, being old and mostly deaf, is passed out asleep in the middle of the walkway. Carefully, the new zookeeper steps over the slumbering lion and continues over to the porpoise display, where he feeds the porpoises their daily ration of seagulls. 

At that moment, a black SUV screeches to a halt in front of the zoo and federal agents promptly arrest the new zookeeper and charge him with...

...transporting gulls across a steak lion for immortal porpoises. ","So there‚Äôs this old, old zookeeper who is nearing retirement.",7

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Mbembe approached it very carefully.

He got down on one knee and inspected the elephant's foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it.

As carefully and as gently as he could, Mbembe worked the wood out with his hunting knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.

The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments.

Mbembe stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away.

Mbembe never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Mbembe was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son.

As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Mbembe and his son Tapu were standing.

The large bull elephant stared at Mbembe, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Mbembe couldn't help wondering if this was the same elephant.

Mbembe summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Mbembe' s legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly. It wasn't the same elephant.",Elephants never forget,561

Joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

Naturally the Radio bleeps it out, but you realize that it sounds familiar. You realize that the rappers are speaking in Morse code. 

Your eyes widen as you swerve over onto the shoulder of the expressway, nearly hitting a Jeep Cherokee in the process. It didn‚Äôt matter to you. Frantically searching the glove compartment, the backseat, and your purse, you finally find a small notepad and a pen with a low ink cartridge. You listen closely to the radio, and begin to scribble down as much as you can. You realize it was merely a pattern. 

‚Äî -. . / - .‚Äì ‚Äî / - .‚Äì ‚Äî / ..-. .. ..-. - -.‚Äì

Unfortunately for you, you aren‚Äôt very well versed in translating Morse code, merely recognizing it. You reach into your purse to grab your phone, but after a moment of searching, you realize you had left it at home before you left for work. ‚ÄúGod damnit,‚Äù you mutter. You‚Äôre more than halfway to your office, and you‚Äôre already running late due to the fact that that you decided to follow some whim and jot down some cryptic message from a provocative rapper. Concluding that it would probably be best for you to mosey to work, you pull back onto the expressway and try to make it to work on time.

Upon arriving at work, you ask any coworker in sight if they know Morse code. Nobody seems to, and some don‚Äôt even know what Morse code is. You slump your shoulders in disappointment and head over to your desk, when suddenly, the quiet, mouse-like secretary clears her throat and says, ‚ÄúExcuse me, I know Morse code!‚Äù

You turn around with the same wide eyes as before. ‚ÄúYou do!?‚Äù you ask vigorous excitement, which seems to startle the young woman.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúwhen I was younger, I planned on joining the navy, so I taught it to myself.‚Äù You feel a bit sorry for her, that she wound up as a mere secretary instead of a naval officer, but that feeling of pity didn‚Äôt stop you from being grateful for the lucky coincidence of her knowing Morse code. You show her the pattern.

‚Äî -. . / - .‚Äì ‚Äî / - .‚Äì ‚Äî / ..-. .. ..-. - -.‚Äì

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all there is?‚Äù she asks, furrowing her brow. 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù you shrugged, ‚Äúit just kept repeating that over and over again. What does it say?‚Äù

‚ÄúOne, two, two, fifty.‚Äù

Your heart sinks a little. ‚ÄúWhat is that? What does that mean, is it like a phone number or house address or something?‚Äù 

The secretary shrugs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs too short to be a phone number, but beyond deciphering it, I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt help you.‚Äù

You nod slowly, and though you understand, you are still not at all satisfied. You go to sit at your desk. 1 2 2 50. The sequence plays over and over in your head all day, and needless to say, your curiosity an wonderment got the best of you. It was not a very productive work day.

You head home, and the same damned song plays on the radio. You shake your head as if that would make the song stop, then decide to plug 12250 into your GPS to see if there are any autofill results. None. You become increasingly frustrated. 

When you get home, your daughter is sitting at the kitchen table, working on homework. She runs up to you and gives you a big hug, and asks about your day at work. You put on a fake smile and sigh. ‚ÄúInteresting,‚Äù you say‚Äî no doubt sugarcoating the intense excitement, disappointment, and confusion. 

‚ÄúWill you help me with my homework? I have to memorize something for my history class tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, doll! What are you memorizing?‚Äù 

She hands you a laminated sheet of paper. ‚ÄúRoman numerals!‚Äù

You glance over the page, your eyes quickly darting from one, to two, to fifty.

It dawns on you. You‚Äôd recognize this pattern anywhere.

Preparing for this trip for the entire year, the man finally booked a flight into Antwerp International. When he landed at the airport, he noticed the language being used on signs and spoken over the PA system was nothing like the Dutch he had been learning this whole time.

He got the attention of an older Belgian gentleman and asked, ""Excuse me, the language here, it isn't Dutch, is it?""

The gentleman smiled back and replied, ""Oh no, it is Dutch, probably just a different dialect then you're used to.""

The American was taken aback. ""A different dialect?""

He looks back to the new customer. ""This guy's amazing, totally old school. Can size a guy just by looking at him. Makes all of his suits himself, and I'll get him to cut you a deal.""

Unfortunately, the specialist tells him that the only solution at this time is to remove his testicles, or else he'll just continue having horrible headaches.

The man ponders this devestatingly difficult decision, but ultimately decides that, while it may be a steep price to pay, removing his testicles would be worth it in order to stop these headaches.

After the procedure, the man, much to his relief, finally stops having headaches. However, without his testicles, he starts to get slightly depressed.

He goes back to see the specialist, asking if there's anything to be done.

The specialist is tells the man this is common, and in this situation, before prescribing antidepressants, he likes to send his patients to his friend, the tailor.

""He's amazing!"" the specialist says. ""He can size you up just by looking at you! He's never been wrong, and you'll feel like a new man!""

Deciding he has nothing to lose, the man goes to see the tailor.

Walking into the tailor's shop, the man sees some of the finest and sharpest suits he'd ever seen. This was already making him feel better.

""Welcome!"" said the tailor. ""What can I do for you today?""

The man says ""I need a new suit to feel like a new man.""

""Ah yes. Well, I'm sure we can get you sorted out right away"" the tailor says. ""First things first, let's get you measured.""

'Ladies and gentlemen, today you will be witness to one of the greatest tricks in history. I will place my penis in this here aligator's mouth and punch it right in the eye.'

He does exactly that, and in everybody's amazement, the aligator does not bite the entertainer's penis. 

'Ladies and gentlemen, in order to show you that this was not sheer luck, I will attempt to do this again, but this time I will punch the aligator in both of his eyes with all of my strength.'

He does exactly that. He places his penis in the aligator's mouth and proceeds to punch the aligator with as much strength as he could conjure in both of his arms, but again, in everybody's amazement, the aligator stays still.

'Ladies and gentlemen, having seen that, is there anybody in the audience who would like to attempt this?'

Scared out of their minds of even thinking of doing something like that, everybody goes silent in their seats except of one old lady who gets up from her seat and enthusiastically says:

'I'll do it, but please don't punch too hard.'

Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",A Man Wakes Up Dazed and Confused in a Strange City,381
