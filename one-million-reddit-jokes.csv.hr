Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

After several weeks of moping about because he's too embarrassed to go alone, his older sister finally gives in, and tells him she'll pretend to be his date because no one at the school knows her anyway.

Unfortunately, when the first slow dance begins, she spots her brother sitting glumly off to the side, and can't help offering to dance, just once, with him. Nobody seems to care or notice, so they dance together through the night and have a great time.

As they're driving home, she notices him sullenly looking out the window. Knowingly, she pulls into a motel parking lot and tells him, ""Listen, I know you were hoping to get down with someone tonight and that is definitely not happening, but we can sleep in the same bed and you can pretend in the morning that you just had amazing sex with some girl from your class."" Instantly, he brightens up, so they rent a room.

While laying together in bed, they begin talking about old relationships when it becomes clear that he has never even had a girlfriend. In complete disbelief, she tells herself to swallow her pride and help him out. ""Okay,"" she says. ""Just this one time, I want you to kiss me so you know how it feels and what to do. I don't want you to flame out like a spazz when you finally get a chance.""

They begin kissing and start feeling so amorous toward each other that they start to forget their proper boundaries. Clothes come off so quickly that before they know it they're doing the deed! But not all is well. After a couple minutes, he looks deep into her eyes, and says ""Fuck, sis, you're looser than mom!"" 

""I know,"" she says. ""Dad told me.""",A teenage boy can't find a date for prom NSFW,15

post,9kzjoz,2qh72,jokes,false,1538558261,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9kzjoz/rich_man_shenanigans/,self.jokes,,"There was once an extremely wealthy man who was known for his eccentric habits. One fine evening, he sent out an invite to all the young, able-bodied men of his city for a very ""special"" dinner, promising a grand prize for one lucky soul. 

Knowing the rich man's generous nature, a hundred young men assembled at his mansion in their finest, most expensive wear. The butler ushered them to the backyard which had a gigantic Olympic sized swimming pool. But the yard was not lit up and in the faint moonlight, all the men could make out was the dark waves of the water.

The rich man stepped into the scene from his balcony overlooking the entire yard.

Rich man: I have called you all here tonight to give you all the chance to prove greatness, skill and bravery. For any man that can complete the task I have set for you, I have a grand prize of your choosing. 

You can either choose :

1. A 100 million dollars 

2. All my estates and properties worth 500 million dollars

3. Marry my beautiful daughter.

Listening to this, all the young men got excited. They all shouted back, ""What is the task old man?"" 

Rich man: The grand prize will go to the first man... that can swim the entire length of this swimming pool.

The crowd went uncontrollable with laughter. They all thought it was the easiest challenge they'd ever faced and got ready in front of the pool to take a dive.

The rich man pulled a lever to his right and about 50 lights came on illuminating the entire pool. The pool was filled with man-eating sharks, hundreds of water snakes and about 2 dozen crocodiles all eyeing the men standing above. 

 Rich man: *laughs* you didn't think it would be that easy did you?

The men were unsure now. No amount of money or land could compensate for their life. Nobody dared to move and all stood still in a hushed silence.

All of a sudden, breaking the pin-drop silence, one man let out a Tarzan scream and dived into the pool, and swam at a speed that would put Michael Phelps to shame. With great expertise and agility he dodged every snake and with extraordinary dexterity, he managed to swim through all the sharks and crocs and finally jump out at the other end.

There was a thunder of applause from the men and the rich man ran out to the brave man gasping for air. He shook the man's hand and said to him:

Rich man: You have proved that you have nerves of steel, man. Tell me now. What do you desire? Do you want a 100 million dollars?

Man: (gasping for air) no...

Rich man: Then you surely want all my estates and properties worth 500 million dollars don't you?

Man: (gasping for air) no...

Rich man: Aah I see. You are a smart man. You realized if you married my daughter, you would get all three. So tell me my good man. You want to marry my daughter don't you?

Man: (gasping for air) no... Man....no...

Rich man: (puzzled) Then what do you want?

Man: (gasping for air) The son of a b*tch that pushed me off. ",Rich man shenanigans,93

After a complete exam the doctor told the man that the muscles around the base of his penis were damaged from a prior viral infection and there was nothing he could do for him.

However, he knew of an experimental treatment that might work, if he were willing to take the risk. The treatment consisted of implanting muscle tissue from an elephant's trunk in the man's penis.

The man thought about it for a while. The thought of going through life without ever experiencing sex again was just too much for him to bear. So, with the assurance that there would be no cruelty or adverse effect on the elephant, the man decided to go for it. A few weeks after the operation, he was given the green light to use his newly renovated equipment.

As a result, he planned a romantic evening with his girlfriend and took her to one of the nicest restaurants in the city. She was leaning over the table in a low cut shirt, and sure enough he began to feel very uncomfortable. To release the pressure, he unzipped his fly. Suddenly his penis emerged from his pants, went to the top of the table, grabbed a roll, and retreated into his pants.

His girlfriend was stunned at first, but then with a sly smile on her face said: ""That was incredible. Can you do that again?""

With his eyes watering, he replied: ""I think I can, but I'm not sure if I can take another dinner roll in the ass.""",A man went to the doctor complaining about erectile dysfunction...,916

To do this, the Queen of England commissioned an expedition to travel across North American and chart what tribes were where.

The expedition started on the Northeastern cost. Venturing inland, they encountered the Iroquois; they met with the chief and learned what the tribe was called. But this was a tribe of warriors, and the expedition didn't intend to stay longer than necessary. Soon, the expedition pushed Southwest. 

Eventually, following the Appalachian mountains, they found themselves in the company of the Cherokee tribe. They found this tribe quite amicable and after some rest and trading for supplies, the expedition set out again across the plains.

There, they found the Arapaho. They learned what the people called themselves and, after some bartering, set out again, northwest where they met with the Crow. The expedition learned the name of this tribe too and again, after some rest, set out once more.

Soon, they came upon the Rocky Mountains. It was too daunting a task to cross them, so the tribe followed the mountains South. Eventually, they found themselves amid nothing but sprawling, hot desert. Running low on water and supplies, they gratefully found themselves in the company of the Navajo. After learning how to get water from cacti, they met with the chief and learned what the people called themselves.

The expedition found other tribes, as well, and at this point decide to follow the Southern coastline of this new world back to their ships. Or better yet, rendezvous with some of the trading vessels that sometimes crawled up what would come to be known as the Gulf of Mexico and return to their ships by see in the company of other Europeans.

But, after travelling so far for so long, slogging through swamps and plagued by insects, they eventually became lost. After much wandering, they were fortunately found by hunters from a tribe they had yet to record. The hunters recognized that these strange, bumbling foreigners were in need of rest, food, and guidance. So, they took them back to their camp to meet the chief.

The chief was a natural leader; though the expedition did not know the language of the tribe, they could tell he exuded an air of authority, but also came across as jubilant and possessed great mirth; thus he had the expedition's full attention. Eagerly, the commander took out paper and quill to write down what the tribe called themselves, listening closely for anything that sounded like an introduction.

Now, though this tribe lived deep in a secluded part of North America, these were not the first English speakers the chief had seen. And so, to show he meant peace and good will, the chief said to the outsiders what he often heard other adventurers say just before being discovered the tribe. With a wry smile and a nod of understanding, the chief said to the commander what he had heard so many Englishmen say before.

With the inked quill in the commander's eager hand and a gleam in the sympathetic chief's eye, the chief boomed in welcome:

Jim Bob and John Boy were sittin on their front porch watching their beans grow. On the road at the edge of their property they see a Volkswagen sputter to a stop. They head out to it and see a pretty woman looking at the engine and scratching her head. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jim Bob ""What's the problem miss?""

&amp;#x200B;

Lady ""I don't know maybe you can tell?""

&amp;#x200B;

Jim Bob and John Boy take a look and find the radiator hose is broken and tell her.

&amp;#x200B;

Lady ""Is there someplace nearby I can get it fixed""

&amp;#x200B;

John Boy ""The nearest place is about six miles down the road but it's after five so it's already closed.""

&amp;#x200B;

Lady ""Is there a motel nearby that I can stay the night?""

&amp;#x200B;

Jim Bob ""The nearest place is about three miles down the road but our truck is broked so we can't take you there.""

&amp;#x200B;

Lady ""Well can I stay at your place for the night?""

&amp;#x200B;

John Boy ""Sure but we only have one bed.""

&amp;#x200B;

Lady ""That's O.K., I just need a place to stay.""

&amp;#x200B;

After dinner they went to bed, the lady in the middle started to play with their penises. As they became erect she reaches into her purse whips out a couple of condoms and hands them to Jim Bob and John Boy.

&amp;#x200B;

Jim Bob ""What are these things for?""

&amp;#x200B;

Lady ""These are so I don't get pregnant.""

&amp;#x200B;

They all have sex for a couple hours and in the morning they call the tow truck and send her on her way.

&amp;#x200B;

About six months later Jim Bob and John Boy are sittin on their front porch watching their beans grow...

&amp;#x200B;

Jim Bob ""Do you really care if that woman gets pregnant?""

John Boy ""No.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Dave was bragging to his boss,1564

After some discussion with his wife, the man made a visit to the herbalist and handed his voucher over wondering what he was in for. The elderly herbalist handed a potion to the man, and with a grip on his shoulder warned him.


""This is a powerful medicine. You take only a teaspoonful, and then say '1-2-3.' When you do, you will become more manly than you have ever been in your life, and you can perform as long as you want.""


Greatly encouraged, the man turned and started to walk away, then stopped and asked, ""How do I stop the medicine from working?""


The herbalist replied, ""Your partner must say '1-2-3-4,' but when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon.""


Eager to see if it worked the man went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine, and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom.


When she came in, he took off his clothes and said, ""1-2-3!"" Immediately, he was the manliest of men. His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes, and then she asked, ""What was the 1-2-3 for?""

The case came up in court. The judge asked the man (about 20 years old) what he had to say for himself.
The young man replied, Well your Honor, it was like this: When the lady got on the bus, I couldn’t help but notice her condition. She sat down under a sign that said, “The Double Mint Twins are coming” and I grinned.

Then she moved and sat under a sign that said, “Logan’s Liniment will reduce the swelling”, and I had to smile. Then she placed herself under a deodorant sign that said, “William’s Big Stick Did the Trick”, and I could hardly contain myself.

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task.

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!
With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

Finally one day Justin said to Christian, ""I'm fed up with being a prawn; I wish I was a shark, and then I wouldn't have any worries about being eaten."" 

A large mysterious cod appeared and said, ""Your wish is granted."" Lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark. Horrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by his old mate.

Time passed and Justin found life as a shark boring and lonely. All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close 
to them. 

Justin didn't realize that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight. 
While swimming alone one day he saw the mysterious cod again and he thought perhaps the mysterious fish could change him back.

He approached the cod and begged to be changed back, and, lo and behold, he found himself turned back into a prawn. 

With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes Justin swam back to his friends and bought them all a cocktail.

Looking around the gathering at the reef he realized he couldn't see his old pal. 

""Where's Christian?"" he asked. 

""He's at home, still distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy &amp; became a shark,"" came the reply. 

Eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture, he set off to Christian's abode. 

As he opened the coral gate, memories came flooding back. He banged on the door and shouted: ""It's me, Justin, your old friend, come out and see me again."" 

Christian replied, ""No way man, you'll eat me. You're now a shark, the enemy, and I'll not be tricked into being your dinner.""

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires.

The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a noosed rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",The legend of the three kingdoms,15

She'd been skating and had fallen into the icy water. Without a moment's hesitation the tramp ran onto the ice and slipped and slided over to the little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and he carried her back to the road.

He took off his coat and wrapped the little girl in it and began looking for a car to flag down. A few moments later a huge chauffeur-driven limo pulled up, and who stepped out but the little girl's father - the mayor of the nearby town and a multi-millionaire.

""How can I ever thank you sir?"" says the father after putting his daughterinto the warmth of the limo.

""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ahem, well ..."" stammered the tramp ""...eh I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out""

""Certainly"" says the girl's father and he pulls out his wallet.

""Oh dear"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten dollars - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten dollars is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that will be plenty"".

""Well, if you insist"" says the father - ""now what will you do with your money?""

""Oh that's easy"" says the tramp ""I've not had a rest in 20 years. I think I'll buy myself a holiday""

""Well good luck"" says the father, and he gets into the car and signals his chauffeur to drive home.

""Ten Dollars"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"", and off he goes to the town, to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk.

""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind"" replied the tramp.

""Well how much money does sir have to spend on sir's holiday?""

""Oh lots - anything up to ten dollars""

""TEN DOLLARS!! You'll never get a holiday for ten dollars"" says the girl incredulously.

""Oh dear"" said the tramp, ""and I was so looking forward to a holiday - I'll probably never get another chance - isn't there anything you can do?""

""Well I don't think so sir, but hold on and I'll check""

The girl goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop.

""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten dollars""

""Yippee"", exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it""

The tramp takes the tickets and, shouldering his dirty old pack, he heads out the door to hitch-hike to the port where the ship is waiting.

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Amazed at his luck and good fortune, he slings his pack over his shoulder, and marches up the gangplank.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""Super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

Hardly believeing his eyes, the captain examines the ticket and admits that our man the tramp is correct.

""Ahem, well O.K."", says the captain, ""But you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst"", says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship! The tramp had never in his wildest dreams imagined luxury like this.

First they went doen through the first class level:

Oriental carpets - 6"" pile.

A genuine Rembrahndt on every wall.

Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair.

24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class:

As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep.

and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class,

down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with, a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing...""

""Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived....

...and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple. Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Eh, well I've never actually dived before"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen ....""

He broke off.

""Hey, I've an idea"", he started again.

""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man.

For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Then one morning the captain came to talk.

""O.K. I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""O.K."" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck.

Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Then the tramp turned to regard the diving board. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well tramp"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do.""

And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie.

And the tramp began to climb....

up and up ...

up and up ...

higher and higher ...

below him the ship grew smaller ...

up and up ...

on and on ...

past a solitary albatross ...

and still higher, till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below ...

still further, till the ocean grew dim, and the earth itself began to shrink...

and higher, ever higher ...

on and on ....

higher, and higher, and on and on towards the diving board,

He climbed on top and radioed the captain .... and then...

he jumped .

slowly at first

but speeding up

faster, and faster

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance,

the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster...

past the albatross,

faster

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

DOWN!

THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!

THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL..........

SMASH! into into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping....

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

HERO! WONDERFUL! AMAZING! BLOODY GOOD SHOW WHAT!

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most STUPENDOUS piece of diving I have ever seen""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on:

""But tell me; most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly:

""Well you see I'm a poor tramp so you must understand...

I've been through many a hardship in my life""","One cold winter's morning a tramp was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.",438

And on that island there lived the native tribe, who called themselves, ""Trids"". Trids inhabited the island by themselves. They made their own cities and an organized government to prevent chaos. All was well for the Trids, life was good and peaceful. One day, one of the Trids decided he wanted to climb up a mountain to pick berries at the top. He climbed about halfway up, but then he was kicked off the mountain and into the ocean by a giant. Another Trid wanted to find out what was going on, so he climbed up the mountain. He got about halfway up and then the giant kicked him down. Finally, a third Trid climbed the mountain. 
He begged, ""Please don't kick me down."" The giant didn't care, the giant kicked him down anyways.
Remember how I said the Trids were the *only* people on the island? I wasn't telling the full truth. On the island, they had a rabbi. The rabbi wasn't actually a Trid by blood, but the rabbi was still one of the highest-ranking officials in the Trid community. After Trids were getting kicked off the mountain, they decided to bring up this issue to the rabbi. 
A Trid approched the rabbi and said, ""Rabbi! Rabbi! We want to climb the mountain but the giant keeps kicking us off."" The rabbi then agreed he would climb the mountain and talk to the giant.

The next day rolls around and the rabbi begins climbing the mountain. He gets about halfway up, and surprisingly, the giant doesn't kick him down. He climbs a little higher, still no kick. He climbs all the way to the top of the mountain, the giant still doesn't kick him. The rabbi then looks the giant in the eyes and asks, ""Why is it that when one of the Trids climbs the mountain you kick them off, but when I climb the mountain, you don't.""


The giant chuckles as he says, *""Silly rabbi, kicks are for Trids.""*","Once upon a time, there was an island...",31

“The usual please, Hugh, pint of Smith’s and a packet of dry roasted.”

“Coming right up.”

Mr Jones took his favourite stool and skimmed the room for friends of his. It had been a long day of working down the mines, and he was looking forward to a relaxed evening with his mates, a few pints and a rugby match on tv.

It would become clear over an hour later that his friends weren’t going to show up. It was a slow night too, a few lonely souls lost in the corners of the room nursing drinks. By that time he was feeling a little melancholy himself, and had sank two pints in quick succession. His team, the Llanelli Scarlets, were a few minutes away from losing the match.

“Looks like the Scarlets have had better luck, eh Hugh?” she said from across the bar.

For the first time in five whole minutes Mr Jones looked up from his pint glass and across to the creature sat by the other end of the bar. Her drink was a gin and tonic, as Mr Jones would soon find out, and she was beautiful. This information was enough for him to decide that his night was about to get a lot better.

“My name’s John. What’s yours?” The Scarlets had just lost the match, which now seemed irrelevant.

“Stacey.” she said, extending an impressively manicured hand. 

John was a man of few words, but needed only a few to be able to charm Stacey. After flirting over a few more drinks, it became blissfully comfortable for them both to kiss, gently huddled in the pub’s warm glow. The few people who were visiting the pub had long left, and Hugh had seen it fit to dim the lights.

“Come home with me.” It was soon, far too soon, but seemed as natural as breathing. This was love at first sight.

John swooped Stacey up into his arms as they crossed the threshold into his cottage. He climbed the stairs, barely able to contain his desire to kiss and hold every part of Stacey.

He laid her down onto the bed and started to undress. It was at this point that Stacey had turned slightly cold, unbeknownst to John. Her kisses became non-committal, and she would not respond to John’s attempts at escalation. The alcohol was slowly wearing off. After 20 minutes of grunting and sweating to no avail, Mr Jones had finally had enough.

“Am I the only one doing any work here, or are you going to take your jacket off and help me with this?” he said, pointing at his erection. “And what’s all this bloody white stuff all over my bed? Are you fucking up for it or what?”

“Well, you know, John, I am a sheep.” she replied, giggling.",A Welsh man walks into a bar...,0

In the piece, there's a long passage about 20 minutes during which the bass violinists have nothing to do. Rather than sit around that whole time, some bass players decided to sneak offstage and go to the tavern next door for a quick one.

After slamming several beers in quick succession, one of them looked at his watch. ""Hey! We need to get back!"" he said.

""No need to panic,"" said a fellow bass player. ""I thought we might need some extra time, so I tied the last few pages of the conductor's score together with string. It'll take him a few minutes to get it untangled.""

A few moments later, they staggered back to the concert hall and took their places in the orchestra.

About this time, a member of the audience noticed the conductor seemed a bit edgy, and said as much to her companion.

""Well, of course,"" said her companion, ""Don't you see? It's the bottom of The Ninth, the score is tied, and the bassists are loaded.""",Bottom of The Ninth,30

He later falls upon hard times and so he talks to his banker. His banker lets him know that things are worse than the man had realized, he couldn't even afford the church's tithe.

Upon these hard times he fell away from the church. For years he accumulated debt trying to keep up appearances and become successful again.

One day, the pastor of the man's old church approaches him and asks why he hasnt been coming to church and paying his tithe.

The man confides in his old pastor and confesses that he's come by a bit of bad luck and so fell away from the church. The pastor says, of course you've fallen onto tough times, you've fallen away from the church! ""Start coming back to the churh and and paying your tithe and you'll be back in god's good graces in no time!""

""Do you really think that will help? I'm in pretty deep here""

""Well I suppose if you really want to you could pay the tithe for the time you were gone from the church the full 10% of everything you accumulated should belong to the church""

So the man and the pastor meet with the man's banker and calculate everything he's accumulated over his years out of the church and they both sign. The pastor excitedly opens the note to see how much the church will be getting. ""Wow! $60,000! It's more than the church could have hoped for!"" The Banker says ""Yes, up until now, us too! Now how will you be paying this debt?""

Upon these hard times, he fell away from the church. For years he accumulated debt trying to keep up appearances and become successful again.

One day, the pastor of the man's old church approaches him and asks why he hasn't been coming to church and paying his tithe.

The man confides in his old pastor and confesses that he's come by a bit of bad luck and so fell away from the church. The pastor says, of course you've fallen onto tough times, you've fallen away from the church! ""Start coming back to the church and paying your tithe and you'll be back in God's good graces in no time!""

""Do you really think that will help? I'm in pretty deep here""

""Well I suppose if you really want to you could pay the tithe for the time you were gone from the church the full 10% of everything you accumulated should belong to the church""

So the man and the pastor meet with the man's banker and calculate everything he's accumulated over his years out of the church and they both sign.

The Pastor opens the envelope and exclaims ""Wow! $60,000! It's more than the church could have hoped for!"" The Banker says ""Yes, up until now, us too! Now how will you be paying?""",A moral businessman always pays his tithe,23

The next day the man returns to the doctors office and hands the jar to his physician. It is as spotless as the day before. 

“What happened?” said the doctor. It looks the same as yesterday. 

“Well,” said the old man, “I got home and figured I’d give it a whirl... I tried it with my right hand first, and then my left hand, but I couldn’t get it to go.”

“So then my wife Mary came home and I got her to help me. She tried it with her right. She tried it with her left. She even tried using her mouth. But still... nothing!”

“Then we went over to our beautiful neighbor Norene and asked her to help us. She tried it with her right, her left, her mouth. She even used her armpit. But still wouldn’t you believe it... nothing!”

The doctor scoffed, “you got your neighbor involved with that?!”

“Yes,” the old man said, “but none of us could get the damn jar open!”",An elderly man went to his physician for a checkup. (OC),3

After six months or so of almost total isolation, someone knocks on his door. He opens it and a huge, bearded man is standing there. 'Name's Cliff, your neighbor from forty miles up the road. Having a Christmas party Friday night. Thought you might like to come at about 5:00...' 'Great', says Tom, 'after six months out here I'm ready to meet some local folks thank you.' As Cliff is leaving, he stops. 'Gotta warn you. Be some drinking'.'

'Not a problem' says Tom. 'After 25 years in the business, I can drink with the best of 'em'.

Again, the big man starts to leave and stops. 'More 'n' likely gonna be some fighting' too.'

'Well, I get along with people, I'll be all right! . I'll be there. Thanks again.'

'More'n likely be some wild sex, too,'

The farmer explains that there were 1,000 acres half farmable and the other half beautiful timber with a trout stream and a small pond full of small mouth bass.  

The man was intrigued but concerned about the price, which he agreed was fair market value.

Then the farmer told the man of the farms secret.  There were no biting or stinging insects on the property.  

Now the man was very intrigued but how could they prove this claim and if they could prove it, he might be willing to pay what the farmer was asking.

The farmer suggested that they tie the man naked to a tree over night and if he didn't have a single mark on his person, his claim would be proven and the man would buy the land at the asking price.  As a bonus the farmer added that if there was just one mark or sting on the man's body that he would sell the property at half the asking price.

The man realized that the farmers claim was too good to be true and fully expected to buy the land at half price and readily agrees. 

As agreed the farmer ties the man to a tree with his hands behind his back and leaves for the evening.  

The next morning the farmer drives into the woods and sees the man still tied to the tree.  His skin is pale white like a ghost, covered in sweat and he's shaking so hard he is almost convulsing.

The farmer runs to his side asking WHAT HAPPENED, was it bugs, mosquitoes or bees, what happened.  

The man replies in a quavering voice, ""No, nothing like that, but doesn't that baby calf over there have a mother?""

The Purple pirate picked a purple pear and ate it, however, halfway through the purple pear he heard a shout from behind. The Purple pirate turned around to see an angry purple farmer wielding a purple shotgun who shouted ""OI! Those are my purple pears! Pay up, Theif!"".

The Purple pirate had no money so the purple farmer dragged him to purple court where the purple judge sentenced the purple pirate to a week in purple jail for scrumping.

The purple pirate was taken to the purple jail, down the purple corridors, up to his purple cell. The Purple jail guard opened the purple door and said to the purple pirate ""indigo"".",The Purple Pirate,10

The Bartender replies with hearty confidence, ""Just take a bite my friend.""

The man, now curious, exclaims, ""Why not?"" and takes a bite.

The man looks up, the face of bliss, and says, ""Good lord, this is the loveliest Rum I've ever had in my life, but I ordered rum and coke!""

The Bartender nods and replies, ""Take a bite from the other side.""

The man does as told and takes a bite and with eyes wide and glowing says, ""My my, this is the most satisfying Coke in all the land.""

A second man walks into the bar at this very moment and asks for a Vodka and orange juice.

The bartender replies heartily, ""An apple to suit any flavor you desire!""

The second man, now curious, takes a bite of his apple. He looks up in awe and says, ""Well I'll be damned. This Orange Juice is better than even my old granny's homemade.. But where's the Vodka?""

The first man motions for the second man to turn his apple.

The second man does so and takes another bite. Again looks up in wonder and says, now a little dazed, ""Better than the finest Vodka I've had in all my ages!""

Suddenly a third man bursts through the bar doors and sits down at the bar. Before he can say anything, the two men next to him start excitedly telling him all about the apples, ""You can have absolutely any flavor you want!"" they both exclaimed.

The third man, skeptical and with a smug look on his face says, ""Anything I want eh? Are each of you willing to bet your wallet on that?""

The first and second man exchanged looks then hurriedly said, ""Yes! Yes! Now order anything your heart desires!""

The third man, excited to walk home with a bundle of cash, says to the Bartender, ""I want an apple that tastes like Pussy!""

Three men go on a walkabout vacation in the outback of Australia. They have never been to the continent, and unknowingly tresspassed on aboriginal grounds.

Towards dusk, they are ambushed and kidnapped by aborigines. They are taken back to thier village, and bound while the aborigines prepare for the event.

With all three men bound around the fire, the leader explains that they will all be killed, and their bodies will be used as crafting materials for the village. He said that the most important use for them would be to use thier skins to make canoes. 

However, the leader explained that they were a merciful people and that they could choose how they would die. They had to make that decision fast, though, or the leader would choose for them. 

The first man somberly asks the leader to shoot him with a gun he had stored in his luggage. He obliges, and shoots the first man. 

The second man begrudgingly asks for death by blade, and the leader obliges once more, and kills the second man using a knife from his luggage.  

The third man, having had time to think, asks politely and confidently for a fork, also in his luggage. The leader, confused, retrieves the fork. The third man also asks if he could have permission to do it himself, the leader agrees.

The third man takes the fork, and a manic smile appears on his face as he begins to stab himself all over his body with the fork while screaming,

On this particular afternoon, someone made the comment that preaching to people isn't really all that hard. A real challenge would be to preach to a bear.

One thing led to another and they decided to do an experiment. They would all go out into the woods, find a bear, preach to it, and attempt to convert it.

Seven days later, they're all together to discuss the experience.

Father Flannery, who has his arm in a sling, is on crutches, and has various bandages, goes first.
""Well,"" he says, ""I went into the woods to find me a bear. And when I found him I began to read to him from the Catechism. Well, that bear wanted nothing to do with me and began to slap me around. So I quickly grabbed my holy water, sprinkled him and, Holy Mary Mother of God, he became as gentle a lamb. The bishop is coming out next week to give him first communion and confirmation.""

Reverend Billy Bob spoke next. He was in a wheelchair, with an arm and both legs in casts, and an IV drip. In his best fire and brimstone oratory he claimed, "" WELL brothers, you KNOW that we don't sprinkle! I went out and I FOUND me a bear. And then I began to read to my bear from God's HOLY WORD! But that bear wanted nothing to do with me. So I took HOLD of him and we began to wrestle. We wrestled down one hill, UP another and DOWN another until we came to a creek. So I quick DUNKED him and BAPTIZED his hairy soul. And just like you said, he became as gentle as a lamb. We spent the rest of the day praising Jesus.""

They both looked down at the rabbi, who was lying in a hospital bed. He was in a body cast and traction with IV's and monitors running in and out of him. He was in bad shape.

The rabbi looks up and says, ""Looking back on it, circumcision may not have been the best way to start.""","A priest, a preacher and a Rabbi walked into their favorite bar",90

No one on the team is willing to hire him, but the distillery manager lets him sit for the interview for amusement's sake.

He asks his assistant to bring a glass of whisky for the homeless man. She sets it down in front of him, and he gives it a taste. Then, he says, ""12 years old, aged in an oak barrel, wood stained from use in a wine barrel, heavy amount of peat used in the fire. Biscuit notes, with heavy smoke, and a hint of vanilla.""

The distillery team is dumbstruck. They never expected the homeless man to be so adept at tasting. Wanting to prove that this was just dumb luck, the manager makes his assistant get a different glass of whisky from his personal collection.

She gives it to the homeless man, and he drinks. Then, he says, ""A 12 year old whisky from Canada and a 6 year old whisky from Scotland, blended in Japan, and aged a further 6 years in oak barrels. Herbal notes, with apricot.""

Not one to hire a disheveled, problematic seeming individual, the manager takes his assistant aside and tells her to pee in a cup, and hand it to him for tasting.

""He'll never be able to guess what it is, and we can reject him without looking bad!""

The assistant goes away for a bit, and comes back with the glass of pee. The manager snickers as the homeless man drinks.

Dick says, ""Well, I'm in the middle of the line and there's one guy in front of me and one behind, I'm the safer bet.""

Harry says, ""No, I'm at the front of the line and there are two guys behind me, I'm the best bet.""

""How is that possible?"" exclaims the old lady. ""Are you going in two different directions?"" They refuse to answer, so the old lady declines the offer for help and moves to the side. She's thinking about the encounter as she hears footsteps moving away.

A curious bystander goes up to her to ask why she refused the offer for help. The old lady mentions the strange responses and is confused when the other bursts out laughing. 

""What really happened - which position were Tom, Dick, and Harry in? How is that possible?"" she asks.

""It's really simple,"" is the response. ""One of them was lying.""",Three men are walking in a line,0

One day, he is running a little behind and will be late to his next stop if he doesn't hurry. He calls into the train station and asks to speed up the train so he can make it in time. They tell him that he's hauling too much to safely travel any faster and that he needs to maintain his current speed.

Not wanting to mess up his record, he goes against the stations' orders and speeds up the train. He comes to a curve in the track and because of the weight, the train derails and the resulting crash kills a man. Being that he went against orders, the driver was charged with manslaughter and sentenced to death by electric chair.

He gets into the chair and the undertaker asks him what he wants for his last meal. He asks for one banana.

With a confused look, the undertaker gets one banana and gives it to the driver. He eats the banana and gets strapped in. The undertaker flips the switch. Sparks fly and smoke fills the room. When the smoke clears, the driver is still alive!

In Bolivia, when you survive the death penalty, it's ruled as an act of God and you're free to go. 

The man haggles his way back into his job driving trains. With a non-perfect record though, he doesn't really care anymore about his job. He is going too fast again and derails another train; this time killing two people.

He's sentenced to death by chair once again. Before he gets strapped in, the undertaker asks him what he wants as his last meal. He asks for two bananas and the undertaker looks confused but gives him the two bananas.

After he's eaten, he is strapped in and the undertaker flips the switch. After a flurry of sparks, the man is still alive. Another act of God and he is free to go.

After begging and promising to be better this time, the man gets his job back driving trains. He didn't do any better though and killed three people after derailing it again.

Sentenced to death once more.

Once the undertaker asks him what he wants for his last meal, he replies 

""Three bananas please""

the undertaker says 

""I remember you! We're going against protocol and skipping your last meal. I'm tired of you eating those stupid bananas and getting away with killing people.""

The driver replies

post,9k6fmf,2qh72,jokes,false,1538314920,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9k6fmf/the_pink_note/,self.jokes,,"Jackson, do to events unknown to him, was woken up early one morning by his dad. 
“We have to leave!” His dad exclaimed, “Now!”
Jackson was, very reasonable, shocked. “What? Dad, what’s going on?” He replied, knowing deep down that he wouldn’t get an answer he wanted to hear, if any answer at all.
To his dismay, his father simply replied, “Now, son! We don’t have time. Grab whatever you can carry and and get in the car!”
Jackson threw a shirt on as fast as he could, grabbed a handful of his most precious items, and ran out to the car. He found his mother was already sitting in the passengers seat. She was very obviously weeping.
Jackson thought about asking his mother what was going on, but he knew there was no hope in getting any information.
Less than a minute later his dad ran out of the house, jumped in the drivers seat, and drove away. Jackson knew he would never see this home again.

Several months went by, and Jackson family was now living in a new town. He was to begin attending a knew school.
On his first day, between classes, he bumped into a girl. This girl was named Daisy, and they immediately hit it off.
Before he knew it, Jackson was falling in love with daisy.
Some weeks went by, until one day, things changed.

Daisy approached Jackson and said, “Before we begin this relationship, there’s something you need to know. I can’t say it out loud, so I wrote it down.” She handed him a small pink piece of paper and immediately left. The bell rang and Jackson went to class

In class, the note was burning a hole in Jackson’s pocket. He took it out and began to unfold it. His teacher saw him and took the note from him. The teacher read it and a look of pure fear broke over her. “We’re going to the principals office.” She said.

In the principal office, Jackson explained what had happened. He told her about the girl and how she had given him the note. The principal took the note from the teacher and read it. Again, that same fear filled look covered her face. “I’m calling your mother.” She said.

When his mother got to the school, the principal gave her the note and Jackson got in the car. They drove for a couple of minutes before his mother asked what happened. Jackson explained everything to her. He told her about the girl, and the teacher taking the note. He told her about the principal.  “The all looks so afraid, mom!” His mother looked stunned. She pulled to the side of the road and opened the note. Immediately her expression changed. She didn’t just look afraid, no, she looked terrified. “We’re going to see your father.” She said.

At home, Jackson replayed the entire days events to his dad. He just wanted to know what was going on! His dad read the note. His face turned to that same shocked and fearful expression, but then it changed to complete disappointment. “I’m sending you away.” His dad said.

Before Jackson know it, he was on a plane all alone flying somewhere that he had no idea. He had 20 dollars and the clothes on his back. Jackson was terrified and more sad than he had ever been. “I don’t even know what was on the note!” He thought. Before he could read it, his dad tore it up and burned it.

Jackson got off the plan some hours later feeling utterly depressed.
He found a box on the side of the road and decided he would sleep there for the rest of his life.

A few hours later, a man approached him. “Do you wanna know what the note said?” The man asked. Confused, but curious, Jackson replied, “More than anything in the world!”

So the man gave him instructions. “Walk down this road a quarter of a mile. You will see a barn with a white roof. Turn right and pass it. Immediately cross the field, but quickly. At the end of the field will be a road. Cross the road and enter the tower on the other side. On the top floor will be a man in a yellow jumpsuit. He will explain everything.”

Jackson didn’t asked questions. He sprung to his feet and ran down the road until he saw the barn. He turned past the barn and immediately crossed the field, sprinting fully as he crossed it. 

He reached the road, and saw the tower on the other side.

He began to cross the road and got hit by a car.",The Pink Note,1

On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men have jobs.

The woman reads the sign and says to herself, ""Well, that's better than my last boyfriend, but I wonder what's further up?"" So up she goes.

The second floor sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men have jobs and love kids.

The woman remarks to herself, ""That's great, but I wonder what's further up?"" And up she goes again.

The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men have jobs, love kids and are extremely good looking.

""Hmmm, better"" she says. ""But I wonder what's upstairs?""

The fourth floor sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking and help with the housework.

""Wow!"" exclaims the woman, ""very tempting. BUT, there must be more further up!"" And again she heads up another flight.

The fifth floor sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak.

""Oh, mercy me! But just think... what must be awaiting me further on?"" So up to the sixth floor she goes.

The sixth floor sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor 6,875,953,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please.",Shopping for a Husband,3
