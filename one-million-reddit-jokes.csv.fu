Understandably startled from seeing a talking frog, and from the requested amount of money, Patty asks the first thing that comes into her head.

""Do you have any collateral, sir?""

""Certainly,"" the frog replies, ""I have it right here."" and he then pulls out a small carved wooden elephant.

Patty is rather annoyed but kept her decorum.

""How dare you! If you think this is useless, take it up with my father, I got it from him.""

""And who is your father?"" Patty asks in reply.

""Keith Richards, of course!""

Feeling quite overwhelmed, and refusing to believe the frog, Patty decides to take the matter to her manager. Picking up the carved animal, she tells the frog that she will be back soon and that she is going to talk to her manager.

Entering her manager's office Patty says,

""Sir, there's a frog asking for a loan of a million dollars, his only collateral is a carved animal, and he claims that his father is Keith Richards!""

The Pope: ""I am the pope.""

Gabriel: ""Nope. I ain't got a pope in my rope"" (his book was made out of paper and thats actually fiber and a long piece of fiber is called a string and a lot of string is a rope so therefore every book is a rope-Heaven comedy turned awful after thousands of years)

The Pope: ""I'm the representative of God on Earth.""

Gabriel: ""What God? Just kidding. He's gotta a rep? Never knew...""

The Pope: ""But I am the leader of the Catholic Church ...""

Gabriel: ""The Catholic church ... What in bojangles... Wait, I'll check with the boss.""

Gabe walks away through Heaven's Gate to talk with God.

Gabriel: ""There's a dude standing outside who claims he's your representative on earth.""

God: ""I don't have a representative on earth, not that I know of ... Wait, I'll ask Jesus."" (yells for Jesus)

Jesus: ""Yes Father, what's up?""

God and Gabe give out the granular gossip in their goldy gazebo-

Jesus: ""Wait, I'll go outside and have a little chat with that there fellow.""

Ten minutes pass and Jesus re-enters the room laughing out loud, slapping the holes in his arms. After a few days (heaven comedy is also slow), Gabriel asks Jesus why he's laughing.

""Oh, it's just a statue,"" she replied nonchalantly. ""The Smiths bought one for their bedroom. I liked it so much, I got one for us too.""

No more was said about the statue, not even later that night when they went to sleep. Around two in the morning the husband got out of bed, went to the kitchen and returned a while later with a sandwich and a glass of milk.

Wife: ""I want to learn and besides it's something we can do together.""  


The husband begrudgingly accepts his wife request and they go to the golf course. On the first tee the husband drives it 300 yards, dead center. The wife tries it and slices it right into a huge window of a huge house on the side of the course.   


Husband says ""ah shit. Ok let's go pay for this window  


The couple arrives at the front door of the broken window house and rings the doorbell. A very well dressed man answers the door, ""Can I help you?""   


Husband: ""Hi we're the ones that broke the window, are you the owner of the house?""  


Well dressed man: ""oh no I am only the butler. Master is in the other room, follow me.   


The couple follows the butler through the massive entry and into a wondrous library. In the center of which sits the master, staring intently at a vase that was broken, quite clearly by the golf ball.  


Husband: ""oh I am so sorry. My wife, you see, is learning golf. She didn't mean to..""  


The master interrupts in an understanding tone ""haha oh its alright. You see I'm a genie and I was trapped in that vase for the last several hundred years. But you released me by breaking it. As you know genies grant 3 wishes. But since you did break the window I will save the third for myself, leave 1 each for you both. Madame would you like to go first?""  


Wife: ""uh I want lots of money....""  


""Done."" Interrupts the master, "" I'll also make it theft proof, fire proof, and infinite. Anytime you need money no matter the amount, it will be in your account.""  


Wife: ""oh my goodness thank you so much!""  


""You're turn"", says the the master looking at the husband.  


Husband: ""I'd like a beautiful home in ever country.""  


Master: ""and you shall have it. Complete with protection from all the elements and a staff to maintain it and look after you when you stay.""  


Husband: "" Jesus! thank you so much!""  


Master: ""not a problem. As for my wish, well I have been trapped in that vase for so long and all the while without a woman. I am sorry but my wish is to have sex with your beautiful wife.""  


Husband to wife: ""I don't know honey. I mean he did give us all of those houses and an unlimited amount of money. You know how I feel about cheating but this seems different.""  


Wife: ""yeah I agree. I'm not thrilled about it but I get where he is coming from. Okay I'll do it""  


The Master is thrilled and wisks the wife upstairs where they have loud, wall banging sex for hours on end. Finally after all that time the master comes down in only his underwear and his unbuttoned dress shirt. He grabs a cup of water and drinks the whole thing. The master then asks the nearby husband, "" if you don't mind me asking how old are you and your wife?""  


Husband: "" well I'm 32 and she is 34, why do you ask?""  


Master: ""just curious as to how you guys still believe in genies..... ",Husband says to his wife that he is going golfing. She gets upset because she thought they would spend the day together.,6241

""Easy. When they lie down and wallow in the mud."" The farmer hung up and came to the conclusion that artificial insemination must mean that he has to impregnate those pigs himself.

After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office.  


The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'.  


The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money . The elderly woman replied that she made bets.  


The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?'  


The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.'  


The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.   


The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?'  


'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.'  


'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.'   


'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently.  


That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that way, up and down, turned it around, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.  


The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square  


The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.  


The president was happy to oblige.  


The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.'  


The elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the \*lawyer was banging his head against the wall.\*  
He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock this morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland ' ",An elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with a purse full of money.,28515

No matter his opponent, he could always parry their blows and was always able to score a hit. Of course, each of his opponents would look greatly unnerved after every match, walking out in anger at their utter loss.

On one occasion, there was an opponent who left not with a frown, but with a smile on his face. In an interview, the journalist asked him, “You lost against him without scoring even a single point! How were you able to maintain composure after your defeat?” He replied, “Well it’s rather simple. Anything original I could come up with, he just counters too easily, even copying my move! Any time I’d try to yell an insult to throw him off, he’d just return the same one, but better! I smile because now I have learned how to win like he can, and I’ll never lose to anyone else! After all, all he does is riposte and if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em!”

We have never had a child before so the parenting thing was new to us. The doctor came in and asked, “what will you name her?” I had a good idea, when suddenly my wife said “Love. Her name is Love.”  I wasn’t so sure what to think of that, but I decided to go along with it. Love was a very sweet child and was excelling in school. We were so proud of her. My wife had to stay home and watch Love, because I worked as a full time police officer. Then one day, our child came back home from school and seemed visibly upset. I locked eyes with my wife as we both knew something was obviously wrong. This continued for days, weeks, months.

                Whenever we tried to talk with Love, she never would cooperate. It seemed like she was being bullied badly. I couldn’t find out though, saying as she wouldn’t talk to my wife or I. A week later, it got worse. She screamed that she hated us and that she was being bullied because of her stupid name she had. I felt so bad, I didn’t know what to do. Then, she grabbed my gun and chased me with it. I couldn’t stop it, and finally she chased me into the garage. I tried to stop her, but it was too late. She fired 3 bullets into my chest. My wife came running in, screaming “WHAT HAPPENED??” And in pain, I looked up to her, and said:

I have chosen to create a new Jesus for this earth, and you shall be the new Mother Mary, the vessel for the savior of the world.""

The nun nodded her head and then said ""My Father I know you are so powerful and mighty, surely you can start a new Christ from only having anal sex with me""

The guy agrees to this and they then proceed to have a vigorous session of hardcore anal sex.

After they finished the guy throws off the blanket and yells ""Ha, I'm not God! I was the guy on the bus!""

post,ardq1o,2qh72,jokes,false,1550355221,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ardq1o/the_story_of_mike_doe/,self.jokes,,"Hey, my name’s Mike Doe, and this is my story. I had a friend in college, my freshman roommate, who was always talking about his family. His name was Robert Gooding, and he must’ve had a family tree that started from Adam and Eve. Every single day he would drone on and on about some cousin or uncle or some such. He would always burst into the room saying things like, “Hey Mike! 

You’ll never guess Uncle Nate and Aunt Ridley are doing in Taiwan for the orphans this week!” I remember him talking about how Dimitri, his mother’s grandfather’s nephew’s son, which is apparently what second cousin once removed means, had resolved a tense hostage situation in Iran. And how cool Auntie Pauline (actually a distant cousin) was for working on top secret stuff with the CIA. I always tried to be patient with him and at least pretended to listen and nod at his stories. They never seemed to be about the same people. Sometimes he’d mention something that was actually funny or interesting too so it wasn’t always bad.

Good old rambling Robert. He picked up that nickname within a couple weeks of starting school--I don’t think he liked it much. He didn’t make many friends because he could never stop talking about his own family. Sometimes I think that I was the only one he could talk to who wouldn’t start running after five minutes. I’m not going to lie though. Back then I endeavored to be out of the room most of the day to avoid his ramblings. However no matter how late I came back, he was always up and ready to tell me something new about his family’s latest adventures.

There was this one time that was different though. On a day close to the end of our first semester together, he suddenly stopped his rambling and stared at me with a really serious expression. The abrupt lack of background noise startled me from the article I was reading while humoring him, and when I saw his face I thought he must have been angry with me for ignoring him. “You know Michael,” he started as I prepared my apology, “I really appreciate that you listen to my stories every day. I know it must be boring and annoying for you, but you listen anyway and I appreciate that. 

So I want to promise you something. Us Goodings, we don’t forget stuff like this. We take care of our friends. Just you wait, one day me and the whole family will find a way to thank you.” I shuddered at the thought of having to attend a graduation party with his entire family and hear about all their adventures first hand, but at that moment I realized that Robert was actually a pretty good guy.
Our year together came to an end, and the next year I was assigned a different roommate. Rambling Robert still sent me emails to keep me up to date with all his family happenings for a while, but even those stopped when he decided to transfer out to some college in Washington. I completed my degree in criminal psychology and went on to work as a detective for the DEA for a while. I had a great time there busting drug dealers and cleaning up the streets of my hometown, and my mom was so proud to have a real Officer Doe in the family. I was about 45 years old when they promoted me and had me relocated near the Mexican border to work on the drug traffic coming from the cartels. It was there that I finally met one of Robert’s infamous family members, Randall Gooding. He was my new supervisor, and when I showed up on the first day he greeted me like an old friend. He told me that he recognized my name and background from the stories Robert had told him, and he personally requested that I be sent down. I was surprised that Robert even talked about me, we had only known each other for a year, but it was nice to reminisce about the Goodings again. Randall was just as talkative as Robert was, and we hit it off almost immediately. It felt like I was in college again. His nickname around the office was Rambling Randy, which had me chuckling for at least a day. Robert, it turns out, was doing just fine. He was a doctor now somewhere in Texas, and I was happy that my old friend was able to make such a good life for himself.

Work was good for a few years until the cartel activity started to pick up dramatically. Nobody was sure why but we were suddenly inundated with arrests and busts and all kinds of paper work. Even Randy wasn’t as talkative around this time. It was all supposed to come to a head today. Today we were going to do a massive takedown on a processing plant operating just inside the border. 

Our undercover agent had uncovered it while posing for a different case so Randy and I took the lead while the rest of the office continued monitoring the other operation. We enlisted the FBI and local SWAT teams for help and I thought everything was going to go smoothly until I got kidnapped right out of the parking lot on my way out of the office last night.

From the time they ripped the rucksack bag off of my head till the first rays of daylight, they questioned me. They were careful. All of them had clown masks on, the hard plastic kind that never quite fit the face right. All of them were wearing gloves and carrying weapons--some had guns, some had various wicked modifications of baseball bats and crowbars. The night was rough. They wanted to know how we found out about them, who we were working with, when the operation was going to go down, and a whole host of other questions. I was patient and waited. I gave them no information and suffered a few broken ribs and some teeth for it. 

While they were questioning me, I took in my surroundings. I knew from the floor plans I had studied for the bust that I was in the processing plant, specifically in one of the raised offices at the end of the building. I could see the entire plant from the large window on the wall in front of me. I guessed that they did not know about our plans yet, so I contented myself to sit tight and wait for the bust to happen at 10AM.

However, it was around 6AM when I heard the sirens blaring in the distance. Maybe they stepped up the schedule when they found out I was kidnapped, I thought. My captors were awake in an instant and took up the preplanned positions we had predicted. 

One of the guys carrying what looked like an M16 came cursing into the office where I was being held. After cracking me in the face with the butt of the gun, I felt more than heard him raise the muzzle level with the back of my head. Soon I heard an unfamiliar voice yell over a megaphone giving the normal spiel about being surrounded and to give up. Of course they refused to give up and began to use me as a bargaining chip. Randy’s voice came over the megaphone just before the first officer continued the negotiation, “Mikey! Just wait Mikey! Hang tight and don’t do anything stupid.”

The standoff lasted for hours. If it weren’t for the gun pressed on the nape of my neck, I would have probably passed out from boredom. Eventually things got real quiet. My guard started getting antsy and walked out--probably to check for new orders with his superiors. As soon as he left the room, a hundred glass windows shattered breaking the silence and raining shards of glass down on the main factory floor. White smoke obscured the first floor as tear gas flooded the facility. Shouting and gunfire followed as my captors opened fire. Amid the confusion and smoke I couldn’t tell who was winning. I did hear Randy’s voice at one point yelling orders like, “Dimitri, take the stairs and give Pauline some cover.” None of the officers who were supposed to be with us today were named Dimitri or Pauline. The din began to wither after only a few minutes and unseen officers began yelling, “Clear!” As the smoke dissipated, I expected to see the body armor and face masks of the SWAT teams who were supposed to be part of today’s operation. Instead I saw lots of men and a few women I had never seen before in various uniforms. Some were in army uniforms others were in suits, and there were even a few in civilian clothes. God, did they call the Army and CIA in on this? When Randy saw me, he came running up with one of the suited men who was carrying a bag.

“Mike! Thank God you’re still alive. I’m sorry we made you wait so long, but we had to wait for all the flights to make it before we could move.”

“What? What flights? Randy, what are you talking about?”

“We found out you were kidnapped at about midnight. The team that we were going to use wasn’t trained for hostage situations so I had to improvise. I made some calls around and got as many as I could to come down here. Good thing Nate here happened to have hostage experience. Nobody asked any questions after I brought your name up, we all know you thanks to Robert here.” He motioned at the suited man who was leaning in to assess me.

I frowned at the man and suddenly realized that his bag contained medical supplies. “Robert?” I choked the question out in disbelief. 

He just gave me a small smile while he continued his work. “You mean to tell me that all of these guys… They’re all your family?”

Robert looked up from where he was examining my jaw with a wry smile, “I told you we don’t forget Mike. All the Goodings come to Doe’s who wait. ”",The Story of Mike Doe,85

He orders all the other food she wants for the menu, but unfortunately he forgets the escargot, and by the time he realizes it's too late. He figures it's no big deal and doesn't bring it up until the day of the party. His wife is furious and kicks him out of the house with a bucket and a trowel, telling him not to come back until the bucket is full of snails.

So there he is walking down the beach collecting snails. He's actually gotten the bucket mostly full when he notices a beautiful woman sunbathing in the nude - next he notices the house she's in front of and realizes he's stumbled onto personal property. Though he's awestruck and also a little worried she'll call the police on him for trespassing, he works up the courage to introduce himself. They hit it off, she invites him in for drinks, and before he knows it he wakes up in the middle of the night in bed with her. Suddenly remembering why he was there in the first place, he runs out the door and grabs the snail bucket waiting outside, figuring he'll try to get home before his wife wakes up and try to come up with an excuse on the way. 

A while later, the house is finally in sight. He gets to the door and quietly opens it. He tiptoes up the stairs to where the bedroom is. He makes it to the very top stair when suddenly he hears the bathroom door open. Startled, he drops the bucket; it rolls down the stairs, leaving a trail of snails all the way down. He looks up and there's his wife in her nightgown glaring at him. Thinking fast, he turns to the snails and calls out....

&amp;#x200B;

Clara blushed and accepted, taking his hand and walking to the buffet. As they ate, the man explained his name was Jerome, and he thought they should date each other. Clara accepted. 

&amp;#x200B;

When the cruise arrived back at port, Clara and Jerome parted ways, but took each others adresses and numbers. Over the next year, they went out together, talked frequently, and bought a house. They got married, moved houses again and lost their virginity. Soon, their baby came along, and they named him Micheal.

&amp;#x200B;

Micheal was a creative child, and he loved drawing. He would draw on books, walls, everything. But above all, he LOVED going to museums. There, he got his inspirations for his own pieces. His room was filled with sketchbooks, pencils and drawings stuck to the wall. The three were a happy family.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, when Micheal was 14, his report card came back. When Jerome and Clara read it, they were devastated. Their child used to get straight As, but now he dropped to Cs and Ds. Jerome sat Micheal down to talk about the card.

&amp;#x200B;

""What happened? Your card has dropped so low, we expect better!""

&amp;#x200B;

""I don't care about grades anymore! I want to follow my dreams!""

&amp;#x200B;

At this point Jerome was pissed. He got up and started screaming. Clara was sitting on the sofa, watching everything unfold.

&amp;#x200B;

""WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU 'DON'T CARE'??!?! I DIDN'T RAISE A QUITTER!!""

&amp;#x200B;

Clara watched and sipped on her smoothie.

&amp;#x200B;

""I EXPECTED BETTER! AND HOW DID YOU GO FROM AN A TO A D!?!?""

Clara perked up at this part. She cleared her throat, stopping Jerome. She smiled.

The first thing he removed was his socks and shoes. She noted his feet were withered and crooked. When asked, he responded that when he was six, he contracted toe-lio.

She looked at him confused. “You mean polio?”

He shook his head and replied, “No…toe-lio.”

He then took off his pants. His knees were knobby and gnarled. She asked him what was up with that.

He told her, “When I was eight, I got the kneesles.”

“You mean measles?”

“No…kneesles.”

Then he removed his underwear. She sighed…

“Let me guess. When you were ten, you got small cocks?”

Sure enough, at the end of the morning service, the rabbi snuck out of the synagogue and headed straight for the golf course. Looking down upon the scene were Moses and God.  Moses said, ""Look how terrible -- a Jew on Yom Kippur. And even worse! A rabbi!""

God replied ""Watch. I'm going to teach him a lesson."" 

The rabbi stepped up to the first tee. When he hit the ball, it careened off a tree, struck a rock, skipped across a pond and landed in the hole for a hole in one! 

Seeing all this, Moses protested. ""God, is this how you're going to teach him a lesson? He got a hole in one!""

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'","Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy.

They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, ""Greetings, Earthling.  
We come in peace. Take us to your leader.""

The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.

The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.

The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you.'

The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response.  


Pissed at  the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, ""Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace.    
Take us to your leader or I will fire!""

The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  
'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad.'

'Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien.  
He aimed his weapon  and opened fire.  
There was a huge explosion.  
A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.

Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.

'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien.  
'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?'

The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his pen!s over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.' ",Two Aliens,1163

It's a little rabbit with a mallet getting ready to hit some mochi. The man recognises this as the rabbit in the moon from the story and decides he really likes it. He goes inside and asks the sales clerk about the price.

Upon hearing the price, the guy balks. He really likes this figurine though and attempts to barter. The sales clerk refuses to barter but informs the man that his store will have sales all this week, starting tomorrow. The man informs the sales clerk he will return the next day. Hearing this, the clerk recites an old adage about delaying his decision. The guy rolls his eyes and dismisses it.

The guy returns the next day, as he said he would. The figurine is now on a shelf infront of the register with a 10% off sign below it. At 10% off, this is still too much for the guy. He again attempts to barter with the sales clerk, with no luck. Again the sales clerk informs him that he wont barter, that there is a better sale tomorrow, and recites the old adage. Again, the guy dismisses it, saying he will return tomorrow.

Four days this scene repeats and on the fifth day, the figurine is 50% off. At this point, it isn't about the figurine but the principle of the matter. The guy is very tempted to purchase the figurine, but knows the sale will last another 3 days and might get a better deal tomorrow. He tries to convince the sales clerk to give him tomorrow's sale price today. The sales clerk again tells him he's not changing the price. The guy storms out of the store in a huff, but not before the salesclerk recites the old adage.

The next day, the guy returns. He walks straight up to the counter to see what today's sale price is. To his surprise, the spot his figurine was in now contains a small gong with a rubber mallet. He searches the store for the figurine he wants but can't find it. Finally he confronts the sales clerk, demanding to know where the rabbit figurine went.

A secret agent was sent to Ireland to pick up sensitive information from an agent called Murphy. His instructions were to walk around town using a code phrase until he met his fellow agent. He found himself on a desolate country road and finally ran into a farmer.

“Hello,” said the agent, “I’m looking for a man called Murphy.”

“Well you’re in luck,” said the farmer. “As it happens, there’s a village right over the hill where a butcher is called Murphy, the baker is named Murphy, and three widows are called Murphy. In fact, my name is Murphy.”

“Aha,” thought the agent, “here’s my man.” So he whispered the secret code: “The sun is shining … the grass is growing … the cows are ready for milking.”

There once were twin boys, age six, that had developed extreme personalities. One was a pessimist and the other a total optimist. Concerned, their parents took them to a psychiatrist.

First, the psychiatrist treated the pessimist. Trying to brighten his outlook, the psychiatrist took him to a room filled with toys. But instead of yelping with delight, the little boy burst into tears. “What’s the matter?” the psychiatrist asked. “Don’t you want to play with any of the toys?”

“Yes,” the little boy bawled, “but if I did I’d only break them.”

Next, the psychiatrist treated the optimist. Trying to dampen his out look, the psychiatrist took him to a room piled to the ceiling with horse manure. But instead of wrinkling his nose in disgust, the optimist climbed to the top of the pile, and began gleefully digging out scoop after scoop with his bare hands.

“What are you doing?” the baffled psychiatrist asked.

The little boy replied, “With all this manure, there must be a pony in here somewhere!”",A pessimist and an optimist,10

She's reluctant because years of top level tennis gave her leg muscles which have since diminished, leaving her legs less attractive than they once were. She agrees, but on the condition that they use a leg model. She requests five candidates who have legs most similar to hers in her prime, and she will pick the best one.

Each leggy model is brought before her and for each one she has a criticism:

Model 1: Her legs are too short.

Model 2: Her legs are too long.

Model 3: Her legs are too fat.

Model 4: Her legs are too thin.

Model 5: Her legs are too... perfect. None will do.

At this point her agent loses his temper ""oh come on, this is ridiculous. Why even ask to see five leg models only to reject them for the slightest imperfection?""

She replies ""I'll be honest with you, I was never really looking for five pairs of legs. I'm just Anna ten shin seeker.""",Anna Kournikova is approached by her agent with one last career option.,5

When night came, the wife put on her sluttiest dress and dolled herself up before heading out to the streets. Not long afterwards, a car rolled up and the driver wound down his window. He leaned towards her and asked, “Hey sexy, how much?”  


The wife excused herself and went to ask her husband, who was just around the corner. She came back and said, “$300.”  


The customer replied, “That's too much! All I have is $100. How about a handjob?”  


The wife excused herself again and quickly went to consult her husband. She came back and said, “$100.”  


The customer answered, “Done. Hop on.”  


The wife nervously got into his car. The customer proceeded to unzip his pants and pull out his ""merchandise"" which was already hard and erect. Her eyes grew wide. She looked up at him and said, ""I'll be right back.""

post,aqtw0r,2qh72,jokes,false,1550213303,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/aqtw0r/the_greatest_joke_of_all_time/,self.jokes,,"A young man named Billy Balderson runs a company called Balderson Boulders LTD. Billy is only 29 years old and started his company exactly 5 years ago to this day at the age of 24. Balderson Boulders LTD sells decorative boulders, which have become en vogue. Billy has made an absolute fortune, launching him into the top 500 rich list, his net worth estimated at over 145 billion dollars. Billy is considered a great boss, he runs a great business and treats his staff well with good pay, bonuses and holidays. In fact, Billy is such a great boss, that people in the field go crazy just to get a job with Balderson Boulders! It's incredibly high demand, and for some strange reason, Billy will only hire staff that perform well in talent shows! Everyone knows this by now so they try hard to impress with gymnastics, animals, jokes you name it!

News has come out that Billy is looking for a new VP of sales for the company since only recently did the previous VP retire. The job includes a $320,000  salary, car, car parking space and a 17.5% bonus! In the two weeks that were advertised, over 300 applications were received with 5 chosen for the talent show. 

The day has come for the talent show to begin. the five applicant are ready and waiting in separate rooms. Applicant 1 is named Jefferson Ford, located in the red room to the right wing of the company building. Applicant 2 is named Greg Frank, located in the blue room to the right wing of the company building. Applicant 3 is named Cromulus Migfinian, located in the yellow room to the left wing of the company building. Applicant 4 is named Shoeman Shoefan, located in the green room to the upper left wing of the company building and Applicant 5 is located in the black room of the left lower wing of the building.

Each applicant has 10 minutes to present their talent, and the winner will be chosen by Billy, who will choose based off of his favourite performance. The whole company is invited to watch the talent show in the audtitorium, with over 700 staff in attendance.  The applicants are selected at random by the sorting computer, which also includes an applause-o-metre to determine who gets the loudest cheer at the end.

Applicant 3, Cromulus Migfinian is picked first. The stage is set, music starts to play and applicant 3 comes out in a tight purple leather suit and sings an incredible rendition of Princes ‘Red Corvette’, one of Billys favourite songs. He nails the highs, he nails the lows and it’s almost flawless. The crowd love it, and the applause-o-metre grades Cromulus at 3,287 clapperoos (the grading point for clapping sound) out of 4000, a great score!

Applicant 1, Jefferson Ford is next. The stage is set and Ford comes out with a tiny motorbike. A giant cage rolls into the centre of the stage, with a dozen bears on more tiny motorbikes, who start riding around. Ford rides up a prepared ramp and backflips into the cage, and starts flying around with all of these bears and motorbikes and it’s incredible! In the 10 minutes allowed, Ford doesn’t fall once! Billy thinks this is incredible, with the applause-o-metre grading Ford at 3,699 claperoos out of 4000. Almost perfect!

Applicant 5, Shoeman Shoefan comes out next. The room slowly darkens and a tiny box is brought out onto the stage measuring only 30cm x 30xm x 30cm. Shoeman walks out, in a leotard with a strange mask on in the shape of a moth. A strange music starts to play, echoing across the room. Shoeman starts to slowly twist her body as she climbs into the box. A person of this stature should not fit into such a tiny tiny box like this but Shoeman manages to squeeze into it and close the lid. It is an incredible display of bodily awareness and everyone, Billy included is in complete awe. The applause-o-metre grades Shoeman at 3,100 claperoos exactly, out of 4000. A very impressive score.

Applicant 2 was next but unfortunately fell ill last minute and was unable to attend. They’re out, and that leaves Applicant 4 remaining. Applicant 4 comes out, head held high. A microphone is placed on stage and the applicant walks up to it, clears his throat and says the following: “Two peanuts walk into a bar, and one was a salted”.

Crickets…nobody laughs, a few small claps are heard with a register of only 12 claperoos on the applause-o-metre, and then the room falls silent. Billy stands up and clears his throat, everyone in the room leans forward in anticipation to hear what the big boss has to say. Billy yells out in his booming voice “YOU WIN SIR FOR THAT WAS THE GREATEST JOKE OF ALL TIME!”",The Greatest Joke of All Time,0
