Pocket-protected scientists built a wall made of iron and crashed a diamond car into it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed. They then built a wall out of diamond and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an hour into the wall, and the wall came out fine. They then crashed a diamond car made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. They crashed 400 miles per hour into a diamond travelling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours. They rammed a wall made of metal into 400 miles an hour made of diamond, and the resulting explosion shifted earths orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Washington suburb that was hurtling towards mid-western Prussia at 400 billion miles an hour. They shot a diamond made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused over 10000 wayward planes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with over 10000 buildings in downtown New York. They spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive. Finally, they placed 400 diamonds per hour in front of a car made of wall travelling at miles per iron, and the result proved with out a doubt that diamonds were the hardest metal of all time, if not just the hardest metal known to man.

post,93tpwy,2qh72,jokes,false,1533162563,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/93tpwy/the_magicians_publicity_stunt/,self.jokes,,"I asked a magician for an \[OC\] joke to post on reddit.  (Yes, I asked a magician and not a comedian, I don't know many comedians personally, sorry.)

.

Instead, I got a long winded story of his most popular magic trick.  He probably made it all up, but here it is.

.

It was another regular show, and already heading towards the closing acts.  It was the trick of pulling birds endlessly out of nowhere, commonly used with doves or small birds.  He, the magician, would use crows instead.  After more than two dozen crows pulled out of his hat, shirt, sleeves, shoes and other ridiculous places, even the magician lost track how many crows there were.

.

This paragraph will be a little graphic.  Poor crow. . . Unfortunately, eventually even magic didn't work.  One of the crows he magically stuffed somewhere came out completely bloody, with broken bones (that stuck out at odd angles).  The blood seemed to be fresh, probably injured when the magician pulled it out of his sock (somehow).

.

I'm not very familiar about animal cruelty laws, but the auditorium hosting the magicians show promptly sued him for bad publicity.  As it were, the messed up magic trick gained a lot of media attention, and not good attention either.

.

During the civil court trial, the magician promptly pulled out another poor crow that was more blood and feathers than crow, placing it on the podium, and magically healed it in plain sight of the judge and jury.  The jury, entertained by the trick, ruled in favor of him.

.

The magician got caught red-handed with a bloody murder, and was ruled innocent of all charges.

(If you don't get the joke, I suggest you search ""crow murder"" with Google, Safari, or some sort of dictionary.)

The man walks miles and miles, maintaining his needs by eating the flesh of dead animals and drinking from the oasis' scattered across the lands. However the one basic need he is unable to satisfy is the need for sex. After several days the man can't take it anymore, and decides that he will make love to his camel in order to sate his needs, alas as he goes to mount the camel from behind it realises what is happening and refuses to stay still, throwing the man around to prevent him from having sex with it. After almost an hour the man gives up and continues walking, conceding that he will have to go without sex. 

A week passes, and the man decides to try once more. He drops his pants and sneaks up behind the camel, hoping to catch it off guard. At the last minute however the camel hears the man and yet again throws the man off, refusing to let him indulge. 

Another week passes, and another, all the while the man keeps trying to have sex with his camel, who everytime refuses to sit still to allow him. He starts contemplating giving up his journey to make it out the desert, unwilling to keep going on without sex, but at that moment he sees two beautiful women standing by a broken down car. The man rushes to the car, relieved to finally come across another person, and asks if he can help. 

The two women are both extremely attractive, wearing low cut tops and jean shorts that don't leave much up to the imagination. One of them puts her hand on the man's chest and says ""excuse me sir but our car isn't working, if you're able to fix it for us, we would do anything."" The second woman, lowering her sunglasses, repeats the word ""anything"" in a very seductive manner, licking her lips. The man sees his opportunity to finally fulfill the desire he has had for weeks, and coincidentally has 20 years experience of being a car mechanic. He gets to work and within an hour is able to identify and fix the problem, much to the delight of both him and the two ladies.

Both the ladies then approach the man to thank him, the main trembling with anticipation, waiting for what's to come. They plave their hands on his waist and slowly move them down, reiterating that they will be happy to repay him any way he wishes. The man thanks the stars for giving him this opportunity, and he rejoices that he will be able to finally have sex after all this time. Unable to wait another minute the man seizes the chance while he can, and he asks the ladies...

over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out, and you can give

him the $50 to use toward food and a new house.”

Rumour has it though, it can be a real bitch to start in the morning! Some have reported that on cold winter mornings, when you really need it, you can't get it to turn over.

New models are initially fun to own, but very costly to maintain, and horribly expensive to get rid of.

Manufacturers are baffled as to how the size of the boot increases, but say that the paint may just make it LOOK bigger.

This model is not expected to reach collector status. Most owners find it is best to lease one, and replace when it becomes troublesome.",The perfect small car,22

2. In the back there’s a pitbull, Pete, who has a rotten canine. You have to go out the back and retrieve it without injury. 

3. Upstairs we have an immobile, former prostitute, Hefty Helen, who’s 300 pounds. Poor thing has never had an orgasm, and you have to sort her out. 

“Insanity! I’m not interested in any of those.”, says the man. And sits down to his beer disappointed. 

Some hours (and many beverages) later, the man is fuck eye drunk! A heavy drinker, was he. 

He exclaims: “Here’s $50 for the bar challenge, I’ll be going home a richer man!”

The barmaid slides him a pint of pepper tequila. He downs it like overpriced water and remains straight faced. 

The man, barely able to walk and slurring his speech, cries out: “Challenge number 2! A man the likes of me should have no issues here!” He heads out the back as the crowd looks on in anticipation. 

Soon after, there’s a blood curdling commotion followed by silence. 

The man emerges without injury! A smile from ear to ear and seeming very satisfied. 

He says to the barmaid in a booming voice:

“2 down, one to go! Now where’s this fat old hooker with the rotten tooth!”",The Bar Challenge,51

So, he went to see the medicine man in their camp. As you might imagine, the medicine man was elated to take care of the highest chief in the tribe, and welcomed him in.

“BigChief, no fart.” came the deep-voiced petition, from the straight face of the tribal elder, with arms held tight to his chest.

Thinking quickly, the medicine man grabbed a nearby bottle and said, “Here- BigChief take 2 , come back in morning if no work.”

The next morning the chief returned to the tent of the medicine man. With a weathered scowl, he said, “Big Chief NO fart.” As you might imagine, the medicine man was very concerned because he had ever seen a case of gas not sold by the high-powered pills he had given the Chief. He grabbed the same bottle, pulled it down and said “Big Chief, take 4, me sure this work for BigChief.

Sadly, the next morning found the Chief once again visiting the medicine man. Visibly angered, the Chief raised his voice for emphasis. “BigChief NO FART!” Feeling quite embarrassed the medicine quickly grabbed his bottle of extra-powerful gas pills  from the top shelf. “Big Chief- Me SO sorry! Not sure why not work. Here is extra-strength pill, BigChief take 10, come back in morning if not work.”

The next morning, the medicine man anxiously awaited the sunrise to see if it would bring the Chief back to his tent.  After an hour after the sun had come up, filling quite satisfied with himself, the medicine man resumed his morning routine when the flap of his tent flew open and the Chief’s wife crashed into the tent, crying uncontrollably.

“What matter?!?” said the medicine man. BigChief’s wife was unable to answer due to her hysterics.

“What matter?!?! BigChief fart? Him fart now?!?” The medicine man desperately inquired.

After a few minutes, the BigChief’s wife was able to regain her composure. She looked at the medicine man with white-hot anger in her eyes and said

Psychological factors are responsible for about 10%-20% of all cases of erectile dysfunction, or ED. It is often a secondary reaction to an underlying physical cause. In some cases, the psychological effects of ED may stem from childhood abuse or sexual trauma. However, the most common psychological causes of ED include:

**Stress :**

 Stress can be job-related, money-related, or the result of marital problems, among other factors.


**Anxiety :**

 Once a man experiences ED, he may become overly worried that the problem will happen again. This can lead to ""performance anxiety,"" or a fear of sexual failure, and consistently lead to ED.


**Guilt:**

 A man may feel guilty that he is not satisfying his partner.


**Depression :**

 A common cause of ED, depression affects a person physically and psychologically. Depression can cause ED even when a man is completely comfortable in sexual situations. Drugs used to treat depression may also cause ED.


**Low self-esteem:**

 This can be due to prior episodes of ED (thus a feeling of inadequacy) or can be the result of other issues unrelated to sexual performance.


**Indifference:**

 This may come as a result of age and a subsequent loss of interest in sex, be the result of medications or stemming from problems in a couple's relationship.


All men at one time or another will experience ED. Only if the problem becomes persistent -- occurs more than half the time -- or becomes a source of distress for you or your partner should you be concerned and consider seeking medical advice and treatment. For men whose erectile dysfunction is caused by psychological problems, therapy may be needed.

The first nun suddenly reaches out and pulls on his manhood.

Startled, he drops a bar of soap.

""Oh look"" says the first nun, ""it's a soap dispenser"".

To test her theory the second nun also pulls on his manhood. Sure enough, he drops the second bar of soap.

Now the third nun decides to have a go. She pulls once, then twice, and three times but nothing happens.

So she gives several more tugs, then yells:

""Holy Mary, Mother of God! LIQUID SOAP TOO!""",Two priests are in a shower.,59

Somewhat reluctantly, the man agrees. He goes to hell and is pleasantly surprised.

He receives the keys to a Lamborghini, and all his friends are there, playing golf and drinking  champagne. At night, he meets the Devil at a party, and immediately becomes good friends.

At the end of the day, he returns to heaven for a trial day. He has fun playing gold harps and sitting on clouds, and feels that he has a tough choice to make.

""Look, Jesus, I had my reservations about Hell, but I think I'm going to spent the rest of eternity there.""

Jesus smiles, and lets him into hell. Upon arrival, the politician is startled. His friends are picking up litter and standing on hot coals. The devil laughs while watching them work.

The politician asks Jesus ""This isn't how it was! It was beautiful and fun out here!""

Jesus responds ""Those were during the elections. Now you've been elected""

He was trained quite well off the lead and although he didn't like to stay within eyesight he would always come to a whistle.

I walk the dog as an excuse to smoke... staying out of the house, and away from my parents, so I tend to get quite carried away while I'm stumbling along through fields and such.

We live somewhat near a beach so I often walk there so the dog can have a swim and dig holes or whatever, and it's funny to watch him play while I'm high.

There I was, siting on a dune in the midday sun listening to music in my flip-flops and shorts when ol' Mary gets the better of me. I drift off to sleep for what feels like 10 minutes.

I awake to the harsh sound of waves crashing at my feet. The sun had almost set and the beach was empty.. my dog nowhere to be seen.

I walk back to the track all the while whistling and calling his name but to no avail. I decide to explore behind the dunes.

After about 45 minutes of aimlessly wandering I think I see some tracks. I start following in a light jog (despite walking a lot I don't have great cardio or endurance). I stop for a breath and think I hear a dog yelping, quickly I sprint to the origin of the sound.

I come across a large lake of quicksand and there, struggling in the middle is... my dog.

Without thinking I dive in. I could not face telling my family I let the dog run off and drown because I was getting high. I manage to swim/wade over to him, clip on his lead and lift him out of the sand and towards solid ground.

As he manages to escape the quicksand I realise that by lifting him out I had pushed myself further in.. my legs were stuck. I fight off sinking further for 15 minutes all the while kicking my legs in order to free them. 

Eventually one comes out, followed closely by the other. I pull myself onto my stomach for maximum surface area and scramble to solid ground.

As I brushed myself off as best I could, I realised that my flip flops had been lost in my attempt to escape.

It would seem that despite rescuing my dog and later my self... in the battle against quicksand I still walked away in d'feet..",I was walking my dog the other day...,0

First Bull: ""Son, don't be foolish -- let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it.""
  
Third Bull: ""Hell, he can have all my cows. I'm just making sure he knows I'm a bull.""",Three bulls heard the rancher was bringing another bull onto the ranch.,6639

post,93d0uo,2qh72,jokes,false,1533029889,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/93d0uo/the_search_for_a_cure/,self.jokes,,"I was a fabulously wealthy man, with enough money to live an extravagant and lavish life many times over. I had many close friends, a beautiful wife and two wonderful children who adored me, and many beautiful homes around the world that I divided my time between.

However, my whole life, I suffered with a problem.

From birth I was stricken with unstoppable diarrhoea. Like lightning, the Tijuana cha-cha would appear loudly, explosively and without warning, leaving me ashamed and hobbling quickly to the nearest public facilities, This thunder-down-under would leave me shaking at the knees with the sheer force of the flow, an unexpected mudslide in an otherwise perfect day. 

As a baby it was less of a problem, as that’s all babies are really expected to do, after all. But as I grew older and continued to fire liquid shit out of my rear end, I became more and more shy, and embarrassed at my continuous production of poop smoothies. I met a beautiful girl, who became my beautiful wife, not caring that I was so afflicted. My friends too, took no notice of my ass vomit, looking past it and seeing the man inside, rather than just what was inside the man. But despite the support of those close to me, I could never feel truly normal, always a step apart from other people, and usually a step closer to the bathroom at that. 

I spent many thousands of dollars jetting round the globe, consulting the leading doctors and scientists of the age to get to the bottom of the problem with my bottom, but with no success. I met with Yogis in India, proctologists in Switzerland, and diagnosticians in America. I paid a leading biologist a million dollars to abandon a project he was working on and see if he could find a way to stall my stool, with no luck. I was seen by immunologists, bacteriologists and even homeopathic healers, none of whom could find an answer to my problem. I went to Peru, Australia, Mozambique, Guatemala and even the Sahara desert, chasing leads and desperately trying to find a way to rid myself of my southern slip ’n’ slide. I became more and more obsessed with curing myself, slowly driving away my family and friends, and offering greater and greater rewards for a cure, a ceasefire, even a temporary halt to the pyroclastic movement of my bowel movements.

After many years of searching, and finding no answers, I finally gave up hope in a small village in Tibet, where I had met with the local wise-man, to no avail. I fell to my knees, my whole body heaving with wracking sobs, clawing at the dusty ground with my unkempt nails.

‘You okay, friend?’, came a voice from above me, in a strong Texan accent. I raised my tear-streaked face, and saw a older white man standing in front of me, his hands in the pockets of his beaten denim jacket. He had a long grey beard, and a shock of wild grey hair, framing kind eyes and a sympathetic smile. He picked me up off the ground, dusted me down, and led me over to a nearby wooden bench. I told him my story, of my fabulous wealth, my wonderful life, and the unending chocolate rain that nearly driven me insane and flushed my relationships down the drain. All the while, he stroked his beard, watching me thoughtfully.

“I would give everything I possess, every bent penny, just to have it stop” I finally wailed, bursting into tears once more. He was quiet for a moment, then, taking my hand, he stood from the bench and walked down the road with me. As we walked, he shared his life story in turn. He had been a prominent and lauded scientist, born in Texas and showered with awards and prizes his entire life. After many years of being invited to countless balls and ceremonies, he grew tired of all the attention, feeling that it was getting in the way of the real science. He’d relocated to this small village in Tibet, where he’d built a state of the art laboratory to do his research without interruption or distraction. As he finished relating his story, we arrived at a large building, not quite in keeping with the of the houses that surrounded it, but still beautiful and warm from the outside. 

He invited me in, and in amazement I took in his lab, with it’s gleaming machinery and equipment, and great bookshelves stuffed with journals and scientific tomes lining every wall. He sat me down on a chair by a vast microscope, and pulling up my sleeve, took a small skin sample, and put it under the lens of the scope. He studied the sample for a long while, hmm-ing and ahhh-ing, before sitting back with a triumphant smile across his kindly face. 

Then he gave me my answer and synthesised a cure, and true to my word, I gave him everything I possessed, every bent penny, losing everything, but gaining the only thing that I felt truly mattered.

“Aha”, he said, “ just as I thought. I’m surprised none of those great doctors you consulted before thought of this.”

They ended up in a giant stone cavern with an iron bared cage sitting in the middle. In the cage sat an enormous purple gorilla. The old woman turned to the man and said “no matter what happens... do not touch the purple gorilla!” Then without another word she led him back up the tunnel and out of the trapdoor and all the way to the couch. She gave him a blanket and he fell asleep. The man had a dream where he and the purple gorilla were best friends and where they skipped through fields of wild flowers and where they shared an ice cream sundae. All he had to do was poke the purple gorilla. Then he awoke with a start! He thought about the dream in the dark the went to the carpet. Lifting the carpet up he lifted the trap door, lit the torch and went down the tunnel. Left left right right down right left straight U-turn down right right left right up backwards down... he arrived in the chamber with the sleeping purple gorilla in the cage. He reached out a single finger inches from the gorilla then... stopped. He remembered what the woman said and how kind she was to let him stay the night. But then he thought of the dream again and tapped the purple gorilla’s matted fur. The gorilla awoke with wide eyes and a earth shaking roar!!! The man started to run twords the tunnel. The purple gorilla ripped off the bars of its cage and charged after the man! He sprinted up the tunnel with the purple gorilla hot on his heels! He jumped out of the trap door slamming it behind him! The gorilla burst through as he ran towards the door. He ran to his car and hid in the trunk. He could hear the gorilla’s large footsteps coming closer and closer... The purple gorilla ripped off the trunk door and chucked it far into the air... then the purple gorilla poked him and said “Tag! You’re it!” Then the gorilla ran off into the woods.",The Purple Gorilla.,35

A man heard that masturbating before sex often helped blokes last longer during the act. The man decided to give it a try. He spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it. He couldn't do it in his office, but that was too open. He considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe.

On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the highway. He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the truck.

Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to wank. He closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to the big finish, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants.

Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, ""What?""

He heard, ""This is the police. What's going on down there?""

The man replied, ""I'm checking out the rear axle, it's busted.""

Came the reply, ""Well, you might as well check your brakes too while you're down there because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago.""

An elderly man in Louisiana owned a large farm for several years.  
He had a large pond in the back. It was properly shaped for swimming, so he fixed it up nice with picnic tables, horseshoe  courts, and some apple and peach trees. 
One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond, to look it over, as he hadn't been there for a while. 
Before he went, he grabbed a five-gallon bucket to bring back some fruit. 
As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee. As he got closer, he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond.  
He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end.
One of the women shouted to him, ""We're not coming out until you leave!""  
The old man replied, ""I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or make you get out of the pond naked.""
Holding the bucket up, he said... ""I'm here to feed the alligator!""

The 3 kids wanted to have a pet, but their mother hated pets, so they decided to secretly get one. They were successful in their attempt and adopted a stray dog.

They loved the dog, and played with it daily. They tried their best to keep it a secret so their mother wouldn’t find it and send it away. One day, they took the dog outside and played fetch. They threw the stick on the road, and the dog went to get it, until all of a sudden...

A car came speeding by, running the dog over and killing it. They were greatly saddened by this and held a funeral for the dog, burying it into the backyard.

The mother didn’t know about the dog, nor 90, since they vowed to keep it a secret from their parents so it would not get sent away....

This must be a sign from God. God must have meant that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace the rest of our days.""

The priest replies, ""I agree with you completely. This must be a sign from God.""

The rabbi continues, ""And look at this. Here's another miracle. My car is completely demolished but this bottle of Mogen David wine didn't break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune."" Then he hands the bottle to the priest.

The priest agrees, takes a few big swigs, and hands the bottle back to the rabbi. The rabbi takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap on, and hands it back to the priest.

The priest asks, ""Aren't you having any?""

The rabbi replies, ""No...I think I'll wait for the police",A rabbi and a priest get into a car accident and it's a bad one.,678

“On my first day of work I spotted this guy who had the nicest cell in the joint. TV, silk sheets, food whenever he wanted it. I had no clue why.

I eventually found out that everyone there - the other guards, the warden, even the other prisoners - found him hilarious. They’d let the rules slip every now and then if he’d tell them a joke and make them laugh. 

At the end of my first week there, I caught the guy with some contraband - drugs or something, I can’t remember anymore. But I decided to give him a chance to make me laugh, like everyone else did.  So he takes out a box of tic-tacs, looks at it for a second and tells me a joke. Easily the funniest thing I’d ever heard; I was in tears with laughter. I let him go on his way.

At the end of my first month I caught this guy again doing something against the rules. He was  walking back to his cell after getting a visit from his comedian brother, carry packets of polo mints. So I tell him to make me laugh and I’ll let him go. He opens up one of the polo packets, looks at the mint for a second, then eats it. While he’s doing it he tells me the best joke I’ve ever heard - my sides were splitting with laughter. I let him go on his way.

At the end of my first year, however, things took a turn for the worse for this guy. His brother died and the guy just wasn’t funny anymore. He couldn’t tell a joke to save his life. Eventually he lost all his special privileges. One day he cracked and told us all why he wasn’t funny anymore. His brother had been the one writing the jokes, and smuggling them into the prison. He didn’t have any good jokes of his own.”

Suzuki raised his hand, ""Lee Iacocca, 1982.""

Furious, another student yelled, ""Oh yeah? Suck this!""

Suzuki jumped up waving his hand and shouted, ""Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!""

With near mob hysteria, someone screamed, ""You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll kill you.""

Suzuki yelled, ""Gary Condit to Chandra Levy, 2001.""

I sometimes stay awake to look out for her cab coming home, but she always comes walking up the drive as I hear the sound of a car leaving around the corner as if she has gotten out and walked the rest of the way.

I once picked up her cell phone just to see what time it was. This caused her to go completely berserk. She quickly snatched the phone out of my hand and cursed me hysterically, screaming that I should never touch her personal property, then accused me of trying to spy on her.

Anyway, I have never approached the subject with my wife. I think deep down I just didn't want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her. I decided I was going to park my Harley Davidson Lowrider next to the garage and then hide behind it so I could get a good view of the street around the corner when she came home.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a Bulgarian man who drove trains,72
