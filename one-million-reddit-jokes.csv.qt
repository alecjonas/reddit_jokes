""I was born this way,"" says the parrot. ""I'm a defective parrot.
""Ha, ha,"" the guy laughs. ""It sounded like this parrot actually understood what I said and answered me!""
 ""I understood every word,"" says the parrot. ""I am a highly intelligent, thoroughly educated bird.""
 ""Yeah?"" the guy asks. ""Then answer this: how do you hang onto your perch without any feet?"" ""Well,"" the parrot says, ""this is a little embarrassing, but since you asked I'll tell you.
I wrap my little parrot penis around this wooden bar, kind of like a little hook. 
You can't see it because of my feathers."" ""Wow,"" says the guy, ""you really can understand and answer, can't you?"" 
""Of course! I speak both Spanish and English. I can converse with reasonable competence on almost any subject:

""I can't afford that,"" he says. ""Pssst,"" the parrot hisses, motioning the guy over with one wing.
 ""Nobody wants me cause I don't have any feet. You can get me for $20. 
Just make an offer!""  The guy offers 20 dollars and walks out with the parrot. 
Weeks go by. The parrot is sensational.

""What happened then?"" asks the guy. ""Then the mailman came into the house and lifted up her nightgown and began petting her all over,"" reports the parrot.
 ""My God!"" the guy cries. ""Then what?"" ""Then he got down on his knees and began to lick her body, starting with her breasts and slowly going down and down.""

After 20 or 25 seconds she says, ""Eighteen!""

Obviously everyone is a little disappointed. Then 90,000 blondes start cheering, ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""

The leader says, ""Well since we've gone to the trouble of getting 90,000 of you in one place and we have the world- wide press and global broadcast media here, gee, uh, I guess we can give her another chance.""

So he asks, ""What is 5 plus 5?""

After nearly 40 seconds she eventually says, ""Ninety?""

The leader is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh -- everyone is disheartened - the blonde starts crying and the 90,000 girls begin to yell and wave their hands shouting, ""GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE! GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE!""

The leader, unsure whether or not he is doing more harm than good, eventually says, ""Ok! Ok! Just one more chance -- What is 2 plus 2?""

The girl closes her eyes, and after a whole minute eventually says, ""Four?""

Throughout the stadium pandemonium breaks out as all 90,000 girls jump to their feet, wave their arms, stomp their feet and scream... ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""

The pope agrees, but the only Jewish man who thinks himself to be a good enough debater is the rabbi, Moishe. But since Moishe only speaks Hebrew and the Pope only Latin and Italian, they agree to a silent debate.

Everyone gathers in a courtyard, and the Pope begins by waving his hand in a circle around his head. Moishe responds by pointing straight at the ground below him. The Pope then replies by holding up three fingers, to which Moishe responds by holding up his middle finger. The Pope finally holds up the holy wine and bread for the eucharist, and Moishe holds up an apple. The Pope then steps down from his platform and admits defeat.

When asked to explain, the Pope said this: ""First I showed him that God was everywhere, and he replied by saying that God was right here with us all. Then I showed him the Holy Trinity, to show him that our religions could never exist together; he then reminded me that though we have our differences, we share the same God. I then showed him the eucharist to remind him of Christ's sacrifice, and that wise man replied by showing me the apple, to symbolize the original sin of man which is shared by us all. At that point, I had to concede.""

When posed the same question by a Jewish woman, Moishe said: ""First he said we had to go out, to anywhere else; I told him to go to hell, we're staying right here. Then he said we had three days to leave, and I told him *exactly* what I thought of *that* proposition.""

The Jewish woman then asked, ""And that bit at the end?""

And Moishe replied, ""That was just us talking about our lunches.""",A pope in the middle ages is trying to kick the Jews out of Rome...,11

Joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

Totally ruined the mood. Now, I didn't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let' just say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.

Joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

In conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?",Proposing to my girlfriend,3

A couple miles later he see the same sign again twice as big proclaiming ""Peaches of All flavors next right"". Since as he liked peaches and was hungry he eased the rig into the turning lane to find some peaches. As he pulled into the produce stand  he encountered an old man with a frumpy fruit shack and a sign proclaiming his many flavored peaches. The driver ambled up to the stand and casually asked the older gentlemen ""I bet you dont have a peach that tastes like apple"". The old man rummaged around for a few seconds and produced a slightly off looking peach proudly and handed it to the truck driver. He bit into it and sure enough it tasted like an apple, dumbfounded he asked ""well do you have one that tastes like orange?"". The old man rolled his eyes and said ""turn it around"" twirling one finger in a circular motion. Sure as rain the driver bit the other side of the peach and it tasted like an orange. Aghast at what he had found he asked the old man for something less likely ""Sir, i'd like a peach that tastes like grapes"", again the old man dug out a peach that tasted like grapes, astounded the driver asked for watermelon flavored peaches and again the old man twirled his finger, watermelon was in the other side. Slightly aggravated at this point knowing the improbability of what he was experiencing he suddenly had an idea for a flavor the old man couldn't possibly have. ""Sir, it seems you really do have peaches of all flavors, but i must ask, do you have one that tastes like pussy?!?"" The old man smiled and said "" I knew you'd ask, they allways do, and yes of course i have a pussy flavored peach"". The old man rummaged around in a particularly dusty box of peaches and again handed the driver another peach. Eager for the long forgotten taste the driver eagerly shoved the peach in his mouth and instantly began spitting and sputtering, amid his hacking he proclaimed ""THAT TASTES LIKE SHIT"". The old man cackled and twirled his finger  again ""Silly boy, turn it arounddd...........""   ",Peaches of ALL flavorz,8

current in order to make his deliveries every year.  And so, the old man
wasn't too surprised when he got a letter from the FAA informing him that
an examiner would be appearing shortly to run him through the usual
re-certification drill.

Santa immediately dispatched a detail of elves to wash and polish the
sleigh, another group was assigned to inspect, service, and repair all the
tack, and a third squad started curry-combing the reindeer.  Santa himself
got out his logbook and paperwork, making sure everything was in order.

On the appointed day, the examiner arrived. After the ritual cup of
coffee, he reviewed Santa's logbook, then after a meticulous review of
Santa's weight and balance calculations, accompanied Santa outside.  The
examiner watched as Santa conducted his pre-flight, closely looking at
everything from the bells on the back of the sleigh to Rudolph's red nose.
 When he was finished, he turned to Santa and said:  ""It looks pretty good
so far.  Let me go get one thing out of my truck, and then we'll take her
up.""

When the examiner returned, Santa was already belted into the sleigh and
ready to taxi.  As the examiner climbed into the sleigh, Santa noticed
that he was carrying a shotgun.  ""What's that for?"" Santa asked.

The examiner looked at him, then winked:  ""I'm not really supposed to tell
you this, but you're going to lose an engine on takeoff.""

One day however, a ferocious lion, 5 times the size of an ordinary lion, charged into the kingdom, and chased everyone out of the kingdom. The lion then proceeded to make itself at home within the king's castle. The king was angry, but he knew he could not take on the lion, and he could see his bravest knights were trembling at the sight of this beast. He decided he needed to motivate them, but he had no money - it was all left in his castle! But then he saw his daughter, who looked beautiful to say the least. So he got up, and announced to everyone:

""He who kills that lion my castle, is entitled to have sex with my daughter!""

The knights took one look each at the king's daughter, and almost immediately decide to charge in - but the lion made short work of them. The king starts looking more troubled than ever. Then one man, who's clearly had too much to drink, stumbles into the castle - the king looks at the man, thinking he'll instantly die. But after a few minutes, mixed screams from the lion and the drunk man were heard. They continued for a good 30 minutes before the man comes back out, bloody and beaten, but alive. The king marvels at the sight of him, and is about to thank him when the man says:

2. Play must be permitted by the owner of the hole.
3. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out.
4. For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.
5. Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid damage to the hole.
6. The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the course owner is satisfied that play is completed. Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again.
7. It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arrival at the course. The experienced player will normally take time to admire the entire course with special attention to well-formed bunkers.
8. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played, or are currently playing, to the owner of the course being played. Angry course owners have been known to damage players' equipment for this reason.
9. Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own protection.
10. Players should ensure that the match has been properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played for the first time. Previous players have been known to become irate if they discover someone else playing on what they considered to be a private course.
11. Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times. Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to be temporarily under repair. Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find alternative means of play when this is the case.
12. The course owner is responsible for manicuring and pruning any bush around the hole to allow for improved viewing of alignment with, and approach to the hole.

The lead doctor started ""Gentleman, we have some bad news.  The Pope has a very rare condition and there is only one cure,  he has to have sex otherwise he will die, there is nothing else we can do.""

The Pope thanked the doctors and asked them to leave.  He and his top advisers then debated the issue.  Eventually they all urged him to do it.  They thought that preserving his life was more important than the vow of celibacy.  

""I have some thinking to do"" said the Pope, ""Let's reconvene in an hour and I will have my decision.""

An hour passed and everyone gathered in the room again to hear what the Pontiff had decided. 

""I have decided that I will have sex with a woman, and that life is more important than the vow I have taken"" said the Pope, ""But I do have three conditions which must be met in order for me to do this act""

""Of course your holiness! What are the conditions?"" said an adviser

""First, the woman must be blind, so she cannot see who she is having sex with"" Said the Pope

""Ok, we can make that happen"" said the adviser

""Second, she must be deaf, so she cannot hear who she is having sex with""

""Um, ok, I'm sure we can find someone like that...""  The adviser replied, ""And the third thing?""

""Give me a cuban flag, please. If this is how I die, I want to say goodbye to my country.""

Since it was a foreign country, nobody had a cuban flag just lying around , and the old man's dying wish wasn't going to be granted. Lucky for him, and since it was Miami, there was a beautiful cuban woman that had a cuban flag tattoo. The only problem was where her tattoo was: her left buttcheek.

It was an akward situation but she figured if the man was dying soon, she might as well make him happy.

She offered to help, and the man told her to show him the tattoo. She did, and the man began to kiss it passionately and saying goodbye to his homeland, as well as praying in spanish.

After some time, he stops his unusual farewell and says to the woman:

""Now turn around, I want to say goodbye to Fidel.""",An old man in Miami has a heart attack.,1

Dear Dad: It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.

I have been finding real passion with Stacy and she is so nice.

But I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am. But it's not only the passion...Dad she's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy.

She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.

We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy.

In the meantime we will pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Stacy can get better. She deserves it.

Don't worry Dad. I'm 15 and I know how to take care of myself.

St. Peter is there, surprised to see him. He says, ""Fidel, you've done so many awful things in your life, how did you get here?""

Castro says, ""It was the Pope. He blessed me and told me I must have been chosen by God, so I was certainly going to heaven.""

""Chosen by God? No, that can't be right. Why would he say that?""

So Castro tells him the story:

""When Pope John Paul visited Havana in 1998, I personally welcomed him, and invited him to tour the city. We rode in the Popemobile, and since it was a warm day, he opened the roof. Everything was fine until we reached the Malecón, when suddenly a gust of wind blew up and swept the Pope’s zucchetto off his head and out into the sea. There it floated, bobbing on the waves.

“Don’t worry, Your Holiness,” I exclaimed, “I’ll get it for you!” I jumped over the side of the Popemobile, leaped over the seawall, and sped out over the water. Yes, I actually walked on top of the water, all the way out to where the zucchetto lay floating on the waves. Then I turned and dashed back, still skimming over the surface, leaped over the seawall, and jumped back into the Popemobile, without getting a drop of water on his 
clothes. “Here, Your Holiness,” I panted.

""And that's when he blessed me.""

Saint Peter is obviously having a little trouble believing this, so he calls God over and asks, ""Do you remember this?""

God says, ""I bless a lot of people. It's hard to keep track of them all."" Then he looks at Castro. ""Do you have any proof?""

""Proof?"" Castro exclaims. ""Of course I have proof! It was worldwide news!""

So God sends Peter down to Earth to go collect some newspapers from the day after, and sure enough it's on the front page of every last one.

In Granma, the Cuban Communist Party newspaper, the headline read “Fidel is Chosen by God; He Walks on Water.”

In L’Osservatore Romano, the Vatican newspaper, the headline read “God Performs a Miracle: Makes Fidel Castro Walk on Water.”

And in the Miami Herald, read by the Cuban exile community in Miami, the headline read

“Fidel Castro Doesn’t Know How to Swim.”",Fidel Castro Dies and Goes to Heaven,31

There was a little lemonade stand run by the boy Jarn that lived on the corner of the street. He was poor, but not too poor because he could afford dirt. The three friends walked up to his stand, a bit parched from the stroll they had been taking. The lemonade was mixed with a low quality tap water and week old lemons, but could still quench a thirst. So Chi opens his mouth and asks the poor boy how much for a glass. He stares back at him, squinting a tiny bit and replies,

""1 dollar.""

""1 dollar?! What a rip off,"" said Chi.

But he glanced down the road at his house, four damn driveways away. An awful walk when you're thirsty. He coughed over the dollar and drank his lemonade, and then the three started to
walk away.

After a couple steps, Cha bellows, ""wait!""

And he runs back to get a cup, but when handing his dollar over, the wind scooped it out of his hand, flinging the dollar into the construction site next to the four boys.

""that was one hell of a strong wind!"" Cha exclaimed.

""Yeah, and Chu's fart didn't help break it either"" Chi added (get it? breaking wind? I'm funny damnit).

""Well, I can't go get the dollar alone, that construction site is damn eerie"" said Cha.

So the three boys ditched the small stand and went to the construction site. Up at the very top of the concrete creation, pierced by rebar, the dollar was (great sentence, thanks).
There were steps going up about half of the height of this menacing tower, but the rest had to be carefully climbed. So the boys went past the abandoned payloaders, bulldozers, and excavators to the base and started moving up the stairs.

""Really? You're gonna keep farting Chu!?"" Chi uttered.

""If you have a cork, feel free to shove it in your mouth"" Chu snapped in retaliation.

""Well, I'm going, back down, fuck you, have fun falling"" and just like that Chi went back down the concrete tower.

The remaining two quickly reached the end, about fifty feet in the air, before they had to skillfully maneuver the remaining half. Cha really wanted that dollar, and Chu loves heights, so nether wanted to go back down at this point. So they escalated, placing one foot at a time while holding onto anything they could. It was a slow process, but when they reached the top, Cha slide across the beams to his impaled dollar and painstakingly removed it without tearing it. Just then, the wind grabbed it again, but it flew right into Chu's hand.

""Did you manage to get my dollar?!"" Cha screams.

""No, i didn't get taller!"" replied Chu.

""I said, did you get my dollar?!"" Cha responded back.

Peninsula of Michigan.
They would get together two or three times a week for coffee and to talk shop.
One day, someone made the comment that preaching to people isn't really all
that hard, a real challenge would be to preach to a bear.
One thing led to another, and they decided to do an experiment. They would all go out into the woods, find a bear, preach to it, and attempt to convert it to their religion.
Seven days later, they all came together to discuss their experiences.
Father Flannery, who had his arm in a sling, was on crutches, and had various bandages on his body and limbs, went first.
'Well,' he said, 'I went into the woods to find me a bear. And when I found
him, I began to read to him from the Catechism.
Well, that bear wanted nothing to do with me and began to slap me around. So I quickly grabbed my holy water, sprinkled him and, Holy Mary Mother of God, he became as gentle as a lamb. The Bishop is coming out next week to give him first communion and confirmation.'
Reverend Billy Bob spoke next. He was in a wheelchair, had one arm and both
legs in casts, and had an IV drip.
In his best fire-and-brimstone oratory, he exclaimed, 'WELL, brothers, you KNOW that we Baptists don't sprinkle! I went out and I FOUND me a bear. And then I began to read to my bear from God's HOLY WORD! But that bear wanted nothing to do with me.
So I took HOLD of him and we began to wrestle. We wrestled down one hill, UP
another and DOWN another until we came to a creek. So I quickly DUNKED him
and BAPTIZED his hairy soul. And just like you said, he became as gentle as
a lamb. We spent the rest of the day praising Jesus..Hallelujah!
The Priest and the Reverend both looked down at the Rabbi, who was lying in
a hospital bed. He was in a body cast and traction with IVs and monitors running in and out of him. He was in really bad shape.
The Rabbi looked up and said: ""In hindsight, circumcision was probably not the best choice as an opener.""",Three Holy Men and a Bear,41

post,5evx16,2qh72,jokes,false,1480109411,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5evx16/double_whammy/,self.jokes,,"So about a year and a half ago, I started dating a girl who loved to hear me play guitar. Her name was Alice, and probably her favorite song I played was Barracuda, and she was really into 80s music and culture. I really liked this girl and wanted to get serious, so I decided I wanted to get her something special for Christmas.

I don't own any music on vinyl, except I did have the album Bad Animals by Heart (who wrote Barracuda), so I decided to give it to her. 

Cue Christmas day, when I made time to go see her between family Christmas celebration so that I could give her the album as a present. I was so excited, but when she opened it, she looked a little underwhelmed. I guess I had amped up the present a little too much, because I could tell she didn't really like it.

That night my dad got a vinyl record player, and so he asked me if I had my heart album we could listen to it, but since we didn't have it, the only other album we could find was by one of my least favorite bands, Tears for Fears. It was an all around horrible day.

The next day, I found out that she had re-gifted it to her mom, and I was really upset. We got in a huge argument and eventually her mom felt bad enough that she gave me the album back.

We mended things and are doing all around a whole lot better than last year. This Christmas season is already going a lot better, and have decided to try and gift the album again, but this time to my cousin who is a little mentally handicapped. She is really into Heart and would absolutely love the album, and it just kinda brings back bad memories for me. Plus, since she will be at my house this Christmas we can listen to it instead of that horrible Tears for Fears album.

The only problem is that this year, Alice hinted that I should give her the album again (she has started to listen to Heart regularly and really enjoys their music now). She had been hinting but I had deflected and kinda changed the subject every time it was brought up until the other day when she told me straight up ""I would really like that album for Christmas this year. I'm sorry I gave it to my mom, that was wrong of me, but I would love to have it this year.""

I was very frustrated, and replied, ""Last Christmas I gave you my Heart, but the very next day you gave it away. This year, to save me from Tears, I'll give it to someone special.""",Double Whammy,12

He's standing in front of the Pearly Gates chatting to St Peter when, all of a sudden, he sees that behind him is a huge wall covered in are hundreds and hundreds of clocks.
And the man's intrigued.  He asks St Peter, ""Why do you have all those clocks?""

St. Peter answered: ""Ah, the clocks. We're very proud of them. What they do is very special.""
He leaned closer to the man and his eyes lit up as he spoke.
""Every human, everyone who has ever been on Earth, has one of these special clocks for them.  You see, every time you tell a lie, the hands on your clock move.""

""I see!"", said the man. He walks up to one of the clocks. ""Whose clock is that?""
""That's Mother Teresa's"" replies St. Peter. ""The hands have never moved, indicating that she never told a lie in her whole life.""

""Incredible"", says the man. ""And whose clock is that one?""
St. Peter responds, ""That clock belonged to Gandhi. If you look...the hands have moved, but only twice, telling us that he told only two lies in his entire life.""
""That's amazing!"" says the man.

There's a pause.

Then the man asks, ""Where's Tony Blair's clock?""

St Peter replies: ""We're using it as a ceiling fan.""",Closing walls and ticking clocks...,19
