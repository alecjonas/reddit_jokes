After about a half an hour of sitting and waiting, the elderly man looks across the street and sees an ice cream shop. He smiles to himself remembering the times he had as a child eating his favorite vanilla ice cream cone. The man gleefully hops off his chair and decides to go pick one up, for old times sake.

""Quasimodo, I am here to ring your bells"" 

""But how can you, when you have no arms?""

The man runs past Quasimodo and races up the stairs to the bell tower with Quasimodo in hot pursuit. He reaches the biggest bell and launches himself toward it, and slams his head directly into the side of the bell.

Instantly, the most beautiful peal Quasimodo had ever heard shimmered out over Paris; he fell to his knees, tears in his eyes, as below in the city, people paused in their daily lives as the sonorous bell spoke.

Quasimodo said: ""That was a most beautiful peal, please do it again""

The man runs again at the bell, but loses his footing and falls over the parapet three hundred feet to the courtyard.

When Quasimodo reached the courtyard, a small crowd had gathered around the pitiful body.

""Quasimodo, he fell from the bell tower: do you know him?""

""Well I don't know his name, but his face rings a bell""


The following day, another identical man came to the cathedral. ""Quasimodo"" he said ""My twin brother died here yesterday and it's our family tradition to resume the work he was doing, let me ring the bells!""

Sure enough, the man had skills even greater at ringing the bell with his head, and once again, the bustling streets of Paris paused at the golden note hanging in the very sky itself.

And once again, the new bell-ringer lost his footing and fell to his death.

Down in the courtyard again: ""Quasimodo, this man looks like the guy who fell yesterday!""

""Yeah, he's a dead ringer for his brother""

Again, before he was shocked, he asked for another curry, one so spicy that flames would appear. His wish was granted, and after he finished, was shocked. Except he didn't die. Kim Jong Un was in a good mood that day, and allowed him to have another chance.

Once again, the composer was given time to gather more people to play, and to write another song. On the day of the performance, the same thing happened. Nothing went right in the performance, it was even worse than the previous ones. Kim Jong Un was furious, and that night, once again, the composer was put in the electric chair.

Ths time, he asked for another curry, the spiciest in the world. Kim Jong Un refused his request, and lead on with the execution. The president wanted to personally press the button to lead to his death. After it was pressed, nothing happened, Kim Jong Un pressed it once more to make sure he wasn't imagining things, but there sat the composer, without even a scratch on him.

One day a messenger came to the gate, declaring he had an urgent message from the king. The general of the fortress called all the guards to a meeting to discuss the message.

""According to His Majesty, two of our fellow fortresses have fallen in the past fortnight,"" said the general. ""The scoundrels responsible left few survivors, but those who lived report that the infiltrators had taken the guise of knights, but were, in fact, horses.""

""Preposterous!"" responded the guards.

""Nevertheless,"" the general continued, ""we have been notified to not allow these infiltrators into our castle, so all who enter must be questioned so no horses may destroy us.""

There were murmurs from the guards, but they decided that despite how ridiculous it sounded, they should follow the instructions of the king.

Later on that day, a blue knight approached the barracks. He was stopped before the gates, and questioned. ""Art thou a horse?"" the guards questioned.

""Poppycock, my fellows!"" the knight responded. ""Of course I am no horse."" The guards decided it would take a skilled horse to mimic speech, so they allowed the knight inside.

An hour later, a red knight approaches. ""Art thou a horse?"" the guards questioned again.

""Heavens no,"" the knight answered. ""I merely wish to rest my weary bones for a while."" Like the blue knight, the red knight was granted entry.

A couple hours later, after both the blue and red knights had left, a yellow knight approached the gate. The guards, once more, questioned the lone knight. ""Art thou a horse?""

The yellow knight responded, ""Nay!""",Horse Marauders,2

The trooper told the driver he was fascinated by juggling and said if the driver would do a little juggling for him then he wouldn't give him a ticket. He told the trooper he had sent his equipment ahead and didn't have anything to juggle.

The trooper said he had some flares in the trunk and asked if he could juggle them. The juggler said he could, so the trooper got 5 flares, lit them and handed them to him.

While the man was juggling, a car pulled in behind the State Troopers car. A drunken good old boy from central Texas got out, watched the performance, then went over to the Trooper's car, opened the rear door and got in.

They were known as one of the most ruthless poachers around, using their crossbows to hunt animals skillfully for bounty, but their identities were never revealed to the public.

One day, the two were requested by a blackmarket to hunt gorillas for their body parts to make illegal accessories out of them. So they went out in the afternoon, made their base camp in the middle of a forest, and began their search. 

Hours went past and neither of them could find their targets, nor even successfully slaughter any of the ones they found. After much pursuit, the 1st poacher decided to head back to base camp to rest for the day while the 2nd remained in pursuit. Eventually the 2nd poacher found another one. It was massive, growling and intimidating as it immediately detected the poacher as a threat. 

Without any hesitation the man attempted to devise a plan to successfully slaughter the primate with little effort. As he checked his crossbow, he realised that he had only 3 arrows left. So without wasting time, he cornered the gorilla, giving it no hope of escaping and only to defend itself. 

Steadying himself, the poacher begun to fire the first arrow. With no effort, the  gorilla then grabbed the projectile with his left arm in an attempt to block it. The poacher was impressed, quickly he reloaded his 2nd and fired again. Once more, the primate grabbed it as well with his right arm instead. The man started panicking, as he hurried to shoot his 3rd and last, he missed. Seeing how the poacher was in a frenzy, the gorilla made a loud growl and took the chance to run further into the woods for safety.

""Dammit!"" cursed the man. Disappointed, he had to call it a day and finally went back to base camp to regroup with the other.

While the both of them went on to talk about their experiences, the 1st poacher decided to carry out a final round of hunting after his long-deserved rest while the 2nd poacher remained.

Not long after, the 1st poacher returned, with a look of shock and delight. He kept his gaze over at the his friend filled with wonder.

""Hey man, why didn't you tell me that you had one? Should've told me earlier so I could bring it back here for checking.""

""What do you mean? I would've tell you if I did. Haven't had any luck so far. Ran out of ammo too.""

""Well,"" he chuckled. ""I was walking through the path you mentioned earlier and I happened to find a dead one with lots of wounds on his chest area, and his hands had the same arrows you used as mine. Good job mate.""

Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend

He tried to dig it out but in his desperation succeeded in only pushing it in deeper. He asked his wife to help him dislodge it but after hours of trying they decided to go to the hospital.

As they were heading out of the door, their daughter came home with her date. After being informed of the problem, their daughter’s’ young male companion suggested he might be able to get the peanut out. He told the father to sit down and relax, then proceeded to shove two fingers up the father’s nose and told him to blow hard. The father blew as he was told, and to everyone’s huge relief the peanut flew out of his ear. The mother and father thanked him profusely for helping them out. 

“It was nothing,” the young man insisted modestly. Once he was gone, the mother turned to the father and said, “That’s wonderful! Isn’t he a smart young man? What do you think he’s going to be when he grows older?”

The father replied, “Judging from the smell of his fingers, our son-in-law.”",One evening a man was at home watching TV and eating a bowl of peanuts.,303

Within seconds they start taking off their clothes. After 15 minutes of vigorous sex they finally finish. They both put their clothes on and they both just sit there awkwardly. The woman speaks up and says ""I'm a prostitute and its going to be 100 dollars for my service."" The man is stunned and saddened that she didn't really like him. He gives her the money and they both sit there awkwardly. The woman tells him that she is ready to leave and the man replies ""I'm a taxi driver and its going to be 150 dollars for the ride here and back.""

They spot each other at the same time, and give a simple wave.  The American, rather bored, decides to signal him what military force he's in.  He first signals Air Force by sticking his arms out to the side, imitating a plane.  He sees the other sniper is rather confused.  He decides he's not in the AF, and decides to signal Navy by imitating swimming.  At this point, the other sniper is looking a little scared.

Running out of options, he goes to Marines by crossing his arms to form a t, with fists clenched.  Now, the other sniper is starting to look terrified.  The sniper (who apparently forgot Army exists) decides to signal if he's a spy by putting his fingers to his eyes and wiggling them.  At this point, the other sniper picks up his rifle and kills the man instantaneously.

At the end of the day, the other sniper is back at his camp, eating dinner, talking to his comrades.  He said that he, unfortunately, had to kill an American sniper that day.  When they asked why, he replied:

""He signaled me that at a quarter till 4, he was going to swim across the river and f*ck me so hard my eyes would pop out of my skull""","There were 2 snipers, in Vietnam, on 2 sides of a big river.",0

 The first of the three was the richest, it had a huge army with many respectable knights. 

 The second kingdom was not quite as rich as the first, but still had a substantial army with some knights.

 The third kingdom on the longest side of the lake, however, was very poor, it had only a camp in the forest, and only had a few squires.

 The three kingdoms decided to go to war over the lake, and the two richest kingdoms formed and alliance. They both had a huge celebration the night prior to the war. Unfortunately, they became so drunk that the knights were unable to fight, so the next day they had to send only their squires into battle.

 The squires of the third kingdom decided to try and be very well prepared. They hung a noose from a tree, and hung a pot fairly high on the string to cook an evening meal.

 The next day, the battle started, and went on for a very long time. In the end, the kingdoms declared a stalemate, and the war ended as a draw, with both sides equal.

 And I suppose his just goes to show how the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides...",Three Kingdoms on a Lake,2

He had suffered from monorchism since birth, and throughout his childhood he was bullied because of it.

He had been called all sorts of names - but none stuck with him as much as 'One-Stone'. He couldn't leave the house without someone shouting it at him.

Eventually, One-stone became so fed up with being bullied, he declared to all that should anyone call him 'One-stone', he would kill them.

It worked. No one dared to call him 'One-stone' for years after that.

Until about 5 years later, when a girl accidentally forgot, and shouted ""One-Stone!"" across the street.

True to his word, One-Stone seduced her, made love to her all day and all night, until she died of exhaustion.

It was about two years after that when another girl made the same grave mistake.

In similar style to the first, One-Stone made love to her all day and all night... but this time, she wouldn't die. So he continued. She still was absolutely fine, days of love-making later. One-Stone couldn't believe it. In the end, he had to give up.

So, what's the moral of this story?

Jake barely survives and after undergoing several surgeries, he is fitted with a wooden leg. Unfortunately his wife can't take it. She refuses to sleep with him, won't be seen with him and calls him all sorts of ugly names. After months of abuse, they finally divorce.

Dejected and depressed from losing not only his leg but the love of his life, Jake spirals downhill hard. He stays drunk from dawn until dusk, won't leave his apartment and sits online all day looking at pictures of his ex-wife. 

Tom, Jake's bff, is concerned and goes to visit Jake to make sure he's doing okay. Upon seeing the condition Jake was in, Tom asks him if there was anything at all he could do to cheer him up. Jake thinks for a minute and tells his friend that he needs to find a woman will love him despite his injury. 'Great!' says Tom, 'My girlfriend has a friend named Susan who is drop-dead gorgeous and is recently single. The only thing is...well she has a wooden eye. We'll all go out tonight so you two can meet. One thing though Jake, do NOT mention her wooden eye! She's very sensitive about it' 

Naturally, Jake agrees. So he gets himself showered, shaves off his unkempt mangley beard, puts on his finest clothes and cleans and polishes his peg leg like never before. Tom picks him up at his apartment and off they drive to the bar to meet their dates. They arrive prior to the women and decide to grab a table. A few minutes pass and the women arrive. Jake sees Tom's girlfriend walk in the door followed by the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen- blonde with DD breasts, long slender legs leading up to her magnificently round ass and wearing the bare minimum clothing requirements for being out in public, and yes, the unsightly wooden eye.

Jakes friend rises from his chair and goes to greet his girlfriend. While the two of them are talking, Susan walks over to the table and in a soft, sultry voice asks, ""Would you mind if I took the seat next to you?"" 

Hardly able to contain his excitement, Jake says ""Would I?!""

A week after we first met online, she reveals something to me. She's only 14 years old. Now, I'm over the age of majority, but when I think about how much of a good time I've had, quite a few late nights and seemingly always something fun and provoking to talk about, I say I'd be fine keeping this up as long as she is.

So we keep up talking. She is unbelievably mature and easily keeps pace on whatever topic we have. I wish women my age were as engaging and interesting as she is. Anyway, she suggests that we meet up, and I'm completely sold on the idea immediately. She continues on to suggest that we get busy when we meet, she says she's ready for that kind of step. I agreed to this as well, and we kept up flirting, and sent some suggestive pictures to each other as well.

After this, she makes a final revalation. She's actually an FBI agent. The only thing I can think of when I read this is...

How fucking cool is it that a 14 year old is an FBI agent?",[long] I met a girl online a few weeks ago...,9

In particular, the guitar really spoke to him so he decided to head to a music shop and learn guitar lessons and soon became very good.

The cow, realizing he needed other band members, invited his friend the Duck to the band. He showed him the same skit, and the duck was positively entranced by the drummer that the idea of a band sounded less far fetched to him. So he went to the same music shop and took drum lessons and became very good.

The cow and the duck later invited the horse to join them in their gradually burgeoning band. After watching the skit, the horse decided that playing the bass would be his passion and proceeded to take bass guitar lessons at the same music shop and became very good.

The 3 friends were jamming out in Cow's garage when a record dealer drove by them. He realized how much talent this trio had and soon they signed a deal to get an album published and a nationwide tour across the country.

Ont he day before they were supposed to leave, however, tragedy struck as the cow's mother became very ill and she had to go and visit her to make sure she was okay. The other 2 members decided to go on the tour anyway but in a twist of fate, their plane crashed horribly and they ended up dying. The cow's mother later also ended up succumbing to her illness

Felling depressed and alone the cow decided to visit the bar for a drink. She was on the brink of sobbing but a duck sitting next to her put his feathers on her shoulder and said, ""Ah, having a tough day, kiddo? Don't worry I've been there.

""Many, many years ago when I was twenty-three
I was married to a widow who was pretty as could be.
This widow had a grown-up daughter who had hair of red.
My father fell in love with her and soon they too were wed.
This made my dad my son-in-law and really changed my life
for now my daughter was my mother, 'cause she was my father's wife.
And to complicate the matter, even though it brought me joy.
I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy.
My little baby then became a brother-in-law to dad,
and so became my uncle, though it made me very sad
for if he were my uncle, then that also made him brother
of the widow's grownup daughter, who was of course my step-mother.
Father's wife then had a son who kept them on the run
and he became my grandchild, for he was my daughter's son.
My wife is now my mother's mother and it makes me blue
because although she is my wife, she's my grandmother too.
Now if my wife is my grandmother, then I'm her grandchild
and every time I think of it, it nearly drives me wild -
'Cause now I have become the strangest 'case you ever saw..
as husband of my grandmother, I am my own grandpa""

Each explorer was to make a daily video call to their country's #1 news station to update them on their trip, in return for funding.
The explorer from Poland set out, and he met the explorer from the Czech Republic at the airport in Vancouver, and they set off for Whistler, where they would start their journey.

They spent the night in town, and then got moving the next morning.  They headed out in the direction of Lake Louise, and their journey was a good one, with each explorer making his daily video call to his country's news station every night.  

This went on for a week, until one day there were no calls from either explorer.  The Polish government contacted the Czech Republic's government, and they decided to contact some locals to see if they could find their missing explorers.

The local Canadians searched high and low where the two men would have been, until they came across a grizzly bear den.  Being as it was mating season, they went on a little more cautiously, until they ran across a female grizzly.  They tried to avoid her, but she was agitated and tried to charge the search party, who were forced to shoot her dead.  

Upon examining the body, they made the unfortunate discovery that the polish explorer had been killed and eaten by that same grizzly.  They found parts of his gear and his official jacket in her stomach. While examining her further, they discovered that she was also recently pregnant, around the same time that the explorers went missing.

A few days later, the head of the search party made his official televised statement:

""After an extensive search, considering the unfortunate discovery of the body of the explorer from Poland, and with the discovery that the female bear was pregnant, we have determined that there was more than one bear responsible for the attack on these two brave men, one female and we can only assume one male.  We don't know how far the other bear may have ranged, but we are confident is telling you that the Czech is in the male.""",Two famous explorers decided to trek across Canada...,20

You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water twice a day. Avoid heavy labor. Your elbow will be better in two weeks.

That evening as the man contemplated this breakthrough in medical science, he began to suspect fraud. To test his theory he mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and teenage daughter. To top it all off, he masturbated into the jar. He took this concoction down to the drugstore, poured it in the machine and deposited $10.

There, he searched and searched among the Himalayas until he came to a tiny temple. Inside the temple sat a monk with a kind face, weathered by laugh lines. The man fell to his knees and begged the monk for the perfect joke.

The savages imprison the men in bamboo cages and inform the men that they are about to be eaten alive. But before that happens the tribal leaders tell the men that they will have one chance to be set free. 

The tribal leader tells them that they have to complete a couple of challenges. He says first, the men must go out into the jungle and collect 10 pieces of the same fruit. 

So the men go out into the jungle to collect the fruit. 

Man number one returns first and he's got 10 oranges. The tribal leader says ""good, good. Now you must insert each one into your ass and if you even flinch, we will eat you alive.""

Man one see it as a tall challenge but he's begins to insert the oranges. He gets two oranges up there before he winces in pain and screams out. 

The tribe eats him alive. 

Just then, man number two emerges from the jungle. He's carrying 10 grapes. 

The tribal leader gives him the same instructions. He must shove the 10 grapes up his ass without flinching. 

Man two begins putting the grapes up his ass. He gets 8 grapes up there and as he's inserting the 9th grape he bursts out laughing hysterically. 

The tribe eats him alive. 

Man two meets man one in heaven. Man one looks flabbergasted. Man one says ""wow, you almost made it! What the hell happened?""

Therefore, they decided once to stop the carnage and solve the dispute in an ancient way: a duel! As between David and Goliath. And this ""duel"" should be a dog fight ...
The mediators agreed that each party is given 5 years to grow the best fighting dog that they can. The dog that wins will deserve for its people the right to lead on this disputed land. And the losing side will have to lay down arms in an amicable way.

The Arabs found the largest Dobermans and Rottweilers in the world. They crossed them, and then crossed their puppies with the worst Siberian wolves. They chose only the largest and most powerful puppy of all litters, fed it with the best food, used steroids and found the best trainers to create the best ""killing machine"".

5 years later. The Arabs had a dog that needed steel prison bars for the cage! Only an expert coach could handle this extremely terrible and ferocious monster.
When the day of the big dog fight came, the Israelis appeared with a very strange looking animal. It was a terribly disproportionate dachshund, 3 meters long!

Every spectator in the arena felt pity for the Israelis. Nobody seriously thought that this strange, incomprehensible animal has at least one chance to stand against the snarling monster sitting on the chain in the Arab camp. All totes predicted that the Arabian dog would defeat Israel in a matter of seconds.

When the cells were opened, the dachshund slowly hobbled to the center of the circle. The Arabian dog jumped out of the cage and, splashing saliva, rushed to the giant strange dog of the Israelis. When the Arabian dog was in inches from the Israeli dog, the dachshund opened its mouth and ... swallowed the Arab monster in one sitting! Nothing left, well, maybe, except for a tiny scrap of wool from the tail of an Arab dog ...

The dumbfounded crowd of international observers, brokers and journalists published a general cry of unbelief and surprise. Everyone was confused.

The Arabs approached the Israelites, muttering and shaking their heads, stricken. ""We do not understand,"" said their leader. ""Our best scientists worked without rest for 5 years, crossed the worst, the largest Dobermans and Rottweilers with Siberian wolves, brought an incredible"" killing machine ""from the dog! ..

He asked “Can ya breathe?”

Still gasping she again shook her head “No.”
