""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.""

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""
The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..
The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150.""",Cat scan,39

However, this next story that he has planned, he figures it's gonna be HUGE. It's the story about a runaway cat, told from a first-person view of the cat himself. The cat is supposedly trying to figure out how to return home, and how to survive. After giving it much thought, and after receiving the feedback from the other failed attempts, he decided to put his all into his book. It'll be a smash hit.

After about fifteen minutes, the teacher finally shows up to first period. The teacher apologizes, ""Sorry, I'm late. My dumbass boyfriend doesn't know how to properly set an alarm clock."" Upon hearing those words, a light bulb suddenly went off in James' head. Boyfriend... clock... that's it! That's the perfect story!

During class, he decided to try and take notes as to the concept of the book in itself. So far, he has the idea of a guy falling in love with an analog clock, something about how digital clocks are about to go outdated, and that he feels nostalgic by them and doesn't want them to fade away... that's what he's come up with so far. Yeah. A story about a guy that has a sexual relationship with an analog clock.

It's a strange story, he knows, but he feels it's quite an original story, to the point where it will definitely put him over the top, WAY more than his cat story he's been working on. Once he gets home, he puts way more time and effort coming up with the characters, the plot details, and so on and so forth. Finally, by the time he has to go to sleep, he's already completed two chapters.

A few weeks later, he's already completed the book. He's so excited about what he's written, where he feels like a big shot. He feels this will definitely be the book that brings him to success. It's well-written, has great structure, and he feels that he wrote the main character enough to where you'd actually empathize with his romantic relationship about the clock, and why exactly he wanted to marry the clock in the first place. He titles the book ""Holding Hands"".

He sends it in to the first publishing company. A few days later, he gets a call, saying that it was one of the worst things they've ever read. Feeling distraught by this, he decides to try again with a different publishing company. However, a few weeks later, he's given the exact same statement, that it was terrible. He tries over and over again, but nothing really seems to happen.

Finally, he decides to give it one last shot. One more publishing company, and if they reject it, he'll scrap the book entirely and possibly resume the cat story that he originally had his eyes on. He sends it in, and... no one contacts him. Days later, not a word. Weeks pass, months. A few years, even. By this point, James has already graduated high school and went to college for writing. His cat story was also rejected, but hopefully he'll be able to write a masterpiece once he graduates and gets his degree.

By now, he's also married and has a child on the way. Suddenly, out of the blue, his phone rings. He couldn't believe it. It was the publishing company from a few years back! He answers the phone. ""Hello?"" A woman answers, ""Hello, is this James?"" He affirms. She says to him, ""I'm just calling to let you know that we've recently read your book you sent us, ""Holding Hands"".""

He says, ""Yeah. It's about fucking time.""",High school student James is in first period.,937

""Dear Ronald J. Kse,

This year we have chosen you to be the host of this year's harvest reap! All you need to do is provide your humble farm as the place of the party, and we will all provide.

Thanks, your neighbors""

Now, Ronald had really enjoyed last year's party, so he was delighted to be the host for this year.

After a grand day of eating, drinking, and merrymaking, All of Ronald's neighbors left - without helping clean up.

""That's fine, its just one party, and I've done the same other years"" said Ron.

Fast forward the next year, Ron was looking forward to this year's harvest, and the celebration that would follow.

After attending this year's anonymous vote, he gets another letter in the mail.

""Dear Mr. Kse,
After the amazing time everyone had last year, the vote was decided again for you to be the host! We look forward to seeing you again, and thank you.""

Ron sighs, but thinks ""Yeah, last year's party was pretty great. I guess the cleanup wasn't too bad. No worries.""

Again, he gathered with his neighbors, and they feasted and drank themselves silly... but there were twice as many people this year. Friends, family, friends of family were all invited...

The cleanup was far worse this year. ""But,"" Ron thought, ""there's no way I'll get it three years in a row.""

Next year, Ron's sister was visiting, and went with him to check the mail. She handed him a very lavish envelope, garnished with golden filigree and laden with caligraphy.

She exclaimed ""Wow! This is beautiful! It must be something very wonderful and important!""

""No... I've seen this before... It's another fucking reap host..."" said R. Joe Kse",A farmer gets a letter,10

Despite the seemingly odd request, he complied and returned the next day with an apple, an orange, and a Mars Bar.

The doctor then said, ""Okay, now drop your pants and bend over. This is going to hurt a bit.""

Although stunned by the turn of events, the patient dropped his pants and bent over. With one deft motion, the Doctor rammed the apple up the guy's arse, swiftly followed by the orange and the Mars Bar. While the doctor consulted his watch, our hero danced around the room shouting at the doctor.

""Okay, I want to see you here at the same time every day for the rest of the week, and bring another orange, apple and Mars Bar."" said the doctor. The now humbled patient, with tears of pain in his eyes, nodded his head.

All week the same routine ensued. First, the doctor rammed up an apple, then an orange, and then a Mars Bar

After one full week of treatment, the doctor finally said, ""Well, tomorrow is the LAST day of treatment. I want you to bring in an apple, and orange and a hammer.""

""No Mars Bar?"" asked the very frightened patient, trying to imagine what a hammer was going to feel like.

""Nope, a hammer."" confirmed the doctor.

On the last day, the doctor said, ""Okay, you know the routine"". So the man dropped his pants and bent over. UP went the apple, and up went the orange.

All of a sudden, this glorious pheasant flies up out of the undergrowth, and flies high over the treeline. With careful aim, the lawyer pulls the trigger and BOOM, the pheasant drops like a stone, out of the edge of the woods, and the lawyer goes to find it.

He sees it lying in a field, in front of a farm house. Knowing the rules, he walks confidently over to the farmhouse to ask the land-owner's permission, before he removes it. The farmer opens the door to him, and the lawyer begins well:

""Sir, I'm a lawyer, taking some time off, and I happen to have shot a rather magnificent pheasant over your land. Now, I am a lawyer, and as such I know that I'm supposed to ask you - the landowner's - permission before I retrieve it. I was wondering if you'd be a good sport and let me have it?""

The farmer says nothing for a bit, and then replies:

""Well, it's a fine enough pheasant, and it is my land, but I'll tell you what. We'll play RoShamBo for it. Winner keeps it.""

The lawyer is puzzled, and says ""roshambo? I'm afraid we must not have covered that at any of the prestigious lawschools I attended while studying, or in my many years practicing as a highly accomplished lawyer. What are the rules?""

The farmer replies ""well, we take it in turns to kick each other in the nuts, and whoever gives up first, loses.""

The Lawyer doesn't really want to play, but he does really want his prize shot. He reluctantly agrees, and asks who goes first. The farmer says ""I do, since it's my land.""

The farmer tells the lawyer to widen his stance a little, and then backs up 10 steps or so. Then the farmer comes running, and his big right boot swings back, like a champion goalkicker. It smashes into the Lawyer's crotch at huge velocity, lifting the lawyer high off the ground, yelling in agony, and the lawyer collapses in a heap on the porch. After several minutes of groaning, aching, sobbing, and trying to muster the strength to stand back up again, the lawyer eventually struggles to his feet. ""All right"" he says, ""It's my turn now"".

The farmer turns away, shuts the door and calls out ""Nah, you can keep the pheasant.""","A Lawyer needs some time off, and he decides to go hunting...",81

The fisherman goes behind his counter and then weighs and measures the order. He was gruff and boomed when he spoke, “Here’s your god damned fish, that’ll be $40”

Sister Margaret meekly replies, “Watch your language, I’ll have you know you are speaking to a sister of the immaculate conception—” 

“No, no, no. That’s what it’s called. This is god damn fish.” 

She thanks him, and heads back to the convent to prepare the meal for the pope. 

While she is cooking, Mother Kate checks in, “How is the dinner coming along?”

“I’m cooking the god damn fish, it will be ready in an hour.” 

“What has gotten into you?!”

“No, no, that’s what it’s called. It’s called god damn fish.” 

Later that evening the pope is sitting at the head of the table and everyone is eating quietly. 

Sister Margaret chimes in, “this is some great god damn fish.” 

Mother Kate pipes in, “this is the best god damn fish I ever had.”

A preacher visits an elderly woman from his congregation. As he sits on the couch, he notices a large bowl of peanuts on the coffee table. 
""Mind if I have a few?"" he asks. 
""No, not at all!"" the woman replied. 
They chat for an hour and, as the preacher stands to leave, he realizes that instead of eating just a few peanuts, he emptied most of the bowl. 
""I'm terribly sorry for eating all your peanuts. I really just meant to eat a few."" 
""Oh, that's all right,"" the woman says. ""Ever since I lost my teeth, all I can do is suck the chocolate off them.""

One day, in line at the company cafeteria, Joe says to Mike, ""My elbow hurts like hell. I guess I'd better go see a doctor.""   


""Listen, you don't have to spend that kind of money,"" Mike replies.  


""There's  a new diagnostic computer down at Walmart. Just give it a urine sample and  the computer will tell you what's wrong and what to do about it.  


It takes ten seconds and costs ten dollars. A lot cheaper than a doctor.""  


So, Joe deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to Walmart.  


He deposits ten dollars and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample. He pours the sample into the slot and waits.  


Ten seconds later, the computer ejects a printout:  


""You  have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water and avoid heavy  activity. It will improve in two weeks Thank you for shopping at Walmart.""  


That evening, while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Joe began wondering if the computer could be fooled.   


He  mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from  his wife and daughter, and a sperm sample from himself for good measure.    


Joe hurries back to Walmart, eager to check the results. He deposits ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results.  


The computer prints out the following:   


1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. (Aisle 9)  
2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. (Aisle 7)  
3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab.  
4. Your wife is pregnant. Twins. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.  
5. If you don't stop playing with yourself, your elbow will never get better.

Bob agreed and went to the nearest corner shop and bought a plain cornetto. However, since he only had flippers, he got a lot of it on his face. He had some baby wipes in the boot of his car, so he waddled back to the garage. 

The mechanic looked up from examining the car and said, “Mate, looks like you’ve blown a seal.”

The man, annoyed by now, reluctantly agrees. The next morning he is flat out irritated with the process and decides to have a bit of fun. He lets the dog out and as the pooch lifts his leg the man catches a little of the dogs urine. He then asks his daughter and his wife to help out and they help fill the container a bit as well. After some thought he drains a few drops of oil from the car, and tops it all off by masturbating and adding that to the mixture as well. He then heads to the doctor's office, giggling all the way. Upon arrival the doctor looks puzzled at the odd-colored sample but then places it into a tray that slides out from the computer-wall. With the man still giggling in the back ground, the computer buzzes and beeps, seeming to take a bit longer this time.

After nearly loosing his arms for the fifth or sixth time he came up with an idea to give the locals ¢10 per pound they brought to him. He went on for months and became a very wealthy man refining the metal and selling it at a better price than anybody else could offer. The locals that would bring the scrap would flood in for a chance at some easy money, one man would come in every week with a cart piled high with scrap, he was so reliable the iron worker decided to start paying him ¢20 A pound! He would see the same face five or six times then they would stop coming around, he assumed the worst and went on with his day. Soon it was only the man with the cart that came to deliver the scrap. The iron worker was curious as to why he was the only one left and so he asked the man and he said 

""Everyone else is either blown up or too scared go root through the piles any more.""

""and what about you?"" Asked the iron worker ""how have you gotten so lucky when the others havent?""

""I have four kids"" replies the man, grinning

During the flight the pilot came back and said that they were experiencing engine difficulties and that the plane was going to crash. The good news was that they had parachutes, but the bad news was that there were only three.

Explaining that he had to make a full report of the situation to the authorities he quickly slipped on the parachute and jumped.

The scholarly gentleman stood up next and explained that he had studied at Oxford, Harvard, Yale and other such schools and that he was one of the most intelligent persons in the world. He said that the world needed his wisdom and great learning. So he grabbed a parachute and jumped.

The pastor considered his age and the fact that he had lived a full life and told the boy that he should use the last parachute. The boy scout calmly said, ""Don't worry, we'll both be okay."" The most intelligent person in the world just put on my backpack before he jumped.""

Again, Phil and Lawrence forked over the cash and helped themselves to some fresh eggs.

They go for their coffee and head home.

Lawrence calls Phil and explains that he is out of town for a few days so he can't go into town with him tomorrow.

The next day Phil decides to take a morning stroll alone down the usual street and low and behold the same woman is sat behind her stall beckoning Phil over.

""Hello there! Would you be interested in my cow's milk? Fresh from this morning!"" handing Phil a bottle of milk.

Phil declines the bottle of milk.

The woman sits there disgusted. ""Why wont you buy my milk? My rent needs to be paid! Please!"" pleaded the woman almost bursting into tears.

""I'm sorry"" Phil groaned 

""I lack toes and tall Lawrence""",Phill and Lawrence go for a stroll (long),4

After some years had gone by, her son had made it successfully, running the startup he joined that had made it big. His first desire to spend his money of course, was to find his mother's belongings. 

Setting out, he first went to the church that the grand piano had gone to. After long negotiations, for the church he been rather fond of its piano, the son agreed to take the old piano in return for donating a new one as well as a large tithe to the church. 

Second was the china. Bought by a connosieur, the collection was, fortuitously, being put up for auction at the present time. Spending thousands of dollars to get every piece, the son had managed to get the entirety of his mother's porcelain back. 

Finally was her love, her racer. However, it was proving impossible to find. Coming home after a whole day of searching, he finally decided to break the surprise to his mother.

He went to a  sex shop &amp; explained his situation.   
 

The man there said, ""Well, I don't know that I have anything that  will keep her occupied for so many weeks, except...  the Voodoo Penis!""   
 

The husband said ""The what""?  The man repeated "" The Voodoo Penis""  and pulled out what seemed to be an ordinary dildo.  The husband  laughed, and said, ""It looks like a dildo!""     
 

The man then pointed to the door and said, ""Voodoo Penis, door!""   The penis rose out of its box, darted over to the door and started  pounding the keyhole.  The whole door shook wildly with vibrations, so  much that a crack began to form down the middle.  Then the man said  ""Voodoo Penis, return to box!"" and the penis stopped &amp; returned to  the box.   
 

The husband bought it.  He took it home to his wife, And after the  husband had been gone a few days, the wife remembered the Voodoo penis.   She undressed, opened the box and said ""Voodoo Penis, my crotch"".  The  penis shot to her crotch.  It was absolutely incredible.  After three  mind shattering orgasms, she became very exhausted and decided she'd had  enough.  She tried to pull it out, but it was stuck.  Her husband had  neglected to tell her how to turn it off.  So she put her clothes on,  got in her car and started for the hospital.   
 

On the way, another incredibly intense orgasm made her swerve over  the road.  A police officer saw this and immediately pulled her  over.   
 

He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to  drink.  Gasping and twitching, the woman said ""I haven't had anything to  drink officer.  You see, I've got this Voodoo Penis thing stuck in my  crotch and it won't stop screwing me...""

A cat is watching the mouse and thinks to himself, ""when that fly drops, the salmon will eat it, the bear will eat the salmon, the hunter will shoot the bear, the mouse will get some cheese from the hunter's sandwich, and while he is occupied with the cheese, I will eat him!""

So the fly dropped the 6 inches and the salmon ate it, the bear ate the salmon, the hunter shot the bear, the mouse got his cheese, but the cat slipped and fell into the pond!

The moral of the story is:
When the fly drops 6 inches, the pussy gets wet.","A salmon is watching a fly hover 6 inches above the pond and thinks to himself, ""when that fly drops, I'm going to eat it.""",102

The more experienced readers are probably already familiar with  
this trick, but, for the others who want to give their man  
something truly special...

This works best as a surprise, so don't tell him exactly what  
you're going to do -- just ask him to lay back, and assure him  
that it will be a ""very pleasurable experience!""

Said in the right tone of voice, this alone is often enough to  
get him fully aroused.  If not, bring him to full erection with  
some oral sex (a ""blow job"").  Try to apply some pressure against  
the penis with your lips, but take care not to bite.  It also  
helps to suck \*hard\*.  You might also caress his testicles (""balls"")  
\*gently\*.  In spite of these tips, it's impossible to really do  
this wrong.  Remember the old adage about oral sex being like pizza --  
even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.

If he's already rock hard, then omit or severely limit the above  
stimulation, as you're likely to bring him to orgasm right there.  
This is especially true with younger (under 25) men.

Tell him to close his eyes and prepare for a surprise.  Take  
one testicle in each hand and quickly squeeze as hard as you can.  
Don't worry; you can't hurt him.  Actually, the most common mistake  
is not to squeeze hard enough.  This has the effect of forcing the  
semen out and triggering an immediate, incredibly powerful orgasm.

It is not uncommon for men to groan, writhe, flail, or even scream  
at this point.  In the confusion of the overwhelming pleasure,  
some men might even tell you to let go.  Don't do it!  There  
is nothing more disappointing to a man than to ejaculate with  
no stimulation.  Keep squeezing for 10-20 seconds, or until he  
calms down and his whole body relaxes.  Then let go.

He'll remember you for the rest of his life!",The instant orgasm trick,2

Christian thinks and says, “I wish to be attractive to lady prawns.” Cod grants his wish.

And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense.""

So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. The little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father having sex with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed.

The next morning, the little boy says to his father, ""Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now.""

Then she hands the bottle to the man. The man nods his head in agreement, opens it, and drinks about a third of the bottle to calm his nerves. He then hands it back to the woman. The woman takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the man.

People from all around his village would come everyday to witness this themselves.They would bring a bowl or a plate from their home and return with it being full of delicious food. Whenever anyone came up to him with a bowl, he would just proudly say ""Ready the bowl, Mam !""and in a puff of smoke that bowl would be full of whatever that person desired to eat.He could make sweets , he could make beverages , he could make anything the heart desired, and he helped everyone with his gift.


Because of this helpful nature he was beloved by everyone in the village. All the girls liked him and all the boys wanted to be friends with him. Except for one who one day out of jealousy ran to the king and told him everything about Al and his powers because he wished for Al to be captured by him, And the greedy king took the bait and sent his soldiers to capture Al by any means necessary. But Al was warned beforehand by a well-wisher of him at the court whom Al had helped once.So he ran away from the village, from everything he knew. His family, His friends, His life.He ran until he could run no longer and he slipped and collapsed.


When he opened his eyes the next time he saw that he was in some sort of a hut with an old guy tending to his wounds. Startled he immediately tried to flee, but the old man reassured him that no harm would come his way there. He told him that he was a woodcutter, He made a meagre income to sustain himself and his livestock. After feeling reassured Al decided that he is going to live here now and help the old man. He said to the old man the he doesn't need to do work anymore now that he's here. He asked the old man to bring him a plate or a bowl. The puzzled old man brought him a plate and a glass. Al took the plate and with a proud smile he said  ""ready the plate, Sir!"" and Poof!, The plate was filled with delicious roasted chicken and herb-basted potatoes with the glass filled with the finest beer in the whole kingdom. Dumbstruck the Old man after tasting the food a bit merrily ate the most delicious meal of his life.


After that beautiful meal the old man thanked Al but told him that it's not that he HAS to chop wood. It's just a part of his life and that he loves going to the market and meeting people there. Al confided and decided to go with the old man to the market everyday, because if he wished to live a normal life, he was going to need to learn some basic skills. So the old man took Al as his apprentice and taught him everything that he knew. He found joy in the young boy trying to learn his craft and was happy with his dedication to working.


Slowly as time passed on that young boy became a young adult, with the old man now confined to his hut due to his health. Al took care of everything now, He would make him soup and chop wood to buy medicine from the local apothecary.
But as slowly more time passed it became evident that the old man was nearing his end. One day when Al returned from the market he saw the old man lying on the bed, Al quickly rushed to his side where the old man put his hand on Al and told him
how much he loved him, about how he was like his son he never had, with tears in his eyes , Al thanked the old man for saving him and as he was thanking he felt the hand of the old man slowly slipping from his shoulders, with the last words by him being about forgiveness and compassion, with Al now again
after all these years left without a family. He arranged a proper burial of the old man in the woods where he just sat near his grave thinking what he was going to do next. After all this time he finally had time again to think about his old life
his family, his friendss, his old village. He decided to go visit his old village, assured that nobody should be able to recognize him after all these years. He knew that the old greedy king was no more and thus he was able to easily reach his village.


Upon reaching he saw that the village he once knew was no longer there. In it's place was a dilapidated town where everything was dark even the people everyone was mean to everyone else. Nobody laughed or played anymore. As he reached the townsquare he saw a man alone on a stage speaking to the 10-15 people who were there. As Al walked closer to hear what was being said, He was shocked. The person there spoke of Al, about how he had wronged Al when they were just kids,
about how Al was the life of the village , about how he was sorry for doing all this to him and about how he has been speaking at that very spot there for years trying to remind the people of that town of the good in their hearts.
After hearing all this Al recognised that man to be the kid that wronged him and he started to get angry but then he saw the man take a tray from his pouch and show it to everyone and then shouted,

""Al ! If you are here, know that I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything that I did to you. If you could find it in your heart please forgive the man that stands in front of you and fill this tray and this town with your magic. Make this town remember its roots again""


After hearing all this Al was fuming with anger.


How could he ? How could he expect forgiveness after ruining his life. Feeling almost disgusted he started to leave but then he remembered the old mans words. He thought about all the good times he has had with him, and he remembered his message about forgiveness and compassion. After a minute of standing still  he slowly started making his way towards the stage until he was standing in front of the crowd. The man on the stage a
