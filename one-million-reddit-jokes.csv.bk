Please be advised that anyone planning to dash through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh, going over the fields and laughing all the way are required to undergo a full Risk Assessment addressing the safety of open sleighs. This assessment must also consider whether it is appropriate to use only one horse for such a venture, particularly where there are multiple passengers. 

Please note that permission must also be obtained in writing from landowners before their fields may be entered. 

To avoid offending those not participating in celebrations, we request that laughter is moderate only and not loud enough to be considered a noise nuisance and therefore must not occur after 11pm and before 7am.

Benches, stools and orthopedic chairs are now available for collection by any shepherds planning or required to watch their flocks at night.
 While provision has also been made for remote monitoring of flocks by CCTV cameras from a centrally heated shepherd observation hut, all facility users are reminded that an emergency response plan must be submitted to account for known risks to the flocks.

The angel of the Lord is additionally reminded that prior to shining his/her glory all around s/he must confirm that all shepherds are wearing appropriate Personal Protective Equipment, including Eye Protection, to account for the harmful effects of UVA, UVB and the overwhelming effects of Glory.

Following last year’s well publicised case, everyone is advised that EC legislation prohibits any comment with regard to the ‘redness’ of any part of Mr. Rudolph Reindeer. Further to this, exclusion of Mr. Rudolf Reindeer from reindeer games will be considered discriminatory and disciplinary action will be taken against those found guilty of such an offence.

While it is acknowledged that gift-bearing is commonly practised in various parts of the world, everyone is reminded that the bearing of gifts is subject to Hospitality Guidelines and all gifts must be registered and where necessary, taxes and import duties paid as appropriate. This applies regardless of the individual -even royal personages. 

It is particularly noted that direct gifts of currency or gold are specifically precluded under provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Further, caution is advised regarding other common gifts, such as aromatic resins that may initiate allergic reactions.

Finally, in the recent case of the infant found tucked up in a manger without any crib for a bed, Social Services and the Local Authority Safeguarding Board have been advised and will be fully investigating. The RSPCA are also seeking reassurance that no donkeys were harmed during this incident.

Compliance of these guidelines is mandatory in order for you to fully participate with the festive spirit. Wishing you a very Merry Christmas (but bear in mind this must be under 107 milligrams per 100 millilitres of urine or 35 microgrammes per 100 millilitres of breath if driving – UK, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland). 

Regards,
The Christmas Regulatory &amp; Assessment Panel (CRAP)",NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN:,14

He’d been the main guy responsible for developing Kevlar and a host of other really great plastics and polymers.

However, it had been quite a while between new developments and so the VP of Research called him into the office.

“Larry, I need to let you know that unless you can come up with something new in the next two months, we’re going to have to let you go.”

Dejected and depressed, Larry headed over to the Covalent Lounge at the end of the day. The Covalent was where the engineers and scientists from the various plants and refineries in the area would hang out and swap stories.

Sitting there nursing his scotch on the rocks, Larry notices a guy in a white lab coat at the end of the bar. Between his fingers he has some material about the size of a marble. At first he bounces the substance on the bar and catches it. Then to Larry’s amazement, the guy stretches the material to about 5 times its original length. He then rolls it back into a ball and compresses between his fingers where it smooths out like a pancake.

Larry, desperate for any idea and excited by the object’s properties, approaches the guy and asks, “Do you mind if I take a look at that?”

The guy in the lab coat looks suspiciously around the bar and then hands Larry the object. Sure enough, the material is like nothing Larry’s seen before. He moulds it, rolls it, bounces it and examines it very closely.

He then hands it back to the guy and asks him, “Where did you get this stuff?”

“In my nose.”

Guy standing there with no arms.
Quasi is incredulous, doesn’t think he can do it.

Quasimodo says, “OK...it’s noon, let’s try you out”
They reach the top of the bell tower, the guy crouches down, takes a running start and slams his forehead into the bell.
BONG!

He stumbles, and falls off the tower and hits the ground. Splat.

I tried and tried to change the bird's attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else I could think of to ""clean up"" the bird's vocabulary.

Finally, I was fed up and I yelled at the parrot.

The parrot yelled back.

I shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even ruder.

So, in desperation, I threw up my hands, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer.

For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet.

Not a peep was heard for over a minute.

Fearing that I'd hurt the parrot, I quickly opened the door to the freezer.

The parrot calmly stepped out onto my outstretched arms and said ""I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I'm sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior.""

I was stunned at the change in the bird's attitude.

As I was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird continued,

""May I ask what the turkey did?""",I Recently I received a parrot as a gift.,156

The man was shocked he didn't know what to say so the leader asked again:
""Uga Buga... Or death?""

Since the man didn't want to die he said in fear: ""I choose Uga Buga""
 
The tribe's leader cheered: ""Uga Buga"", pulled the man out of his cage and f***ed him while the entire tribe cheers.

At the end, the leader threw the man into the cage and left.

The last man knew that he is next. He looked at his friends, one of them can't stop crying, and the other seemed to be paralysed. He also knew that it gets worse with every day that passes.

So he made up his mind, he is going to choose death, because death is the more merciful option.

The day after the entire tribe gathered around the cages and leader asked again, one last time.

""Uga Buga... Or death?""

And the man knew exactly what to say.

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned  a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's  owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his  front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to  bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. 		The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few  minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and  also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on  its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the  room. 		

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" 		

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.. 		

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1,500!"" she cried,""$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!"" 		

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it,  the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and   the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.""",A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon.,34

The exhausted Senate immediately and unanimously voted to force the consultants to provide a ten word response that ended in their opinion. The consultants then began to come in with haste, though barely a dent was made in all of the fields. The vote was split exactly between passing and rejecting the bill. The senators decided to let one more consultant vote. They ushered in an amalgamation that was nearly identical to all of the previous ones.

The king was much loved by his people, but he had an intensely jealous brother. Envious that the birth of the prince would mean he would never rule, the brother sought the help of an evil witch. The witch cursed the unborn child, causing him to have no sense of humor at all. You see this kingdom, being a magical sort, had an ancient and unyielding law saying that a man who could not laugh could not rule. And so years passed and the king fell ill and yet the prince had never laughed. Desperate that the passing of the king would lead to the rule of his evil brother the queen sent out a proclamation: there was to be a contest between the 10 best wordsmiths, jesters, bards, and comedians and if any could construct a joke which could make the prince laugh, that man would be richly rewarded for the rest of his life. For weeks, the contestants practiced and planned and finally the ten best jokes were presented to the prince. The assembled audience laughed and cried and rolled on the ground with mirth and when the last joke had been told they eagerly looked to the prince, sure that at least one of the masterful jokes had succeeded but sadly...

Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her Mother was coming to visit, which stressed Santa even more.

When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two others had jumped the fence and were out, Heaven knows where.

Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all the toys were scattered.

Frustrated, Santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor.

In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor.

He went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom.

Just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated Santa marched to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big Christmas tree.

The angel said very cheerfully, ""Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn't this a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to put it?""

post,echoem,2qh72,jokes,false,1576699064,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/echoem/wait_for_it/,self.jokes,," So there's a farm. On this farm, there's a cow, a chicken, and a horse, and the three of them are best friends.

They do just about everything together. And one day, they're sitting at the window of the house, and the farmer's kid is watching MTV, and they're watching it, and they hear the music, and the horse says ""you know what? I'm gonna learn how to do that.""

So the horse calls up Guitar Center, and he says to the guy on the phone, ""Hey, listen. I wanna learn to play guitar.""

Guy on the phone says ""no problem. Come on down.""

""No, there might be one problem. I'm a horse.""

""Naw, it ain't a problem. We'll get some attachments, I can teach you to play. Promise.""

So horse turns out to be a natural. He gets GOOD. And he calls over Cow and Chicken and he's like ""LOOK WHAT I CAN DO"" and he jams out like Jimi Hendrix. And Cow says ""holy shit. That's awesome. I want to learn to do something like that too. What's like that?"" And horse says ""Bass. Learn to play bass.""

So Cow calls up Guitar Center, and she says ""Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play bass guitar.""

Guy on the phone says ""No problem, miss, come on down.""

""Eh, this might be a problem. I'm a cow.""

""Nah, no problem. I helped a horse recently, I can teach you to play too. Promise.""

So Cow learns to play the bass, and Cow is fucking amazing at it. So Cow and Horse are jamming, and Chicken gets a bit jealous. He says ""Damn, I wanna learn something too. But not like that.""

Horse says ""Well, I mean, we need a drummer around here.""

So Chicken calls up Guitar Center, and he says ""Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play drums.""

Guy on the phone says ""No problem, man. Come on down.""

""Eh, maybe a problem. I'm a chicken.""

""Naw. Ain't no thing. I taught a horse guitar and a cow bass. I can teach you drums.""

So chicken learns the drums, and he's fucking amazing. So Cow, Horse, and Chicken all start having jam sessions whenever the farmer's out. And one day they're playing, and a big record agent is driving down the road. And he hears them, and he's like ""what the fuck? that sounds amazing."" so he stops at the farm, and he finds them all playing in the barn. And he says ""Holy shit. You guys sound AWESOME. I wanna represent you, make this a real band, make some music. You're gonna be HUGE.""

So Cow and Chicken and Horse take this guy's deal, and they move to the city, they cut albums, and they're big. REAL big. Top 10 hits, platinum albums, the works. They get set for their first tour. But there's a problem, see. Horse gets a phone call, his mom's real sick. Cow and Chicken, though, they're cool as hell. They say ""Listen. Go see your mom. We'll delay the first show a couple of days, so fly back home, spend some time with her, and then jump on a plane and come meet us.""

Horse says ""Thanks, guys. you're the best,"" and he takes off.

Couple of days later, Horse's mom is just fine. Turned out to be a real bad cold, she gets over it, and he spends another night there. The following morning, he gets a call. It's his agent. Cow and Chicken's plane went down, they died in the crash. The band is done. he's lost his best friends. And horse, this breaks him, man. He's been through so much with them, and he feels real down in the dumps. So he takes a walk, and while he's on that walk, he just can't shake the blue, so he figures to himself

""Alright, alright. One drink, just to get over it.""

So Horse walks into the local bar. Bartender looks at him and says:

""Hey. Why the long face?""",Wait for it,484

""Father, I would be honored to take the job of sounding the church bell for you,"" he said.

""Very well,"" said the priest, ""but first I would like you to show me your skills. We're very particular about how the bell is rung and I want to be sure you know what you're doing before I give you the job.""

So up many flights of stairs they went, up into the bell tower. Once at the top the priest says, ""Ok son, let me see what you can do.""

The young man leans his head back and smacks it full force into the bell, causing it to ring out beautifully. The priest is shocked - not only had he never seen someone do such a thing before, he had never heard the bell sound so amazing. ""Wow!"" he said, ""can you please show me that again?""

""Certainly, says the young man. He proceeds to wind up and smack his face into the bell again, and once again it rings out beautifully across the town. Unfortunately, as the bell swings back, it catches the young man full force, knocking him off the tower, several stories down to his death.

Mortified, the priest rushes down to the ground where a crowd has already gathered around the body of the mysterious young man. ""Father, Father!"" they cry. ""What happened? Do you know who this is?""

""No, I have no idea who he is,"" the priest replies, ""but his face rings a bell.""

Now you may thing that this sad tale is over, but that would not be the case for the church was still in need of a bell ringer and the very next day another young man showed up at the door requesting the position. The priest was still in a bit of a shock from what happened the day before, but he was eager to find someone to take the job so welcomed him inside.

""I do feel I should let you know, Father,"" the young man said as he walked into the church, ""the man who fell to his death yesterday was my older brother.""

Understandably this made the priest a bit uncomfortable. ""Are you sure you want this job then? It wouldn't put you an an awkward position?""

""Oh yes, Father, I'm sure, it would be a great honor,"" the young man reassured him.

""Okay then, but I do need to see that you know what you're doing first, please follow me,"" said the priest, and they headed up the bell tower. Once at the top the priest asks to see the young man's bell ringing ability.

The young man pulls back his head and smacks his face full force into the bell, just like his brother. And once again the bell rings out in the most amazing way. The priest is dumbfounded but nervously asks, ""can you show me that again?""

""Of course!"" says the young man and obliges. His fate was written though as the bell rang out wonderfully but swung back, catching him full force, and catapulting him off the tower to his death. Once again horrified, the priest ran down the tower as quickly as he could. By the time he got to the ground, there was an even bigger crowd gathered around the body.

""Father! Father!"" the crowd yelled. ""What's going on here? Now who is this dead man?""

The priest was shaking from the experience and answered, ""I have no idea, but he's a dead ringer for his brother.""","In a remote village, the local church found itself in need of a bell ringer.",7

He thinks to himself, ""This driver is just as dangerous as a speeder!"" So he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over.

Approaching the car, he notices that there are five old ladies - two in the front seat and three in the back - wide eyed and white as ghosts. The driver, obviously confused, says to him, ""Officer, I don't understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! I always go exactly the speed limit. What seems to be the problem?""

""Ma'am,"" the trooper replied, ""you weren't speeding, but you should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers.""

""Slower than the speed limit? No sir, I was doing the speed limit exactly! Twenty-two miles an hour!"" the old woman says a bit proudly.

The State Police Trooper, trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that ""22"" was the route number, not the speed limit.

A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error.

""But before I let you go, Ma'am, I have to ask ... Is everyone in this car OK?"" the trooper asked with concern. ""These women seem awfully shaken and they haven't muttered a single peep this whole time.""

 “Well, you’ll just have to ask a teacher then, won’t you?”

And so he goes and asks a teacher what a purple lemon is. “Go to the Headmaster!” She screeches.

And he goes and asks the Head what a purple lemon is. “I’m sorry, but this is big, we’ll have to go to the police.” The Head replies sadly, calling 999.

When the police arrive, the boy says: “But I just want to know what a purple lemon is!”

And the police look at him, and take him back to their headquarters, where they call the army, and an army officer arrives.
The boy, now in tears, asks; “But what’s a purple lemon?""

The soldier looks to the policemen, shakes his head and takes the boy to go see a general.

“I only asked about purple lemons.” The boy sobs.

The general frowns, and calls the Prime Minister, and gives the boy the telephone. “S-sir, what’s a purple lemon?” The boy asks once more.

The PM is silent for a long time, and then tells the boy that he’s patching him through to the Queen.

In the call to the Queen, the boy asks; “But what’s a purple lemon? I just wanna know!”

And the Queen tells him; “You’ll just have to find out when you’re old enough.”

So the police release him, and the boy is walking home, and crosses the street when *WHAM* – he’s hit by a car.

Adam's parents had moved to Hong Kong in from a small village in the Xinjiang province of China in search of a better life for them and their family.

However, due to a lack of proper education in their village, they struggled to find work and both ended up working as cleaners in a University, earning minimum wage and they struggled day to day to get by. However, they were loving parents, and gave everything they could to their children. Adam had a happy childhood, a better education, and loved his mother and father dearly. 

The day after completing his final school exams, young Adam's world was torn apart.His parents had been killed in a tragic boating accident while they we celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary. This devastated the teenager, he adored his parents and felt he has lost his whole world. He decided to go travelling to get away from the life in Hong Kong, where every day he was reminded of those he had lost. Using his meagre inheritance, he booked a ticket to London and packed a single bag, not looking back.

Adam lived the high life, working in hotels and bars, he travelled Europe, drinking and partying his sorrows away. After a good six months, he met a girl and settled in Amsterdam, which was as good a city for the young man as you can imagine. He was fed up with the lifestyle of hospitality work, and found an ad for a job as apprentice cheese maker, of all things, studying the profession under the tutelage of Franciscus Veltman, a cheese maker world renowned, his Edam especially was constantly voted the best in all of the Netherlands. As such they technique and recipe was a closely guarded secret, only known to Franciscus himself.

Things unfortunately faded away with the girl, as young love tends to do, however Adam had inherited his parents work ethic, and turned out to be a natural at making cheese. He and his mentor formed a close bond, with Franciscus, who was unable to have a family of his own, loved and looked after Adam as if he was his was his own son; and Adam himself looked up to him as a father. He had even finally taught Adam the secret Edam recipe, strengthening the bond between the two.

With the help of Adam, Franciscus' business went from strength to strength, and after 3 years, he decided to take well deserved vacation for the first time in decades, such was his dedication to Caseiculture, safe in the knowledge that his livelihood was in good hands with Adam at the helm. He booked himself on a week long cruise down the Danube, as he'd always wanted to see the beauty of Budapest. 

Alas, tragedy struck again, as the cruise ship capsized, and Franciscus drowned in his cabin. For the second time on his still early life, Adam had been left heartbroken. He couldn't bring himself to stay in Amsterdam, packed his things and moved back to Hong Kong.

Never one to be fully hindered by adversity, Adam used his skills and started his own cheese shop in his hometown. Again, thanks to Adam's hard work, talent and dedication, this was a roaring success, he made cheeses from all over the world that delighted the taste buds off anyone who tried them. As a tribute to dear old Franciscus, he however never sold his world famous Edam, only keeping it to make at home and treat those nearest to his heart. Despite constant calls from cheese lovers the world over who had tasted the Edam in Holland, Adam never wavered, and the cheese was never sold to the baying public.

Adam at this point fell in love with the daughter of the owner of the florist next door to his shop, a beautiful young lady called Chen. He finally plucked up the courage to ask Chen out, ask took her to the finest restaurant in Hong Kong. Chen fell for Adam's wit and charm, and before long they were married in a lavish ceremony. 

Six months of marital bliss later, Chen becomes pregnant. Adam is delighted, with his life finally coming together. When Chen goes into labour, Adam rushes to the hospital. Ten painful hours later, and Chen gives birth, not to a child, but to a deer! Everyone is in shock, and experts the world over descend on Hong Kong to witness this miracle of science, but no one can explain it.

Nevertheless, Adam and Chen treat the deer as if it was human, and in a fitting tribute name him Franciscus after his mentor and father figure, but along the way, shorten it to Frank for ease. Young Frank, despite the media attention, lives a sheltered childhood, and learns to walk, speak, goes to school, and leads as normal a life as an anthropomorphic deer could do.

Adam continues to run his now thriving cheese business, and still keeps the masterful Edam just for special occasions with his new family, and Frank adores it, counting down the days until the next event when Adam brings it out to share.

Frank continues his education, but a final tragedy was awaiting Adam. Chen, while out on a sailing holiday in the South China Sea with her now retired parents, fell overboard and was killed by a shark attack. 

Adam, after another cruel accident taking another loved one, cannot take anymore, and moves back to his parents village in Xinjiang, as far away from any large water sources as possible. He lives as a recluse, hiding away from the world in grief and sorrow. 

It's left to young Frank to run the cheese business. He, unfortunately, is not as adept at cheese making or running a business as his father, and the company starts to struggle. Realising this, he writes to his father for the legendary Edam recipe to sell to help revive the fortunes. His father, now a stubborn, grouchy soul, steadfast refuses out of tribute to Franciscus. 

Frank continues to just about keep the business afloat for the next few years, but every six months sends the same letter to his father asking for the recipe that could turn around his fortunes, but is constantly refused.

Finally, Frank hears word that Adam is on his death bed, his grief stricken body as succumbed to cancer. Frank rushes to Xinjiang, to find Adam in a terrible state, with only hours to live. After a long and tearful goodbye, Frank again asks for the recipe. 

Adam, gives him a long look up and down, and says with his dying breath ""I don't know how many times I have to tell you this, but Frank Lee, my deer, I don't give Edam.""


Edit : I feel guilty getting an award for a repost.",Adam was born in Hong Kong,209

"" Place this in your mouth so that your cheeks are stretched taut for my blade to shave off the tiniest wisp of hair off your face.""

""Interesting"", thought the man and willingly complied with the instruction and kept the ball in his mouth grimacing and holding still throughout the shave.
