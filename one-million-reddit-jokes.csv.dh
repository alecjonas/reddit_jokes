There was a boy that had a question about God. He goes to his local priest to see if he has an answer. The boy presents the question and the priest is completely at a loss of words. The question is so challenging that he could not give an answer. Unwilling to let the boy go unsatisfied without an answer, the priest takes the boy to a local bishop that knows even more about religion than the priest

The boy approaches the bishop and asks him the same question. Again, the bishop has no answer that will satisfy any of the parties. Seeing that the boy is getting discouraged that no one can answer the question the bishop sends the boy directly to the Vatican to talk to the pope. 

This pope was very popular among the people. And he knew everything. He was so smart they called him Pope The Wise. The boy walks up to the pope and asks him the question. The pope begins to answer but then gets choked up and realized that not even he has the answer for the question. 

As all hope was just about to be lost, an old nun walks into the room. The nun asks the boy to ask her this famous question and the boy does. The nun formulates the most perfect answer to the boys question. Almost everyone rejoices and all is good. 

Except the pope looks a little upset. He exclaims 
“This is impossible! Explain to me how a simple nun could be smarter than me! Pope The Wise!”

The boys learned well but they eventually got bored and started to search for something to entertatin themselves after the lesson. They found big heavy metal bars at the back of the temple, so they started playing with them.

One day, one of the monks found out about it and got worried that they might hurt each other while playing with the heavy metal bars. So, he approached the other monk and told him about it and asked what to do?

The other monk told him to hang a sign saying ""***Dangerous Metal***"" near the bars and tell the kids not to mess with them. The monk went down the hill at morning to buy a wooden sign and came back at dawn. 

He wrote ""***Dangerous Metal***"" on the sign, hanged it near the metals and went to sleep. But suddenly a heavy rain started pouring and when the monks came to check the sign in the morning, the words ""***DANGEROUS L***"" were washed off and only the word ***META*** remained,

On his first day of service, he sets off in a submarine which regularly patrols some islands which his country owns. His jobs is to clean the men's toilets. 

Halfway through his second day, Dave's commanding officer tells him he's getting a new, higher paying job: Janitor duty. Now, instead of the bathrooms, Dave mops the floors, scrubs the walls, and cleans the cafeteria. (It's small, so it's not much.)

At the end of his fourth day, he's moved to cleaning the *exterior* of the sub. So Dave puts on a scuba suit the next day and gets to work.

Finally, before lights out his sixth day, Dave's told to work the kitchens, making food for the other soldiers until further notice. Well, he's had enough.

He decides to ask one of the other cooks about it the next day.

""Hey, is it normal to have to keep switching jobs here?"" Dave asks Russ, the head cook, while preparing the potatoes for the next meal.

""Oh, of course. This sub is full of reposts. Say, are you going to the party later tonight?"" Russ replies, clearly used to hearing the question from new recruits.

""Yeah. 23.00, right?""

""Yeah. That's why we're making all the extra food.""

So they finish their day's work and get freshen up for the party. Dave looks pretty sharp, in his own words.

At the party, he interacts with all of the other soldiers in the sub, including a very pretty girl from the navigation team named Alexis. They talk, and decide to go get some drinks from the tables.

There's beer, wine, water, maple syrup, soda, punch, jello shots, etc. You know, all the good stuff. It's too bad that most of the drinks have a long line waiting to get them, though.

""There's lines for the wine, beer, *and* the jello shots!"" Alexis pouts, starting to walk away, back towards the other people.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,79

""Howdy"" says the gorilla.

The man freezes.

""Holy shit,"" he says, ""a talking gorilla!""

""Sorry,"" Began the animal. ""I didn't mean to scare you. I wasn't aware you were -""

""So how do you talk?"" interrupted the man.  ""Are there others? Are we cool? Or is this like that movie I saw once,""

""Whoa, relax man."" The ape started. ""It's all okay, I'm not going to hurt you.""

""How can you talk?"" The man repeated in awe, ""There's more of you right?""

""There's some."" The ape explained. ""None as intelligent as your kind, most of us can talk, but it's very difficult to learn, and we aren't really equipped the brainpower to do what you can do. Fortunately there's a lot of you guys and we can learn your language with plenty research and data collection by simply observing your kind.""

The man couldn't belive his eyes nor his ears. This creature, animal was speaking his language! They could communicate!

""You should come with me!"" The man chimed after hearing the apes words. ""We can get you talking with some scientists or whatever and we'll both learn from each species!""

The ape thought about the mans request. ""I can't see a reason not to do that. As long as I can safely return here to the jungle afterwards so I may see my clan afterwards. My father was taken away by your kind when I was young. Though I don't blame your species, I know that there are types in every group that are capable of such crimes.""

""I'm sorry about your father, and you have my word."" The man began. ""I'll make sure you can return here once we can find a research team to speak with you.""

The next day, the ape stayed with the man as he tried to get into contact with research groups to host a completely ethical meeting where a team of scientists would converse with the animal and send it on it's way, without putting it in a zoo or anything. Luckily, the man was able to reach out to an American University bioethics group to see for themselves the gorilla that could speak..

Eventually, after a few days of phone calls, the man scheduled time with the research group. So he and his animal friend drove out to the U.S. to speak with the researchers.

Once they made it, the two located the group, currently located on a second floor lecture hall, and made their way into the room.

The man opened the door to see a large amphitheater of empty desks, cabinets, tools, benches, and everything one would expect from a biology classroom of such a scale. At the front of the room was a group of what the man assumed were scientists. They noticed the man's gorrila and started to look pissed.

""What the hell is this?"" One of them sternly asked.

""What do you mean?"" The man asked. ""He can talk, you know..""

""Howdy,"" said the gorilla.

""We know he can talk!"" The scientist shouted. ""The issue isn't whether or not he can speak, but you called us saying you had a talking gorilla, and you bring us a fucking nigger?""",A man is walking through the jungle.,0

He first visits the Archdioces of Paris. France prepares very well for his arrival and celebrates his visit with parades, photo ops with young babies and politicians, and a mass baptism and blessing of thousands at the Seine. When all the events are finally over, the Pope steals away with the Archbishop and has a one on one meeting behind closed doors.

""My son,"" the pope says, ""you are the Archbishop of almost 3 million Parisians and almost 1300 priests, one of the wealthiest regions of a wealthy western nation, yet the Church has seen nothing from your tithes in months! Tell me, has the Devil taken you so far from the light that you would forsake Our Father in Heaven?""

The Archbishop frowns, ""Forgive me Father. I have submitted the finances of our Church to the Papal bookkeepers as has been required for centuries. Surely you know that there was a major fire in Notre-Dame earlier this year?""

""Of course! We saw the news of course, and heard tales of the billions pledged to restore her to her former glory. We would have expected a proper 10% to be sent to Us as is required...""

""Ah, I see,"" replied the Archbishop. ""Your holiness, like much of the world you have been misled by the media coverage on our great tragedy. Sure, many billionaires worldwide have pledged half their fortune to the Church, yet somehow even our most basic cleanup crews have gone unpaid in the last month. Those who made pledges did so for notoriety, not piety.""

The Pope was shocked and dismayed. ""I have heard rumors but I did not believe a Catholic could act in such a disgusting manner, offering a donation in the services of our Lord and reneging. Forgive me, my son, for my doubt. I will ensure this story is clearly presented to the media at once!""

The Pope did as he said he would, and moved on to the next diocese on his list, but not before giving his accountants a stern talking to to ensure he received all the information on the next two diocese.

The Pope and his entourage visit the Archdiocese of Caceres in The Philipeans. While not a wealthy country, the Pope was assured that their numbers just didn't add up. After days and days of community prayers, baptisms, blessings, and parades, the Pope finally had a minute to visit the Bishop in his very modest home. 

""My son, "" said the Pope,  ""you lead the Church in a country that enjoys the largest majority of believers in our Lord in all of Asia! While others may outdo you by sheer numbers, the Philipeans boasts some of the most strong and faithful Catholics in the entire world! Surely you have room in your budget to do your duty to the leadership of His Church?""

The Bishop was very sad at this questioning. ""I'm so sorry father, I have done all I believe I can. God has given me the energy to preach every night the virtues of Our Lord in Heaven and His word in the Bible yet our people are losing faith! We are a poor nation besieged by a government that claims to be fighting sin while killing all those who disagree! What little money our worshippers have has been going to funerals and medical expenses. As Pope Francis, God rest his soul, requested of us on his last visit, the diocese have declared all of those costs as charitable donations in the name of Our Lord! We can not serve my people AND single-handedly support your office, Father. I am sorry.""

The Pope reflected a moment. Surely this man was doing as God and the previous Popes had required of him. It was he who should be ashamed. ""No, my son, please forgive me, an old man who apparently had some poor advisors. You are doing the best work of Our Lord. I give you my blessing to continue as you have and to fight the treachery of your government in whatever ways necessary.""

The shocked bishop thanked the Pope profusely.

Hours later on the Vatican's private jet, the Pope again addressed his advisors. 

""This trip has been a waste! You assured me that the children of God needed my hand, the hand of this office, to steer them back into the light, yet I have found twice that both diocese are doing more of God's work than a thousand of you each! Tell me, what shall I find in Orlando??""

""Please Father, this one will surely make your holy toes curl,"" proclaimed their leader, ""the diocese there is the largest in the world and boasts a magnificent revenue yet it disappears into the other without increasing their profits not our donations! Sure this one is not a mistake!""

The Pope grumbled but he couldn't turn back now. He was greeted by tens of thousands, rallies across the state of Florida, parades, and politicians. He had never truly believed he could sense evil until his short visit with the leaders of that great nation, yet he was not there to condemn men not of his church. Yet, anyway.

Throughout his visit the Bishop of Orlando was not available a single moment. This disturbed the Pope greatly and it took several days of tracking for the Swiss Guard to secretly track down the man and bring the Pope to where he was hiding. In a rundown shack in the middle of the swamp, they found him watching fox news on an 30 year old CRT television.

""Why are you hiding, my son? I will not harm you so long as you change your ways...""

The poor bishop shook his head. ""You're here about the finances. Well I dont know nothin about finances.""

The pope gasped. ""My son, you are the leader of the largest diocese in the world, almost 14 million square miles! How can you not be aware of that?"" 

""Hah! 14... that's what you're here for? You want money from the moon?"" He could see the Pope's eyes widen. ""Oh you didn't even know, did you? Some law from 100 years ago, we took off from Orlando and landed on her surface therefore I get to lead all zero of the folks there now! Every year I get notes from your office about that unprofitable land and every year I tell y'all to fuck off!""

""Dont use such foul language in my presence boy! You are still under investigation for failing to return any money to the vatican for decades!

The black guy walks up to walrus, angry. He doesnt feel this is bar appropriate.

""What exactly are you fucking doing?"" The black guy asks the walrus.

But the walrus doesnt speak, it continues to fuck the watermelon.

He releases a breath he wasnt aware he was holding and decides since it is such a nice day, he will walk home instead of taking the bus.

He steps out on the curb and is hit by a moving van.

The chicken walks up to him and deposits the book on the desk. Apart from a little pond weed on one of the pages, they were all fine and within the lending period, in fact, they had only been issued the previous day.

Next day the chicken walks in amongst the shelves muttering quietly:
           ""Book book book"".

The young librarian turns to one of his colleagues and asks about the chicken
     ""Oh yes, the colleague replies, She comes in 
       everyday, collects a wingful of books, takes     
        them away and brings them the next day.""

This continues for several weeks until the young librarian can stand it no longer. So the young librarian resolves to follow the bird home and see what happens. The chicken turns up at her usual time, collects her wingful of books and heads out of the library. The young librarian follows at a discrete distance.


The chicken knowing that she is being followed takes a devious route home, suffice it to say she definitely didn't want to be followed. Fortunately the young librarian had managed to hang on. The young librarian watched from behind the bush, as the chicken (taking a good look round to make sure nobody was around) nipped into a forest of tall reeds beside a duck pond.


The young librarian crept quietly into the reeds only to be confronted by the sight of the chicken handing the books to a frog:

I carry it on me while I'm running. Those guys who like to whistle at me as I go by? I flash my gun at them and they don't bother me anymore.

It's like magic. It's like the friend I never had. One that will stand up for me when I need it. I'd never felt like this before.

Then one day, the best thing happened. My husband came home, late as usual. Drunk as usual. It's not often that he hits me, but this time I was out of line. I was feeling empowered by my gun. I always keep it on me. When he decided it was time to show me how out of line I was, I chose to show him how empowered I was.

And as I fled with Kelly, my daughter of 8 years, I made sure to show my friend that I would stand up for it too when two separate neighbors outside tried to wrestle it from me.

I drove. Kelly in the back seat, sleeping now. It's been about three, maybe four hours. We find a motel outside of town, but my judgment gets the better of me. Nobody is going to hurt me or my gun or my daughter. We drove cautiously into a park and slept in the car that night.

The next morning, Kelly is crying. She doesn't know what's going on or where daddy is. I guess she was in a daze before. Maybe thought she was dreaming. It pains me to see my daughter cry.

An idea. We need to change our style. No beards to grow or shave, but what if we were to get our hair done? I could tell her it was a treat for her, like some sort of makeover getaway. Two birds.

We pull into the fanciest stylist who might not be looking for us. All the works - fancy decor, big brand name products on the shelves. But the stylists. The stylists all have the most ridiculous hair. Absolutely disgusting. It's the type of hair that ""makes a statement."" Spikey one one side, shaved on the other. Dyed unnatural and unreasonable colors. I hate hair like that.

I wanted to turn around as soon as I'd walked in. But Kelly was so excited. I had to indulge her. Our guy came over. Some European weirdo. ""What'll it be then, love?""

I warned this guy. I said hey. Nothing funny. Kelly is a beautiful little girl, and she is MY precious little angel. Don't you mess up a single hair on her head, you hear me?

He stood there silent for a moment. And then he said he'd see what he can do. ""Come along, love."" He took Kelly back, and I mocked his words with my mouth.

Time went by, and i was stewing in my seat. The only way to calm my nerves was to hope that he gave my precious little angel something normal and beautiful and pure, like a little girl should be.

""Go on then, love. Show your mum.""

""Mommy, mommy, look!""

I was mortified. Bright red. BRIGHT RED. And SHAVED on one side! It just made me so. Angry. And the sides of my face. Flames. Just. Flames.

I pulled out my friend and told him he messed with the wrong woman today. POW!

And as he slumped down. Blood pumping out his chest as fast as it could. People scattering for the exits. He asked me why. And I wanted him to know that it was his actions that led to his undoing.

I chose my words carefully. Shot through the heart, and I blame you. You gave ""love"" a bad do.",Everything changed the day I bought my gun.,0

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.'

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.'

And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.

The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.'

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.

The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.'

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?'

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed.

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.'

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?'

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.'

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday.

”Dearest father,” the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.'

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory.

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.'

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country.

The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.

“Father,” the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.'

That night, the son spent on board the tanker.

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?'

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.'

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.'

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.

`Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.'

The son nodded weakly.

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.

`Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested.

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.

`I- I-'

Then he died","A day before his fifteenth birthday, the son of a wealthy family was asked by his father, “Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?”",11

The barman, now intrigued by the rabbit and the extra drinkers in the pub, (because word gets round), gives the rabbit the pint and the Toastie. The rabbit consumes them and leaves.

The next night, the pub is packed.

In walks the rabbit and says, 'A pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie, please barman.'

The crowd is hushed as the barman gives the rabbit his pint and toastie, and then burst into applause as the rabbit wolfs them down.

The rabbit looks aghast.

The crowd has quietened to almost a whisper, when the barman clears his throat nervously and says,  
 'We do have a very nice Cheese and Onion Toastie.

The rabbit looks him in the eye and says, 'Are you sure I will like it.'

The crowd's bated breath is ear shatteringly silent.

The barman, with a roguish smile says, 'Do you think that I would let down one of my best friends. I know you'll love it.'

'Ok,' says the rabbit, 'I'll have a pint of beer and a Cheese and Onion Toastie.'

The pub erupts with glee as the rabbit quaffs the beer and guzzles the toastie.

He then waves to the crowd and leaves....

NEVER TO RETURN!!!!!!

One year later, in the now impoverished public house, the barman, (who has only served 4 drinks tonight, 3 of which were his), calls time.

When he is cleaning down the now empty bar, he sees a small white form, floating above the bar.

The barman says, 'Who are you?

To which he is answered,  
 'I am the ghost of the rabbit that used to frequent your public house.'

The barman says, 'I remember you. You made me famous.

You would come in every night and have a pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie. Masses came to see you and this place was famous.'

The rabbit says, 'Yes I know.'

The barman said, 'I remember, on your last night we didn't have any Ham and Cheese Toasties. You had a Cheese and Onion one instead.'

The rabbit said, 'Yes, you promised me that I would love it.'

The barman said, 'You never came back, what happened?'

'I DIED', said the rabbit.

'NO!' said the barman. 'What from?'

Little Johnny's mother was hopeful that Johnny's math grade would finally improve. But to her dismay, his grade had still not improved on his next report card.

In an act of desperation, little Johnny's mother decided to transfer him to the local Catholic school. Immediately, she noticed that when Johnny came home from school, he wouldn't say a word, but would go straight to the table and begin doing his math homework.

“What about those shoes over there?” asks the cowboy, gesturing to the Oofos rack.

“Oh, those?” replies the store owner. “Unfortunately we were unable to apply the sale fully to the Oofos. They’re quite expensive. The best I can do is a pair at 5% off, which would still be well over $100. Did you want to try them anyway?”

Johnny thinks about this for a moment, and says, “Okay dad. All I really want is a new 10-speed bicycle,” and promptly shows his dad the bike in an ad online.

“Johnny, that bike is a little too much for us. Why don’t you think about some other things tonight and give me some more ideas tomorrow. Just keep in mind we have a large mortgage and your mother is looking for another job.”

That night, Johnny barely slept. His mind wandering to and fro, unable to think of another gift idea. At some point around midnight, he got out of bed to use the bathroom. As he walked past his parents’ room afterwards, he heard what sounded like a very heated discussion...

His father loudly proclaimed, “Oh honey, I’m gonna go, I’m gonna go!”
Then, his mother, “That’s it! That’s it! I’m coming too!”

Puzzled, Johnny ran back to his bedroom and hid under his sheets.

The next morning, Johnny’s father is sitting at the table, drinking his coffee and scrolling through Reddit, when he sees Little Johnny walk past him dragging a suitcase. 

“Johnny, what on earth are you doing?”

“Dad, last night I heard that little discussion between you and mom. You said you were going, and mom was coming too. I’ll be goddamned if I’m stuck here by myself with a fucking $280,000 mortgage and no 10-speed bicycle!”","Oh, Little Johnny.....at it again",37

There stood a big, muscular man in a zookeeper uniform covered in hair from head to toe. He was about 6½ feet tall and looked just like a gorilla. 
    
    
""This zookeeper seems to be heading towards the same building I am"", said the man as he approached the zookeeper, maintaining a disturbed stare. 
    
    
As he passes the zookeper, he glances towards his nametag and reads ""Oscar"".
    
    
""This must be Oscar Cocks! I can't believe I ran into another Oscar while looking for Oscar!"" thought the man with an amused smile on his face.
    
    
After a short walk, the man finally arrives at the building with the zookeeper right behind him. He enters the building and even holds the door open for the zookeeper as they greet each other with a smile. The man is then greeted by his buddy as soon as he walks inside.
    
    
""Hey buddy! How've ya been? I'm glad you could make it! You managed to get here on your own too!""
    
    
""I'm good! I asked for help from an employee on where to find you. I even have a little story I wanna tell ya."" He then whispers ""*It's about a guy who has the same name as you. He's the guy who I held the door open for earlier. He might hear us if we talk in here*"". He then continues, ""So what do you say we go out and grab some lunch?""
    
    
""Sounds good to me but give me a while and let me get my stuff. I've been working on this insect habitat all day and it's HUGE. We had to move a bunch of insects around just to make room for the construction. We used barrels for spiders, buckets for ladybugs and that crate you see over there is for grasshoppers among other things. In the mean time, why don't you have a look around? I'll be right over there by the habitat. If you need anything or have any questions about something just give me a holler.""
    
    
Oscar then walked to the nearby habitat that was under construction. 
    
    
The man strolled around and saw different charts and exhibits about insects. He eventually became bored and decided to lean against what seemed to be a wooden ^pole while waiting for his buddy. 
    
    
After a while, he feels a tingling sensation all over his body followed by sharp pains. The man turns around to examine the ^pole and notices hundreds upon hundreds of insects crawling about on its surface. As he frantically tries to identify if the bugs nibbling on him are venomous or not, all the while trying to get the insects off of him, he sees Oscar Cocks along with a bunch of other zookeepers making their way towards him. 
    
    
""Crap! If the zookeepers find out that I've been squishing their insects, I'll be in big trouble! I need Oscar's help! But if I called out Oscar's name, the zookeeper might be the one to approach me... But at the same time I need to know if these insects are venomous!"" The man pauses for a bit and finally reaches an epiphany.
    
    
He clears his throat and hollers at his buddy, 
    
    
""Hey OP,  what is this? A post for ants?""",A man went to a gigantic zoo to visit his buddy Oscar [LONG],6

After a bit of thinking, the owner realises something. He explains that if the can was broke, there would be no other way of watering the plants due to leakage and because that was his only piece of equipment. So he's asks the drunk man how he did it.

So about 9 months after we started living together, I met a girl who eventually became my girlfriend, and 6 months of dating later, I decided to propose to her.

We were sitting in my living room with our feet on the glass coffee table that Joseph bought, and I decided that that would be a great time to pop the question.

So i was getting ready to pull out the ring and was about to ask when Joseph burst through the door, drunk as hell, and fell straight onto the glass table, shattering it and getting shards of glass everywhere.

It turns out that a shard went into his eye, and he had to wear a cotton eye patch to help his eye heal. He also broke his leg, so he couldnt walk for a while. My girlfriend felt bad for him, so she decided to take off some shifts from her job in order to take after him. I had no problem with this. 


A few months later, Joseph had made a full recovery, and was able to walk and see our of both eyes. 

One day I  woke up and walked into my kitchen. I saw a note on my fridge that said that Joseph and my girlfriend were having an affair while he was injured, and  decided to run away and start a new life somewhere else.

Unfortunately, they left nothing else but that note, no phone numbers (they both changed their numbers), addresses or anything I could use to track them down.

Dr- okay I need you to pee into a cup
Patient- why? It’s my EL-BOW!
Dr- ::sigh:: we have this new machine in back and all it needs is the patients urine and it will diagnose ANYthing. Will you just humor me?

The patient agrees, goes into the bathroom, produces a urine sample, hands the cup to the nurse, nurse hands the cup to the doctor and the doctor goes into the back room with the diagnosis machine and closes the door. 
*thirty seconds later*
Doctor comes back out of the room, tears off a prescription from his pad, hands it to the patient “thank you and have a nice day” turns and walks out. 
Refuses to make eye contact with the patient so for the whole drive home the guy is bitching to his wife on the phone about what a horrible doctor he saw today. 
As the man walks into his kitchen when he got home, his 17 year old daughter comes in and said “dad I heard the whole story, hows about next time you have an appointment with this quack doctor- how’s about you me and mom take a turn peeing into this cup and see what the doctor says THIS time? Throw him for a loop.”
So weeks later, before his follow up exam, the mom dad and daughter have all taken a turn peeing into a decoy cup only unbeknownst to the other two, dad cummed into the cup....and put a tiny drop of motor oil into the cup. Shakes the cup up “let’s see what this fuckin quack has to say about THIS!” Drives off to the dr office. 
In the patient room the doctor comes in an says how can I help you?
Patient- “it’s this tennis elbow still.”
Doctor- “pee into a cup again.”
Patient-“FINE”
Only when he’s in the bathroom he switches the urine sample he just made with the fucked up cup
Hands the fucked up cup to the nurse. Nurse doesn’t expect anything. She hands the cup to the doctor...who’s already oblivious anyway. So the doctor walks back into the back room and closes the door.   Only this time he’s in the room for 3 and a half hours. 
Finally the door flies open, Doctor is making alllll kinds of hateful eye contact this time. 
Doctor walks up to the patient and says “alright you fuckin smartass here goes. Your daughters pregnant, your wife’s gotta gnarly vanereal disease...your cars about to throw a rod and if you don’t stop jerking off that fuckin tennis elbow isn’t ever going to get any better!”",Guy walks into a dr office complaining about a tennis elbow.,11

Now, I don't mind the occasional, light shake to get the pee off. But this was vigorous throbbing of his dick, so much so that his right hand was shaking his entire body. Not making this up. 

&amp;#x200B;

The guy seemed to really enjoy this as he was there for a good minute. Thought of telling him ""dude, please stop you may just cum"" coz that's how long men last. 

He smiled at me and left when he was done.",Went to the washroom at Office,0

post,chzml4,2qh72,jokes,false,1564124881,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/chzml4/there_was_a_tramp_walking/,self.jokes,," There was a tramp walking out in the country during a long winters night when he heard a girl screaming.  He turned to see a little girl struggling in the broken ice in the middle of the lake. She'd been skating and had fallen into the icy water. Without a moment's hesitation the tramp ran onto the ice and slipped and slided over to the little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and he carried her back to the road.  He took off his coat and wrapped the little girl in it and began looking for a car to flag down. A few moments later a huge chauffeur-driven limo pulled up, and who stepped out but the little girl's father - the mayor of the nearby town and a multi-millionaire.  ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" says the father after putting his daughterinto the warmth of the limo.  ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""  ""Ahem, well ..."" stammered the tramp ""...eh I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out""  ""Certainly"" says the girl's father and he pulls out his wallet.  ""Oh dear"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten dollars - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe""  ""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten dollars is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that will be plenty"".  


""Well, if you insist"" says the father - ""now what will you do with your money?""  ""Oh that's easy"" says the tramp ""I've not had a rest in 20 years. I think I'll buy myself a holiday""  ""Well good luck"" says the father, and he gets into the car and signals his chauffeur to drive home.  ""Ten Dollars"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"", and off he goes to the town, to buy himself a holiday.  He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk.  ""I'll have one holiday please!""  ""Ahem, which holiday would sir like"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.  ""Oh, any holiday I don't mind"" replied the tramp.  ""Well how much money does sir have to spend on sir's holiday?""  ""Oh lots - anything up to ten dollars""  ""TEN DOLLARS!! You'll never get a holiday for ten dollars"" says the girl incredulously.  ""Oh dear"" said the tramp, ""and I was so looking forward to a holiday - I'll probably never get another chance - isn't there anything you can do?""  ""Well I don't think so sir, but hold on and I'll check""  The girl goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.  ""Well you'll never believe it"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop.  ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten dollars""  ""Yippee"", exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it""  


The tramp takes the tickets and, shouldering his dirty old pack, he heads out the door to hitch-hike to the port where the ship is waiting.  A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Amazed at his luck and good fortune, he slings his pack over his shoulder, and marches up the gangplank.  ""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.  ""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""Super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""  Hardly believeing his eyes, the captain examines the ticket and admits that our man the tramp is correct.  ""Ahem, well O.K."", says the captain, ""But you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""  So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.  ""Psst"", says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.  ""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin""  The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship! The tramp had never in his wildest dreams imagined luxury like this.  First they went doen through the first class level:  Oriental carpets - 6"" pile.  A genuine Rembrahndt on every wall.  Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair.  24 ct gold trim everywhere.  


Then the second class:  As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep.  and so on...  3rd, 4th, 5th class,  down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with, a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.  ""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""  ""I'm glad you like it"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing...""  ""Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""  Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...  Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived....  ...and what a dive...!  Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple. Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.  ""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""  ""Eh, well I've never actually dived before"" replied the tramp.  ""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen ....""  He broke off.  


""Hey, I've an idea"", he started again.  ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""  ""It's a deal!"" says our man.  For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Then one morning the captain came to talk.  ""O.K. I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""  ""O.K."" agreed the tramp.  Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck.  Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Then the tramp turned to regard the diving board. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.  ""Well tramp"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do.""  And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie.  And the tramp began to climb....  up and up ...  up and up ...  higher and higher ...  below him the ship grew smaller ...  up and up ...  on and on ...  past a solitary albatross ...  and still higher, till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below ...  still further, till the ocean grew dim, and the earth itself began to shrink...  and higher, ever higher ...  on and on ....  higher, and higher, and on and on towards the diving board,  He climbed on top and radioed the captain .... and then...  he jumped .  


slowly at first  but speeding up  faster, and faster  and by now the earth was growing large in the distance,  the oceans and land masses grew clear,  faster, and faster...  past the albatross,  faster  double-back somersault,  and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,  hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,  Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,  ""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!""  The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...  NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!  DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!  SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!  DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!  SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!  DOWN!  DOWN!  THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!  THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!  SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!  AND DOWN THROUGH THE STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!  STILL DOWN...!  DEEPER,  DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,  TILL..........  SMASH! into into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.  Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.  Up and up, desperate, gasping....  Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.  HERO! WONDERFUL! AMAZING! BLOODY GOOD SHOW WHAT!  And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.  ""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most STUPENDOUS piece of diving I have ever seen""  The tramp blushed.  The captain went on:  ""But tell me; most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""  And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly:  ""Well you see I'm a poor tramp so you must understand...

&gt;!I've been through many a hardship in my life""!&lt;",There was a tramp walking,64

The other priest says “I’ll go to my office and get some”.

So the priest picks up two bars of soap from his office, but on his way back he hears the voices of two nuns down the hall. 

The priest, stark naked with nowhere to hide, decides to freeze in place. The nuns walk by but of course stop when they see the priest. 

“What is this?” asks the first nun. 

“Must be a new statue” says the other. 

“It’s so lifelike and detailed” marvels the first nun, as she begins to run her fingers along the “statue”.

Suddenly, the enamored nun is hit with an inexplicable urge to pull the “statue’s” third leg. 

The priest did all he could to stay frozen, but he couldn’t stop himself from dropping one of the bars of soap. 

The second nun says “why’d you do that?” 

“I don’t know,” replies the first nun, “but I think this statue might be a soap dispenser.” 

“Let me try!” exclaims the second nun. 

She too pulls the “statue’s” third leg , and sure enough, the second bar of soap is dropped. 

“It IS a soap dispenser!” says the first nun excitedly. 

She pulls again, but this time of course no soap appears. She pulls again. 

And again. 

And again. 

The second nun gives it a go.

On my first day there, I watched him enter the theater to watch the latest summer blockbuster. A few hours later, he walked out, looking a little frustrated. It was my first day, and I wanted to be helpful, so I went up to him and said ""I'm sorry, sir. Did you not enjoy the movie?"" And he replied ""The movie was great, but I've seen it five times already."" As you can imagine, I was confused. But I didn't say anything else.

The next day, I saw the same guy come to the theater. He purchased a ticket for the same movie. I said ""Sir, are you sure you wouldn't prefer to watch a different movie this time?"" But he insisted on watching it again. A few hours later he walked out. And once again, he was angry and complaining about how he'd already seen it. I shook my head in disbelief.

Wednesday, I saw the same man come in and buy yet another ticket to the same movie. I told my manager that the guy was crazy, but he said a sale is a sale. When the movie was over, me and a few others went into the theater to begin cleaning up. If we didn't have a mess before, we did now, because that same guy threw his popcorn and drink on the floor in frustration.

The next day, I expected him to show up again, and he did. He bought a ticket to the same movie. I didn't have to wait long this time. In less than half an hour, he left the theater red in the face and muttering about how he'd already seen the movie.

It was Friday. And this time, I wasn't having any of it. As soon as he walked in, I confronted him. I said ""Sir, before you buy another ticket, I want to let you know that we have plenty of other movies showing today, you might want to watch one of those instead of one you've already seen.""

He told me ""I know you have other movies. They're not as good as the one I've been watching, though."" Annoyed and confused, I asked ""What kind of person keeps complaining that they've already seen something and refuses to look at something different because it's not as good?""

And the man replied ""Someone who visits r/jokes ""

One of them, Harry started boasting about how hard he worked non-stop for 2 straight days in the field, he felt so soiled and nasty that his underwear was really messed up and sticky. The other two, James and Kent felt theirs won't be any less filthy.

So they decided on a contest, to throw their underwear onto the wall and the one whose undergarment took the longest time to slide down the wall wins.

The bartender overheard and offered to treat the winner to a month of free beer. He then helped clear one side of the walls. Everyone else stood up and started placing bets and cheering the 3 dudes.

Harry went first. He pulled out his piece. Everyone pinched their noses, and cringed. The bartender prepared his watch, getting ready to time. 8 feet away from the wall, Harry threw with all his might. That piece of filthy fabric slapped onto the wall at eye level height. It then started to slide down, ever so slowly. ""One... Two... Three..."" the crowded shouted in unison, led by the timekeeper. ""Fourteen.. Fifteen!!!!"" It took an impressive 15 seconds for Harry's masterpiece to slide to the ground!

James was next. He stepped forward with a grin. Ever so effortlessly, he removed his underwear. Everyone else waited in anticipation, likewise holding their breaths. James spun his around the finger and flick it onto the wall, similarly hitting it at eye level. The bartender started to count, ""One.. Two.. Three.."". To everyone's disbelief, James' piece didn't move an inch! After two minutes, the 3 dudes agreed let it be. James had bettered Harry's feat.

Now the crowd were on fire, wondering how Kent can outdo James. Kent looked nervous the entire night, fidgeting and scratching his butt and crotch frequently. It was his turn. It took him awhile to unleash his weapon for all to see. All eyes were onto him. Without any special move, he clumsily tossed his underwear before tripping himself. As it flew across towards the wall, everyone sensed it will not end well. It landed about 2 feet above the ground. The crowd booed in disappointment. The timekeeper started to time, reluctantly. ""One.. Two.. Three.."" Kent's underwear was still hanging there!!!! They then felt he had a fighting chance against Harry's. ""Eight.. Nine.. Ten..""

What happened next made everyone's jaw drop. By the tenth second, Kent's underwear started creeping up the wall. It eventually reached the height of James' one and nudged it off the wall.","In a rowdy bar one hot summer night,",0

Her 9-year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them and hides in the bedroom closet to watch.

The woman's husband also comes home. She puts her lover in the closet, not realizing that the little boy is in there already.
The little boy says, ""Dark in here.""

The man says, ""Yes, it is.""
Boy - ""I have a baseball.""
Man - ""That's nice.""
Boy - ""Want to buy it?""
Man - ""No, thanks.""
Boy - ""My dad's outside.""
Man - ""OK, how much?""
Boy - ""$150""
Man - ""Sold.""

In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the lover are in the closet together.

Boy - ""Dark in here.""
Man - ""Yes, it is.""
Boy - ""I have a Wilson infielder's glove.""
The lover, remembering the last time, asks the boy,""How much?""
Boy - ""$350""
Man - ""Highway robbery. Sold.""

A few days later, the father says to the boy, ""Grab your gloves, let's go outside and have a game of catch.""

The boy says, ""I can't, I sold my ball and my glove.""
The father asks, ""How much did you sell them for?""
The boy says, ""$500""
The father says, ""That's terrible to overcharge your friends like that... that is way more than those two things cost.
I'm going to take you to church and make you confess your greed.""

They go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confession booth with the Priest  to confess his sins and he closes the door.

The boy says, ""Dark in here.""
The priest says, ""Don't start that crap again, you're in my closet now.""",A woman takes,7

The woman thanks him for the info and leaves the shop, a little bitter about her own name. But she visits the well-endowed florist anyway. She steps up to the counter and pointedly says, ""I heard you are particularly...skilled in certain areas?""

He smirks. ""What is your name?"" She pouts a little and says ""Christina."" His smile falters, and he sighs and shakes his head.

Christina's heart drops. ""Well...then I'd like some flowers for my mother.""

Suddenly, he brightens up again. ""I think we can make this work."" He takes her hand and locks the shop door. 

Three hours of mind-altering sex later, she calls her mother immediately and tells her all about him and his shop, saying she may have met THE one, if she can just pin him down. Her mother is instantly smitten as well. 

The next day, Christina feels like a million bucks and swings by the original florist's shop.

""I just wanted to thank you for telling me about that gentleman! He was AMAZING.""

He smiles sheepishly. ""I suppose I should thank you too. I just got another beautiful flower for recommending you to him.""

""Really? What flower could he have possibly sent that was named after me?""

First is the brain. “It’s obvious I’m the boss. I’m the smartest and without me the body wouldn’t even know what to do.”

The hands speak up and say, “Without us the body wouldn’t be able to get food to the mouth. The body couldn’t drive, use tools, etc.”

The feet go next and say, “Well without us the body wouldn’t get anywhere. It couldn’t walk, dance, play sports.”

Each body part gets a turn giving the reasons why they are the most important and should be the boss.

Last to go is the asshole. It claims it is the boss and every other body part just laughs and makes fun of the asshole. “What do you do? You have the least important job.” So the asshole closes as tight as it can and lets nothing get by it.

After a few hours the other body parts are starting to feel weird but don’t concede that the asshole is the boss. Close to a week passes and the feet are feeling weak, the hands can’t grab things as well, and the brain can’t think clearly. Still, the asshole stays shut tight.

A few more days pass and all the other body parts can barely function at all. The body keeps falling because the feet can’t keep it up. It’s hungry because the hands can’t pick up food and the brain can’t even think straight.

Finally all the body parts concede that the asshole is the most important body part. So the asshole opens up and everything soon returns to normal for the other body parts. 

So to be the boss you don’t have to be smart, strong, or extremely useful. You just need to be an asshole.",Was reminded of my dad’s favorite joke when I saw a similar joke posted earlier today. He owns his own construction company and would tell this to everyone.,13

The Daltons were a typical suburban, white, upper-middle-class family. Mr. Dalton was the owner of a succesfull engineering firm downtown. He had a beautiful wife, two lovely children, and a sweet Mercedes in his two-door garage. The second family, the Millers, were not as financially well-off, coming from Detroit a few years earlier. They didn't have the nicest home on the block, but they were a happy family nonetheless, and Mr. Miller enjoyed his job of running the liquor store downtown.

One day, after spending some time with the Miller's son, Timmy, Mr. Daltons son, asked his father why the Millers didn't have as big as house as they did.

Mr. Dalton sighed, and decided to relay to his son, the difficulties of financial inequality.

""You see, Timmy.. Some people,"" He started, ""because of their background, education, criminal records, or anything else really, they may find it difficult to find work in order to earn money. It's just how the world is now, but that doesn't mean the Millers are any worse than we are. No, and remember don't go telling anybody either. These topics are generally not talked about with others. Understand?""

Timmy was confused. ""Not really Dad, at my age I have yet to truly grasp the complexities of financial inequality between citizens regardless of occupation. Although I understand the importance of demand in the workplace, I have yet to reach the age, or brain maturity to understand the inner-working of the corporate and economic world.""

""Excellent, my boy."" Mr. Dalton praised. ""Now run along and have an excellent Saturday afternoon!""

So Timmy went back outside and played with the Millers boy, Tiresias.

After the day had ended, and supper was brought to each families tables, the boys departed to see each other again perhaps the next day. The Daltons feasted on fine steaks, seafood, and mashed potatoes. The Millers, on the other hand, had fried chicken from the oven.

""Daddy,"" Tiresias asked with a mouthful of chicken, ""Why is it that the Millers have TWO cars? And such a lot of room in their house for activities?""

Mr. Miller sighed quietly, and prepared himself to answer the tricky questions of financial inequality that the young man had on his mind.

""Well, Tiresias,"" began the older man. ""Some people are born, they learn, they work, they start a family, everything like that. Some of us may have difficulties in life, some of us get along just fine. Some of us are critisized and unfairly keptfrom ever succeeding in the corporate world. Some of us are born lucky, to doctors, senators, many that go on to have high-paying, but stressful jobs. You see son, The Daltons are more of the latter category. Mr. Dalton is a chief engineer, and he has a lot to do at work.""

""I don't really get it."" Tiresias lamented. ""But I'll dwell on it and I think I'll get it sooner or later.""

The next day, Sunday, the Millers were preparing to go to church; meanwhile, the Daltons prepared to go to their church.

""Mom?"" Timmy pondered as they drove to church, ""Why is it that the Millers go to a different church than we do?""

Mrs. Dalton quietly sighed, and began to relate to her son what she believed. ""Well son, when we read the bible, does God tell us to go to others homes to have gathering?""

Timmy thought about it for a minute. ""I suppose not mother, in fact, the bible does say that The Lord dwelleth not in buildings of man, but that the church is Jesus inside our hearts as we listen to the word of our lord.""

""Very good,"" chimed Timmy's mother. ""Some people, however, may not read that part of the bible, and their congregations take place in others homes, because they think church buildings are not Godly do you understand?""

Timmy was confused. ""But mother, doesn't that go against the bible?""

""Yes,"" his mother said. ""But that remains between the Millers and God.""

""Okay,"" said Timmy, his head swimming with confusing information about the Millers.

""Hey, mom,"" started Tiresias as his dad drove the family to church. ""So, the Daltons go to a church building in town. Didn't worker Dennis say that we must have church in the houses of our congregation?""

Tiresias's mom sighed, as she knew the difficulties in explaining religious concepts.

""Well Tiresias, some people don't follow the word of God, and they don't have the spirit in their hearts. This can lead them down the path of Satan where they care more of the world than of God.""

Tiresias was puzzled, but accepted his mom's answer.

The next day, Monday, both boys had school to attend, and they arrived home later in the day, before supper. When Timmy came home, he did some of his homework, and had delicious mac and cheese for dinner. Tiresias, however, recieved not so warm a welcome.

Mrs. Miller sat on the lving room couch. Her eyes were red.

""What's the matter ma?"" Tiresias asked, concerned.

""Tiresias,"" his mom wept. ""your father's in prison.""

""What!?"" Screamed Tiresias. ""No that can't be true, that can't be. W-w-w-hat? w-why would they do this?""

Mrs. Miller sniffled and tried to explain to Tiresias the concept of driving under the influence, resisting arrest, and corruption in the police force.

The next day, The Daltons heard the news. Mr. and Mrs. Dalton heard it from Mrs. Miller herself, Timmy on the other hand, heard it from Tiresias at school during recess.

""Dad?"" Began Timmy, ""please don't confuse me like you always do. I'm just a kid, I don't have a lot of big words to use, and I can't keep track of too much information. Just please, why, why did they bring Mr. Miller to prison Dad? I've heard you talk about financial inequality, I heard Mom tell me about religious Christian values, but I don't understand any of it. Why Dad? Why did they take Mr. Miller to prison?""

Mr. Dalton sighed, he knew the difficulties in what he'd have to explain to Timmy. All the work he'd put in to making him understand all about the world. Timmy was young. And there were plenty of complicated things to explain in the world.

""Well boy,"" the older man started. ""Because the Millers are a bunch of fuckin' niggers.""",Two Neighbours,4

Indeed, he manages to go months without stepping on any ducks. One day though, St.Peter appears with the most gorgeous woman the guy has ever laid eyes on. She's tall, curvaceous, tanned and extremely sexy.

Eventually, after she had grown up and was married, she realized that the teasing actually made her stronger, and that having a unique name was actually a good thing.

So, when her first child was born, she talked her husband into naming their daughter 'Love,' knowing that while the child might be teased, she would grow up stronger and thank her one day. 

As expected, when Love started school, she endured much of the same teasing that Darling did, all because of her strange name.

One day, Love simply had had enough. She came home from school very angry and screamed at her dad, asking why her parents gave her such a stupid name.

The husband, being a good man, took the blame of naming her to protect his wife and apologized.

In a fit of rage, Love shot him with her dart gun and ran away.

Minutes later, Darling came home and saw her husband lying on the ground.

""Omg, what happened?!"" she asked, running to him.

He waved her closer, and whispered, ""Shot with the dart, and you're to blame. Darling, you gave Love a bad name.",Repost number 582: A girl named Darling had a particularly rough childhood because of her uncommon name.,5

The water was churning and splashing everywhere. Both Brian and the crocodile were screaming and raising hell.

Finally, after what seemed like an age, Brian strangled the crocodile and let it float to the top of the pool like a dead goldfish.

An exhausted Brian wearily climbed out of the pool with everybody staring at him in disbelief.

The millionaire said, ""Well, Brian, I reckon I owe you a million dollars then.""

""Nah, you all right boss, I don't want it,"" said Brian.

So the millionaire said ""Man, I have to give you something. You won the bet. How about half a million bucks?""

""No thanks, I don't want it,"" Brian insisted.

The millionaire said, ""Come on, I insist on giving you something. That was amazing. How about a new Porsche, a Rolex and some stock options?""

Once again, Brian said, ""No.""

Confused, the rich man asked, ""Well Brian, then what do you want?""

""I want the bastard who pushed me in,"" said Brian.","A multi-millionaire living in Darwin, Australia, decided to throw a party and invited all of his buddies and neighbours.",11

&amp;#x200B;

Nick, the Dragon Slayer, obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death, should he try to touch them, but he had to try.

&amp;#x200B;

One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,  Nathan 

the Erudite lawyer, the King's chief adviser. Nathan thought about this and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause, Nick readily agreed to the scheme.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, Nathan got a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.

&amp;#x200B;

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident,  Nathan informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and Nathan advised  that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

&amp;#x200B;

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Nathan then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

&amp;#x200B;

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Nathan demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Nathan could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, Nathan slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.

I planned an entire night to make her feel special and such, and as I was preparing myself to propose, my roommate Joey came crashing through the door. He tripped and fell on our glass coffee table with his face, sending shards of glass flying everywhere. It was a huge mood kill, so I was going to postpone my plans to propose. 

He had also gotten a big shard of glass in his eye, making him completely blind in that one eye. Now, I didn't even know him that well; I didn't even know where he was from, but I agreed to take him to the hospital, where he got this cotton eyepad over his now blind eye. 

Then, suddenly, a few weeks later, he disappeared with my girlfriend. Apparently, they had bonded over the course of his injuries and recovery, and they just left without saying anything.

The mathematician was brought back to his cell and started to ponder the sentence. ""Suppose next Monday comes and I'm still alive. He will have to execute me that day, but I would be expecting it. So it has to be before Monday. So Sunday is the last possible day. But if Sunday comes, by the same reasoning, I would be expecting it. Aha! So by induction, I can show that there is no day when he can execute me without contradicting his sentence - he's just toying with me, one logician to another.
