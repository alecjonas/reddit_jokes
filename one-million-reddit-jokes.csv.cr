The ham grew legs, not like human legs but tiny pieces of itself that held its weight and allowed it to 'walk'. The man was flabbergasted. He was thrilled about his new found success, he could change the world..somehow. He put the ham aside, and decided to up the scale. He made an entire sandwich, bread, lettuce, ham, cheese and the condiments too. A delicious sandwich was ready to be filled with life. He pressed ON, and boom just like the ham, the sandwich had grown legs. At this point the man had grown hungry, being so busy with his invention he had forgotten to eat. He grabbed the sandwich and thought how a sandwich that was alive would taste. He raised it up to his mouth but the sandwich somehow knew what was about to happen and kicked him in the face. He dropped it in shock and the sandwich ran toward the window and jumped straight out onto the pavement below. It picked itself up, rebuilt itself, leaving a small mess of condiments.

“Not quite”, says Mr. Trump, “that would be an accident.”

A little girl then raises her hand: “If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.”

“I’m afraid not,” explained the president. “That’s what we would call a great loss.”

The room goes silent. Trump searches the room. “Isn’t there someone else here who can give me an example of a tragedy? “

Finally, at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: “If Air Force One, carrying you Mr. President, was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.”

“Fantastic!” exclaimed Mr. Trump. “That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?”

post,d1n4rw,2qh72,jokes,false,1568010469,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/d1n4rw/hide_and_seek/,self.jokes,,"    Stacy, John, and I have been friends ever since we were children. From that point, we were practically inseparable. Every day after school we would hang out for hours walking around the block, playing tag, and hide and seek.

    One day, it was my turn to be the seeker. I had a tough time trying to find them, but I eventually found John hidden behind some bushes in our neighbor’s house. Stacy, however, could not find. Ten minutes passed. Twenty. Thirty. She had found the best hiding spot ever.

    We gave up and we’re yelling her name now, screaming it down the block, but no response. We decided to go to Stacy’s house to see if she went there. The backdoor was slid open, and we knew we were always welcome in as our families were all very good friends, so John went to the kitchen and I went to the living room. John found nothing in the kitchen, and Stacy’s mom was in the living room. The movie IT was playing on the television.

    John asked me, “what’s going on in there?”

    I tell him, “Stacy’s mom has got IT going on.”

This bloke walks into the poshest restaurant in town and says, ""Where's the god damn, mother fucking Manager you cock sucking arse wipe."" The waiter is naturally taken aback and replies, ""Excuse me, sir, but could you please refrain from using that sort of language in here, I will get the manager as soon as I can.""

The manager comes over and the bloke asks, ""Are you the chicken fucking manager of this bastard joint?"". ""Yes, sir, I am,"" replies the manager, ""and I would prefer it if you could refrain from speaking such profanities in this, a private restaurant"".

""Fuck off!"" replies the bloke. ""And where's the fucking piano?""

""Pardon?"" says the manager.

""Fucking deaf as well are we? You little piece of sniveling shit, show us your pissing piano.""

""Ahhhh,"" replies the manager. ""You've come about the pianist's job,"" and shows the bloke to the piano. ""Can you play any blues?""

""Of course I fucking can,"" and the bloke proceeds to play the most inspiring and beautiful sounding honky tonk blues that the manager has ever heard.

""Why, that's superb, what's it called?""

""I want to fuck your missus on the sofa but the springs keep hurting my knob,"" replies the pianist.

The manager is highly upset by the bloke's language but offers him the job on condition that he doesn't introduce any of his songs or talk to any of the customers.

This arrangement works well for a couple of months until one night, sitting opposite him, is the most gorgeous blonde he has ever laid his eyes on. She's wearing an almost see through dress, her tits are almost falling out the top and the skimpy little 'G' string she's wearing is riding up the crack of her arse.

He approaches, and after thanking the captain for the party, offers to refresh his drink. The captain takes him up on his offer, and asks for another Coke. The ensign searches for the line serving Coke, and after a long wait, learns someone else grabbed the last one. Defeated, he returns to his captain to give him the bad news.

""It's ok"", replies the captain, ""see if you can find a Sprite."". Once again, the ensign takes off across the boat, and finally finds the line serving cans of Sprite. However, as before, by the time he gets to the front of the line, the Sprite is gone. Nervous, he returns again to his captain with bad news.

""That's too bad"", says the captain, ""but I really wanted something sweet to drink.""

As he's failed his captain three times, the ensign is extremely anxious to give him the bad news. 

He approaches the captain, who notices a lack of beverage in the ensign's hands. Frustrated, the captain asks why the ensign has come back again empty handed. The ensign timidly replies, ""I'm sorry sir, I've searched this entire sub, but couldn't find the punch line"".",The Captain and the Ensign,2

""I am going to eat you for lunch,"" said the fox.

""Wait,"" replied the rabbit, ""You should at least wait a few days.""

""Oh yeah? Why should I wait?""

""Well, I am just finishing my thesis on 'The Superiority of Rabbits over Foxes and Wolves.'""

""Are you crazy? I should eat you right now! Everybody knows that a fox will always win over a rabbit.""

""Not really, not according to my research. If you like, you can come into my hole and read it for yourself. If you are not convinced, you can go ahead and have me for lunch.""

""You really are crazy!"" But since the fox was curious and had nothing to lose, it went with the rabbit. The fox never came out.

A few days later the rabbit was again taking a break from writing and sure enough, a wolf came out of the bushes and was ready to set upon her.

""Wait!"" yelled the rabbit, ""you can't eat me right now.""

""And why might that be, my furry appetizer?""

""I am almost finished writing my thesis on 'The Superiority of Rabbits over Foxes and Wolves.'""

The wolf laughed so hard that it almost lost its grip on the rabbit.

""Maybe I shouldn't eat you; you really are sick ... in the head. You might have something contagious.""

""Come and read it for yourself; you can eat me afterward if you disagree with my conclusions."" So the wolf went down into the rabbit's hole ... and never came out.

The rabbit finished her thesis and was out celebrating in the local lettuce patch. Another rabbit came along and asked, ""What's up? You seem very happy.""

""Yup, I just finished my thesis.""

""Congratulations. What's it about?""

""'The Superiority of Rabbits over Foxes and Wolves.'""

""Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.""

""Oh yes. Come and read it for yourself.""

So together they went down into the rabbit's hole. As they entered, the friend saw the typical graduate abode, albeit a rather messy one after writing a thesis. The computer with the controversial work was in one corner.

And to the right there was a pile of fox bones, on the left a pile of wolf bones.

And in the middle was a large, well-fed lion.

The moral of the story: The title of your thesis doesn't matter. The subject doesn't matter. The research doesn't matter.

All that matters is who your advisor is",One sunny day a rabbit came out of her hole in the ground to enjoy the fine weather.,849

So the boy's father walked up the street to the house where the lady lived and found her out in the yard calmly planting petunias. He introduced himself as the father of the boy to whom she had sold a Porsche for fifteen dollars and demanded to know why she did it.

""Well,"" she said, ""this morning I got a phone call from my husband.

As I looked up, I noticed she was wearing a low cut blouse with cleavage to die for... ""I'm okay I think,"" I replied as I pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.

She said, “Get in and I’ll take you home so I can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head.”

""That's nice of you,"" I answered, ""but I don't think my wife will like me doing that!""

""Oh, come now, I’m a nurse,"" she insisted. ""I need to see if you have any more scrapes and then treat them properly.""

Well, she was really pretty and very persuasive. Being sort of shaken and weak, I agreed, but repeated, ""I'm sure my wife won't like this.""

We arrived at her place which was just a few miles away and, after a couple of cold beers and the bandaging, I thanked her and said, ""I feel a lot better, but I know my wife is going to be really upset so I'd better go now.""

""Don't be silly!"" she said with a smile, while unbuttoning her blouse exposing the most beautiful set of boobs I’ve ever seen. ""Stay for a while. She won't know anything. By the way, where is she?""

- What?! I'm dead? It can't be! Bring me back to Earth, now!  
- It's not that easy. You can either come back as a chicken, or a dog.

- Bring me back as a dog. - exclaims the man.  
  
Suddenly, the man appears as a chicken on a farm. Another chicken approaches him and says:  
- You must be the new chicken that St Peter told me about.  
- Oh yes that's me.  
- So, how do you like being a chicken?  
- Well, I feel like my rump is going to explode!  
The other chicken shrugs with his wings and says:  
- You got to lay an egg to get some relief.  
- And how am I supposed to do that?!  
- Cackle two times and then push as hard as you can.  
  
The man-chicken cackles and pushes as hard as he can.

They beg in different areas of London ...

Habib begs just as long as Ali does, but only collects £2 to £3 every day.

Ali brings home a suitcase FULL of £10 notes, drives a Mercedes, lives in a mortgage-free house and has a lot of money to spend.

Habib asks Ali :-
'I work just as long and hard as you do but how is it that you bring home a suitcase full of £10 notes every day?'

Ali says, 'Look at your sign, what does it say'?

Habib's sign reads
'I have no work, a wife and 6 kids to support'.

Ali says No wonder you only get £2- £3

Habib says... 'So what does your sign say'?

Ali shows Habib his sign....
It reads,

'I only need another £10 to move back to Pakistan'.

F: Go on, ask him anything.

M: Alright dog, tell me about yourself.

D: Well, when I was a young pup, I always wanted to serve my country. So, as soon as I could, I enlisted with the airport security as a sniffer dog. I was real good at my job too, got a few promotions and turned some heads. Eventually, the US army picked me up as a bomb-sniffer dog, and I helped prevent tragedies all across the country and oversees. After a while I retired, found myself a nice girl, had a few pups, and finally came to this farm to live out my golden years.

The man is stunned. He says to the farmer:

Lucas agreed to give him whatever amount he wanted but he wanted to fondle with those titties. 

The next day, the doctor snuck into the queen's room as she was bathing and put some itchy powder in her bra. 

The queen started getting an itch on her breasts and it wouldn't stop so she told the king about it and the king turned to the doctor about it. The doctor said that her itch would stop by the saliva of general Lucas only. 

So the king summoned Lucas and ordered him to lick her breasts. Lucas did so happily licking each and every part of her boobs.
The doctor had given Lucas the antidote to put in his mouth before he would start.

The queen was eased and Lucas was satisfied. The doctor asked for his fees but Lucas refused thinking that the doctor couldn't complain to the king or court.

But the doctor wanted revenge so he took the same itchy powder and put it in the king's underpants as he was bathing.

Satan suddenly appears and says “Oh, but there is! Withstand ten whippings from my trusty whip here and you’re free to go. I’ll even let you pick something to cover your back with”

The men let out a cheer. This wouldn’t be so hard.

The first man steps up and observes his surroundings. Finally, he picks a sturdy looking boulder to place on his back. “Ready,” he says.

Satan raises his whip and yells, “ONE!”

CRACK

The boulder immediately splits in half.

“Aw fuck this,” says the first man. “I’ll just stay.”

Satan smirks and asks, “Who’s next?”

The second man steps up and, without picking any protection, gets in position.

“Are you sure about that?” asks Satan, to which the man replies with

“I have trained my mind and body to ignore any unnecessary pain. I need no protection.”

“Whatever you say, pal.” Satan raises his arm and yells, “ONE!”

CRACK

The man slightly flinches, his pain evident, but he remains upright.

Annoyance flashes across Satan’s face. He raises his arm again and shouts, “TWO!”

CRACK

Again, the man remains upright, all the way up to the tenth whipping.

The man gets up, weary but happy. Satan looks furious and says, “Whatever, goodjob. You, third guy, you’re next. What are you picking?”

The third man takes in his surroundings, lays his eyes on his choice and says, “I’m gonna pick the second guy.”",Three men go to hell and they're pissed..,44
