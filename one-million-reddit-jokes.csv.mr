He soon realized she was heading straight towards his seat. As fate would have it, she took the seat right beside his. Eager to strike up a conversation he blurted out,

""Business trip or pleasure?""

She turned, smiled and said, 

""Business.""

I'm going to the Annual Nymphomaniacs of America Convention in Boston.""

He swallowed hard.

Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs.

Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked,

""What's your business role at this convention?""

""Lecturer,"" she responded.

""I use information that I have learned from my personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.""

""Really?"" he said. 

""And what kind of myths are there?"" ""

""Well"", she explained,

""One popular myth is that African-American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait.

""Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Jewish descent who are the best.

I have also discovered that the lover with absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck.""

Suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed.

""I'm sorry,"" she said,

""I shouldn't really be discussing all of this with you. I don't even know your name...""

""Tonto,"" the man said ,

""Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me Bubba.""",Nymphomaniacs convention,3

As luck would have it, there was a station just down the street. She walked to the station to borrow a can with enough gas to start the car and drive to the station for a fill up. 

The attendant regretfully told her that the only gas can he owned had just been loaned out, but if she would care to wait he was sure it would be back shortly. 

Since the nun was on the way to see a patient she decided not to wait and walked back to her car. After looking through her car for something to carry to the station to fill with gas, she spotted a bedpan she was taking to the patient. Always resourceful, she carried it to the station, filled it with gasoline, and carried it back to her car. 

As she was pouring the gas into the tank of her car, two men walked by. One of them turned to the other and said, ""Now that is what I call faith!""

The second woman sneers, rolls her eyes, and says ""Fuck you!""
The third belle shakes her head, snorts, and says, ""Fuck you!"" 
The fourth lady tilts her head, considers, and replies, ""That's nice.""

A little while later, the second woman flashes the large diamonds on her fingers, playing with a pearl necklace. ""D'you see the jewelry *my* husband bought me because he *LOOOOOOVES* me?""

The first woman scoffs, ""Fuck you!""
The third belle makes a disgusted face and echoes, ""Fuck you!""
The fourth lady frowns a moment, shrugs, and says, ""That's nice.""

Not to be outstripped, the third Southern Belle motions to the house behind them, and the land around it, and says, ""Well, D'you see this here huge mansion-house my husband bought me because he *LOOOOOOOVES* me?""

The first and second women, truly disgusted, say, ""Fuck you!""
The fourth nods slowly, and says, ""That's nice.""

Finally irritated with the their friend's reserved responses, the first woman asks the fourth, ""Well? What did YOUR husband buy you to show he loves you?""

His son replied, ""This isn't a nail, dad, it's a worm. I put these chemicals on it and it became hard as a rock.""

His son quite naturally said, ""Sure, why not.''

The next day his son went into the garage to see his new car. Parked in the garage was a brand new Mercedes.

The certificate paid for a visit to a medicine man living on a nearby reservation who was rumored to have a wonderful cure for erectile dysfunction. After being persuaded, the man drove to the reservation, handed his certificate to the medicine man, and wondered what he was in for. The old man slowly, methodically produced a potion, handed it to him, and with a grip on his shoulder, warned: ""This is a powerful medicine, and it must be respected. You take only a teaspoonful, and then say, '1-2-3'. When you do that, you will become more manly than you have ever been in your life, and you can perform as long as you want."" The man was encouraged. As he walked away, he turned and asked, ""How do I stop the medicine from working?""
 
 ""Your partner must say, '1-2-3-4',"" the medicine man responded, ""but, when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon."" Eager to see if it worked, the man went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine, and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom. When she came in, he took off his clothes and said, ""1-2-3!"" Immediately he was the manliest of men. His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes, and then she asked, ""What was the 1-2-3-for?""

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.


Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""

This morning, around 7:00 AM, I went for my stroll around the marina, I noticed a man running down the dock toward me dressed in Islamic clothing who shouted ""Allah be praised!"" and ""Death to all Infidels!"", when suddenly he tripped and fell into the water.

He was struggling to stay afloat because of the weight of all the explosives he was carrying, and I knew that If he didn't get help he would surely drown!

Being a responsible citizen, and abiding by the moral code that requires a person to help those in distress, I contacted the Police, the Coast Guard, Homeland Security and even the Fire Department!

It is now 11:00 AM, the terrorist has drowned, and none of the authorities have responded. I'm starting to think I just wasted four stamps.

""These Bitches and Bastards!"", Johnny ran out and asked, ""Daddy what are bitches and bastards?""
""Oh that's a nice way of saying ladies and gentleman.""

So Johnny went back to his room and played with his LEGO's until it was about bedtime. From across the house he heard his mother yell, ""Put your penis in my vagina!""

Johnny walked into his parents' room, ""mommy? What is a penis and vagina?""
""Oh Johnny that's just a kind way to say coats and hats!""

The morning of thanksgiving, Johnny walked into the kitchen and heard his mom yell ""Fuck!"",
""Mommy what's fuck mean?"" 
""That just means I'm cutting the turkey."" She replied.
""Shit!"" Johnny rushed to the bathroom,
""Daddy what does shit mean?""
""Oh that's just a new shaving cream I'm using!""

So later that day, the guests finally arrive and Little Johnny answers the door, ""Hello bitches and bastards, can I take your penises and vaginas and hang them on the coat rack?"" An elderly man leans down,
 ""Young man where are your parents?!""
""Well my mom just got done fucking the turkey and my dads wiping the shit off his face.""

The family had two twins who were both seniors in my class, Ving and Ling. Ving and his sister Ling were quiet to start off with, but eventually I made good friends with Ving. After talking to him for a few weeks he revealed to me that he absolutely abhorred his name, and that he'd do almost anything to figure out how to get it changed. I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said

""Lee, like Bruce Lee or some shit.""

I was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework. Ling overheard us and chimed in,

""If you do that, father will disown you as our child. That name has been in our family line for generations.""

Ving never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan. The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall. After we arrived, he had gotten the name-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change. I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice. Tears began to stream down his face. He finally decided that he was gonna have to cancel his request, and Ling looked relieved. The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancellation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her. Suddenly, A short asian man with neon shorts, ray-bans, and an american flag t-shirt bursted into the room. Ving turned in awe and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks.

""D-D-Dad?""

With a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son.

""Don't stop, be Lee, Ving.

Hold on the that fee, Ling""

The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He goes into a deep depression and stays locked up drinking for almost two weeks. Finally, he breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""

post,6wkyv6,2qh72,jokes,false,1503941716,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6wkyv6/a_cowboy_named_bud/,self.jokes,," A cowboy named Bud was overseeing his
 herd  in a remote mountainous pasture in
 Montana when  suddenly a brand-new BMW
 advanced toward him out of a cloud of dust. The 
 driver, a young man in a Brioni® suit, Gucci® shoes,
 RayBan® sunglasses and  YSL® tie, leaned out the
 window and asked the cowboy, ""If I tell you
 exactly  how many cows and calves you have in your
 herd, will you give me a calf?""                       
       
 Bud looks at the man, who obviously is
 a  yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd
 and calmly answers, ""Sure,  why
 not?""                        
         
 The yuppie parks his car, whips out
 his  Dell® notebook computer, connects it to his Apple
 i phone, and surfs to a NASA  page on the Internet,
 where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix
 on  his location which he then feeds to another NASA
 satellite that scans the area  in an
 ultra-high-resolution photo.                       
         
 The young man then opens the digital
 photo  in Adobe Photoshop® and exports it to an image
 processing facility in Hamburg, 
 Germany.                     
       
  Within seconds, he receives an email on
 his  Apple iPad® that the image has been processed and
 the data stored. He then  accesses an MS-SQL® database
 through an ODBC connected Excel® spreadsheet with 
 email on his Galaxy S5® and, after a few minutes, receives
 a response.                    
                              
 Finally, he prints out a
 full-color,  150-page report on his hi-tech,
 miniaturized HP LaserJet® printer, turns to the 
 cowboy and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and
 calves.""                     
                              
 ""That's right. Well, I guess
 you can take  one of my calves,"" says
 Bud.                         
                              
 He watches the young man select one of
 the  animals and looks on with amusement as the young
 man stuffs it into the trunk  of his
 car.                         
        
 Then Bud says to the young man,
 ""Hey, if I  can tell you exactly what your
 business is, will you give me back my
 calf?""                       
 
 The young man thinks about it for a
 second  and then says, ""Okay, why
 not?""                        
         
 ""You're a Congressman for
 the  U.S. Government"", says
 Bud.                         
                                
 ""Wow! That's correct,""
 says the yuppie, “but  how did you guess
 that?""                       
                               
 ""No  guessing required.""
 answered the cowboy. ""You showed up here even
 though  nobody called you; you want to get paid for an
 answer I already knew, to a  question I never asked.
 You used millions of dollars’ worth of equipment trying 
 to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you
 don't know sh*t about  how working people make a
 living - or about cows, for that matter. This is a herd of
 sheep.”

So the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of accommodations and starts designing and building improvements.

After a while, they’ve got air-conditioning and flush toilets, escalators, elevators and so on ... and the engineer is a pretty popular guy.

One day, God calls Satan on the telephone.

""So, how's it going down there in hell?"" God says.

""Hey, things are going great. We've got air-conditioning and flush toilets and escalators. There's no telling what our engineer is going to come up with next!"" Satan says.

""What? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake — he should have never gotten down there. Send him back immediately!"" God says.

""No way! I like having an engineer on the staff — I'm keeping him!"" Satan says.

""Send him back up here or I'll sue!"" God says.

Satan laughs uproariously and answers:

Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them. The fisherman replied that it only took a little while. The American then asked why didn't he stay out longer and catch more fish. The fisherman said he had enough to support his family's immediate needs.

The American then asked, ""But what do you do with the rest of your time?""

The fisherman said, ""I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, señor.""

The American scoffed. ""I am a Wharton MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then L.A., and eventually New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.""

The fisherman asked, ""But how long will this all take?""

To which the American replied, ""Fifteen or 20 years.""

""But what then?""

The American laughed and said, ""That's the best part. When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions.""

""Millions? Then what?""

The first does a total makeover. She goes to a fancy beauty salon, gets her hair done, new makeup; buys several new outfits and dresses up very nicely for the man. She tells him that she has done this to be more attractive for him because she loves him so much.

The man was impressed.

The second goes shopping to buy the man gifts. She gets him a new set of golf clubs, some new gizmos for his computer, and some expensive clothes. As she presents these gifts, she tells him that she has spent all the money on him because she loves him so much..

Again, the man is impressed.

The third invests the money in the stock market She earns several times the $5,000. She gives him back his $5,000 and reinvests the remainder in a joint account. She tells him that she wants to save for their future because she loves him so much.

Obviously, the man was impressed.

And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense."" So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. The little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father having sex with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, ""Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now.""
