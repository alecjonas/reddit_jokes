First of all, he walked everywhere barefoot which made his feet very tough. 

Secondly his diet was completely void of calcium sources which led to osteoporosis.

He was also a very spiritual man., and some might say he had supernatural powers. 

Lastly, and probably the least known trivia about him was he abhorred brushing his teeth.


When his attending physician was asked for a summary of his health,  the answer was none too obvious.

Lucky for him, along comes this cow, who sees him and feels sorry for him. So, she lifts her tail, and SPLASHH! Drops this steaming hot cow pile right on him.

So the little birdy is nice and warm again. But he still ain't happy and keeps going ""be-beep, be-beep, be-beep, be-beep, be-beep, be-beep""! Louder than ever! 

Mean old coyote hears him and comes a-running. He reaches out his paw, and pulls him out of the cow pile. He brushes the dirt off him real nice, and then... 

Swallows the birdy down in one go! 

The moral of the story is: the folks that throw dirt on ya, aren't always trying to hurt ya. And the folks pulling you out of a jam aren't always trying to help ya.

But the main point is: when you're up your nose in shit, keep your mouth shut!",You ever heard the story about the little birdy? My grandpa used to tell it to me.,2

He asks the bartender, ""Hey what's with that pot o' gold behind the bar there?""  


The bartender replies, ""Oh that's the reward for a contest that's, dare I say, probably impossible!""  


The man then asks, ""Well, what is the contest?""  


The bartender says, ""Well the contest is to make my horse laugh.""  


The man quickly says, ""Hell, I can do that no problem! I just need you all to leave the bar for a moment while I work my magic.""  


The bartender doesn't believe him but decides to let him try and gathers up all of the patrons and leaves the bar. A few minutes later the man calls everyone back in. The bartender is beside himself, the horse is not only laughing he is pounding his hooves on the floor of the bar in fits of uncontrollable laughter.   


The bartender has no choice and gives the man the pot of gold.  


A few weeks later the man comes back to the bar and spies yet another pot of gold. He asks the bartender how to win this pot of gold.  


The bartender replies, ""Well this time you have to make my horse cry!""  


The man stands up and quickly replies, ""Hell that will be even easier! Bring in the horse, but same as last time you all have to leave while I work my magic.""  


The bartender agrees and he rounds everyone up and leaves the bar again. Not even two minutes later and the man in the bar beckons everyone back inside.  


The bartender can't believe it. His horse is crying and is downright depressed looking.  


The bartender looks at the man and says, ""Okay, you won my pot o' gold again, but before I give it to you, you have to tell me what you did!""  


The man looks at the bartender and a smile comes across his face as he tells him, "" Well, it was easy really. The first time I told your horse that my dick was bigger then his, the second time I proved it."" ",Lame Joke: A guy walks into a bar....,7

Instantly, Justin becomes a shark. Horrified, Christian swims away, afraid his former friend might eat him. As time passes, Christian continues to avoid Justin, leaving the shrimp-turned-maneater lonely and frustrated. So when he bumps into the cod again, he begs the mysterious fish to change him back. Lo and behold, Justin is turned back into a prawn. With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes, he swims back to the reef to seek out Christian. As he approaches, he shouts out: “It’s me, Justin, your old friend. I’ve changed… I’ve found Cod. I’m a prawn again, Christian.”

His name was George.  He was in the market for a fine horse, a quick horse, and one with stamina and perseverance.  A horse to explore with.

The horse--The horse was absolutely ideal--he was young, he was fast, deferential, and with nerves of steel.  The temperament of this animal is something that most human beings work toward their whole lives and never achieve.  This horse was named Bellybutton.  George immediately contacted the seller.

The seller--his name was Fred.  Fred was a good man, and he had Tourette's syndrome.  It was well-managed, but Fred would still allow tics at opportune times, and one of these times was while riding his horse.  They'd be out on the pasture, and Fred would tic ""What!"" and the horse would go left--""HHHeH!?"" and they'd hang a right.  ""JOLLY RANCHER"" brought them to a stop, and ""JESUSCHRIST"" would set Bellybutton off at a mad gallop.

Fred's back was broken in an auto accident several months ago, and he'll never ride again.  But he loves Bellybutton and he doesn't want to deprive his friend of those hours spent outdoors.

So it is that in a flurry of introductions and explanations, George made the acquaintance of Bellybutton.  Fred and George spoke at length about Fred's symptoms, and George agreed that he would continue to communicate with Bellybutton in this way.

George and Bellybutton are out enjoying one of their first rides.  It's incredible.  For the first time since owning Bellybutton, George decides to go nuclear--he sees open land ahead and he gleefully yells ""JESUSCHRIST"" and Bellybutton TAKES OFF!

There's no comparison.  Imagine a drag racer, except that it's pounding your pelvis into your neck.  George didn't realise but he's not ready for this at all!  He's panicking, he's slipping from the saddle--this horse is orders of magnitude more athletic than George is, and then approaching in the distance--the darkness of an abyss darker than where George is headed--A Fucking Cliff.

Now, Bellybutton probably saw it too but as we've talked about he's a persevering horse and he wants to prove his stamina to his new owner.  Bellybutton is trying to impress middle management.

But most importantly, George sees it.  He sees the telltale shadow which whispers doom!  And George is thinking ""oh WHAT was the term for stop!?""  He can't recall it.  He's trying to stay in the saddle for fuck's sake.  He can't remember.  What random term stops the horse?  ""BLOWFLY!?""  The horse runs.  ""BROKEN ARMS!?""  Bellybutton continues forward!  ""SUBMARINE!  JOLLYRANCHER!!!!""

Bellybutton digs his hooves in, but they slide.  They slide on the gravel and dust toward this canyon, and they're not slowing down.  But somehow there's a patch of moisture just before the edge of the drop and Bellybutton's hooves dig in--George and Bellybutton come to a complete halt merely inches from the edge of the precipice.

George, his palms sweaty, with piss running down his legs and shit in his pants already takes a deep breath.

""JesusCHRIST!""

Horse: Reach up and grab hold of my ‘thing’.

So the man trys his luck. He whispers in the horse's ear and the horse begins laughing. So the man picks up the bucket and walks out with his winnings.

A week later the man comes back to the same bar and the horse is still laughing, with a new bucket of money next to him. So the man goes back to the bartender and asks about the horse again. The bartender tells him that whatever he said to the horse, the horse found hilarious and hasn't stopped laughing about it. The new bet was to get the horse to stop laughing, without hurting it of course. 

So the man goes up to the horse, makes a few gestures and the horse stops laughing. He proceeds to walk out with the new bucket of money, but the bartender stops him. 

""Hey, buddy, before you go. I gotta know what you said to the horse to make him laugh, and more importantly what you did to make him stop.""

The man replies, ""To make him laugh, I told him my penis was bigger than his. To make him stop...I showed it to him.""",Horse and bucket,7

Eventually, their king became frustrated and called a meeting of the tribe's elders. He said he wanted them to figure out a way he could enjoy his wealth, and stay within traditional guidelines.

After much consideration, the elders suggested he build a magnificent throne. When he objected there was not enough room in his hut for a throne, the elders suggested he call in an engineer to solve the problem.

Soon, the king's tiny hut was rigged with an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys. He could lower the huge throne for use during the day, and at night, he could haul the throne up, and lower his bed. This was truly the best of both worlds for the king.

Unfortunately, after a few months of constant use, the ropes frayed, and one night, the throne slipped and came crashing down on the king, killing him.

The wise men of the island recognized a lesson in this experience and added to the lore of their people this statement: ""People who live in grass houses should not stow thrones.""

After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away"". The distressed woman wailed ""Are you sure?"" ""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead"" replied the vet.

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something"".

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck"".

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman. The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150"".

He called the local vets so they could test the crows, as he suspected there must be some kind of avian flu that was killing them all.

The vets tested the crows and discovered that they had not died due to any disease, and they had in fact been hit by motor vehicles. The vets referred the dead crows to motor vehicle experts for further testing.

The experts tested the paint residue that was left on the crows and came to a very strange conclusion: every single crow had been killed by a motorbike, and not a single one by a car. They contacted an ornithologist, who gave them the answer to the puzzle of the 200 dead crows: 

Crows, as a species, like to feed in groups. At feeding time, the ""murder"" of crows will swoop down and begin feeding, and one crow will stay in the air to be a look out. Now, the reason for the bizarre skew of crow-killing vehicles was simple:

Look out crows were very good at saying ""CAWR"", but could not say ""MOTORBIKE"".",200 dead crows.,2

The pastor said, ""Your sermon on Sunday is about the Ten Commandments.  What you should do is emphasize 'Thou Shalt Not Steal.'  Really bring the point home.  Perhaps the thief will have an attack of conscience and return the bike.""

The young priest thought that was good advice, and agreed to do exactly that.  But when Sunday came around, the pastor listened to his sermon, and didn't notice any particular emphasis on the commandment against theft.  The pastor called the young priest aside after Mass and said, ""I thought you were going to emphasize 'Thou Shalt Not Steal'.  Don't you want your bike returned?""

The young priest said, ""There was no need, father.  When I got to the one about 'Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery', I remembered where I left my bicycle.""

A few steps through the door and I was greeted by a petit partygoer with flashing lights in her hair, she said something but I couldn't hear her over the DJ, but I wasn't really interested in what she had to say. My throat clenched at the through of something so sickly sweet, that I shoved right past her. 

Down the winding foyer, party men and party women of all shapes and sizes yelled and danced over the balcony, dripping nectar from their red solo cups as it fell into my hair. I noticed my friend Matt from across the room after stepping out of the foyer, he knew where I could find a drink, he's the one who could save me from this drought. 

""Hey Matt!"" I yelled in anticipation. We were barely five feet away from each other, yet it's as if he couldn't hear me.

""YO, MATT!"" This time he heard me, but only the sound that came out of my mouth as his face showed utter delight in my presence, but confusion as to what a said. His reaction was comparable to winning $20,000 on a scratcher ticket, only to realize you owe $60,000 in student loans.

I made a drinking motion with my hand  and threw my arms up in the air to signal that I was indeed thirsty but lacking the knowledge on how to find a drink.

A streak of light from one of the disco balls illuminated Matt's left hand to reveal yet another solo cup, something I have longed for since I entered the house.

He put his arm around my shoulder and began to lead the way, hoping he would take me to the destination I have sought. 

One step after the other, I kept counting. 

10. 

20. 

30. 

40. 

50. 

It's as if this house went on forever.

We greeted a few of our other friends along the way, each word out of Matt's mouth was a second in eternity I couldn't bear. 

60.

70.

80.

There was a breach in the crowd to reveal the tops of upside down cups, stacked together so beautifully I could almost hear God screaming at me, invoking a divine pleasure so pure that I simply couldn't contain myself.

90.

100.

Just as I arrived into the kitchen, I couldn't help but notice a group of people waiting to serve themselves. I laughed in defeat, my eyes swelled as I had been waiting for this moment for practically all of my life. There were at least 15 people waiting for a drink, for a sip of the poison of their choosing. If only I could be so grossly inebriated.

I had finally arrived at the punch line. ",I was at a party the other night.,3

It was of this old, grizzled investigator trying to solve a mass murder case. The problem was, he couldn’t find any of the bodies at the murder scene. 

He turns up to the scene of the crime, and everything that would show a fight to the death is there, blood spattered on walls... but no body. Every time. 

Then they start turning up, strange tasting meats in stews at inns, fertiliser that just works too well. 

In the end, the murderer was caught, but died in the struggle. The investigator never figured out how the murderer spread the bodies across the city and hid them so well. 

The mysterious case was enough to keep you watching episode after episode.

With the worst premonition he opened the envelope with trembling hands and read the letter.

Dear Dad: It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.

I have been finding real passion with Stacy and she is so nice.

But I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am. But it's not only the passion...Dad she's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy.

She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.

We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy.

In the meantime we will pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Stacy can get better. She deserves it.

Don't worry Dad. I'm 15 and I know how to take care of myself.

Someday I'm sure that we will be back to visit so that you can get to know your grandchildren. Love, Your Son John

PS. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Tommy's house.

She'd specifically said to the undertaker that she wanted him buried in his blue suit; she'd brought it especially for that occasion, and she was distressed that the mortician had left him in the same brown suit he'd been wearing when the lightning bolt hit him.

She demanded that the corpse be changed into the blue suit she'd brought especially for that purpose. The undertaker said, ""But madam! It's only a minute or two until the funeral is scheduled to begin! We can't possibly take him out and get him changed in that amount of time.

The lady said, ""Who's paying for this?"" Seeing the logic to this argument, a very reluctant mortician wheeled the coffin out, but then wheeled it right back in a moment later. Miraculously, the corpse was in a blue suit.

After the ceremony, a well-satisfied widow complimented the undertaker on the smooth and speedy service. She especially wanted to know how he'd been able to get her husband into a blue suit so fast. The funeral director said, ""Oh, it was easy. It happens that there was another body in the back room and he was already dressed in a blue suit. All we had to do was switch heads!

Since the audience was different each week, the magician did the same tricks over and over again. There was only one problem: The captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the Magician did every trick.

Once he understood, he started shouting in the middle of the show, ""Look, it's not the same hat!"" or, ""Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table!"" Or ""Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?""

The magician was furious but couldn't do anything. It was, after all, the Captain's parrot.

Then one stormy night on the Pacific, the ship unfortunately sank.

The magician luckily found himself on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea, as fate would have it ... With the parrot.

They stared at each other with hatred, but did not utter a word.

This went on for a day... And then 2 days. And then 3 days. Finally on the 4th day, the parrot could not hold back any longer and said...

""Okay, I give up. Where's the ship?""

I totally forgot about charging it the next morning when I woke up.

Next morning I had a presentation for my Circuits class in front of the professor, 2 TAs, and the assistant director of the program I was part of.

I opened my laptop, realized it was dead, and plugged it in. About 10 seconds after I plugged the charger, moaning sounds from the lesbian porn I was watching started coming out of my laptop in a moderately high volume, and I realized I was DEAD.

The Professor looked confused and slightly mad, the assistant director was looking in a different direction, and one of the TAs was trying really hard not to laugh.

I was trying to log in to laptop to mute it, but since it was dead, it was taking time to let me in. In that moment, I didn’t think to mute it by clicking the keyboard button, which I consider to be one of my biggest mistakes I have ever made.

I was trying to be as calm and nonchalant as possible, but it is extremely hard to seem calm while loud moaning sounds are coming from your laptop.

By the time I was able to mute and exit from the window, I think I lost 10 pounds from sweat. No one said anything about it, and I started my presentation.

I just couldn’t present in front of them, so I ended my presentation abruptly before I even reached to my main project.

When the Macedonian empire conquered Thrace, they brought the early versions of the pipes with them.  Then Alexander the Great would bring the pipes to Greece.

Contemporaneous Roman accounts describe the bagpipes being brought back to Rome after their conquest of Greece.  The Roman Empire continued the spread of the instrument and soon it found its way to North Africa.

The Moors would bring bagpipes to Iberia with Islam, but they would not stay there.  Among the booty acquired by Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers were two hundred bagpipes.  The instrument found favor in what is today France.  Slowly bagpipes worked their way to the north and east.

There the Normans took control and brought the instrument, through trade to the Vikings and there, Scandinavia, but only briefly.  Soon bagpipes were in England in the Danelaw.  

Under the reign of King Edward I the Welsh obtained bagpipes (in face there are examples of bagpipes in the carvings of the tombs of early Welsh barons.

In the middle 13th Century, bagpipes became established in Ireland.  By the end of the century they reached Scotland.  There are definitive accounts from monks in Aberdeen of bagpipes being used in festivals as early as 1302.  Soon they became emblematic of Scottish culture.    

Remarkably, after over seven centuries, the Scots **STILL** haven't caught on to the joke.

Trump frowned, and then asked, ""But how do I know the people around you are really intelligent?""
 
The Queen took a sip of tea. ""Oh, that's easy; you just ask them to answer an intelligent riddle.""
 
The Queen pushed a button on her intercom. ""Please send Theresa May in here, would you?""
 
Theresa May walked into the room and said, ""Yes, Your Majesty?""
 
The Queen smiled and said, ""Answer me this, if you would, Theresa. Your mother and father have a child. It is not your brother and it is not your sister. Who is it?""
 
Without pausing for a moment, Theresa May answered, ""That would be me.""
 
""Yes! Very good,"" said the Queen.
 
Trump went back home to ask Mike Pence the same question. “ Mike, answer this for me. Your mother and your father have a child. It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is it?""
 
""I'm not sure,"" said Pence. ""Let me get back to you on that one."" He went to his advisers and asked everyone, but none could give him an answer.
 
Finally, Pence ran in to Sarah Palin in a restaurant the next night. Pence asked, ""Sarah, can you answer this for me? Your mother and father have a child and it's not your brother or your sister. Who is it?""
 
Sarah Palin answered right back, ""That's easy, it's me!""
 
Pence smiled, and said, ""Thanks!""
 
Pence then, went back to speak with Trump. ""Say, I did some research and I have the answer to that riddle.
 
It's Sarah Palin!""
 
Trump got up, stomped over to Pence, and angrily yelled, ""No, you idiot! It's Theresa May!""

""Really?"" The father asks, ""Are you sure that's all you want? I have no shortage of money, and I will spare no expense to make you happy."" 

""Yes, I'm sure,"" replied the son, ""All I want is one pink rubber ball.""

So the father drives to the local toy store and buys a single pink rubber ball. He brings it home to his son, who takes it and brings it into his room. After a few hours he emerges, but the ball was never to be seen again.

One year later, the father again asks his son what he wants for his birthday. 

His son answers, ""This year, I want a bucket full  of pink rubber balls."" 

Without questioning, the father drives to the local toy store and buys a bucket of pink rubber balls. He brings the bucket home to his son, who, once again, takes it into his room. After a few hours his son emerges from his room, and the bucket was never to be seen again. 

A year later, the father again asks his son what he wants for his birthday. 

His son answers, ""This year, I want a truck load of pink rubber balls.""

So the father contacts the company who makes the pink rubber balls and asks them to send one of their trucks to his address. The truck arrives in their driveway a day later. His son opens up the truck, climbs inside, and shuts the door behind him. A few hours later he opens the door and climbs out of the truck, but much to the father's suprise, the truck was completely empty. 

A year later, the father again asks his son what he wants for his birthday. 

His son answers, ""This year, I want a boat load of pink rubber balls."" 

So the father once again contacts the makers of the pink rubber balls, but this time he asks for them to send one of their freighters to the nearest harbor. When the ship arrives, the father drives his son to the harbor. His son climbs aboard the ship and orders all of the workers to leave. After a few hours the son walks out of the ship and onto the dock. Without saying anything, they get into their car and leave.

A year later, the son's birthday was only a few days away, but he suddenly became very sick. Their doctor informed them that he had stage three terminal cancer and didn't have much time left. 

On his birthday, the son was lying in a hospital bed while his father sat next to him. 

The father said, ""If there's anything I can get for you, son. Anything at all. Ask and it will be yours.""

""There's only one thing I want,"" the son replied weakly, ""If you could drive to the toy store and get me a single pink rubber ball, I would be happy in my final moments.""


Without wasting a second, the father got into his car and rushed to the toy store to get the ball for his son. 

He arrived back at the hospital and gave the ball to his son. 

""Thank you,"" said the son, ""Now if you could leave the room for fifteen minutes, that would make me even happier."" 

""Okay."" Replied his father, ""But when I come back in, will you tell me what you've been doing with all those pink rubber balls?"" 

""Yes, I believe it's time for someone to know my secret."" Replied the son. 

The father quietly left the hospital room. Fifteen minutes later, he reenters the room. As always, the ball was no where to be seen. 

""Now will you tell me this secret you've kept for so long?"" Said the father, desperate to learn the truth.

""Yes."" Said the son. ""The reason I wanted the pink rubber balls...is.....""

“My, my,” said the Poodle, “I guess it’s hopeless. That’s just as dumb as the Lab’s sentence.”

She then turns to the last of the three dogs and says, “How about you, little guy?”

The last of the three, tiny in stature but big in fame and finesse, is the chihuahua.
