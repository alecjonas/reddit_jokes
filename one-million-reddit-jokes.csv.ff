Someone who had committed adultery would say they had ""fallen"".   


This seemed to satisfy the old priest and things went well, until the priest died at a ripe old age. About a week after the new priest arrived, he visited the Mayor of the town and seemed very concerned. The priest said, ""you have to do something about the sidewalks in town. When people come into the confessional, they keep talking about having fallen."" The Mayor started to laugh, realizing that no-one had told the new priest about the code word.

So he picked up the rifle and looked through the sight in the direction of his house.

""Yeah, I can see my house all right. ""This sight is fantastic. I can see right in the window. Wow, I can see my wife in the bedroom"".

""Ha Ha, I can see she's naked!! Wait a minute, that's my neighbor in there with her......He's naked, too!!! The bitch!""

He turned to the hit man. “How much do you charge for a hit?""

""I'll do a flat rate, for you: One thousand dollars every time I pull the trigger.""

""Can you do two for me now?""

“Sure, what do you want?”

""First, shoot my wife; she's always been mouthy, so shoot her in the mouth. Then the neighbor, he's supposed to be a friend of mine, so just shoot his dick off to teach him a lesson.""

The hit man took the rifle and took aim, standing perfectly still for a few minutes.

The man merely shrugged and said, “Oh yes, I think that’s a fitting position for Washington.”

The agent says,""Go ahead, I'm listening""

The man says,""I bet $7500 that I can bite my other eye.""

The agent, not seeing a seeing eye dog or a cane, agrees. 

The man pulls out his dentures and bites his other eye. 

The man then says,""Now hold on one second. I want to give you one more chance to earn back your money. And before you say no, consider the bet. I'll bet $15000 that I can piss in your trash can all the way at the opposite end of your office, without moving, and without spilling a drop.""

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.
However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other
The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.
Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.
The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.
With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened.

 The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

“Terrible!” says Harry. “Our house burned down last night.”

“Could have been worse,” says James, again with total aplomb, and goes about his business.

A month later, James runs into Harry a third time. “Well, how goes it?” he inquires.

“Oh!” says Harry. “Things just get worse and worse. It’s one tragedy after another! Now my wife has left me!”

Harry nods his head and gives his usual optimistic-seeming little smile, accompanied by his usual words: “Could’ve been worse.”

This time, Harry grabs James by the shoulders. “Wait a minute!” he says. “I’m not gonna let you off so easy this time. Three times in the past few months we’ve run into one another, and every time I’ve told you the latest disaster in my life. Every time you say the same thing: ‘Could have been worse.’ This time, for God’s sake, Harry, I want you to tell me: how in Heaven’s name could it have been any worse?”

James looks at Harry with the same little wisp of a smile. “Could have been worse,” he says. “Could have happened to me.”","James is walking on a downtown street one day,",19

Gladly the man agreed to follow him out of the desert. 

Soon Jesus came across a tortoise that had fallen on it's back. As he bent down to help this poor creature the gay man, who had not been with another man in a long time, could not resist the temptation and tried to mount Jesus.
The son of god spun around and threw the man to the ground. ""Do not try this again with me!"" he shouted angrily at the man.

However, only a short time had passed before Jesus bent down again to assist another creature in need and again the homosexual could not resist his urges.
""Man, I have warned you and I warn you again"" Jesus said as he pushed the man off ""if you do this again you will feel the wrath of god"".

Later, after they had traveled some distance, Jesus dropped his water skin and as he bent down to retrieve it his companion again could not resist his better judgment.

Jesus turned around to the man and with booming voice announced ""you have been warned, now face the wrath of god"", and with a wink of his hand he sent him to hell.


Many years later, as Jesus passed through the same desert again, he remembered the homosexual, and curious to learn about his fate, descended down to hell to find out.
As he arrived in the realm of the devil he could not recognize the place. Frost covered the walls, thick icicles hung from the ceiling.

""I am a magic mirror. Each one of you can tell me one way you think you are better than each of the other ladies. If you are right I will give you a reward beyond anything you could imagine. If you are wrong, I will suck you into the mirror. Proceed at your own risk.""

The redhead steps up to the mirror first, looking long and hard at the other two ladies before saying,

""I think I am the prettiest of the three ladies.""

The mirror is silent for a second before responding, 

""Very good. You are correct. Your new private helicopter is waiting outside for you to take you to your $60 million mansion on your new private island.""

The brunette and the blonde look a little hurt that they are not the prettiest ladies there, but they congratulate the redhead on her new riches, and she waits to see if the other two ladies follow in her success.

The brunette steps up to the mirror next and, after some careful thought, says,

""I think I am the smartest of the three ladies.""

The mirror is again silent for a second before responding,

""Very good. You are correct. Here is a one of a kind credit card. It has no limit, and you can buy anything you want. There is also a group of three men and three ladies waiting outside the bathroom for you to be your personal assistants. They will do anything you ask of them.""

She says, ""I think...""

“Ok, I’ll be there.”

“Thank you, see you tomorrow.” 

The old man thought to himself, “I probably need a lawyer, huh?”

The next morning at 9am the man walks into the IRS offices with his lawyer, ready to discuss the sums of money.
He sits down at Bills desk.

“Hello.” he says

“Hello sir,” Bill says “I was just wondering where these large sums are coming from.”

“Gambling.” The man says

“Gambling? You serious?”

“Well sir, I gamble for anything worth gambling for.”

“Oh yeah?”

“Yeah, tell you what, I bet you $5000 that I can bite my own eye.”

“Sure!” Bill exclaims, not thinking this man can possibly bit his own eye.

So, sure enough, the old man takes out his eye and bites it. It’s glass. Bill is very disgruntled

“I’ll let you redeem yourself,” the old man says “I bet you $7000 that I can bite my other eye.”

Bill thinks to himself. The man didn’t come in with a seeing eye dog, or a cane, or anything to indicate he is blind, so bill says “Okay!”

The old man takes out his denchers and bites his other eye.
Bill is visibly angry.

The old man says, “I’ll give you a chance to get all of your money back, and then some. I bet you $15000 I can pee into the trash can from here without spilling a single drop.”

Bill thinks to himself again. “The man doesn’t have a gurney with him, no pee bag, and the trash can is 6 feet away!”

So, Bill says yes

The old man undoes his belt, pulls down his britches and proceeds to pee all over Bill’s desk.

“YES! You owe me $1000 dollars now!” screams Bill, getting weird looks from his coworkers (Glass office)

“NO!” the lawyer screams “ He bet me $100,000 that he would pee all over your desk and you would do nothing about it!”

“I hope that explains it.” the old man says, he then walks out of the IRS office and drives home.

One day, one of the brothers mysteriously died. 
       
 Although they had never attended church, the one remaining brother went to the local pastor and offered vast sums of money if he would come to the funeral and say the appropriate words, AND, a large bonus, but ONLY if he would - during the course of the eulogy -refer to his brother as ""a Saint."" 
       
The pastor was troubled by the request, however, it was a very poor church and the church desperately needed repairs. 
       
The Parishioners had heard about the pastor's dilemma and were curious as to what he would do. 
       
The Funeral began, the church was packed, and the pastor started with the usual prayers and followed the rites and traditions as required by the churches teachings. In closing, after referring to the man in the box, he paused and turned to face the remaining brother. 

He began, ""As you all know, the departed was an awful individual who robbed, cheated, swindled and stole from everyone he ever did business with. However, compared to his Brother, he was a Saint!""

But finally one day on that dating site I got matched with this beautiful girl

On her profile bio, she wrote some facts about her that she has some forecasting ability that when she closes her one eye she can see the past and when she closes her both eyes she can see the future

 I ignored that fact and started impressing her with cracking some jokes and etc

After all these all fun-loving formalities she really got impressed by me and I finally invited her for a movie at my house 

While watching the movie we started doing foreplay with each other we were almost about to have sex but suddenly her bunch of hair came in front of her one eye and she started watching past with her ex-boyfriend after watching the past she got upset about her old memorise

So to cheer up her again I took her for a movie in the theatre.

Again while watching the movie she came close to me for a kiss she closed her both eyes and told me...

Screams are everywhere as the audience seeks cover.

His best friend Nathaniel is in the audience, but all he can do is sit there in shock and stare at the corpse of his now dead friend. Police swarm in through the doors to the venue and take down the shooter, putting a bullet through his head without a second thought, and rough hands seize Nathaniel.

Everything is a daze. The next thing he knows, he’s in a cell, being interrogated about the shooting. Questions are ringing through his head, questions he wants to answer but can’t find the time to collect his thoughts.

“Was he a friend to you?”

“We can’t contact his family. Do you know how we can reach them?”

“What is...”

The words fly by, and the next thing he knows after that is sitting at a table, making calls on his phone. Nathaniel is planning his friend’s funeral, putting every bit of detail into it to give his friend the best send off he can. Yet he’s looking from far off in his mind, almost on autopilot, still in shock somehow.

The day of the funeral comes round, and everything is planned perfectly. The church is presented well down to the finest detail, the guests are all dressed accordingly, and the entire service puts a bit of life into Nathaniel, but there’s still something off in his mind.

Next stop, the wake. A crowd of people who admired the magician all stand around, praising him for his marvellous tricks and chatting fondly about him.

Nathaniel starts to make his way to the drinks table, but is caught behind a queue of others wanting to do so. As he waits patiently, he hears the man in front laugh and say, “well, he was a terrible person and his tricks were garbage.”

Something snaps inside Nathaniel, drawing down a curtain of red in his vision. His mind becomes a blur, but when he comes to he can’t believe what he’s seeing. The group of people are all dead, heads bashed in, and he’s in handcuffs. He killed them all.

Being dragged away. The police. The blood. Blood all over his hands. But he needs confirmation.

“E-excuse me,” he asks a stunned woman near him. “What happened?”

The woman turns to him and says, “can you not remember what you just did?”

Nathaniel shakes his head in fright, to which the woman sighs and asks, “you’re the one who planned his funeral, right?”

He nods his head this time, a slight smile coming to his face.

The woman stares at him and says, “well the setup was pretty good, but you completely butchered the punchline.”","A Mexican magician says he will disappear on the count of three. He says “uno, dos...”",144

A yellow car goes past.

A red car.

A white van.

A green car.

A black pickup truck.

This time he double takes. For there are about thirty penguins in the back of the pickup truck.

The pickup was not speeding, in fact the cop was unsure if the black pick up was breaking any laws at all, but out of sheer boredom and curiosity he fires up his siren and goes after the pickup truck.

The pickup truck pulls over and the cop approaches as the driver rolls down his window. The driver is very nervous and asks frantically ""Sorry officer! Did I do something wrong!?"".

The cop replies: ""No.. not exactly... I'm just wondering what it is you plan to do with all of the penguins in the back of your pick up truck?"".

The driver explains nervously: ""I'm not really sure officer. I was hoping you might have a suggestion.""

And the cop replies: ""Take them to the zoo!""

The driver, relieved, replies: ""That is a great idea officer! Why didn't I think of that? Thank you so much for your help."" and he rolls up his window and goes on his way.

The next day, the cop is sitting in his car with his speed gun, in the same spot, once again bored by the mundane job which he has been tasked to perform.

And he sees the pick up truck go past again, with the same thirty penguins in the back, but this time they are all wearing sunglasses!

The cop, agitated that the driver did not take his advice, fires up his siren and speeds after the pick up truck.

The driver pulls over and rolls down his window and says ""Sorry officer! Did I do something wrong!?""

Everyone who has ever tried had either returned exhausted and near death, or hadn't returned at all. Because of this, the men knew that they needed to seek guidance. They had heard of a shaman who would give advice to those who needed it, and thus sought to find him.

Upon arriving at his home, the two friends sit down and ask him what he advises they do. He says only one thing: ""Beware the Bacon Tree.""

Understandably, the men are confused, and ask him to repeat himself, and to clarify, thinking they misheard him. Again, the shaman only says one thing: ""Beware the Bacon Tree."" 

Thinking that asking any more will result in nothing of value, the friends thank the shaman, and leave his house. They organise to meet at the mouth of the desert the next day, where they will begin their journey.

The following day, upon meeting each other with bags full of rations and water, the men are surprised to find the shaman waiting, carrying nothing but the clothes on his back. The friends ask if he plans on journeying with them, to which he simply replies with ""Beware the Bacon Tree,"" while nodding. The friends explain that they won't be able to share their rations with him, to which the shaman shakes his head, while holding up his hands in a sort of 'no worries' gesture. The men shrug it off, and start their long trek.

After about an hour of walking, the men stop for food and drink. Having only talked to each other for the entirety of the trip, they decide to try and talk to the shaman. However, everything they ask is only replied to with ""Beware the Bacon Tree."" After a while, they give up, and keep walking.

Five hours into their adventure, the sun is setting, so the men decide to set up camp. They pitch their tents, light a fire, and settle down for the night. They ask the shaman where he is going to sleep, and he only replies with ""Beware the Bacon Tree."" They ignore him, and go to sleep.

And so, the men keep trekking for several days, and eventually their supplies run to half-full. They seek advice from the shaman on whether they should turn around, which, as they expected, is only met with ""Beware the Bacon Tree."" Thus, they decide to keep going forward.

Eventually, their supplies reach a quarter of what they were originally. Knowing that it's too late to turn back now, they talk to the shaman for guidance, and to test whether he'll say anything else. Yet again, they are only met with ""Beware the Bacon Tree."" Feeling let down, the men continue their hike.

Finally, there supplies are gone, and the two men are starting to worry. As they glance back, they notice the shaman, who has a grim look on his face. As he meets the gaze of the two men, he warns, yet again, to ""Beware the Bacon Tree.""

As the two men look to the horizon in front of them, one notices a small green speck, sitting to the right of their line of sight. He shows the other guy, and they hurry over to it, with the shaman widening his eyes and following in hot pursuit.

As they approach, they notice that the green speck is actually a small, neatly trimmed bush, covered with bits of cured meat. When they reach the bush, the friends look back to the shaman, seeking advice. He warily says one thing back to them: ""Beware the Bacon Tree.""

One of the men, starving, reaches forward to grab some meat. Their shaman friend bolts immediately. The other man tries to stop his friend, but the other man cannot be stopped and finally snags a piece of pork off the plant.

Suddenly, twenty tribesmen jump out from their hiding places, all armed with blowpipes aimed at the necks of the two men. The tribe's chief walks forward, and says to them, ""What you say, before you die?""

One man turns to the other and says, ""That idiot shaman got it wrong. It wasn't a bacon tree.""

""It was a ham-bush!""",Beware the Bacon Tree.,24

post,b663ya,2qh72,jokes,false,1553703222,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/b663ya/back_when_i_was_in_high_school_i_worked_at_a/,self.jokes,,"One of the ""long time fixtures"" there was a homeless guy who would sit outside and ask for change. He was there every day, from opening of the store until closing, without fail.

Several months after I started, the owner decided to go in a new direction with the store and wanted to increase worker/client interaction to hopefully drum up ""add-on"" sales. As a result, a new position was created, the ""product demonstrator.""

After seeing this homeless man struggle to get by, and knowing that he was diligent in his efforts (in fact, he was more dependable to show up than some of my current co-workers), I suggested to my manager that we hire him.

It took a lot of convincing, TBH. After the better part of a month, my manager finally relented to my persistence and allowed the man to come in for an interview.

I don't know what happened in the interview, but the man came out of my manager's office beaming with a new optimism, a HUGE smile on his face, and practically in tears! I guess he impressed my manager because he was hired... on the contingency, of course, that he ""clean up"" and make himself more presentable.

I didn't have a lot of money at the time (working for WV minimum wage as a stockboy wasn't nearly the glamorous life that it sounds like), but I ""loaned"" him some money to get some new clothes, as well as a haircut and shave. Honestly, I never really *expected* to get the money back, I was just glad that I had been put in a position to help someone in need.

Since I had been a hard worker and dependable during my time at the store --- and, well, it WAS my idea to hire him in the first place --- I was put in charge of properly training our newest hire.

Unfortunately, no matter how much time I spent, and no matter what method I used for instruction, he just couldn't figure out how to properly operate the power juicer.... much less give a demonstration on it!

I thought it was such an EASY thing to do. If I'm being honest, I STILL think it's an ""elementary"" skill, but for whatever reason, he just couldn't grasp this particular skill. I mean, he was reasonably well-spoken, personable, and even took pride in his work (as bad as it was at the time).

I saw the writing on the wall, and although I did everything I could to delay the inevitable, after two weeks of failure my manager decided to let our newest hire go.

I was extremely distraught over the situation at the time, and looking back it's disheartening that it never culminated in the ""feel good"" story that I was hoping for when originally lobbying to hire that homeless man. I still think of him on occasion to this day.

But despite all of that, the seeds of hope and the eventual disappointment, I learned a VERY important lesson that I will NEVER forget:

Beggars can't be juicers","Back when I was in high school, I worked at a grocery store as a stockboy.",54

The man walks to the machine puts a penny in it and then gives the sample.

After a few beeps, a note comes out ""Your hand's tendon is injured, don't put it under any stress and exercise"".

The man was amazed and decides to mess with the machine, so when he reaches home, he takes a bottle, then pours some water in it, then makes his dog urinate in it, and then sees his daughter's chewed gum on floor so puts it on the bottle also, and finally to sum it up, masturbates in the bottle.

Then heads towards the machine and gives the sample to the machine.

After 10 minutes of strange noises and sounds that machine made, a note comes out ""Your water pipe will clog soon, be sure to fix it.

Your dog will die in 2 weeks, be prepared for it.

Your daughter is pregnant, go beat the boy living upstairs. and if u keep masturbating like this, your injured tendon won't heal!""",A guy is walking when he suddenly falls and injures his hand.,13

One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colours. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean’s list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him.

He goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it.

Of course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp’s departure, but they all know it’s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn’t been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there’s an extremely long line. He decides it’s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he’s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it’s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there’s no punch line.",So there once was this wasp that lived in a jungle.,5

Thousands of people came to try to hurt the trio. The fighters were sitting in three different chairs with a painted line in front of them. The first fighter had a kick line, everybody in that line was allowed to kick the fighter, in the second line everybody was allowed to tackle the fighter as painful as possible, and in the third line....

Every morning he tells the joke and a leaves the intercom on to hear the reaction.

No one says a word but after a good minute, everyone starts laughing. This happens every morning.

He is kind of confused but so happy that his employees can start the day in a good mood, that he doesn't give it too much thought.

One day his System Engineer meets him at the coffee machine, and remembering the joke of that morning mentions that to the boss saying ""You gave me a really good laugh, the pun about the lion was awesome!""

The CEO is really confused but not wanting to spoil the mood, smiles and says ""Glad you liked it!""

&amp;#x200B;

Truth is, he never said anything about a lion. He is so confused that when he gets back at his desk, he decides to take a part his intercom, thinking that something might be wrong and people might be hearing him wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

When he takes off the top cover, he finds a bunch of ants near the microphone and he hears a small whisper. He puts his ear near them and he keeps hearing them telling jokes, one better than the other.

That is when he realizes that up to that day, his employees have always been laughing because of the ant's jokes.

post,b61da9,2qh72,jokes,false,1553671020,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/b61da9/slow_slower/,self.jokes,,"Joke I heard in Egypt, prolly funnier in Arabic but here goes.


There was this couple named Slow (M) and Slower (F). On their anniversary, Slow took Slower for a walk over a bridge on the Nile River. While they were walking, Slower decided to take a picture of Slow sitting on the bridge, so Slow goes ahead and sits in the bridge and gets ready to get his picture taken. Slower takes a few steps back to take the picture and tells Slow to do a pose. As Slow is doing the pose he loses balance and falls over the bridge. 

Slower is in a panic and doesn’t know what to do. She screams “ OMG someone help my husband fell over the bridge, I don’t know what to do!!”. She sees a phone booth near by, so she runs over there and calls her sister. “Sister, sister, help me! I don’t know what to do! Me and Slow were going for a walk on the bridge over the Nile and I decided to take a picture of Slow sittin on the bridge and he fell over!!” 
The sister in shock doesn’t know what to do either so she tells her “ omg! Ok don’t panic! Did u call mom and tell her?!” Slower goes “ no not yet I didn’t want to freak her out!” Her sister goes “call her, maybe she can help!” 

Slower hangs up with her sister and calls her mom immediately. “Mom! Mom! Help me!! Me and Slow were going for a walk on the bridge over the Nile for our anniversary and I decided to take a picture of him sitting on the bridge and he fell over!! I don’t know what to do!! I called my sister and she told me to call you!” Her mom in shock doesn’t know what to do either, this has never happened before, she goes “ it’s ok honey everything is going to be ok! But I can’t help you maybe your father can help you better!”

Slower completely out of it and panicking she calls her father. “ Dad! Dad! Help me!! Me and Slow were going for a walk on the bridge over the Nile for our anniversary and I decided to take a picture of him sitting on the bridge and he fell over!! I called sister and she told me to call mom and mom told me to call you!!” Her father in a very calming voice said “ honey it’s ok, you need to call the ambulance to come and rescue him to make sure he’s ok.” 

Slower hangs up with her dad and immediately calls the ambulance, she tells them exactly what happened. Bla bla blah etc etc. the EMTs say “ ok dont worry ma’am , we’re on our way!”

A few minutes go by and the ambulance finally arrives. They see Slower at the phone booth and ask her where her husband fell. She goes “ right this way guys hurry! He’s probably dead by now!!” 

They all go running to where her husband fell and as soon as they get to the bridge they see Slow still falling off. 


TL;DR: can’t really have a tl;dr it would ruin the joke lol. 


I tried to translate it best I could lol. In Arabic the adjectives are gender oriented so prolly won’t make sense to some of y’all.

There was one man who was greeted cheerfully by everyone. Like really everyone. His name was John. Boss stopped him for a while and asked him a question 'John, how is it possible that our accountant, manager, supplier and even our new clients who were here for the first time they all know you?'. 'Well boss..', he replied 'I'm worldwide known and everyone knows who I am'. 'This is some damn joke' boss thinks 'but let's check this out'. 'If it's true you will get a promotion but if it's not you will clean my office for a week, deal?'. 'Ok, boss' John replied. Few seconds later boss said 'I'm sure you have not met Arnold Schwarzeneger so we go to California and see if you are telling the truth'. After a short fly and taxi drive they visited California's governor - Arnold Schwarzeneger. 'Hello John, high five, how are you? When was the last time you were here?' 'Who knows Arnie, 2 years maybe?' Boss was shocked. After a while he said to John 'Well, you might know him but I'm 100% sure you do not know Lionel Messi'. John replied 'He's my longtime buddy'. So to check if this is truth they took a flight to Barcelona, Spain. Flight was few hours longer then before but they reached the Camp Nou stadium where players had their training. 'Sup Leo, we have not had any sparring last time, have we?' asked John and they had one hour talk about their relationship. 'Damn you John. Last person. I'm positive you do not know current Pope - Francis. 'Boss, let's fly to Vatican and you will see on your own eyes'. After reaching St Peter's Square John said to his boss 'I'm going inside and after 20 minutes me and Pope will wave at you from the balcony'. John did as he had promised. When he was going back he saw an ambulance and his boss inside. 'Boss, what happened?!' he asked. 'John...' he barely said. 'I can believe that you know Arnold Schwarzeneger. Hell, I can even stand that you and Messi play football together. But when some 10-year old boy came when you were on the balcony with Pope and asked 'Who the fuck is that old geezer standing next to John?!' my heart couldn't take it'.

""Hold on there, partner,"" said the snake, ""don't shoot - I'm an enchanted rattlesnake, and if you don't shoot me, I'll give you any three wishes you want."" 

The cowboy decided to take a chance. He knew he was safely out of the snake's striking range. He said, ""OK, first, I'd like to have a face like Bradley Cooper, then, I'd like a build like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and finally, I'd like sexual equipment like this here horse I'm riding."" 

The rattlesnake said, ""All right, when you get back to the bunk house you'll have all three wishes."" 

The cowboy turned his horse around and galloped at full speed all the way to the bunk house. He dismounted on the run and went straight inside to the mirror. 

Staring back at him in the mirror was the face of Bradley Cooper. He ripped the shirt off his back and revealed bulging, rippling muscles, just like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Every year there was a big fair that came to town that Mike and Ida decided to go to when they were 19, and they were blown away with all of the events and festivities. There was one in particular that caught their eye though, it was a helicopter ride with a stunt pilot. 

To celebrate their new marriage they approached the pilot to incquire how much it was and the pilot said $50. They both wanted to do it but Ida said ""I would love to go on the helicopter ride but its $50 and $50 is $50..."", so to no avail from Mike they didn't go on the ride. Every year they came back to the helicopter stand but Ida would say ""its $50 and $50 is $50"". 

One year they're 80 years old and Mike tells Ida that they might not have another chance to go on the ride, but once again Ida says ""it's  $50 and $50 is $50"", overhearing them the pilot comes up to them and says he heard them talking about it and he'll take them up for free, but if they make a single sound over the whole flight they would have to pay. 

Delighted with the offer the couple immediately says yes. The pilot takes them up and does a world class routine, flips, rolls, anything that you can think of. He does it once and not a single sound from either one, so he does a second round pulling out any trick he can.

Finally he lands and is amazed, he tells Mike wow I can't believe you didn't say a single word the whole time, you don't owe me anything!

Mike replies back to him ""I almost said something when Ida fell out of the helicopter, but that would've cost $50 and $50 is $50..."".",$50 is $50,14
