ds and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. And all this we will do.

Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions - who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.

What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them - that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works - whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account - to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day - because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.
Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control - and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart - not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.

As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more.

Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.

We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort - even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we’ll work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.

For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus - and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.

To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West - know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.

To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.

As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment - a moment that will define a generation - it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.

For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.

Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends - honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism - these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility - a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.

This is the price and the promise of citizenship.

This is the source of our confidence - the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.

This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed - why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.

So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:
""Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it].""

America. In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.

Thank you. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.""

Next to which is a sign which says has been marked down from $2000 to only $50. Curious, she enters the shop and asks the shopkeeper why it is so cheap.

'Well' he says 'There is a bit of a problem with that one... See, it was sold to woman who returned it because she couldn't keep up the payments on it. Problem is, she also happened to be the owner of a brothel, and it's happened to have picked up a bit of bad language. If you don't have a problem with any of that you can have it for only $50'

The woman, never one to pass up a bargain, thinks 'how bad can it be?' and pays the $50 and takes the bird home.

She hangs the cage with the large and beautiful bird up in her living room when she gets home. The parrot says: 'New house. New madam!'

She thinks this isn't too bad, and is beginning to think she's got a great bargain when her teenage girls come home from high-school. 'New house. New madam. New whores!' Screeches the bird.

The girls are a little shocked, but their mum explains the situation and they have a bit of a giggle about it and think nothing more of it.

man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper's cemetery in the Nova Scotia back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost and, being a typical man, I didn't stop for directions.
I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the
diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late.
I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn't know what else to do, so I started
to play.  The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before for this homeless man.  And as I played ""Amazing Grace,"" the workers began
to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished, I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head was hung low, my heart was full.  As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, ""I never seen anything like
that before, and I've been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.""",When A guy gets lost: Yet another joke from a 83 year old dad.,12

Although his English was far from perfect, they got along very well — until one day he rushed into a lawyer’s office and asked him if he could arrange a divorce for him.

The lawyer said that getting a divorce would depend on the circumstances, and asked him the following questions:

Lawyer: “Have you any grounds?”

Man: “Yes, an acre and a half and a nice little home.”

Lawyer: “No, I mean what is the foundation of this case?”

Man: “It’s made of concrete.”

Lawyer: “I don’t think you understand. Does either of you have a real grudge?”

Man: “No, we have a carport.”

Lawyer: “I mean, what are your relations like?”

Man: “All my relations are still in Poland.”

Lawyer: “Is there any infidelity in your marriage?”

Man: “We have a high-fidelity stereo and good DVD player.”

Lawyer: “Does your wife beat you up?”

Man: “No, I always wake up before her.”

Lawyer: “Sir, exactly why do you want this divorce?”

Man: “She’s going to kill me.”

Lawyer: “What makes you think that?”

Seeing as that wasn't enough, the second soldier throws out their boxes of food rations. Still not enough, the last soldier throws out a bomb, which was critical for their mission, but as they were not going to complete the mission regardless, it was better than dying. 

With the dropping of the bomb, they end up in the clear. They land, but as they had no bomb, they aborted the mission and went back to town to call it into HQ. 

On their way back, they see a crowd gathered. Upon further inspection, the soldiers see that some were cheering, some were crying and looked sad, and one person looking extremely confused and embarassed. The soldiers asked, ""what happened?"" 

The crying: ""Swords fell out of the sky and killed our brothers and sisters!"" 

The cheering: ""But now we have weapons to fight against the bandits! "" 

The crying: ""And then a heavy box fell on top of one of our elders and killed him!"" 

The cheering: ""But it was filled with food to last us weeks!""

post,4i4dfr,2qh72,jokes,false,1462526930,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4i4dfr/the_voodoo_dick/,self.jokes,,"A man enters a sex shop, looking for a new toy to keep his wife busy while he goes on business trips. As a higher-up in his corporation, he tends to be away from home several times a month, and wants to ensure his wife stays faithful.

When he reaches the counter, he's shocked to see an old, wizened man tending it. He asks, nervously: ""Do you work here?""

He replied ""Yes, I do"".

Still stupified by this mystical old man, the husband stammers...I uh...uh..am looking for something for my wife. My work requires me to travel and I wan't something that can keep her satisfied so she won't cheat on me.

The old man blinks slowly a few times, then says: ""Yes, I believe we have what you're looking for."" He pulls out a wooden box, covered in dust. It looks ANCIENT. As he opens the lid, the smell of old wood floods the husband's nostrils. 

This here is a Voodoo dick. It has magical powers and I assure you, it would keep any women satisfied.

The husband laughs harder than he has in a long time. ""Did you say VOODOO dick? HAHAHAHA I can't believe you're trying to sell me this sh*t"".

The old man just looks at him. ""Allow me to demonstrate to quash your doubts, I suggest you stand away from the door.""

The husband looks behind him, and with a quizzical look on his face, takes three steps away from the door he was leaning against.

The old man speaks. ""VOODOO DICK, The door!""

All of a sudden, the gnarled, wooden shaft lying dormant inside the box floats into the air. It levels off with the doorknob, then soars through the air directly at the keyhole. 

A thunderous bang bang bang can be heard as the voodoo dick tries violently to enter the hole that is far too small for it. The door starts to shake and hinges rattle.

The man says I'LL TAKE IT!!!!!

The old man then says VOODOO DICK, the box!

And as if on rewind, it slowly glides back into the box, and lay still.

Upon arriving home, his wife asks him what he has in the box. ""It's a voodoo dick, honey"", he says. The wife starts dying of laughter. ""Voodoo dick? hahahahaha you must be joking!!""

The husband gives her a stern look and says: ""Listen, I know how lonely you get on those business trips of mine, and this will keep you occupied so I know you'll be faithful."" 

He then says: ""Voodoo dick, her pussy!"" The lid of the box bursts open as the dick flies through the air, directly towards his wife's crotch. There is the definitive sound of her panties ripping as the dick penetrated through the fabric, into it's designated spot. 

The wife: ""What the he....hey....ooooo...mmm...oh...my...god...!!!!"" She is shaking on the couch.

The husband smiles and says, see you later honey, I'm going golfing with some pals from work!.

She is too busy biting her lips to respond.

Three hours pass. 

Finally, decided she's been satiated, the wife tries to remove the dick from inside her. She pulls, tugs at it with all her might, but it won't budge. The thing remains inside her and refuses to move.

She panics.

She sees her husband's cellphone on the living room table. He forgot it. And he didn't tell her how to turn the thing off!

With the voodoo dick still thrusting inside her, the wife runs to the garage and starts the car. She has to get to a hospital. She's freaking out. 

12 minutes later, she is pulled over by a traffic cop for doing nearly double the speed limit. He asks her why she felt she needed to risk her life and the life of others by speeding. He thinks she's on drugs, because she's not talking coherently.

Officer...oh...ahh...see...uh..my husband bought this....voodoo dick...for me and it won't come out!!..And oohhhhhh.......ahh...he didn't tell me how to turn it off! He's gone..golfing with his friends...and I can't...get a hold..of him.

The officer looks at her with a blank expression on her face.

He bursts out laughing.

""Hahahahaha, that's a new one! Never heard that one before! Voodoo dick, my ass!""",The Voodoo Dick,166

The church was dark, he couldn't even see how woman looked clearly but the blowjob was amazing, he had never felt so good before and the sweet sound of lullaby made it even better!

Please note that she asks 5 or 6 questions, which he answered quite simply.  
She is speechless after answering only one question.

 Critical Thinking At Its Very Best!:


 Woman:   Do you drink beer?

  Man: Yes.

  Woman:  How many beers a day?

  Man:   Usually about 3.
 
 Woman:  How much do you pay per beer?

  Man:   $5.00 which includes a tip (This is where it gets scary!).

  Woman:  And how long have you been drinking?

  Man:   Oh, about 20 years, I suppose.

  Woman:  So, a beer costs $5.00 and you have 3 beers a day, 
which puts your spending each month at $450.00. 
In one year it would be approximately $5400.00 correct?

  Man:   Correct.

  Woman:  If in 1 year you spend $5400.00, not accounting for inflation, 
the past 20 years puts your spending at $108,000.00 or maybe more, correct?
                                    

  Man:   Correct.

  Woman:  Do you know that if you didn't drink so much beer, that money could have been 
put in a step-up interest savings account, and after accounting for compound interest for the past 20 years, 
you could have now bought a  Ferrari?
                                    

  Man:   Do you drink beer?

  Woman:  No.

  Man:   Where's your Ferrari?",Male logic. Another joke from an 83 year old dad.,108

he's got small favorability ratings...
So 2 make up for that. He pulled a slick move.
From the beginining this years election cycle has been akin to the Hunger Games.
Over 20 people were in the race.
Donald asserted his dominance
He also asserted that he is assertively asserting himself.
(That's to assert dominance)

Anyway after Ben Carson woke up from his nap he realized he had sold hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of more books because people thought he had died and was having a televised funeral attended to by the other contestants in the two thousand and sixteen Republican Presidential Primary Race.

Carly Fiorina had no hope to start with. A woman will not yet be accepted by conservatives as a leader.

If she had pulled a reverse Jenner and gone full G.I. Joe then Donald might have put her on his next ""reality"" show. 

That probably would have given her enough popularity to win the general election; Americans enjoy novelty.

Jeb! had to drop out because he forgot to put his last name on his application for president.

and Nobody will forget Marco Robotio, the boy robot determined to be president... and become a real boy.

and a whole bunch of other puppets dropped out along the way.

anyways Donald was getting mighty rustled that Ted Cruz and John Kasich wouldn't drop out.

Eventually, John Kasich left the race to enjoy the young pussy screaming he is the hottest contestant on America's Got Politicians to date.

Cruz dropped out to pursue a profitable career on Nickelodeon.


Now Donald Trump is open he to raise the minimum wage.

Immediately after the final two opponents heeled to him, Donald Trump decides to do a complete flip and says he will look into it.
He has given the elephants some chocolate-covered peanuts.

Donald's Slick Trick (Patent Pending) uses positive reinforcement to encourage behavior that favors Donald Trump. 
Most people want a higher wage. 
Most politicians were open to it.
I believe Donald Trump made a calculated decision to originally be against it so that issue could be used as leverage. In this case he has opened on the point to attract the residual voters left mourning the political graves of the other contestants.

Kasich and Cruz bowing to Trump is the neutral stimulus.

Offering openness to a higher minimum wage is the unconditioned stimulus.

The subjects to this experiment populate not only America, but the entire globe.

Humans are animals.

Donald Trump is a man looking for power.

He has scratched the dogs' back.

I plead that the dogs don't roll over for a belly rub.","1 Genius trick that Donald, original surname Drumpf, pulled off will blow your mind",0

Joe was horrified, and decided to get a second opinion. Joe contacted Dr. Smith and showed him the green growth. Dr. Smith said, ""I am sorry but Dr. Jones is correct. We must amputate,right away"". Joe could not accept this. 

A friend suggested that he visit an oriental doctor... They must deal with this all the time! He went to Dr. Chu Wong.

This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico but as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York.
The ship hit an iceberg and sank and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day.
The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5 and is known, of course, as Sinko de Mayo.
Go out on this day, grab a couple of slices of Wonderbread and a jar of Hellman’s mayonnaise and have a party. You know I will!

So the husband went to his doctor and told him that he and his wife didn't want to have any more children.The doctor told him there was a procedure called 'vasectomy' that would fix the problem, but it was expensive. A less costly alternative was to go home, get a large firecracker, light it, put it in a beer can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10. 

The husband said to the doctor, ""I may not be the smartest guy in the world, but I don't see how putting a firework in a beer can next to my ear is going to help me with my problem....""

""Trust me.... it will do the job,"" said the doctor. 

So the man went home, lit a cracker and put it in a beer can. With one hand he held the can up to his ear and began to count with his fingers: ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5,"" at which point he paused and placed the beer can between his legs so he could continue counting on his other hand.",Family Planning,11

""Well, here in the bathroom theres a big red button on the wall you shoukd never press. The owner has made me aware this is the only flaw in the house."" Figuring he can live with this he buys the home. 

Well a year after his family moves in the husband gets curious and presses the button. As soon as he pressed it a section of the wall slides open and reveals a very hung man.

The man says ""with or with out vaseline?"" Stunned, the husband replies ""wi...without vaseline?"" And the man behind the wall begins to rape the husband. 

So another year goes by and the husband has been careful to not press the button. Unfortunately the husband tripped coming out of the shower and hit the button. Of course the wall slides open and reveals the hung man and he bellows his question once more. 

""With or without vaseline?"" Remembering last time and figuring a little lube would be beneficial the husband replies ""WITH vaseline!"" The man shrugs and says ""your choice."" And hits a button inside the wall.

The engineer looks at the huge amount of cash and agrees. He sets up a mic in the booth then heads back into the console. The guy goes into the booth, closes the door and starts to speak:

""Since I was little, all I ever wanted to be was a musician. I trained with the best in the business, practiced every day, and made myself too be the best I could possibly be. I learned to write songs and record, played every instrument on my demo tapes and created masterpieces. And then I brought them to you people at the record companies. And you rejected me. I tried again and again, refining and bettering my work, but the response was always the same - that people didn't want musicianship, talent, and songs written from the heart. They wanted easy to swallow crap that was familiar and easy to listen to. They wanted the same old shit, instead of something original!""

""Well, I'm fucking fed up! I've worked my whole life and have never been successful! You've ruined my dream, crushed my hopes and destroyed me! I have nothing left to live for, and I hope you're all happy!""

With that, he takes a gun out of his pocket and shoots himself dead, right in the vocal booth.

""It's been so long since any of us had sex, and I think it's driving us crazy"" *both men nod* ""and, given the circumstances, I feel like we could all use some good sex. So here's the plan: I stay with you *pointing at the first man* for five days, then you *pointing at the second* the next five. And repeat.""

Everyone seems satisfied with this turn of events, and life happily continues on the island. The survivors even built a second house, so that each man would have his and not interfere while the other was ""busy"" in the other house.

However, one day, as worse came to worst, the woman suddenly died of a tropical illness.

Both men then meet, and, in a very sad mood, look at each other: ""Hey man, it's gonna be tough, but I really can't live without the sex anymore."" ""Yeah, we need to find something"" ... ""So, you for five days, me for the next five, repeat?..."" *the second one sadly nods*

And so, life continued, surely, far less fun than before.

He went back to the circus, ate delicious popcorn, watched the acts, and was generally pretty relaxed, and then the clown came out.

The vet tells him that he should try artificial insemination. The farmer doesn’t have the slightest idea what this means but, not wanting to display his ignorance, only asks the vet how he will know when the sheep are pregnant. The vet tells him that they will stop standing around and will lie down and wallow in the grass when they are pregnant. The farmer hangs up and gives it some thought. He comes to the conclusion that artificial insemination means he has to impregnate the sheep. So he loads the sheep into his truck, drives them out into the woods, screws them all, brings them back and goes to bed. Next morning, he wakes and looks out at the sheep. Seeing that they are all still standing around, he deduces that the first try didn’t take and loads them in the truck again. He drives them out to the woods, screws each sheep twice for good measure, brings them back and goes to bed. Next morning, he wakes to find the sheep still just standing around. One more try, he tells himself, and proceeds to load them up and drive them out to the woods. He spends all day sheep screwing, and upon returning home falls exhausted into bed. The next morning he cannot even raise himself from the bed to look at the sheep. He asks his wife to look out and tell him if the sheep are lying in the grass. “No,” she says, “they’re all in the truck and one of them is beeping the horn.” ",A new farmer buys several sheep hoping to breed them.,66

On Marty's second birthday, his mom asked Marty what he wanted for his birthday. Marty said, ""I want a pink ping pong ball!"" Mom was confused why Marty wanted pink ping pong balls but agreed to buy them for her son's sake. 

Fast forward to Marty's 12^th birthday. Marty was treated to a surprise birthday party that he did not know about. He got cake and presents but was not satisfied. Marty's dad walked up to him and said, ""Marty, it doesn't seem like you want any of your presents. What would you like for your birthday?"" Marty said, ""I want a pink ping pong ball!"" Dad thought this was just a phase that he is going through and agrees to buy such a weird item for his son's birthday.

Fast forward to Marty's graduation day. Marty was dressed all nice and his parents were taking photos of him. His parents wanted to get Marty anything he wanted, no matter the price. Marty looked at them and said, ""I want a pink ping pong ball!"" Both parents looked at each other and agreed since it was such a special day. In their minds, however, they were wondering what Marty is doing with these ping pong balls. 

Fast forward to Marty's wedding day. Marty is in his tuxedo with his newly wedded wife next to him. He sees his parents and his teenage brother grabbing some food. They see Marty and walk over to him. Marty's brother said, ""Congrats bro! For this special day, I will get you anything you want that is reasonable for me to afford. Quickly, Marty said, ""I want a pink ping pong ball!"" The brother was shocked and sort of weirded out by this request. Without complaint, he agrees. 

Fast forward about 50 years later. Marty is on his hospital bed where the doctors say he is not going to make it. Marty is barely awake and his grandson is by his side. The grandson is crying and wants to ask a question to Marty. He says, ""Grandpa Marty, can you answer this one question that I have been meaning to ask you for years? Why did you always ask for a pink ping pong ball for a gift?"" Marty looks at him and says, ""Well my boy, it is because..."" And then he dies.

The bartender stands there **speechless**. Again, without skipping a beat, the monkey takes another peanut, puts it up its butt, takes it out and eats it.

The woman looks at the burning building behind her. The flames lick her heels. She sees she has no choice. 

She sticks the baby out the window, raised high as Simba, and she drops it.

The crowd falls immediately silent. The baby plummets for what seems like an eternity until, at last, it falls right into the strong, powerful arms of professional football player Rob Gronkowski. The baby is unharmed. A perfect catch.

The crowd roars. People hug each other and cry. And Gronk, lost in exultation, performs his patented touchdown celebration.

So I was a few years out of high school and my brother was 18. We decided to go to this strip club in the next town over. Let me set the mood for you, this was an 18 and up FULLY NUDE titty joint…. Real classy, well this particular night it was a $25 all you can drink beer night. My brother and I were like hell Yeah! We paid our money and steered toward the bar ready to start drinking. We roll up and ask the barkeep and asked where the “all you can drink” beer is? He pointed over to an old raggedy ass folding square table, the kind you Mexican grandma brings out during Easter, and Christmas to sit the kids at. On top of this table was a tried and true keg of beer in a trash can filled with ice. It was the good Lord giving me a sign to take my brother and run… Of course I didn’t listen, so we went up to the keg and got our cups filled with none other than KEYSTONE LIGHT! So here I am, $100 dollars deep worth of cover and beer passes, drinking keystone light, in the butt naked club… I shake all this off and we go sit near the stage, time goes by and this older stripper keeps bothering my brother, when are you going to buy me a drink? Can I sit here? Blah blah blah, he kept shooing her away, for one because he didn’t have any money, I was sponsoring this whole adventure, and for two this stripper looked like something that came out of a Tim Burton film. Nasty shaggy hair, looked like she brushed her teeth with a snickers bar, legs dimply like a golf ball, no ass to speak of. But for some reason she liked my brother. As the night went on I went to the back to get a private dance, I’m in there about 10 minutes and here comes snickers teeth! She pokes her head in and says I got your brother back her and he says you have the money. I’m like ya here’s 40 bones just to get her to go away. My dance ends, so I make my way towards the front and like a scary movie out pops snickers teeth again from one of the rooms, I look over her shoulder and I see my brother sitting on a couch, drunk, looking like hell.. I look at the girl; she looks left, then looks right as if she’s checking for the cops and whispers to me, “Ill suck your brother’s dick for 30 bucks”. I think to myself, this is a hell of a deal, so I reach in my wallet and after counting my money I say to her, “I have 11 dollars” without missing a step she says done, grabs the money and runs to my brother. I was shocked and a little pleased that I was hooking my brother up with such a bargain. So I go to take a piss and about midstream one of the bouncers tells me, hey bro you got to go. I’m like, for what? He says we caught your brother with his cock out. I’m in total shock, here I am dick in hand and this 400 pounder is telling me my brother is getting thrown out. It may have been the keystone scrambling my brain but I couldn’t understand why they would throw him out after I just paid my 11 bones to the stripper. So I hurry and finish and quickly go to the front and there is my brother between the bouncers, pants unzipped, shirt untucked and the manager is giving him this lecture. He’s like give me your wallet, my brother reaches and hands him his wallet, the manager shuffles through it trying to find some cash, with each item he takes out, the more disappointed he gets, my brother has a condom, expired Bennigan's gift card, a school ID, a receipt from game stop, and 2 dollars, the manager was so pissed he told him to just leave bro. the whole way out the door they shamed my brother, yelling, you’re despicable bro, what kind of place do you think this is, I can’t believe you…  the stripper never even got his dick in her mouth, best 11 bucks I ever spent.",Getting kicked out of the strip club,0
