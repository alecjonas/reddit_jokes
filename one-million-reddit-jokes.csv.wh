A Zach Galifianakis Poem:



Zach Galifianakis, Zach Galifianakis

The greatest actor of all

Oh..how blissful his art was

Until he shat himself all over the wall.


Zach Galifianakis, Zach Galifianakis

We are his fans and he so appreciates

Oh..how gay and merry his acting was

Until he was caught sniffing another dude's privates!


Zach &amp; Will, the best of friends

Together they spend, all their nights and days

Then one day Will said, I won't play with you no more

To that Zach said, is it because I fart in your face?


zach galifianakis, zach galifianakis

the greatest actor you will ever see

oh what a Gandhi fan he was

until zach choked on his own pee


 

              .....To Be Cuntinude

Old Man: We rarely talk any more, Doc, and I love her more than anything.  

Doc: Try the distance test. When you get home, Call her name and if she doesn't hear you, get closer and closer until she does. This will give me a good sense of how bad her hearing actually is.  

Old Man: Okay, thanks Doc. See you soon.

Nothing.  

He walks through his hall and once more shouts ""EDNA?! WHAT'S FOR DINNER?!""  
Nothing.

He walks to the door to his kitchen and sees his dearest wife over the oven cooking dinner. ""EDNA?! WHAT'S FOR DINNER?!""  
Nothing.

Frustrated, the Old Man walks right up to his wife and shouts in her ear ""EDNA?! WHAT'S FOR DINNER?!"".

The chief replied, “The drums must not stop.”

The man figured it was their culture and focused on enjoying the day, studying and spending time with the tribe.

That night, the drums again kept the man awake for the whole night and in the morning he spoke with the chief.
“Chief, please! I need some sleep; couldn’t the drums cease for just one night for my health?”

The chief replied, “The drums must not stop.”

The man, exacerbated, let the issue drop and tried to focus on the day at hand, but could not focus due to lack of sleep and the incessant pounding of the drums.

That night, the beating of the drums left the man sleepless yet again in the morning he angrily approached the chief.

Missing a crucial interchange, he runs the trains of the tracks and destroys all the cargo, wrecks the train, and kills four people in the process.

After months of trials, lawsuits, and court dates, he receives a death row sentence.

────────

Months pass and finally the week of his execution arises. With three days left to live, an Holding Officer comes to his cell and walks him through the process that will occur in the upcoming days.

Tonight you will receive 1 of your last 3 meals. You may ask for whatever food you like and we will accommodate to the best of our abilities. On the third day, before your last meal, the chaplain will come in to give you your final blessing if you desire. You will eat. Then I will come take you to the chair.

The Holding Officer leaves a notepad and pen for the man to write down his meals...

One the first day, he is brought a banana and a glass of water per his request. The office leaves a tray with the items at the foot of his cell, but gives the man a perplexed look before leaving.

The man eats the banana and drinks the water, but takes the peal and stores it under his mattress.

The second day comes and once again the office brings his order, this time with two bananas instead of one. Before leaving though, he stops to ask the man of his odd requests.

You can have any food your heart desires, and yet yesterday all you ask for was a banana, and today the same thing?? Would you not prefer a seasoned steak, or gourmet pizza? Or maybe a fancy desert like a crème brûlée??

The man thought for a moment before speaking. Without looking up from the tray of food, and barely above a murmor, spoke gently to the officer, If it concerns you that much to mention it, perhaps you could add an item to my order tomorrow

The officer's ears perked up in anticipation of the request.

I'd like an ice cream cone added to my order tomorrow. With chocolate sprinkles on top, NOT multi-colored.

The officer's look of intrigue disappeared off his face, but he acknowledged the mans' request and said he would make it so.

The third day arrives. The man sitting cross-legged in the middle of the cell waits for the officer to arrive. In one corner of his cell sits an untouched cup of water from the previous day, under his mattress two banana peels rest, with the third lodged between his thighs.

Officer shows up. Sets down the tray, proud of himself for having found chocolate sprinkles despite the kitchen's only confetti colored ones, and informs the man he'll be back in half an hour to take him to his end.

For his last meal he eats the entire banana. Peel and all. He drinks the cup of water but not the one on his tray. Taking it from the corner of the room, he pours the entire cup into his throat with his held tilted back. In one swallow it's gone.

Next, he takes the new cup of water. Individually, he sticks every single one of his fingers into the cup. With wet tips, he runs his hands through his hair for several minutes. Repeating this process until all the water in the cup is gone.

At last, he reaches his single scoop of ice cream. Chocolate sprinkles, just like he asked. A small smile crosses his face.

Then, with the grace and precision of a watch maker, he picks off every one. Every. Single. Sprinkle.

By the time all the sprinkles are removed, and stashed secretly into the banana peels under the mattress, his clock reads 2-minutes till showtime.

With his last remaining minutes he enjoys his ice cream.

────────

The helmet is strapped.

The belts are tied tight.

The man's moment of judgement has finally come.

The officer does the inspection himself, insuring everything is in order. A medic stands by ready to flip the switch. In a matter of seconds, hundreds of thousands of volts will be passing through the man's body, ending his sinful life.

The officer places his right hand on the switch. His touch lighter for some reason than all the times in the past. He asks if the man has any last words.

But the man says nothing. Instead, he shakes his head from side to side, with eyebrows raised in a show of complacency. His thighs however, squeeze tight to the banana peel between his legs.

The Officer lets out a sigh, and begins his count.

3.

2.

1.

The switch is flipped. The lights flicker. And a loud buzz is heard.

But nothing happens.

Now in the state where they reside, if any attempt past two does not successfully end a prisoner's life, he is returned to his cell and given a new term of life sentence over execution.

Full well knowing this is the case, the officer goes to check his connections. Every thing seems in order.

He returns to the switch

3.

2.

1.

The switch is flipped. The lights flicker. And a loud buzz is heard.

Still nothing.

Now a man in a suit has entered the room. He whispers something to the medic. The officer double and triple checks all the connections.

The man sits calmly. A content look rests upon his face.

The final attempt. Tensions high in the room. Everyone's breath is held.

3.

2.

1.

The switch is flipped. The lights flicker. And a loud buzz is heard.

Nothing.

Perplexed. The officer run his hand through his hair. He looks at the man sitting in the death chair, unharmed. Now a giant smile radiates from ear to ear.

The officer shouts out the man

I DON'T UNDERSTAND! HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE!? HOW ARE YOU NOT DEAD

The man smile fades, he raises one eyebrow, shrugs and mutters--

Tonight, I thought my husband was acting weird. We had made plans to meet at a nice restaurant for dinner. 
I was shopping with my friends all day long, so I thought he was upset at the fact that I was a bit late, but he made no comment on it. Conversation wasn't flowing, so I suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we could talk. He agreed, but he didn't say much.

 
I asked him what was wrong; He said, 'Nothing.' I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. He said he wasn't upset, that it had nothing to do with me, and not to worry about it.
On the way home, I told him that I loved him. He smiled slightly, and kept driving. I can't explain his behavior. I don't know why he didn't say, 'I love you, too.'

 
When we got home, I felt as if I had lost him completely, as if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore. He just sat there quietly, and watched TV. He continued to seem distant and absent. Finally, with silence all around us, I decided to go to bed. About 15 minutes later, he came to bed. But I still felt that he was distracted, and his thoughts were somewhere else. He fell asleep; I cried. I don't know what to do. I'm almost sure that his thoughts are with someone else. My life is a disaster.

He could craft the greatest of ballads, but no one would listen to them. They were too preoccupied with the two big-time poets in the neighboring castle. The poets called themselves ShakespeareA and ShakespeareB. Their work was terrible, but the common folk were so enticed with the original work of the real Shakespeare that the brand name just kept rolling. The two Shakes were so conceited that they even believed that they were actually Shakespeares, and built two identical Globes that they lived in. Dmitri was tired of their fookin shite. So he took a trip to the local assassin, a shady man who had a sweet tooth for bakery treats. The assassin was so corrupt that he'd kill a man for just a single scone. Dmitri hit it off with the assassin instantly, and they struck an emotional connection that still stands today. Dmitri's poetry about cake plucked at the assassins heart strings, so he offered to lower his price to half a scone per man killed. Dmitri smiled and agreed, and before you could say ""iambic pentameter"" the two Shakes were found mysteriously dead, a silver arrow embedded in each of their necks. After this, the common folk began to listen to Dmitri's poetry. They loved it! Dmitri enjoyed immense wealth, and he and the assassin lived in high luxury. One day a man went up to Dmitri, and asked how Shakespeare A and Shakespeare B had overshadowed him for so long. Dmitri simply answered, ""What can I say, *I killed two Bards with one scone!""*",Dmitri the poet,3

post,3433lw,2qh72,jokes,false,1430174688,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3433lw/an_elephant_story/,self.jokes,,"In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Louisiana State University .

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.

The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant.

With all the jacking off going on, it's a wonder any work is getting done, and it's making a mess all over the ship.  I don't know what to do!"" 

The other captain smiles knowingly.  ""Ah, I have a solution for that!  You take the crew and divide them into two teams.  Then you buy about 50 barrels and put them on the ship.  You tell the crew that the team that fills the most barrels wins a bag of gold."" 

""Well that's a great way to keep the ship clean, but then I'm out a bag of gold every trip!"" 

""Aha,"" replied the other captain.  ""After you get back to port, take all the barrels together and sell them to the wax factory to make into candles.  You make a tidy profit every time."" 

The captain pondered this and the next day, he took his friend's advice and divided the crew, bought a bunch of barrels, and set off to sea.  Before long, the crew took to the new system and began filling barrel after barrel.

When they finally reached port, the captain sold the barrels for a huge profit.  ""This is great,"" thought the captain, ""before long, I'll be able to buy a new boat!"" 

This went on, voyage after voyage.  Then one day, the ship happened back to that very first port.  Coming down the gangplank, the captain was surprised to see the marshal waiting for him.  As he slapped the cuffs on him, the captain cried out, ""What's the meaning of this?""

I saw sea horses, sharks, turtles, the whole shebang. But I couldn't wait to get to my favourite creature. I don't know why but I've always been fascinated by eels. I did a project on them in primary school and since then they've just stuck with me. I can name every single breed of them without even trying.
 
So I get to the eel section which is crowded beyond belief. I mean I love eels but most people just kind of glance at them on the way to the stingrays. Today there were so many people there I couldn't even see the tank. I managed to push myself to the front, accidentally shoving a toddler, and saw what all the fuss was about. 

There they were, all swimming about, hidingin crevices, doing what eels do best. Except one. I couldn't actually believe it but right in the middle of the tank there was an eel. Biggest eel in there. And it was singing. Clear as day it was singing. I don't know how we were all hearing it through the glass and the water but we could see its mouth moving perfectly with the words. It even hummed some of the music at one point so I know it wasn't a trick. It only sang the one song though, this old love song that I can't remember the name of. It's really popular though,used in loads of movies, especially ones about Italy. 

I couldn't believe it, I'd never seen an eel do this before. I knew so much about eels and yet I'd never heard of this kind before. I managed to spot an employee on the other side of the room and struggled my way over. I somehow got his attention over the noise of all the people and the singing eel. 

""How the hell does an eel know that song? How is it able to sing? What kind of eel is it?"" And he turned to me and went ""oh that's a moray"" ",Trip to the aquarium joke,11

In high school I had a friend named Simon. He wasn't popular or particularly good looking. In fact he was a little socially awkward. He was on the chess team, ate lunch in the hallways while playing card games (magic the gathering &amp; games like that), and had a roller backpack.

Now Simon had an enormous crush on this girl named Jennifer. He had spent four years (both seniors) staring at her and not once had enough courage to talk to her. Jennifer was quite simply the exact opposite of Simon. She was popular, beautiful, smart, and overall just a fantastic human being. She was a cheer leader, student body president, and captain of the debate team. Jennifer was the whole package (plus she pays her taxes).

Simon decides that he is going to ask Jennifer to the prom. Simon knows that to have a chance of going to prom with Jennifer he is going to have to do it in a spectacular way. So, Simon bought a kitten. Jennifer has a reputation of being a cat lover, FYE. He walked up to Jennifer and said, ""It would be PURRTY awesome if you went to prom with me"". Jennifer being the fantastic human being decided to make Simon's life by saying yes to his prom proposal. 

Simon now has to make sure everything is perfect for prom. So, the first thing that he needs to do is rent a tuxedo. He goes to Men’s Warehouse to pick out his tux and there is what seems like his entire school there doing the same thing. Simon has to wait in a two hour line before he gets fitted. Simon is thinking that two hours is nothing for getting to go to prom with Jennifer.

Simon wants to go all out for Jennifer and decides to rent limo. He gets to the limo rental store and again there is a crazy line to rent limos. Simon thinks whatever Jennifer is worth it. So he waits in line and rents nicest limo they have.

Prom is approaching so now Simon has to get Jennifer a corsage. He gets there and once again half of his school is there doing the same thing. Three hours pass and finally he gets the perfect corsage of roses and baby's breath to match her dress. 

The big day arrives. Simon looks handsome in his tux and Jennifer stunning in her gown. He puts the corsage on around her wrist and they get into their limo. 

They arrive to Prom and everything is going swimmingly. They do a little dancing before deciding to go over to take prom pictures. There is a massive line for pictures, but they wait anyways because they want this night immortalized forever. 

After a little bit more of dancing they decide to take a break. Jennifer feeling parched asks Simon he wouldn't mind getting them some punch. Simon feeling chivalrous obliges. Walking over to get them some punch the craziest thing happened.

THERE WAS NO PUNCH LINE.

""Why yes! I am a leprechaun. And because you guessed so, I will grant you three wishes.""

The guy says:
""Ok. I wish I had a Ferrari.""

""Granted.""

""I wish I had a smokin' hot wife.""

""Granted.""

Then the man says:
""I wish I had a bigger dick.""

The leprechaun says:
""Well, in order to grant that wish, you need to have butt sex with me first.""

The man thinks about it for a bit. After he considers it, he says:
""Well, if Im going to get a bigger dick, I guess its worth it.""

So the man bends over and lets the leprechaun screw him. After he's finished, the man says:
""I cant believe I just had butt sex!""

He was the cause of a large number of groaners. Even Ferdinand Feghoot could be outpunned on occasion – but he always rose to the challenge.


He conducted a crew of new S.A.R.H. (Society for the Aesthetic Rearrangement of History) recruits – all from late twentieth-century Terra – on a training study of Carter’s World, a newly established agricultural colony attempting to support itself by the export of edible nuts. Barely into their second generation, and having yet to show a profit, the colonists were technologically backward. Nevertheless, they showed a surprising ingenuity in the use of their few advantages. It was this resourcefulness that Feghoot was demonstrating to his rookies.

“Look at the perfection with which these streets are graded”, exclaimed one student. “Earth-moving machinery on this scale is strictly high technology stuff. How can they do it?”

“A new alleyway is being constructed, nearby”, said Feghoot. “Let us walk that way while I explain.” As they strolled, he told his students that countless centuries before, the Carter’s World system had been inhabited by a now-vanished race of giants. This very planet had served them for a nursery, and among the many artifacts they had left were thousands of childrens blocks, immense and precision-cut. You simply jack one up onto logs, bring it where you want it, put collapsible jacks underneath, snake out the logs, spread soil more or less evenly beneath, and collapse the jacks.

“I see”, said the student. “It’s not graded road at all; its a simple hammered-earth base.”

“That’s right,” Feghoot went on smoothly. “You just hit the road jack and don’t come back no mo.”

His students registered dismay and anguish.

“Isn’t that right, old-timer?,” Feghoot demanded of an ancient Carterian standing by the mouth of the newly completed alley they had just reached.

“Ahm afraid not, suh”, said the senior citizen, and the students giggled at Feghoots discomfiture. “Oh, we used to do it that way, but it was far too much trouble. It’s the soil heah. You see, the very same soil which produced our famous cashews is so high in clay content that a child could roll out a road of it. Then, we simply use a system of lenses to bake it into hardness. Ahve just completed this alley mahself, and ahm just a retired professor of Sports History, much too old and feeble to handle hydraulic jacks.

“So you see,” he finished, eyes twinkling, “Mah hammered alley is really cashews clay.”

Howls of agony rose from the students, but Feghoot never hesitated. “And he”, he said, turning to his students, “is clearly the gradist.”","A Ferdinand Feghoot ""shaggy dog"" story",2

The husband went to his doctor and told him that he and his wife didn't want to have any more children. The doctor told him there was a procedure called a vasectomy that would fix the problem but it was expensive.

A less costly alternative was to go home, get a firework, light it, put it in a beer can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10.

Paddy said to the doctor, 'I may not be the smartest guy in the world, but I don't see how putting a firework in a beer can next to my ear is going to help me.'

'Trust me, it will do the job', said the doctor.

So the man went home, lit a banger and put it in a beer can. 

He held the can up to his ear and began to count: '1, 2, 3, 4, 5,' at which point he paused, placed the beer can between his legs so he could continue counting on his other hand.

This procedure also works in Middlesbrough, Hull, Workington, Grimsby, parts of Bradford and anywhere in Scotland.

The nun shook her head.  ""No Mother, that didn't cause me to curse; it was what happened next.  As the ball was falling, a bird swooped in and the ball bounced off its back and landed several feet away from the green.""

""Why would that cause you to curse and take the Lord's name in vain, sister?""

""It didn't,"" the nun replied, ""It was what happened next.  As the ball came to rest near the green, a small rabbit dashed out of the grass and grabbed my ball in its mouth and dropped it a foot away from the hole.""

""Dad, how does a man make a baby?""

The father scratched his head, attempting to formulate an appropriate answer. The boy's mother had never been around and he had no aunts, so it was a difficult thing to try and explain. He explained the difference between masturbation and ""the real thing.""

""See,"" said the dad, ""when you're all done and 'that' happens, it goes inside the woman and makes a baby!""

The boy pondered this and said, ""I want a baby!""

The dad laughed and explained to him that he was much too young to have a baby. The boy became a bit miffed and said, ""I'll show you.""

The boy went for a walk in the woods and happened across a big rock next to a pond. Now, be reminded that in this point in his life, he had no girlfriend to have a child with, but he was determined. He pulled down his pants and went to town. When he was done, he boomed on the rock next to the pond, pulled up his pants and he went home. 

The next day, the boy came back to the pond, searching for his results. Surely enough, there sat a humongous bull frog on the rock staring right at him.

The teller is understandably taken aback by this, and asks if the frog has any collateral to cover this.

""As a matter of fact, I do!"" says the frog, and he reaches into his pocket and hands over a tiny ceramic elephant.

""What?!"" says the teller, ""This is garbage! I can't take this!""

""Well, take it up with my father then!"" The frog retorts.

""Oh yeah, and who might that be?"" The teller is quickly getting more and more annoyed at the frog.

""Why, it's Keith Richards!"" The frog is waiting impatiently, tapping his toe on the ground. ""Now, can I have that loan or not?""

""Wait right here"" the teller says, as she storms into the back room, looking for her manager. 

""There's a frog out there who claims to know you, and wants a million dollar loan. He claims his father his Keith Richards! He even gave me this as collateral,"" she says, holding up the elephant. ""I mean, what even is this?""

They're an elderly couple. Nobody of his age that he would like. Unfortunately, the child is home-schooled, too, so he has no chance of making friends at school. The child's parents decide that they should get him into comics in hopes that he might realize that some of the greatest heroes didn't have friends as a child, either. The child, at the age of 6, walks into the shop. He looks around and sees a Superman comic. Smiling, the boy begs his father for the comic. He gets the comic, and they walk home happily with the comic. When they get home, the boy begins to read the comic.

As the boy goes into his teens, he has many comics, action figures, and superhero movies. Cups and plates are strewed all over the floor, since the teenager is too immersed in his comics to return them to the kitchen. One day, the mother of the boy walks in his room, and he throws a Hulk action figure at her, screaming, ""HULK SMASH THOSE WHO NO KNOCK!"" The mother, shocked by the action figure, accidentally drops a china plate she was cleaning with a wash cloth. The plate falls onto the figure, snapping off it's head as they hit the floor. The teenager starts shouting insults at the mother, and eventually she slaps him. The teenager screams and cries so loudly that the very elderly lady across the street (the elderly man passed on a few years back) calls the police for a case of child abuse. The mother gets arrested, and the father and his son are deeply saddened.

One day, the teen decides to try illegal drugs and alcohol. As he walks along the sidewalk, searching for illegal dealers, he hears a beautiful tune. He decides to drop illegal activities and start a band, simply because of this tune. When the new band is deciding a name, the teen begins to think: the elderly lady across the street  called the cops to get my mom arrested. If my mom wasn't arrested, I wouldn't have gotten interested in illegal activities. If I hadn't gotten into illegal activities, I wouldn't hear the song that made me start this. So technically, an elder caused me to start this band. But for her to know it was abuse the night I screamed and not me seeing a spider or something, she must have been experienced. She must have seen a thousand worlds. To see so many things, you gotta be brave!

So, the teen suggests they call themselves The Elder Who Is So Brave They Have Seen 1,000 Worlds. The band agrees, and they play loudly into the night.

One day, as the teen walks into the kitchen for breakfast, the father says that a new recording studio has opened up down the block and they're looking for ""new blood"" and that the band should try and get one of their songs up. The teen's new step-mother and baby step-sister laugh. Getting angry and feeling rebellious, the teen tells his band. They go down to the studio and find out that they now have a recording label.

A couple years later, The Elder Who Is So Brave They Have Seen 1,000 Worlds is invited to a big studio in Hollywood since they've gained so much fame. Saying goodbye to their original recording label, the band and their families move to Hollywood. They release a new album, which tops the charts. Now the band is known by everyone.

One day, the band is practicing in the teen's garage. Suddenly, a small spider crawls in. The band screams, knocking over all of their equipment and causing a ruckus.

Suddenly, a young woman who was watching the band on the sidewalk at the time began to laugh out loud. Another woman came along and asked what was so funny.

""This old guy just tore down his garage because of a tiny spider!""

Now the fly noticed that if it moved about three inches down the leaf it would catch some mist off the pond, and cool down a bit.

Now in the pond there was a Fish, and the fish noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, it would be able to jump up out of the water and eat the fly.

Now next to the pond behind a tree there was a Bear, and the bear noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, the fish would jump out of the water to get the fly and the bear could come out from behind the tree and catch the fish for dinner.

Now across from the pond eating a cheese sandwich was a Hunter, and the hunter noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, the fish would jump out of the water to get the fly and the bear would come out from behind the tree to catch the fish and the hunter could drop his cheese sandwich and shoot the bear.

Now in a log next to the hunter was a mouse, and the mouse noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, the fish would jump out of the water to get the fly and the bear would come out from behind the tree to catch the fish and the hunter would drop his cheese sandwich to shoot the bear and the mouse could come out of his log to get the cheese sandwich.

Now behind the log there was a Cat, and the cat noticed that if the fly moved down about three inches, the fish would jump out of the water to get the fly and the bear would come out from behind the tree to catch the fish and the hunter would drop his cheese sandwich to shoot the bear and the mouse would come out of its log to eat the cheese sandwich and the cat could jump out from behind the log to get the mouse.

SO, sure enough, the Fly moves down about three inches, the Fish jumpes out of the water, the Bear comes out from behind the tree, the Hunter droppes his sandwich, the Mouse comes out of the log, the Cat jumpes over the log to get the Mouse and misses and falls in the pond.

TL/DR if the fly moves down about three inches, some pussy is gonna get wet.

He decided he wanted to propose, so he purchased an expensive ring, booked a spectacular cruise, and told his girlfriend to meet him at the fanciest restaurant on the boat at seven.

He got there a bit early--around six o'clock--to prepare. The entrance to the restaurant was across from the railing of the boat, and he looked out into the sea and pondered this huge event. He took out the ring and looked at it. ""Is this the person I want to marry?"" he asked himself. ""Do I want to spend the rest of my life with her? I love her, but... do I love her forever??"" He began to get antsy. Just as he realized that he loved her more than he could bear, that nothing could keep them apart for the rest of their days, and that this was the time to propose, a big wave crashed along the side of the boat, knocking the ring into the ocean.

It was seven o'clock. Disappointed, but undeterred, he went into the restaurant to meet his beloved. He sat down with her, trying to determine the best way to pop the question. The waiter came around and offered the specials, which they took without thinking. He got a lovely steak, and she got fresh fish, caught from the side of the boat.

For what felt like an eternity, he worked up the courage and found the right time to propose. The food came out, and he began. She cut into the fish just as he asked her those fateful words... and guess what was inside the fish?

Inside the sound of pool balls clicking and shot glasses slamming drown out the sound of the broken-down jukebox struggling to carry a tune. He sits in a wobbly seat. 


""What'll be this time?"" The bartender asked.

""The same as every time."" The duck sneered. 

The bartender served the duck a shot of cheap gin and left the bottle. The duck pulled out a cigarette and struck a match, and ordered a second bottle.

""What's the problem? You trying to drink yourself to death? 

""Maybe I am. Maybe my time is up, maybe it's time for this miserable old duck to finally fly south for the winter.""

""Look, you keep talking like that people are gonna start thinking you need some help. Like you maybe need to talk to someone.""

""Talk to who?""

""You know...A therap-""

""A QUACK?!""

""You don't have to call them that, they're just trying to help.""

""Fuck their help. I don't need nobody's help. The only thing I need is a little bit of wind and a clear take off. You always think you know best, like how somehow serving people poison gives you some great insight to how to improve their lives. Well fuck you! I'm all that I need, and you remember that!""

""But-""

""But what? What do you have to say?""

""...Ducks fly together.""

""You son of a bitch.""

The duck saw his reflection in the bottom of his empty shotglass. He was old, and bitter, and worthless, and all the other things he said he would never be. He looked up and saw the the other patrons, staring back at him with wide-eyes and slightly dropped jaws. 

""I'm sorry everybody. I've just been so stressed lately, both under and above the water. Drinks are on me."" 

And the duck drank with the patrons and there were smiles to be had. The duck felt so much better he bought the bar another round. And as he waddled out on the dance floor everything seemed a little brighter, the smell of foul beer and snuffed cigarettes faded from the air and even the jukebox sprang to life as the  duck gathered the confidence to approach a swan drinking a martini while the other drunken patrons vied for her attention. In a drunken swirl of self-confidence and momentum he stumbled up to the swan and whispered in her "" These niggas is fowl and its duck seazon.""

The duck grabbed the swan and together they walked out of the bar onto a street that looked a little better - or at least less shitty - and a little bit more worth living for. They fell into a cab and as it drove away the bartender came out shouting ""You never paid! You never paid!""

And the duck stuck his head out of the window and shouted back.

At closing time, he saw a fellow stumble out of the bar, trip on the curb and try his keys on five different cars before he found his. Then he sat in the front seat fumbling around with his keys for several minutes. Everyone left the bar and drove off. Finally, he started his engine and began to pull away. The police officer was waiting for him. He stopped the driver, read him his rights and administered a Breathalyzer test. The results showed a reading of 0.0. The puzzled officer demanded to know how that could be.


The driver replied, ""Tonight, I'm the designated decoy.""

The first thing they see are the gas pumps.  Thinking that the gas pumps might be sentient artificial life forms, the first alien goes up and says,

&gt;""Greetings!  We are visitors from planet Omicron Persei IV.  Please take us to your leader.""

Naturally, the gas pumps don't respond.  A bit miffed, the first alien tries a different tact.

&gt;""Hello and salutations, oh noble Creature of the Third Planet.  We humbly request your assistance in making first contact with your leaders.""

Still no response.  And so the cycle goes a few more times, each time the alien becomes a bit more beseeching and a bit more annoyed.  Finally, fed up with this non-response, the first alien pulls out his ray gun.

&gt;""Please take us to your leader, or be immolated!""

At which point, the second alien immediately chimes in.

&gt;""Uh, hey, you probably don't want to do that.""

Ignoring the second alien, the first alien tries again.

&gt;""You have to the count of three to say something.  Anything!""

Second alien chimes in again.

&gt;""Seriously man, let's just go, you don't want to threaten these guys.""

Still ignoring the second alien, the first alien proceeds to carry out his threat.

&gt;""One.........  Two..........  THREE!""  And the first alien pulls the trigger.  Which results in a massive explosion.  When the aliens come to in a crater some 1000 feet away, the first alien turned to the second alien.

The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the bird’s mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity.

John tried and tried to change the bird’s attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to ‘clean up’ the bird’s vocabulary.

Finally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even more rude. John, in desperation, threw up his hand, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer.

For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute. Fearing that he’d hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John’s outstretched arms and said “I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I’m sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior.”

John was stunned at the change in the bird’s attitude. As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird spoke-up, very softly, “May I ask what the turkey did?”

After introductions and typical small talk, they discover that these aliens are galactic swingers, and they were  looking to do a little swapping.

The couple decided that, since they were representing all of humanity, they would play along.  

The wife takes the male alien upstairs to the main bedroom, while the husband takes the female to the guest room.

When the male pulls down his pants, the wife discovers he has a tiny penis...smaller than a golf tee.  She chuckled a little bit, and told him ""We aren't going to be doing much with that little thing!""  

The alien, with a twinkle in his eye replied...""Come over here and tug on my right ear.""  So she did, and his penis grew straight out 14 inches!  But it was still as thin as a pencil...

He then said ""Tug on my left ear now...""  After doing so, the alien cock fattened up like a super sized summer sausage!

The alien, annoyed by what he perceived to be the gas pumps haughty attitude, drew his ray gun, and said impatiently, ""Greetings earthling. We come in peace. How dare you ignore us in this way! Take us to your leader, or I'll fire!""

The other alien shouted to his comrade, ""No, you don't want to make him mad!"" But before he finished his warning, the first alien fired.

There was a huge explosion that blew both of them 200 meters into the desert, where they landed in a heap rather abruptly. When they finally regained consciousness, the one who fired turned to the other one and said, ""What a ferocious creature. It damn near killed us! How did you know it was so dangerous?""

The other alien answered, ""If there's one thing I've learned during my travels through the galaxy, when a guy has a penis he can wrap around himself twice and then stick it in his own ear, you don't mess with him.""",Two Aliens in the Desert,38

'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'
'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'

Sam Clam was a lobster; Larry Lobster was a clam. Remember this.

Sam Clam had six kids, four of whom were boys, one of whom was a girl, and one of whom was a horrifying mutation without a gender. His wife had left him when it was discovered that he was also a huge drug dealer and hitman.

Larry Lobster had no kids but had a wife.

Sam Clam worked as an entrepreneur, while Larry Lobster was a humble chicken farmer.

The two, as stated above, were best friends! They did everything together, from driving to the grocery store to playing video games.

This friendship started 69 years ago, when each of them was only 4 years old, and they had been best buddies ever since, even entering old age together. Eventually, the two died at the same time, both of heart attacks after watching 2 Girls 1 Cup.

Because Larry Lobster had been a good Christian, he went to Heaven. Meanwhile, Sam Clam, who was a filthy cheater and a criminal that also was an atheist and hated Jews, went to Hell.


One day in heaven, St. Peter noticed that Larry Lobster was sad. 

""What's the matter, Larry?"", he asked. ""You have all the money and cars and hot, busty virgins in the world! What could possibly be wrong?""

""I just miss my pal Sam, who is in Hell!""

St. Peter considered this and decided that he could arrange a meeting between the two for one day, which Larry Lobster agreed to.

Larry went down to hell and packed his angel stuff, including his harp, halo, and wings. 

He was amazed in Hell! His old pal Sam owned a massive disco place that all the demons boogied in during their free time. The old buddies spent the entire day dancing and having fun.

Eventually, it was time for Larry to leave.

""Wait!"", said Sam Clam. ""I think you forgot something.""

""What could I possible have forgotten? I have my halo and wings right here..."", Larry Lobster said.

""Is that everything?"", Sam Clam said.

""Wait a minute! You're right!"", said Larry Lobster. ""I Lost My Harp in Sam Clam's Disco!""

As the woman walked into her house, she saw Jerves sitting by himself in the dining room. She called for him to follow her, and led him into the master bedroom. She then closed and locked the door.

She looked at him and smiled. ""Jerves,"" she said, ""take off my dress."" He did this carefully. ""Jerves,"" she continued, ""take off my stockings and garter."" He silently obeyed her. ""Jerves,"" she then said, ""remove my bra and panties."" As he did this, the tension continued to mount.

post,33ratk,2qh72,jokes,false,1429911735,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/33ratk/racist_jokes/,self.jokes,,"So I like this sub for the occasional one liner or [sensible chuckle every now and then.](https://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m84tmvNfOP1qa4kw5o1_1280.gif).

I've also noticed that there are quite a many racist jokes that tend to get upvoted to the front page of the sub and are usually rife with arguments in the comments section on whether or not the joke is racist (if your discussing whether or not it is, then there obviously is some sort of racial prejudice being introduced).

Just wondering what this community thought of that, if they think of it at all. Just to be clear I am a white male in my early twenties so personally I have never experienced attacks of racial bias, but I do feel shame whenever I see a racially charged joke on here because I know for a fact that humor reflects personality. It's impossible to separate oneself from the humor that one finds affinity with. And if you think that a joke about a bunch of black people stealing a car because of the racial stereotype that black people commit crime is funny because of the content and not because of the irony of the racial bias that is being highlighted, then I have to say I think your a bad person. 

Making jokes about racial prejudice isn't inherently racist. Just when the joke relies on the negative racial bias being a common thought. That makes it racist. 

Maybe I am overthinking this, but I know a lot of people don't like to think about race at all because the mere thought of it makes them worried they are going to be considered racist. That being said, if you don't think about racism then you can still be racist. So think about it you fucking racists. Think about why something is funny to you and if it's because of negative bias or harmful thoughts, then maybe try and think about something more positive.

There's enough racism out in the real world, we don't need to glorify it here.",Racist Jokes,1

So Jimmy says ""Another kid said 'bitch.' What's a bitch?""

The mother thinks for a moment, then says ""Well, a female dog is a bitch. So they were probably talking about a female dog.""

Jimmy nods, and walks away. But he still thinks that there must be more to it than what his mother was telling him. So he goes upstairs to where his father is sitting in his office, to ask him. 

""Daddy, I heard some words today on the playground and I asked Mommy what they meant and she told me, but I don't think she really knows. Can you tell me what the two words mean?""

The father looks at Jimmy and says ""Sure. I'd be glad to. What's the first word?""

Jimmy says ""Well, Daddy, what's a pussy?""

Jimmy's dad opens up a drawer in his desk and pulls out a Penthouse magazine. He flips to the centerfold. Then he grabs a sharpie marker and draws a circle around the centerfold's vagina. He points to it and says, decisively, ""That, son. THAT is a pussy.""

The man stumbled around the car park for a few minutes, with the officer quietly observing.

After what seemed an eternity and trying his keys on five vehicles, the man managed to find his car which he fell into. He sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off. Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off (it was a fine dry night) flicked the indicators on, then off, tooted the horn and then switched on the lights. He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little and then remained stationery for a few more minutes as some more vehicles left.

At last he pulled out of the car park and started to drive slowly down the road. The police officer, having patiently waited all this time, now started up the patrol car, put on the flashing lights, promptly pulled the man over and carried out a breathalyzer test. To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence of the man having consumed alcohol at all!

A navy mine hunter reportedly made a “contact of interest” while conducting an underwater search for Squalus. The contact was detected in the Duke of York Islands, about 500 miles northeast of Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea.

“We need to get more detailed analysis. The search area was determined using local historical accounts, including one from Pacific islanders who spoke of a “monster” that approached a nearby reef and then disappeared.

Upon closer inspection they found out the ship is, in fact, not a U.S. vessel but the Australian vessel, the AE1.
