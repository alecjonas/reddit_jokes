As they cross the river, a tribe of savages charge out of the trees and surround them. The tribe Chief steps forward and says

“This river sacred ground... you trespass on sacred ground! Now, as punishment, you DIE.”

The Chief goes on to explain that after they kill them, the tribe will use their skin to make canoes. They will then sail these canoes on the river as a warning to future trespassers. 

However, (as he is a kind leader) the Chief decides that although the three men  must die, they may choose how they die and even do it themselves if they wish. The three men agree, and the Englishman goes first

“I would like a gun, please”

The Chief hands him a gun. The Englishman thanks him, shouts “GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!” and blows his own brains out. The tribe drag his corpse away to turn into a canoe. The Frenchman goes next

“I would like some poison, si vous plait”

The Chief hands him some poison. The Frenchman thanks him, shouts “VIVA LA FRANCE!” and drinks it. He instantly dies, and the tribe drag his corpse away to turn into a canoe. Finally, it’s the Scotsman’s turn 

“I want a fork”

The Chief is very confused, but nevertheless hands him a fork. The Scotsman thanks the Chief, before beginning to frantically stab himself all over his body. His arms, legs, face, chest, back, anywhere he can reach. After a good thirty seconds, he finally drops the fork, blood now gushing from the hundreds of tiny holes across his body.

One day in third grade we were all sitting on the carpet listening to our teacher read something. My stomach hadn’t been too kind to me that day. ....... 


You know that feeling when you can tell an abnormally massive fart is making its way downward, and you’re doing everything in your power to stop it? Well let’s just say the flood gates didn’t close in time on this particular day. 


What is hands down the longest, loudest, most disgusting passage of methane gas I’ve ever generated occurred less than 5 feet from my teacher and in front of all my classmates. I mean this thing had to have lasted a solid 10-12 seconds. This thing was probably on par with a Yellowstone Supervolcano eruption. It was like irritable bowel syndrome on steroids. 


After the damage to our atmosphere had been done, the class went dead silent. I remember looking at my classmates behind me to pretend that it wasn’t me who’d broken the sound barrier that day. Somehow, the teacher didn’t realize it was me.",Embarrassing Fart Story,4

Again, the atheist tries to thank the devil, but he only says ""Everyone down here gets some cool cars! How would you drive around without having cars?"".

They walk on and the area gets even nicer. There are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere. They arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. She looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. The man couldn´t be any happier. The devil says ""Everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!""

As they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. He peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. There are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. Other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. A stench of sulfur is in the air.

I sleep on a top bunk bed because I stripped the bottom bunk out to make space for my piano and cupboards. Total walking space in my bedroom - a modest 3m². Ideal for moments of circular contemplation.

I was telling my boss about all this recently. She's a lovely woman. Very thoughtful and accommodating, appreciative, caring and happy. And she likes to enjoy a nice craft beer at the end of the day.

I was telling her about the miserly amount of sleeping space I get in my bunk bed, because it's made of metal and has a headboard and feetboard(?) which locks my 6'4"" body inside a 6'3"" frame. So most nights I sleep like an unmotivated starfish. If its proper baltic and the metal feetboard feels like ice on my toes then I will sleep fetal - but I prefer not be scrunched up.

My boss listened attentively to my tales of woe, which must have been very boring for her.

I moaned about the unsatisfactory dimensions of UK bunk beds, and how successive generations of kids are generally taller than the last, but bunk bed lengths hadn't reflected this trend in child growth.

Then I instantly ruined all sympathy in the air by talking about the perfect length a mattress would have to be for me, by asserting to my boss - ""If I want to feel completely relaxed in bed then I'd need at least 4 inches to play with"".",How to ruin sympathy fast,2

Upset but hungry, he purchases the sub. After taking the sandwich from the bag, an equally disapproving worker comes up to him and says ""Sorry sir, but the Arjoques sub doesn't have any original contents. Everything in here is stolen.""",A man walks into a Subway...,37

My grandfather was always playing pranks on people. He was originally from Ireland before he moved to the US. He fit all of the stereotypes of an Irishman, having red hair and beard, constantly being at the bar, and having an accent so thick that I could barely understand him even though I knew him for years.

In addition to all these traits, grandpa was a rather short man. Everyone he met called him a leprechaun, always asking him for his pot of gold or his Lucky Charms. They even called him a leprechaun while he still lived in Ireland, saying he was the spitting image of one.

At first, he was annoyed, just wanting to get a drink without the hassle. But after a while, he began to take advantage of the name. He was always getting people at the bar to do stupid stuff for a chance at a pot of gold. After all, it isn't that hard to convince a drunk person that a short Irish ginger is an actual leprechaun.

He was doing this for decades, and without fail there would always be at least one person at the bar he frequents that would try to get a pot of gold.

Many years passed, and grandpa started to go to the bar less and less. He said since he was getting older, he would much rather stay at home and watch whatever is on the television instead of going out to bars, getting drunk and playing pranks.

A few years later, grandpa was hospitalized. Doctors said it was his liver failing. Even though he stopped drinking recently, all the decades of abuse his liver took have finally caught up to him. Instead of being horrified or worried, grandpa looked peaceful, almost relieved. He began to calmly write his will, giving his possessions away to family members.

For most people, he wrote down normal items, like his car, television, or house. But he gave me something very different. Instead of including it in his will, he decided to give it to me in person when there was nobody else around.

""Listen,"" be began to say to me, ""I need to tell you something very important. All those years of joking about being a leprechaun... those were not jokes. I really am a leprechaun. Here, take this."" he said, handing me what looks like a small lump of metal. ""That, my boy, is my pot of gold. It might not look like much now, but if you place it down at the end of a rainbow, it will explode into a shower of golden coins. It's very important that you tell nobody about this.""

Of course, I thought he was just pulling another prank, like he has all these years before. But honestly, what do I have to lose? The next time I found a rainbow, I placed the metal at the end of it. I'm waiting for something to happen as I'm writing this, I'll keep you updated.

Edit: Wow, this really blew up! Thanks for the gold!",My grandfather was always playing pranks on people.,29

The High Council of Men stood atop a massive mountain, which many people had died climbing. However, David and Lisa believed their love to be stronger than anyone’s and so they set about the journey. Starting off, Lisa packed three large meals in her backpack. One was a vegetarian meal, one was a large chicken kebab, and the last one was a pork stew. David was a bit different in his packing. He packed three types of weapons, for he had heard that there were many different types of creatures on this mountain. He packed a machete, a multitool, and a large Bowie knife. 

So, they left for the mountain. The journey there, however was blocked by The Forest of Darkness. When they arrived at the Forest, they found that their path was blocked by a large cluster of brambles. “Have no fear, Lisa!”, David proclaimed as he took out his machete. “I will get us through these brambles.” David set to hacking apart the cluster. However, while he was doing so, a large wolf attacked the pair. David tried to fend off the wolf, but it was to no avail. The machete was not nearly powerful enough to pierce the wolf’s skin. Lisa suddenly remembered her pork stew! She knew wolves loved pork, and so she threw the pork stew across the brambles. The wolf leapt off of David and attempted to get through the brambles but was cut to death by the sharp thorns. 

After David had cut through the rest of the brambles, the two found it very easy to get through the Forest. As it turned out, the Forest of Darkness was actually quite bright in the daytime. They had now arrived at the mountain. The pair climbed for 12 hours straight, but they were barely halfway up the mountain. David was very tired after being attacked by the wolf, and was almost ready to give up when they came across a tavern. Inside the tavern was an old man. Lisa asked, “Excuse me sir. We are a loving couple who need to get to the top of this mountain and talk to the High Council of Men. Is there anyway to get to the top easier?” The old man looked at the pair and he could see that what they had was truly true love. He said, “I normally don’t do this, but if you have any meat on you, I’ll let you use a new-fangled machine I built out of spare parts. I call it the Treadation and I got it’s parts from the High Council of Men themselves.” Lisa decided to give him their second meal, the chicken kebab in exchange for the Treadation. David decided to give him his knife so that he could eat the kebab.  Incredibly, the machine could fly, and took them all the way to the top of the mountain! 

Lisa and David had finally reached the top of the perilous mountain and they were at the foot of the High Council of Men. They walked in to the building and were met with a dozen men sitting on high thrones. The Man to the center left spoke first. “David and Lisa, you have endured many trials to arrive at this location. However, before you can get married, you must show the council that you are pure of heart. Do you have any proof that you shall not harm anyone as long as you both live?” Lisa smiled and pulled out her vegetarian meal and said, “My future-husband and I have never harmed another animal! In fact, we do not even eat meat.” This, of course, was not true, but the High Council did not know that. 

“And you, David, what do you have in your backpack?”, said the man on the center right. Lisa gasped, knowing her husband’s predilection for weapons. David pulled out a small multitool. The High Council of Men gasped. “What, pray tell are those for?” The one on the left boomed. David explained, “Sir, as you can see, I am deeply in love with my wife. On this multitool, there is a small pair of scissors which I was planning to use to cut a couple of flowers for Lisa as a gift before our wedding day.” This was also not true, as the multitool also had a viciously sharp knife which cut through stone like butter. However, the High Council did not know this. After what seemed like an eternity, the third man from the left spoke. “I call for a vote of the High Council to rule on Lisa and David’s union. All in favor please rise.” In a few seconds, everyone in the High Council rose. David and Lisa has done it! They could finally get married! The ninth person suddenly spoke, “However, The High Council of Men do have one condition.” David, who was quite ready for this to be over with, said, “Name your price, I would do anything for my Lisa!” The man said, “We understand you acquired the machine outside from a man who owns a tavern on this mountain. This machine was made from spare parts that he acquired from us. As such, we would like to ask you not to break that machine.” David readily agreed. 

Lisa and David set out to finally make it down the mountain. They get in the Treadation and fly their way down the mountain with ease, over the Forest of Darkness and all the way home. Their parents were delighted to see them, since they were convince that they would die climbing the mountain. The wedding was set for the next day and everyone was invited. Of course, David wanted to show off the incredible machine that had made it all possible, the Treadation. He set it up to be the centerpiece of the wedding. The day of the wedding came and Lisa and David has written their vows. They got up to the platform and the priest conducted the rites. As David began reading his vows however, Lisa’s father, who was incredibly drunk, crashed into the Treadation! The Treadation collapsed and the motor turned on. The wheels began to turn and the Treadation’s propellors spun and crashed into David and Lisa, instantly killing them both. 

David’s last words were: I never wanted to break the High Men’s Treadation.","A man and woman, named David and Lisa were trying to get married in the olden days.",2

One day, the odd rabbi out, after the usual ""3 to 1, majority rules"" statement that signified that he had lost again, decided to appeal to a higher authority.""Oh, God!"" he cried. ""I know in my heart that I am right and they are wrong! Please give me a sign to prove it to them!""It was a beautiful, sunny day. 

As soon as the rabbi finished his prayer, a storm cloud moved across the sky above the four. It rumbled once and dissolved. ""A sign from God! See, I'm right, I knew it!"" But the other three disagreed, pointing out that storm clouds form on hot days.So the rabbi prayed again: ""Oh, God, I need a bigger sign to show that I am right and they are wrong. So please, God, a bigger sign!"" This time four storm clouds appeared, rushed toward each other to form one big “cloud, and a bolt of lightning slammed into a tree on a nearby hill.""I told you I was right!"" cried the rabbi, but his friends insisted that nothing had happened that could not be explained by natural causes.

The rabbi was getting ready to ask for a *very big* sign, but just as he said, ""Oh God...,"" the sky turned pitch black, the earth shook, and a deep, booming voice intoned, ""HEEEEEEEE'S RIIIIIIIGHT!""The rabbi put his hands on his hips, turned to the other three, and said, ""Well?""

They had just finished their big talk when an eighteen-wheeler pulls up in the middle of the pasture with only ONE ANIMAL IN IT: the biggest Son-of-Another-Bull these guys had ever seen! At 4700 pounds, each step he took toward the ground strained the steel ramp to the breaking point.

The second bull says, “I’ll have plenty of cows to take care of if I just stay on the opposite end of the pasture from HIM. I’m certainly not looking for an argument.”

They look over at their young friend, the third bull, and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns, and snorting up a storm.

Could he be the same guy that I had a secret crush on, way back then?

Upon seeing him, however, I quickly discarded any such thought. This balding, gray-haired man with the deeply lined face was way too old to have been my classmate.

There was a man who worked for the Post Office whose job it was to process all the mail that had illegible addresses.
One day, a letter came addressed in a shaky handwriting to God with no address. He thought he should open it to see what it was about.
The letter read:
Dear God,
I am an 83 year old widow, living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had £100 in it, which was all the money I had until my next pension cheque.
Next Sunday is Christmas, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner.
Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with. I have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope.
Can you please help me?
Sincerely,
Edna

The postal worker was touched. He showed the letter to all the other workers. Each one dug into his or her wallet and came up with a few pounds. By the time he made the rounds, he had collected £96, which they put into an envelope and sent to the woman.
The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of Edna and the dinner she would be able to share with her friends.
Christmas came and went.

A few days later, another letter came from the same old lady to God.
All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened.
It read:
Dear God, 
How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your gift of love, I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day and I told my friends of your wonderful gift.
By the way, there was £4 missing.

As he's enjoying his drink, a nun walks by, and glares at him sourly. ""How can you pollute your soul with the Devil's drink like that?"" she asks.

The man shrugs. ""It's not the Devil, it's just whiskey.""

""But it's sinful and wicked!""

""How do you know it's so bad, then? Have you ever tasted whiskey?""

""Of course not! My sisters and mother superior told me how evil drink is.""

""But how do they know? Have they ever had a drink?""

They go back and forth like this for a while, before at last, the nun relents. ""Well, I suppose that if I were to try a sip of whiskey, I would better understand how it corrupts the soul. But it wouldn't do for any of my sisters to come by here and see me drinking. Could you order me one in a teacup?""

The man agrees this is fair, and walks inside to the barman.

""Two whiskeys, but put one in a teacup, please.""

The barman slams his hand down on the bar and shouts, ""Is that damn nun here again!?""",A man walks into a bar and orders a whiskey,10552

Do you ever stop and think about something that you would like to invent to make society happier? I do. I think we should make bike seats that are designed to accommodate the anatomy of men. Guys, have you noticed that whenever you get done with your ride you have lost the desire to have children at any point in your life? You feel like you just did squat exercises over a bear trap for two hours. Bike ride? Ha. I call it self-neutering. Heck, the seats should be considered a public health emergency the way they are currently designed! These things frickin kill people! Don’t believe me? Check this out. There should be a sticker on every single one of these when you buy it warning you of potential health effects it can cause. 


“Warning: using this item may cause: lasting numbness in the testicular area, low sperm count, the sudden need to urinate, possible explosion of the ball bag if you sit on it long enough, discomfort when engaging in other forms of sitting (such as attending a movie, eating at a restaurant, working at a cubicle, watching TV, or using the John), temporary or even permanent waddling, bullying from peers, difficulty in maintaining a relationship, temporary (possibly permanent) loss of desire to have children, limited things you can do in bed, eventual divorce if you’re married, having to deal with lawyers, financial ruin, possible addiction to adult films, inability to orgasm (if not make it extremely painful rather than pleasurable), suddenly understanding how your dog feels, previously unneeded creation of profiles on websites such as Tinder and eHarmony, addiction to these websites, severe depression, years of therapy and spending large sums of money on it, and possible suicidal thoughts.” 


This list of things I have made up, albeit extremely exaggerated, is the reason why each gender should have custom bike seats. For males, design the seat with a padded divot under the affected area. It would make bike riding so much more enjoyable wouldn’t it? I think this idea would gather so much support that it just might work. Everyday folks who enjoy the adrenaline rush of exercising would support it. I’d almost expect professional cyclists to show support, especially Tour de France riders. Heck, those poor people have to sit on these things while going up and down mountains for weeks! Not to mention that they probably have to practice a heck of a lot in their spare time! They probably go through hell between events when the cameras aren’t on them. When all is said and done, after they sit on one of these things for so long, Merriam-Webster will probably be able to add an entirely new definition of “ball chin” to the dictionary. We could even turn this into an entire movement! Hashtag SaveTheTesticles. I can see it now, every major corporation in the cycling industry would begin mass production after enough coercion from the public. Schwinn, Diamondback, Giant, Trek, Mongoose, all mass producing these new seats! Everyone who enjoys riding a bicycle will now be able to do it without all the needless pain in the nuts afterwards. The only problem that we’d encounter while mass producing these new seats would be the mountains of old bike seats decaying and polluting the earth. We can’t have that. There’s got to be other ways we can use the old seats.... like getting terrorists and other dangerous criminals to talk. You make a terrorist sit on one of these things for an hour and he’ll almost certainly talk then! Believe that. “Alright if you’re not gonna give us intel we’re gonna make you sit on this thing!” The guy would s—- himself and then start talking. You could make a decent argument that that is a worse punishment than being sentenced to Guantanamo Bay! The current layout of a bike seat could qualify it as a torture device! If we gave bike seats to the military I think we’d be achieving peace in the Middle East a lot quicker. The same method of use could be applied to murderers who won’t disclose where they hid the bodies. “What did you do with Mrs. Smith? ...... He’s not talkin Jim, bring out the seat!” Within seconds the guy’s attitude will completely change. “Alright she’s in the cornfield! She’s in the cornfield! Please don’t make me sit on that!”


What are some nicer ways in which we can use old bike seats? I know! These things could also be a pretty durable chew toy for dogs! You could donate a ton of these things to animal shelters and help keep the poor dogs from going nuts in those cages they’re kept in twenty three hours a day! That would lead to greater adoption rates and hopefully many dogs staying in homes permanently. We may actually have enough of these things to cover every dog in every shelter on the planet! We still may have to find more ways to use these things!


Other ways we could use the old seats....... how about learning to sing? If you own a bike seat, you don’t need to pay for lessons. Sit on your seat for awhile and you’ll soon have the voice of Michael frickin Jackson.",Bike Seats (How To Neuter Yourself),0

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.

**“5 minutes”**: If she’s getting dressed, this means 30 minutes. It only means 5 minutes if you have been given just 5 more minutes to stay on the computer before helping her with the housework.

**“Nothing”**: This is the calm before the storm. It means ""something"". So be on your guard because arguments that begin with “nothing” usually end in ""fine"".

**“Go ahead”**: This is a dare, not a permission to do it. SO DON'T DO IT.

**“Loud sigh”**: Although not actually a word, the loud sigh is often misunderstood by men. It means she thinks you are stupid and wonders why she’s wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over ""nothing"".

**“That's OK”**: One of the most dangerous statements that she can make to a man. It means that she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake.

**“Thanks”**: This is the least used word in her vocabulary. If she’s thanking you, don’t question it. Just say ""you're welcome"" and back out of the room slowly.",Help for Men - Words &amp; Phrases Used by Women and What They Really Mean,17
