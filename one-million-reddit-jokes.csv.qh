Down the Lane and through the Dell.

Santa's Big Fat Sack is coming,

Know this Tale and Hark thee well.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Santa's Sack is glistening Red

From the Tension of its Presents.

Every Girl and Boy awaits -  

Tensely squirming for Its Presence.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Santa's Big Fat Sack is coming,

Shoving down your Chimney Hole.

Haunting you in every Household,

Music in Department Stores.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Santa chews his Milk &amp; Cookies,

Sitting by an Open Fire.

Santa's Big Fat Sack awaits,

On his Sled are our Desires.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Tis' the Season for his Sack,

Push your Legs, Bow your Back.

You will work to fill the Sack,

You'll accrue some Overtime.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Santa's Big Fat Sack is coming,

Cuckold to the Sack you'll be!

Only Santa's Big Fat Sack

Deposits Presents round your Tree!

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Wrapping paper, Christmas Morning:

Santa's Sack has Flown and Gone.

But Know that Santa always Watches,

From his Icy Winter Throne.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If you're Nice, the Sack will Bulge,

For the Naughty, it'll Wither. Now, forever - Frozen Winter.

Now! Send your Wishes! 3, 2, 1... (Everyone says their wish.)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; **Standard Acknowledgement of The Oath-Bound Order:**

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; **Read Santa's Big Fat Sack is Coming, out loud, every December 18th at the Exact Stroke of Midnight.**

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; **Carefully recite each of these Words and surely you'll successfully invoke Santa and his Big, Jolly, Fat Sack.** 

 ""Santa's Big Fat Sack is Coming,"" in deference to  longtime readers who know the whole tale by heart, is a postmodern fable. Some brief groundwork for this fable and an explanatory conclusion now follow:

A literary *chef d'oeuvre* inspired by the classic Christmas tradition, SBFSiC plays with the nature of reality, dancing around the questions it naturally encourages with an ever evolving pattern of words. Just enough words, however, to contain the whole: the whole recipe to properly invoke Santa. Proper recitation will result in delivery of presents. However, in the case of the naughty who are judged to be exceptionally such, their perception of ""time"" will transcend to a purgatory of infinite cold. Their fate similar to falling into a black hole, as perceived from the outside and the inside of the event horizon at the same time.

Emergently, the story's web of thought organizes structure and meaning. Each line glows with kinetic poeticism. Every passing moment leading to the end is more tender and meaningful than the last.

SBFSiC has long-suffered criticism as posing an unfair challenge to the neophyte, who simply desires the reward of nice presents and holiday cheer with little to no work or effort expended. But as we've clearly established, the Sack Invocation requires each word be read exactly, and this fact fills some with nervous trepidation. As a piece of advice, reading the poem aloud encourages dogged studiousness in accuracy. Practice makes perfect.

Not just an allegory, the eponymous Sack is a wholly physical object capable of delivering unbridled joy on the special day! It is, in short, also a literal sack. 

Realize that the poem is not yet over. To reinforce, this sentence, these concluding thoughts are part of the poem and should be recited as part of the Midnight Invocation every December 18th. 

Suddenly, the recitation appears to be over. 

There are no words left, unless you accidentally stopped after the line above. Then you must start from the beginning again. Recite half as quickly. Slow down and take your time. Practice makes perfect.

Regardless of the interesting nature of content which precedes the end moment itself, your overall level focus in recitation of the poem may annually vary. Reading, for example, the co-requisite concluding segment may prove difficult at midnight a week before Christmas. But as a fair reminder to your family, and especially your hopeful children, **each word must be recited exactly as it appears, and only in the English language, to the precise syllable.** If you do not speak English, consult your phone book for an interpreter willing to translate the text, along with your wishes to Santa included after the above count of 3, 2, 1... Important note: go on ""1,"" there is no actual ""0"" moment, or additional wait as may be suggested by the ellipses. The included ellipses merely serve as a grammatical device to serve the flow of the poem. Everyone should share their wish simultaneously, at the moment the reader says ""1."" 

If you neglect to fully read through the full length of the conjuration, it will fail and Santa will cease to exist in your family's universe. The true last word required for invocatory catalyst follows the above background &amp; explanation. To wit, that word is this one here.

Bob would often ask, 'how do you know that guy?' and Joe would say, 'oh, I know everybody.' 

Bob got pretty used to Joe saying that, and usually left it alone. One day they went to another city for a work conference, and Joe was at it again saying hi to everyone. Bob was really confused and asked Joe again, 'Seriously man, how do you know all these people?' and Joe answered in his usual style, 'oh, you live as long as me, you know everybody.' 

Bob had had it. 'Joe, you're barely 8 years older than me, and it's not possible to know everybody in the world.' Joe said, 'I Really do know everyone.' but Bob wanted proof, and he asked for it. Joe said 'You really want proof?' 'Hell ya!' 'Well,' said Joe, 'It just so happens that I know the Pope. We can go to the Vatican, and I'll show you.'

That sounded like an excellent idea to Bob. He'd always wanted to go to Italy, and now he could finally call his friend's bluff. Doesn't get not far-fetched than knowing the Pope.

they set off to Italy and spent some time visiting while they were there, and all the while Joe kept telling Bob, 'We'll go see him at the end of the trip.' Bob figured he really had Joe this time, and was ready to delight in Joe's defeat.

But if you stand here I'll go talk to the Pope, and we'll come to the balcony and wave to you.' Bob figured he was trying to weasel his way out of it, but agreed and stood on one of the streets where  a lot of people were taking pictures and moving all around. 

After about 10 minutes he sees the door open, and out comes  Joe, followed by the Pope. Joe looks down and waves, and he sees Bob, standing in a group of people, wave back. Suddenly, Bob collapses. Joe shakes hands with the Pope and runs down as quick as he can.

When Joe arrives, some people are fanning Bob, who's laying on the street. Bob Begins to stir. Joe kneels down and says, 'Friend, you really didn't believe me, huh?' Bob says, 'When I looked up I couldn't believe my eyes, but that's not why I fainted.' 'Well what happened?'

He looked up at the cross and saw it was Jesus talking. Then he hears ""Peter! Come here!"" As Peter starts walking to the cross people began to throw rocks at him because they didn't want him trying to take Jesus down. 

One rock catches him in the head and he falls to the ground bleeding. Yet still he hears ""Peter get up here"". So he starts crawling to to the foot of the cross.

Freaked out, he shone his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot. ""Did you say that?"", he hissed at the parrot.

""Yep,"" the parrot confessed, then squawked, ""I'm just trying to warn you.""

The burglar relaxed. ""Warn me, huh? Who in the world are you?""

Many of the toys had to be cleaned off with sanitary wipes, and production was days behind schedule. 

Then Mrs. Claus surprised Santa with some good news. ""My mother is coming to visit, and she can stay the whole week!""

Muttering under his breath, he went outside to harness the reindeer. Where he learned that Blitzen had baked them some gingerbread, laced with something he thought was oregano. So all the reindeer were scattered around, staring up in awe at the northern lights. 

Santa began to load the sleigh and noticed that one of the runners was loose. When he bent down to tighten it, the whole sleigh fell over on its side, capsizing a giant sack of toys. Quite a few presents tumbled out onto the ground. The reindeer were laughing too hard to be of any real help.  After cleaning up the mess and wiping all the snow off the gifts, Santa's fingers were numb and red, and his sense of humor had been stretched to the breaking point.

Grumbling a steady stream of ancient Norse curses, Santa stomped up the stairs into the kitchen to pour himself a large mug of steaming hot coffee spiked with rum. When he opened the liquor cabinet, he discovered that Mrs. Claus had hidden the rum. Tearing the cupboards apart, he finally found a half-empty bottle of peppermint schnapps from several years ago. He emptied its entire contents into the coffee pot, and reached across the counter to get his oversized ""Ho Ho Ho"" mug.

But just at that moment, the doorbell rang. Santa was so startled that he dropped the coffee pot. It shattered into a thousand tiny sharp pieces. The peppermint schnapps and coffee seeped through the wooden floorboards, down into the workshop below. He could hear the elves shouting in alarm.

Santa stomped over to the kitchen door and opened it.

There before him was a beautiful, shining Christmas Star holding a tree. The star spoke to him in a radiant voice filled with joy and amusement. ""Santa! Merry Christmas! Isn't this a lovely Christmas Eve? Why it smells so good here, just like peppermint and coffee! I have brought you this beautiful Christmas tree for your workshop! Isn't it lovely? It is absolutely perfect in every way! Just like me! Where would you like me to stick the tree?""

And that's how it all started. The famous and much-beloved holiday tradition of the star on top of the Christmas tree. 

(NOTE: this is a completely rewritten version of a joke that has appeared before.)","It was a snowy Christmas Eve, many years ago, and Santa Claus was having a bad night.",2

The old pastor of the local church moved  away out of fear of the squirrels. The church got a new pastor, a young fellow,  who was full of ideas for the church and how to help the town.

It didn't take him long to figure out the main problem was the squirrels. They were there day and night, biting people and chattering at all hours.

The pastor knew almost at once what to do. He held a church service and invited all the squirrels. He had them all baptized and made them full members of the church. Now they only see the squirrels Christmas and Easter.","Once upon a time, squirrels terrorized a small church in Massachusetts",28

""I can't afford air-con, I'm too poor""

""Well, Dave, do you have a good mate?""

""Yeah, I've got a mate Francis""

""Well, ask your mate Francis to stand over you and the mrs with a towel, wafting you both to cool you down, that might help.""

So, Dave asks Francis for this favor, who then agrees to help him. That night, Dave is in bed with his wife, pounding away with Francis fanning them with the towel but it's doing nothing for her.

Dave says, ""Well this isn't working, let's swap."" So Dave takes the towel and starts wafting Francis, who is now shagging Dave's wife.

Not long after, Dave's wife goes ""Oooh... oh that's it, I'm about to cum, I'm going to cum!""

Dave shouts, triumphantly, ""You see, Francis?! That's how you waft a fucking towel!""",Dave cannot make his wife cum.,17476

Inside this river is a fish. The fish sees the fly hovering up above him and thinks, if that fly drops six inches I could swim up and eat it and have me some lunch.

Meanwhile off in the distance, a bear walks by. He sees the fish and he sees the fly and thinks, man if that fly dropped six inches then that fish would come swimming up to eat that fly and I could run out to get that fish and I could have me some lunch.

Well just upstream is a hunter sitting on a log eating his lunch. He suddenly sees the bear hiding behind a bush, sees the fish, sees the fly, and thinks... if that fly would just drop six inches the fish would swim up for the fly and the bear would run out for the fish exposing itself, so I can shoot it and get some dinner.

Just then a little mouse pokes its head out of his hole. The mouse sees the sandwich that the hunter is eating, sees the bear, sees the fish, sees the fly, and thinks, if that would drop six inches teen the fish would swim up for the fly, bear would run out for the fish, hunter would drop the sandwich to shoot the bear, I would run out to grab the sandwich, and have me some lunch.

Well it just so happens... a little stray kitten come struttin through the wood. This kitten looks up and sees the mouse, sees the sandwich, sees the hunter, sees the bear, sees the fish, sees the fly and thinks.. damn if that fly would just drop six inches then the fish would swim up for the fly, bear would run out for the fish, hunter would drop the sandwich to shoot the bear, mouse would run out for the sandwich and I could go grab the mouse and have some lunch.

Well the fly dropped six inches. The fish swam up to eat the fly, bear ran out to get the fish, hunter dropped the sandwich to shoot the bear, mouse ran out to get the sandwich, and that little stray kitten ran with all his might at the mouse! In fact the kitten ran so fast that it zipped right overtop of the mouse and fell into the river.

When they are seated, a waitress asks Dave if hed like his usual and brings over a Budweiser.

His wife is becoming increasingly uncomfortable and says,""How did she know that you drink Budweiser?""

""Shes in the Ladies Bowling League, honey. We share lanes with them.""

He was very much looking forward to this, but there was one problem: he had a horrible cold, and his nose was running. 


He said to his butler, 'Oh Butler, what shall I do? I cannot have my nose running everywhere while there are guests here?', to which the butler replied, 'I have an idea. If your nose is running, I will say 'Johnson's at the door, sir,' and that will give you an excuse to leave the room and wipe your nose.' The man was delighted. 'Genius!' he said, and they planned this for later.


That evening, there was a knock on the door. The man opened the door, to see a woman, his first guest to arrive. They greeted each other, then he invited the woman to the table. Soon after there was another knock on the door, and a man appeared, and he greeted and invited him in, and this continued on until there were a good 6 people at the table.


When it was time to eat, Butler brought out a bowl of soup to everyone. All was well again, until Butler noticed something: the man's nose was beginning to run! 'Eh, Johnson's at the door, sir,' he said, but the man did not notice. 'Johnson's at the door, sir?' he said slightly louder. 'Sir!' he shouted. The man, startled, looked at Butler. 'What ever is wrong, Butler?' he asked. 'Well sir,' Butler said, 'Johnson's in the soup.'",An old joke that my grandad told me.,7

So Andree and princess got into a carriage and set off to the countryside. The princess being very naive, was asking Anderee about everything she sees ""what is that?"","" who is that?"".
After about 2 hours in, Anderee started to get annoyed by all the questions. 

Suddenly a rabbit jumped infront of the carriage, and the princess asked ""what is that?"". Anderee screemed ""BLOW ME AND I'LL TELL YOU!""

After a while, a deer jumped infront of the carriage, and the princess asked ""what is that?"". Anderee screemed ""BLOW ME AND I'LL TELL YOU!""

A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

post,5k0duc,2qh72,jokes,false,1482539448,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5k0duc/talking_dog_for_sale/,self.jokes,,"A guy was out for a leisurely drive in the country when he came across a sign that said, ""Talking dog for sale $50"" with an address written on it. Knowing that the house wasn't too far from here, curiosity got the better of him so he drove over to see the talking dog.

When he arrived the dog's owner came out and greeted him then took him into the backyard to meet the dog, a Golden Retriever named Dave. The man approached Dave and asked, ""Dave, are you really a talking dog?"" Dave looked up at him and replied, ""Yes, I am a talking dog."" Impressed, the guy continued on saying, ""That's amazing! Can you tell me a little about yourself? I've never met a talking dog and I'm curious."" Dave sat down and said, ""Sure. I used to be in the C.I.A. and worked as an undercover operative. I would infiltrate our enemy's bases and they never suspected a dog so they would talk around me then I would relay that information to my senior officers. It worked so well they actually loaned me out the F.B.I. for a few years where I worked undercover bringing down biker gangs. I would mostly do the same thing, hang out, make friends with bikers then relay what I heard them talk about back to the F.B.I. Sadly, I got shot in the line of duty and had to retire so now I have a nice, peaceful life out here in the country.""

Blown away, the man turned to Dave's owner and said, ""I don't understand why you would want to sell a talking dog, and if you were why you would sell this amazing dog for only $50."" 

The many replied, ""It's because he's a lying son of a bitch. He never did any of that stuff, he just makes it all up.""

Naturally he wants to know what happened.  She tells him that she can no longer be with him because he is just waaaay too kinky in the sack.  She just can't handle it and knows he will never be satisfied with holding back.  She is leaving because it is best for both of them.  With that, she is gone.  Tom is heartbroken.  So he does what many do when they are down.  He heads to the bar to get drunk.  
  
Tom has a few drinks, he's starting to mellow.  After a while he sees a pretty lady walk in and head straight to the bar and order a stiff drink.  He watches her for a bit, she's really preoccupied and keeps throwing them back.  He screws up his courage tries to talk her up.  They hit it off and sit down together for some more drinks.  
  
She asks what his story was, why he was so down that he is here drowning his sorrows.  ""Well"", replies Tom, hanging his head, ""You are probably going to get up and walk out on me, but believe it or not, my girl just dumped me for being too kinky""  
  
  
""Get outta HERE!"", she exclaims, ""You are NEVER going to believe this, but my man just took off because he did not like how crazy I was in bed.  I like to get freaky too!""  
  
Well naturally this really perks Tom up.  In fact, they are both pretty interested now.  They have a few more drinks and are really hitting it off.  Eventually, she leans in close, ""Hey...I'm having a lot of fun and we obviously have some things in common.  How about we head to my place and see what happens?""  
  
Tom is all for this and off they go.  At her place they get hot and heavy on her couch.  Suddenly she pulls away from him. ""Tom, why don't you sit and relax while I go slip into something a little more......adventurous???""  She heads to her room, leaving Tom excited in the living room.  
  
Once in her room she puts on a leather panties, a rubber bra with the nipples cut out, thigh high spiked boots, studded straps, and grabs a little whip.  She looks at herself in the mirror and is pleased with herself.  She heads out and grabs a ball gag from the drawer on the way.  
  
  
She glides into the living room ready to get down and dirty.  She sees Tom putting on his jacket and heading for the door.  
  
  
""HEY!!! Where are you going?  I thought we were gonna get kinky???""  
  
Tom pauses at the door, ""Look, lady.....I just fucked your dog and shit in your purse.  I'm outta here""

God decided He was finally fed up with the human race and decided to end it for good. He called up a reporter at the New York Times to tell him the news: The world would end the day after tomorrow.

The reporter tried to talk God out of it, but God was firm and wouldn't be swayed. The reporter then asked if he had an exclusive. God said that He was going to call three other newspapers.

Headlines the next day:

The New York Times: ""God says world to end tomorrow; story and analysis on page B11.""

The Wall Street Journal: ""God says world to end tomorrow; market to close early""

USA Today: ""IT'S OVER!""

Not wanting to be denied heaven because he was taking to long, he finally just pulls out the next thing that he gets his hands on, and it happens to be a pair of panties.

St. Peter looks at the pair of panties, thinking there's no way that he could pass this off as something Christmas-y, but he lets him try to explain himself.  ""Alright, let's hear it.  How are those representative of Christmas?""

Two minutes later I got hit by a flying fridge and had to be taken to the hospital.

Judge: Ok, what does the accused have to say?

Accused: The factory I work at, closed earlier that Friday so I came home before the usual hour. When I got home, I saw my wife in intimate clothing and some men's clothes and shoes laying on the floor. I quickly put the two together and realized that I just interrupted a cheating scene so I went looking for the guy in my apartment. I couldn't find anyone.

post,5jvsod,2qh72,jokes,false,1482476211,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5jvsod/peter_loved_tractors_a_story/,self.jokes,,"When Peter was about 4 years old, he saw his first tractor. It was brought to his school by a local farmer and Peter was allowed to climb on it, sit in it, and even take a ride around the playground on the farmer's lap. It was his earliest memory, and he instantly fell in love with them.

That Christmas he got his first 'Tractor and Digger' annual, and every year up to early adulthood. Each glossy new annual contained the latest and greatest in tractor models, tractor building and innovation in all things Tractors for that year. This guy lapped it up, because Peter fucking LOVED tractors.

One Christmas, Peter wasn't given the new Tractor annual. After all these years, had his parents forgotten? Was he now deemed 'too old' for tractor fandom, and destined to leave his passion, nay, his vice, behind for good!

NO - Peter's kind, loving parents had always catered to their only son's true calling. They brought him outside, and there it was - a 1955 Lamborghini DL25h limited edition (the one with the special fog lights, green leather upholstery and that charming old chain-type horn - you know the one I mean). This beautiful Tractor was always the classic, the one that was up on a poster on his wall longer than any other. It was his muse, his Eleanor.

Too excited to wait, Peter got straight in, turned on the engine and vrooom! Like he'd always imagined it would feel. That purr that he was only familiar with through YouTube on his old laptop with tinny speakers, felt every bit as he had always hoped he would one day hear. This was his porn. He was speechless.

Every day for weeks Peter would take Eleanor out for a whirl, passing old farms and mechanics whom he knew, HE KNEW, would truly appreciate what they were seeing and hearing as he passed them. He never stopped smiling, and he loved planning new routes every day.

This continued for, oh, 4 months? Until, one fateful day, Peter, all too cautious not to even mildly scratch his new baby, gave an oncoming, overly confident delivery truck too wide a berth..

A crash..

Then darkness, nothing..

All he remembered was waking up in the ditch on the side of the country road. Ambulances blaring, paramedics standing over him, his neck already in a brace being led into the back of an ambulance.

Peter caught one glimpse of Eleanor. Upside down and half buried in the ditch, axle bent out of all recognition, just absolute toast. He knew it was over. Eleanor was no more.

Peter spent the next few weeks in recovery and undergoing painstaking physiotherapy to realign his spine, and to try and regain full function in his hand, which was half crushed in the accident.

All the while, Peter was stewing. Seething at his own carelessness, over-cautiousness, his sheer greed, over indulgence and selfishness at having lead such a meaningless existence. An existence thus far only defined by his love of an industrial vehicle that he hadn't even managed to make a living out of.

He made a decision then and there, to move on. His resolve was always strong, making no apologies for his unconditional love for Tractors to the onlooking crowds of countless bullies and naysayers over the years. So as tough as this decision was, Peter knew that he had to do it, and that he could do it.

The rest of that winter passed in a flash.

Peter, rendered inactive for work and struggling to walk, threw out his entire, pristine collection of Tractor annuals, magazines, scale models, pictures, posters, mugs and all manner of Tractor memorabilia that he had amassed over the years. Peter was a changed man.

But a man without a calling.

Until..

One day, about 10 years back now, Peter was sat in a pub just outside his local village. This was just before the indoor smoking ban, and the place was filled with smoke. Peter had gotten used to it over the years, but even he struggled to breathe comfortably in such a crowded and densely smoke filled room. Winter was holding on late this year, and people were still crowding inside and there were no windows open.

Over in the corner of the room, Peter saw a woman on her own. She was hunched over a half finished glass of wine, and seemed to be crying.

He felt compelled to walk over to her and ask what was wrong.

The lady looked up to meet his gaze, and said she wasn't upset, but her eyes were reacting to all the smoke in the pub.

Then it hit him - his calling, his true purpose in life, the reason he felt so compelled by Tractors since that wonderful day at school all those years ago, and the reason his parents had so whole-heartedly encouraged this passion of his ever since..

He knew, somehow, that he was capable of this..

Peter took two steps back, stuck his head up and inhaled. He inhaled and inhaled and inhaled all that he could, until all the smoke in the room had entered his lungs.

He stepped outside and exhaled every bit of air and smoke that he had inhaled. It was an incredible sight, and everyone in the pub just stopped everything and gawped at this man in amazement and wonder.

Emerging out of the crowd, the woman, now smiling and opening her beautiful eyes fully for the first time, said 'Wow, that was amazing! Where on earth did you learn to do that?!'

'Somehow', said Peter, 'I've always known. I just wasn't able to until now.'

'You see'

'I'm an Ex-Tractor fan'

Relieved, the bartender makes good on his promise and serves the man a drink on the house, the bar's special made from single malt scotch, a blend of ice and line and a dash of punch. The man takes a sip but purses his lips from its strong and bitter taste.
