A game of truth-telling is being played at court by a Queen and her retinue. A knight is asked by the Queen if he has fathered any children; he is forced to admit that he has not. 

The Queen nods in assent, saying ""you do not have the look of a man who could please his mistress when you hold her naked in your arms. For your beard is little more than the kind of fuzz that ladies have in certain places, and it is easy to tell from the state of the hay whether the pitchfork is any good.""

On his turn, the knight asks ""Lady, answer me without deceit. Is there hair between your legs?"" When she replies, ""none at all"", he comments, ""Indeed I do believe you, for grass does not grow on a well-beaten path.""",A Dirty Joke from the 14th Century,18659

After a while, he finds himself in a very nice neighborhood with big, stately residences...no pubs, no stores, no restaurants, and worst of all NO PUBLIC RESTROOMS.

He really, really has to go, after all those drinks. He finds a narrow side street, with high walls surrounding the adjacent buildings and decides to use the wall to solve his problem.

As he is unzipping, he is tapped on the shoulder by a London police officer, who says, ""I say, sir, you simply cannot do that here, you know.""

""I'm very sorry, officer,"" replies the tourist, ""but I really, really have to go, and I just can't find a public restroom.""

""Ah, yes,"" said the policeman.""Just follow me"". He leads the tourist down a back delivery alley to a gate, which he opens.

""In there,"" points the policeman. ""Go ahead sir, anywhere you like.""

The fellow enters and finds himself in the most beautiful garden he has ever seen. Manicured grass lawns, statuary, fountains, sculptured hedges, and huge beds of gorgeous flowers, all in perfect bloom.

Since he has the policeman's blessing, he relieves himself and feels much more comfortable. As he goes back through the gate, he says to the police officer, ""That was really decent of you... is that what you call English hospitality?""

""No sir,"" replied the police officer, ""that is what we call the French Embassy.""

This was a huge loss for him. This was his shooting arm,  his writing arm,  his....single-player intimacy arm.  He used the arm (and attached hand) for everything.

Good for him that a doctor had just completed building some great new technology: the Voice Activated Arm (tm) - patent pending.

Upon waking up for the first time since the accident, he was greeted by a kindly doctor sitting by his hospital bed. Looking down the man sees all the needles and tubes going into him, and asks what happened.

The kind old doctor explains the situation, and with a pregnant pause began to explain the depth of his physical damage -- broken ribs, busted lip, and of course his missing arm.

The man looks down and to the right. He doesn't *feel* different. His arm looks no different. 

The doctor explains that it is voice activated -- tell it what to do preceded by ""voice activated arm..."" and if it can, it will follow the command.

Well this seems too space-age to be real, so he decides to not ponder it immediately, and to get some rest.

Fast forward 6 weeks and the man has been out of the hospital for 3 of those weeks, constantly dodging the calls of the doctor, because he doesn't need false hope.  He finally gets tired of being useless and frustrated, and decide to finally call the doctor back.

The man first states, 
&gt;Doc, I know you said this arm was high tech, but it just dangles uselessly at my side.

The kindly doctor responds,
&gt;As I tried to explain at the hospital, the arm is voice activated. You must give it command in much the same way you would a computer. For example, if you wanted to open a door, you would say ""voice activated arm, open door."" Now, you can stack commands, like ""voice activated arm, open fridge. Grab beer."" This will instruct your arm to first open the fridge, then grab a beer


To this, the man replies,
&gt;I'm not sure, doc, but I'll give it a try...


Later that day, he had to use the restroom. As soon as he got in there, he realized this was a perfect time to test the arm.  He didn't want to be in public talking to his arm just yet.

First, the man opens with 
&gt;Voice activated arm, unzip pants


Zip


&gt;Cool. Ok. Voice activated arm, whip my dick out. Aim towards toilet


Out it comes. Dead center aim acquired.


&gt;Fucking amazing. Hey. This feels pretty good. Jerk it off.


The arm promptly detached the man's salamander.

&gt;FUCK ME !

He looks out the window and sees a three legged chicken running beside him in the ditch. 
He is amazed that as he looked at the speedometer in his car and he's doing 40 mph, all the while the chicken is keeping up with him. 
He increases his speed to 50 mph and the chicken stays with him. He keeps it up. 60, 70, 80 mph and the chicken keeps pace no problem. 
 The realtor hits 90 mph and he is finally able to overtake the chicken. As he coasts to a more manageable speed the chicken runs down a driveway and into a farm. 
The realtor, who's curious at this point, turns around and goes into the farm. He finds the farmer tending his garden and heads over to him. 
"" I was driving down the road and I came across a three legged chicken! He could run 90 miles an hour! What is with that?""
The farmer replies: ""it's a simple story. There is me, my wife and my son living here. We all love a drumstick. So instead of fighting over them when we eat chickens, we biologically engineered our chickens to have three legs!! Drumsticks for everyone!""
""My god! That's a brilliant plan! Think of all the possibilities! How do they taste?""

post,4qzb4i,2qh72,jokes,false,1467497797,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4qzb4i/the_voodoo_dick/,self.jokes,,"There was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man said, ""Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. ""Except what?"" the man asked. ""Nothing, nothing."" ""C'mon, tell me! I need something!"" ""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'"" ""So what's up with this voodoo dick?"" he asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said ""Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!"" The old man replied, ""But you haven't seen what it'll do yet."" He pointed to a door and said ""Voodoo dick, the door."" The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said ""Voodoo dick, get back in your box!"" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more. ""I'll take it!"" said the businessman. The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say ""Voodoo dick, my pussy."" He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.

After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said ""Yeah, right.. Voodoo dick, my ass!""

The mother, shocked, decided to move to England to get a new life.

25 years later, the teacher was diagnosed with a severe cardiac problem, and that only a very experienced surgeon in England could manage such problem.

The teacher decided to sell everything to pay a flight to England, and so she did.

When she got there, a very well clothed man received her at the airport and took her to the hospital in a Mercedes Benz.

Then she got operated, and when the surgery ended, the doctor said ""Well, this is a complete success.""

When the teacher woke up, she was in a room with people surrounding her. Then she looked at the surgeon, but before she could say anything, her face turned blue, she couldn't breathe, and suddenly she passed away before anybody could understand what was happening.

They advise park visitors to wear little bells on their clothes so they make noise when hiking. The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge.
Visitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away.
It is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat.

The angel reappeared and informed the man that God had decided to allow him to take one suitcase with him. Overjoyed, the man gathered his largest suitcase and filled it with pure gold bars and placed it beside his bed.

Soon afterward, he died and showed up at the gates of heaven to greet St. Peter. St. Peter, seeing the suitcase, said, “Hold on, you can’t bring that in here!”. The man explained to St. Peter that he had permission and asked him to verify his story with the Lord.

Sure enough, St. Peter checked it out, came back and said, “You’re right. You are allowed one carry-on bag, but I’m supposed to check its contents before letting it through.”.

He buys drinks for all the ladies and none of them show interest. At the end of the night the bartender makes the last call and Tony, disappointed, makes his way out the back to head home. As the door to the bar closes behind him, he notices a drunk hobo passed out over the sidewalk railing. Tony glances around to see if anyone is nearby and prods the hobo to see if he'll wake up. The hobo grumbles slightly but otherwise doesn't show any intention of waking up anytime soon. So, after not getting any action at the bar and knowing that nobody would ever find out, he drops the hobo's pants and removes his own and gets it on with the hobo. Tony finishes up and cleans up himself and the hobo. He begins to walk away but starts feeling guilty for using the hobo so he slips five bucks into the hobo's pocket and heads home.

The next morning the hobo wakes up disoriented and hungover. He looks around and slides his hands into his pockets as he begins his morning walk around the block only to feel something strange with his hands. He pulls out the five bucks and is ecstatic! He can't believe it and runs down to the liquor store, slams the five bucks down on the counter and says, ""Give me five bucks worth of the cheapest stuff you've got!"" The clerk takes the money and hands the hobo the cheapest liquor they've got. The hobo grabs it and walks out of the store, drinking the liquor for the rest of the day. Eventually, he heads back to his spot behind the bar and passes out.

Meanwhile, Tony headed back to the bar in hopes of getting some action from the ladies tonight but just like last night, every girl in the bar didn't even notice him. Closing time rolls around and Tony heads out the back door to make the long, lonely trip back home. Tired and hurt, Tony barely noticed the hobo slumped over the railing again. Tony wasn't planning on spending the night alone so decides that it can't hurt anything to have a go with the hobo again. He yanks down the hobo's pants and unzips his own and starts going at it with the hobo. A few minutes later, he cleans up, slips a five in the hobo's pocket and heads home satisfied.

The next morning, the hobo wakes up more hungover than yesterday and slips his hands into his pocket and yelps for joy as he pulls another five bucks out of his pocket. ""It's a miracle!"" he says to himself as he makes his way back to the liquor store. He walks in, slams down the five bucks, and demands cheapest liquor. The clerk grabs the cash and hands over the liquor and the hobo makes his way out of the store. The hobo gulps down the liquor throughout the day and passes out behind the bar again for another night.

Meanwhile, Tony was telling all his single friends who couldn't get any action that they should all come to the bar with him tonight in hopes of having better luck in numbers. A few of them have other plans but three of his friends decide to go. So the four of them head to the bar and just like the last two nights, all the women ignore Tony and pay no attention to his friends. So when the bartender makes the last call, the four of them head out the back to go their separate ways but lo-and-behold the hobo is slumped over the railing again. Tony's friends laugh at him and begin heading home but Tony stops them and lets them in on his secret. They can't believe it so Tony tells them to watch as he goes at it with the hobo for the third night in a row. Tony's friends are amazed and each one of them takes turns with the hobo, leaving five bucks each time. Satisfied, they all head home for the night.

The next morning the hobo wakes up and reaches into his pockets and pulls out twenty bucks! He looks at the wad of cash and sprints to the liquor market. He slams twenty bucks on the counter and says, ""Give me twenty bucks of your most expensive liquor!""

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.' 

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball. 

The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

'Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

'Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

'A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

'I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

'Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

'Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

'Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

'Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

'Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

'Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

'Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.

But only under the condition that you stay away from my daughter or you shall receive the three forbidden tortures!""

The man, thinking only that the farmer is a little overprotective, but not having much of a choice, accepts the farmer's agreement.  Over dinner, the farmer's beautiful daughter eyes him and playfully rubs her leg against his.  That night, thinking that the old man would never know, sneaks into her bed.

The next morning he wakes up with a large rock on his chest.  A note on the rock says, ""First forbidden torture:  rock on chest.""  The man hastily stands up and throws the rock out the window when he sees the underside of the rock with a note that reads, ""Second forbidden torture:  rock tied to ball.""  

Surely enough, he sees a quickly diminishing coil of rope leading to one of his balls.  In panick, he decides to jump out the window and as he exits the window, on the underside of the window frame is yet another note written, ""Third forbidden torture: other ball tied to bed.""",The Three Forbidden Tortures,22

A Chinese Doctor can't find a job in a Hospital in the US, so he opens a clinic and puts a sign outside 'GET TREATMENT FOR $20 - IF NOT CURED GET BACK $100.'
An American lawyer thinks this is a great opportunity to earn $100 and goes to the clinic.
Lawyer: ""I have lost my sense of taste.""
Chinese: ""Nurse, bring medicine from box No. 22 and put 3 drops in patient's mouth.""
Lawyer: ""Ugh. this is kerosene.""
Chinese: ""Congrats, your sense of taste is restored. Give me $20.""
The annoyed lawyer goes back after a few days to recover his money.
Lawyer: ""I have lost my memory. I cannot remember anything.""
Chinese: ""Nurse, bring medicine from box no. 22 and put 3 drops in his mouth.""
Lawyer (annoyed): ""This is kerosene. You gave this to me last time for restoring my taste.""
Chinese: ""Congrats. You got your memory back. Give me $20.""
The fuming lawyer pays him, and then comes back a week later determined to get back $100.
Lawyer: ""My eyesight has become very weak I can't see at all.""
Chinese: ""Well, I don't have any medicine for that, so take this $100.""
Lawyer (staring at the note): ""But this is $20, not $100!!""
Chinese: ""Congrats, your eyesight is restored. Give me $20""

post,4qpz6i,2qh72,jokes,false,1467348328,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4qpz6i/luckiest_man_alive/,self.jokes,,"A man lost his job, closing in on losing his house. He's never been married. Or ever in a serious relationship. He has little to no friends and uses alcohol a little too much.

So, down on his luck, he gets hammered. Night after night, with no one to console him. He's brushing his feet against the ground on his home one night and hears a loud CLUNK. He looks down and picks up some sort of ornamental teapot? It has a cool looking design under a coat of ash and dirt so he rubs it off and POOF whaddya know! Out pips a genie.

The genie looks down in his glorious fog and says to the man, ""congratulations!  You have awoken azavaad the glorious genie. I shall grant you only one wish for releasing me.""

So the man simply replies, ""I want to be the luckiest man alive.""  

And so it was done.

The man wakes up in his house thinking he had an awkward drunken dream. But as he looks around his house it has completely transformed! 

There was a chandelier, a grand piano, candelabras made of gold, and a stack of cash on his coffee table.  

""Wow"" he thought ""it worked!""

So he decides to celebrate. Going to the nearest bar. As he enters sirens go off and balloons and dollar bills and glitter fall to the ground.

""Congratulations!"" Says the bartender, ""you are one lucky guy! You're our 1000th customer and you get a free bar tab for life!""

So he drinks himself almost under the table and decides to press his luck at lottery tickets. Well lo and behold he won the max prize on every shitty scratch ticket he could purchase.  This continued for months.  At the casino, taking home strippers and beautiful women, celebrities inviting him to the best parties.

But, alas, he is alone, and steeps into his lonely depression once more.

So he returns to the genie. 

""Hey, genie, I wanted to be the luckiest man alive and while I'm grateful our definition of luck may be different. To me, being lucky would be settling down with a beautiful woman and having a family and living a successful and peaceful life.""

""My bad,"" Says the great asavaad to him, ""I shall correct this mistake and give you the most exotic woman for you to have for the rest of your life.""

And again, it was done. He awoke in his awesome new house. Still money and glorious furniture everywhere. So he says fuck it I'll go get a coffee. As he is leaving with his coffee a woman bumps into him, spilling his coffee everywhere.  He looks into her apologetic eyes and sees a beautiful Indian woman. With an accent, shaul, and dot on her head. Beautiful brown skin, dark eyes, and silky long hair. The whole package. She offers to buy him another and they strike up a conversation.  And they end up having almost everything in common. They sat at the coffee shop for hours and talked and laughed. They were in love.

They went home and had the most romantic and passionate sex anyone has ever had, all night until they fell asleep from exhaustion. They spent every waking minute together. And with his riches he took her all over the world. So one day he proposes and naturally she says yes. They have a small beautiful wedding and a glorious honeymoon with everything he and she ever wanted. They have another round of passionate sex, even better than the time before until they pass out from exhaustion again

In the morning the man awakes, and is looking at her beautiful, naked, sleeping body. He runs his hand down her cheek and admires her. He truly is the luckiest man alive.

But then, still in her slumber, he notices the dot on her head is smudged.  Which is wierd because he's never seen her without it. So he rubs it a little and it starts to fade away. And then the paint chips off a little so he starts to scratch it.  AND THEN HE WON A TRUCK!",Luckiest man alive.,0

As the men sit down the lawyer says, ""Look, the reason my client is in this situation is because he is a terrible gambler.""

""I am not a terrible gambler,"" the man replies. ""I will make a bet right now. I bet you $1,000 that I can bite my own eye."" he says to the auditor.

""You can't bite your own eye,"" the auditor replies. ""I'll take your bet.""

The man reaches up, removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor is in shock, he just bet this man $1,000 in front of a lawyer. The man however is generous.

""Ok, that wasn't really fair. You didn't know that I had a glass eye. So, for double or nothing I bet you I can bite my other eye.""

The auditor is skeptical, but after careful examination determines that there is no way he has two glass eyes. ""Fine, double or nothing, you cannot bite your other eye.""

The man reaches into his mouth and pulls out his false teeth and carefully makes them bite down on his other eye.

The auditor is completely taken aback. How could he possibly be so dumb as to take that bet.

""Ok,"" the man says again. ""You didn't know I had dentures, so I will give you one last chance. Double or nothing, I bet you I can stand on this side of your desk and piss over your desk and into that wastebasket without getting a single drop on your desk.""

The auditor backs up and looks at the distance. There is no way the man could physically maintain a stream that could reach that distance. It had to be impossible.

""I have no choice,"" the auditor says. ""I'll take the bet.""

The man stands up, walks to the side of the desk and proceeds to piss all over the auditors desk, not a single drop reaching the wastebasket.

The auditor leaps from his seat and cheers his victory. The lawyer however, has his face in his hands, audibly groaning.

""Wait,"" the auditor says. ""Why are you so upset?""

""Before we came in, he bet me $20,000 he could walk in here, piss all over your desk and you would be happy about it.""

Please show him where the cow is when he gets here, OK?"" 

The rancher leaves for the fields. After a while, the artificial insemination man arrives and knocks on the front door.

Amy takes him down to the barn. They walk along the row of cows and when Amy sees the nail, she tells him, ""This is the one right here.""

The man, assuming he is dealing with an air head blond, asks, ""Tell me lady, 'cause I'm dying to know. How would YOU know that this is the right cow to be bred?""

""That's simple,"" she said. ""By the nail that's over its stall,"" she explains very confidently.

Laughing rudely at her, the man says, ""And what, pray tell, is the nail for?""

The blond turns to walk away and says sweetly over her shoulder, ""I guess it's to hang your pants on.""

My wonderful girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year so we decided to get married.
There was only one little thing bothering me. 

It was her beautiful younger sister, Sofia.

My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight mini-skirts, and generally was Bra-less.

She would regularly bend down when she was near me. 
I always got more than a nice view.

It had to be deliberate she never did it around anyone else.

One day she called me and asked me to come over.
'To check my Sister's wedding- invitations' she said.

She was alone when I arrived, she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me and she couldn't overcome them anymore.
She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married.

She said ""Before you commit your life to my sister"".
Well, I was in total shock, and I couldn't say a word.
She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom"" she said. 
""If you want one last wild fling, just come up and have me"".

I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs.
I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a bee-line straight to the front door. I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car.

Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!

With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me.
He said, 'My Son, we are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter.

Welcome to the family my son.'

And the moral of this story is:

Always keep your condoms in your car.

He was so nervous to ask, but he finally did and she said yes! Excited, the guy started to make preparations in his mind and decided on a few things he would need.

He first needed to rent a tux. He went to the tux rental place but there was a long line, about an hour but he waited because he knew it would be worth it.

Next, he had to get her a corsage. He went to the florist and this time the line was 2 hours long! He was annoyed, but still waited because he knew it would be worth it.

He then needed a limo to ride up in style. The line to rent a limo was a staggering 4 hours long, but he knew it would be worth it.

Finally all the preparations are done and it is prom night. The boy is looking good in his tux, the girl loves the corsage, and all her friends are jealous when she pulls up in a limo. Inside, they are having a great time, dancing and laughing. Sparks are really flying. The girl says to him, ""I'm thirsty, can you get me something to drink?"" He says, ""Of course."" So he walks over and there is no punch line.",Prom Night,0
