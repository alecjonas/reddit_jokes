Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard 'Jesus is watching you.'

Startled, he shined his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot.

'Did you say that?' he hissed at the parrot.

'Yes', the parrot confessed, then squawked, 'I'm just trying to warn you that he's watching you.'

The burglar relaxed. 'Warn me, huh? Who in the world are you?'

'Moses,' replied the bird.

 “Yes sir, what’s happened? How is my wife?” 

The doctor sits next to him and says, “Not good news. Your wife’s accident resulted in two fractures of her spine.”

“Oh my God” says Mr. Jones, “what will be her prognosis?” 

Dr. Smith says “Well, Mr. Jones, her vital signs are stable. However,her spine is inoperable. She’ll have no motor skills or capability. This means you will have to feed her.”

 Mr. Jones begins to sob. 

“And you’ll have to turn her in her bed every two hours to prevent pneumonia.”

Mr. Jones begins to wail and cry loudly. 

“Then, of course,” the doctor continued, “you’ll have to diaper her as she’ll have no control over her bladder and the diapers must be changed throughout the day.” 

Mr. Jones begins to shake as he cries, sobs, wails.

The doctor continues, “You’ll have to clean up her feces on a regular basis as she’ll have no control over her sphincters. Her bowel will engorge whenever and quite often I’m afraid. Of course you must clean her immediately to avoid accumulation of the putrid effluent she’ll be emitting regularly.”

Now Mr. Jones is convulsing sobbing uncontrollably and beginning to wither off the bench into a sobbing pitiful mass.

""No..."", said Ari apprehensively, ""tell me you're not actually considering converting!""

""I've been thinking about this, and today is as good of a day as ever,"" Hymie replied.

Ari stood there speechless as his old friend walked into the church. About fifteen minutes later, Hymie walked back out smiling.

""Fine,"" Hymie assured him, ""It was easy.""

Ari seemed to relax as they resumed walking, but then stopped. ""Wait...did you get the $10?""

Hymie looked at him with disdain and said, ""What...is that all you people think of?!""","My first submission, it used to play well with my father-in-law",33

However, Jim felt this was the time for him to open up and admit that he also had a deformity. 

Jim looked Sandy in the eyes and said, ""I too have a problem. My penis is the same size as an infant's, and I hope you can deal with that once we are married.""

I've done this drive a dozen times so I wasn't paying much attention to the road, giving glances to my phone. Saw the street light ahead about a mile or so down the road when BOOM, I hit something. I stopped my car and looked down the road to see a pig laying on its side. I checked my car and didn't see any real damage. I looked around and saw no street or farm signs or anything of the like. The pig then tried to get up but fell down again. He looked at me with a ""help me"" look in his face but I was no vet and wasn't planning on throwing him in the back of the car. He looked rattled but seemed to have no serious injury to him (no blood, head was intact, no missing limbs, etc), so I decided to get out of there. 

The next day we get a knock at the door and my wife answers the door. She yells to me, ""babe the cops are here for you...""  
I go to the door and one of the cops says, ""hello sir I'm officer White and this is officer Smith, we would like to ask you a couple questions.""
""Okay, how can I help you officers?""
""Well, you can start by telling me where you were last night""
""I went to my buddies house out by the ranches to play some cards and came home"" I said.
""Okay, do you drive a white Honda Civic with license plate ....""
""Yes"" I said, ""what is this about""
""Sorry sir but we have a report from a local farmer that you were involved in a felony hit and run with his pig. Unfortunately we are going to have to take you in""
I tried pleading my case by saying that there was no one around and that I looked for signs for someone to call but found none, but they didn't seem to care. They put the cuffs on me and I started to walk to their car. As I made the walk I looked at one of the officers, ""sir, I'm sorry but how did this even come about? Who told the farmer that I had hit the pig? I don't understand. It was in the middle of nowhere, no one was around and it was night out.""
I started to sit down in the back of the car and right before he closed the door he said, ""the pig squealed""

The first man explains, ""Well, I was having a bad day at work, so I left early and came home. When I got to my apartment, I noticed that my wife was there, and loud moans were coming from the bedroom. I thought she might have a man in there so I ran and got my hammer, and couldn't help but start shouting that I was going to kill him. I get into the bedroom with my hammer, and sure enough there she is trying to throw on her clothes. I run out to the balcony, where I find the guy she was sleeping with, dangling off the balcony, probably trying to jump down to the apartment below us. Well I start bashing his fingers with my hammer until he lets go. We live on the 9th floor, but it looked like he didn't die because he landed on a bush. He was definitely injured though because he wasn't moving much. I was so furious that I needed to kill him. I looked around my apartment for something heavy to drop on him. I don't know where I got the strength from, but I lifted up my refrigerator and hoisted it over the balcony, where it fell 9 storied, and crushed him. I was so upset that I jumped over the balcony myself, and that's how I died.""

The 2nd man goes ""well I live on the 11th floor of an apartment building. I was home, out on my balcony enjoying myself, when all of a sudden a huge gust of wind came and blew me off the balcony. I scrambled to grab on to anything and luckily I caught the balcony a few floors below me. As I was struggling to pull myself up, this madman came out with a hammer and started smashing my fingers in! I couldn't hold on and fell all the way to the ground. Luckily again, I landed on a bush and was dazed, but okay. Then I looked up and saw this huge box start to fall on me. It got bigger... and bigger...and SPLAT. It smashed me, and that's how I died.""

The 3rd man goes, ""Well, I left work early to go back to my secretary's apartment, to have some fun. As things started heating up, I heard someone come into her apartment. She told me her husband is crazy and I'd better go hide. I looked and looked for somewhere to hide, when finally I decided on, the refrigerator...""

He runs into a bunny. Now, this bunny in particular was by himself because all of his pack had been devoured by hyenas and only he escaped. He had been also wandering around of days, and he couldn't think of anything but sex. 

So, when the lion and the bunny met, they felt some sort of camaraderie and sat down to discuss their issues with women. 

After a while, the lion, who was horny as hell, told the bunny, ""you know, I'd appreciate if you... ah... helped me out. C'mon, be a pal, take one for the team.""

The bunny thought about it and said ""ok, but you have to promise that then it'll be my turn.""

The lion said ""oh, yeah, sure"" which was strange, because it's not like horny males would say anything to have sex. Besides, he though he would just eat the little motherfucker afterwards.

So, the lion had his way with the bunny. Needless to say, the experience was a gruesome ordeal for the little fellow.

After he had finished giving all he had, the lion was too tired to do anything and lied down for a nap. The bunny, trying hard to recover, climbed on the back of the lion and tried to do his thing. However, it was such a little creature compared to the lion and there wasn't much he could do. The lion barely felt anything. Not that the bunny didn't give it his all, mind you, but he just was too small.

Meanwhile, nearby on a tree, a couple of Capuchin monkeys were smoking pot. One of them told the other, ""man, I don't know where you got this shit, but it's too strong for me. I think I'm seeing a bunny fucking a lion.""

The other monkey turned around and said ""dude, you're not seeing things, it's really what's happening."" Both monkeys laughed their asses off, coz they were pretty stoned, and then they started to throw coconuts at the lion and the monkey, coz they were trolls and they were pretty stoned. 

One of the coconuts hit the lion on the head, waking him up. ""Hey, that hurts"" complained the lion loudly.

And the bunny went ""YEAH, IT'S PAYBACK TIME, BITCH!""

The German soldier is taken first. The other two hear blood curdling screams of pain and within minutes the German tells the allies all they need to know from him. He comes back to his cell feeling ashamed.

Next, the Japanese soldier is taken. Again, there are screams echoing throughout the building. The Japanese man lasts two whole days of torture before finally giving in. He comes back in disgrace, dishonoring his homeland and family name.

Finally, it is the Italian's turn. The other two wish him luck as they know what is coming ahead for him. The terrified Italian is taken to the other room and, once again, nothing but screams of pain. However, it continues into the night, and the next day, then several days... finally two weeks of almost non-stop torture and the captors give up on him.

The allied guards angrily bring the battered and bruised Italian back to his cell and leave. The German soldier and Japanese soldier looked onto their comrade in utter shock.

""How did you make it so long? It's impossible..."" said the German.

""I had no choice"" shrugged the Italian. ""How can they expect me to talk when they tie my hands behind my back?""

post,4t7ukf,2qh72,jokes,false,1468724184,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4t7ukf/chili_cookoff/,self.jokes,,"Notes from an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting Texas from the East Coast:

Recently, I was honored to be selected as an outstanding famous celebrity in Texas, to be a judge at a Chili cook-off, because no one else wanted to do it. Also, the original person called in sick at the last moment, and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me that I could have free beer during the tasting. So I accepted.

Here are the scorecards from the event:

CHILI # 1: MIKE'S MANIC MONSTER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A little to heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.

JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.

FRANK: Holy Shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway with this stuff. I needed two beers to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. Those Texans are crazy.

CHILI # 2: ARTHUR'S AFTERBURNER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Smokey, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.

JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor. Needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to walkie-talkie in three extra beers when they saw the look on my face.

CHILI # 3: FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.

JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili. A bit salty. Good use of red peppers.

FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced.

CHILI # 4: BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC

JUDGE ONE: Black Bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.

JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods. Not much of a chili.

FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating.

CHILI # 5: LINDA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.

JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.

FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no linger focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly from a pitcher onto it. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Freakin' Rednecks! ! !

CHILI # 6: VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.

JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions and garlic.

FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulphuric flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!

CHILI # 7: SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum. Tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge # 3.

FRANK: You could put a FUCKING Grenade in my mouth, pull the FUCKING pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my FUCKING mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit, to match my FUCKING shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the four inch hole in my stomach.

CHILI # 8: HELEN'S MOUNT SAINT CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending. This is a nice blend chili, safe for all; not too bold, but spicy enough to declare its existence.

JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good balanced chili, neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge # 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank.

(Editor's Note: Judge # 3 was unable to report).",Chili Cook-off,2

Since it was a nudist colony as well, they invited him to disrobe and wander the grounds to get the full immersive experience.  He soon saw that it was indeed a tropical paradise on which no expense had been spared.  As he wandered along an especially lush and fragrant jungle path, he came to a clearing where a beautiful stream tumbled over a small waterfall into a crystal clear pool in which cavorted a dozen or so young women of extraordinary beauty.  Upon seeing them, he naturally developed some swelling in the nether regions.  This was obvious to the ladies, who immediately hopped out of the pool and swarmed him, fellating him relentlessly in an orgy of ecstasy.  Pleased and a bit overwhelmed, he continued his walk along the verdant trail.  Suddenly, he tripped over a protruding root and fell down on his hands and knees.  Equally suddenly and quite unwelcome, a young man jumped out from behind a nearby tree and proceeded to rape his upturned ass.  As his assailant made good his escape into the concealing greenery, the man continued on his way as best he could, finally returning to the sales office.

As he pulls into the farmyard, a large pig in the pen by the barn catches his eye. He wanders over for a closer look and to his astonishment he sees that the pig has a wooden leg! As he is staring at the pig, the farmer emerges from the barn and extends a greeting.
The young salesman introduces himself, but then curiosity gets a hold of him and he asks the farmer about the pig with the wooden leg. The farmer replies, “Well young man, that is no ordinary pig. That’s  a special pig.”
“I can see that,” said the young salesman, “but why does he have a wooden leg? “
“Well let me tell you.” Said the farmer. “One day I was plowing right there on the other side of that pig’s pen when I stopped the tractor to move a big rock out of the way. Don’t you know that tractor slipped into gear and would have run me over ‘cept that pig broke through the fence and pushed me out of the way just in time.”
“So is that how the pig lost his leg?”
“No, no, no,” said the farmer, “I’m trying to tell you that is one special pig. Why just a couple of months ago the wife and I were sound asleep about three in the morning when a fire broke out on the porch over there. That pig broke through the pen, rushed to the house and made such a ruckus we were woken up in time to put out the fire. He saved our lives!”
“So did he lose his leg in the fire?” Asked the young man.
“No, no, no,” said the farmer. “I’m trying to tell you. That’s one special pig! Why just four weeks ago I was home alone. I had a heart attack. That pig ran into the road and right in front of the first car that came by. When the driver got out the pig led the man to me lying in the barnyard. The driver called an ambulance.

Beyond the river, on the bank, a bear sat, watching the fly and the fish and pondering, 'Man, if that fly drops and the fish catches it, I'll have enough time to run into the river and get that fish.'

Behind the bear, a hunter was hidden, waiting,' If that fly drops, the fish catches the fly and the bear gets the fish, it'll be a perfect time to shoot that bear.'

Well, in the hills, not too far away from the hunter, a wildcat stocked about, watching the scenario and thinking, 'If that fly drops and the fish jumps up to catch the fly and the bear runs to catch the fish, then the hunter fires his weapon, I know something they don't know.  The man has a bag of chips in his pocket and I'm going to have myself a snack!'

Sure enough, the fly dips down, the fish jumps up and eats the fly, the bear runs down and catches the fish and the hunter fires his gun and gets the bear, with the chips falling onto the ground.  Taking his opportunity, the wildcat sprints down the hill and closes in on the bag, but misses it and slips on a strip of mud, sliding straight into the river.

""I can't possibly do that,"" said the Pope. ""Not even for 100,000 dollars?"" asked the Colonel. ""No, not for 100,000 dollars,"" replied the Pope. Six months on and KFC sales were declining still further. The Colonel was getting desperate and made another call to the Pope. This time he offered 500,000 dollars for the words of the Lord's Prayer to be changed to ""Give us this day our daily chicken."" Again the Pope refused. ""I can't possibly change the wording of the Lord's Prayer from bread to chicken,"" he repeated. Another six months and KFC sales had reached an all-time low. The company was in danger of going out of business. Colonel Sanders made one last attempt to persuade the Pope to change the wording of the Lord's Prayer. ''I'll donate 50 million dollars to the Vatican if you change the word 'bread' to 'chicken' in the Lord's Prayer."" ""That's a lot of money,"" conceded the Pope. ""So you'll do it?"" ''I'll have to discuss it with the cardinals."" So the Pope called a meeting of the cardinals. He began: ""I have good news and bad news. The good news is, KFC are going to donate 50 million dollars to the Vatican. The bad news is, we lost the Wonder Bread account.""",The Lord's Prayer,13

Mustering one great final effort, he threw himself toward the table, landing on his knees in a rumpled posture. His parched lips parted: the wondrous taste of the cookie was already in his mouth, seemingly bringing him back to life. The aged and withered hand trembled on its way to a cookie at the edge of the table, when it was suddenly smacked with a spatula by his wife.

At closing time, as everyone came out, he spotted his potential quarry.

The man was so obviously inebriated that he could barely walk.

He stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes looking for his car.

After trying his keys on five others, he finally found his own vehicle.

He sat in the car a good 10 minutes as the other pub patrons left.

He turned his lights on, then off.

He started to pull forward into the grass, then stopped.

Finally, when his was the last car, he pulled out onto the road and started to drive away.

The cop, waiting for this, turned on his lights and pulled the man over.

He administered the breathalyzer test and, to his great surprise, the man easily passed.

The cop was dumbfounded.

'This equipment must be broken,' exclaimed the policeman.

'I doubt it,' said the man. 'Tonight I'm the DD...Designated Decoy.'

It was hosted by Jimmy Valentine, who is now in the Minnesota Broadcasting Hall of Fame.

The show had bleachers where the kids sat, like the ""Peanut Galleries"" of Mickey Mouse and Howdy Doody.

The kids brought a riddle to the show and Valentine, who loved riddles, would try to solve them. If he failed, the kid got some sort of little prize.

So, one Saturday, this kid was supplied with a risque riddle by an older sibling or (God forbid) a father or uncle. The little kid possibly had a very vague idea about the riddle but he stood up and read it.

Remember, this was before video tape and 8 second delays.

""Why is a woman like a frying pan?""

Valentine was stumped. ""So, why is a woman like a frying pan?""

The kid responds, ""They both have to be hot before you stick in the meat.""

All over Minneapolis and St. Paul, TV screens went dark. The show never aired again.",The Peanut Gallery,10

Everything is going great, then a week in his boss calls him to warn him that he's going to have a rather special passenger that day; the Pope is coming to visit and plans to ride John's trolley line to the cathedral.

When the Pope gets aboard along with his retinue, John is really nervous. What a celebrity! And yet he seems like a regular person, talking and laughing with the other passengers. As John steals a glance in the mirror, the light ahead goes to yellow, then red. He looks back to the road in time but in his panic he slams on the gas instead of the brake, and as the trolley races through the intersection a Mac truck slams into its back end.

John is pulled from the wreckage in a daze, mumbling - ""The Pope?! What hap- hapen- to the Pope?"" A policeman standing close by as the EMTs get to work bandaging him snarls, ""He's dead, and now you're in for it.""

The trial is quick; in other circumstances the verdict might have been manslaughter, but given the magnitude of the tragedy John's head must roll. He's sentenced to death by electric chair, and moved right to the front of death row.

When the day of John's execution arrives, the warden comes to ask him what he'd like for his final meal. John requests porridge, plain porridge. He wolfs it down when it's brought to his cell, and says, ""Alright, now I'm ready!""

He's strapped into the chair, and the lights dim as the charge builds up. The switch is flipped and... nothing. The executioner frowns, and flips the switch off and then on again. Nothing. One more try, and the warden steps in and calls off the execution. ""Let's check the chair and try again tomorrow,"" he says.

John sleeps fitfully and in the morning, the warden offers him another last meal. ""Porridge please, plain, and twice as much as last time."" He eats with gusto, and is again taken to meet his doom. All the preparations are made and the switch is flipped. And again, nothing happens!

The warden is enraged. This can't happen on his watch! As soon as John is back in his cell the warden storms in and slams him against the wall. ""Alright buster, you've got five seconds to tell me your secret! What is it? Five! Is it the porridge? Four! It must be the porridge! Three! Who asks for porridge!? Two!""

Terrified, John slumps to the floor and cries out, ""It's not the porridge, I swear! I don't know what you're talking about! I guess... I guess.. I guess I just never was a good conductor!!""

""Wheres is that son of a bitch?! where is he?!""

""Who?"" the wife says

The husband starts looking around his apartment for the man, and finds a guy hiding on the window, so he goes to grab a baseball bat, signed by Bryce Harper, and starts trying to hit the man on the window, while evading the hits from the husband, the man fell off the window, of course, the husband begins to celebrate, until he realizes he fell on a truck full of pillows!

""So, St. Peter, since I couldn't let him get away with it, I fucken threw mi fridge at him! but in the process, my coat got stuck and I fell too, so here I am, but at least I got that son of a bitch!""

St. Peter sighs and says ""Sorry to tell you, off to hell you go, you killed two people, three if you count yourself""

Man 2 is a really good christian, honest, has 3 kids and works cleaning windows, he was going with his day as usual until he fell off the building while cleaning, luckily, he was able to hold on a ledge 2 floors below, just out a window

""St. Peter, I believe the man in there thought I was a thief! cause when he saw me he grabbed a baseball bat, signed by Bryce Harper, which I thought was funny, and he tried to hit me!""

""Oh god I can see where this is going"" St. Peter thinks holding in laughter

""Now, I've never been very agile myself, so while dodging, I fell! while I was falling I muttered a quick prayer and to my surprise, I was spared! I had fallen on a truck with pillows! my happiness was such that I forgave my agressor, until I looked up and saw him and a fridge coming down on me, and here I am""

""Well, sir, you've been a good man, what happened was an accident but we can't do anything, but heaven is open for you"" says St. Peter

Man 3 comes in, rather startled

""Well what did you do? how'd you manage to die?"" asks St. Peter to the man

""I don't know! all I know is I was balls deep into this chick, we heard her husband come home early so I had to hide in a fucken fridge!""

So, he goes all the way downtown to the tux store and when he opens the door there's a huge long tux line. Apparently everyone in town waited until the last possible minute to rent a tux, which shouldn't be that surprising for a 17 year old boy.

So he waits and he waits and he waits and finally he gets his tux when he over hears two boys talking about their dates and he thinks ""Shit! I need to get a corsage.""

So Billy heads on down to the florist and of course there is a huge long corsage line. This too, of course shouldn't be surprising as flowers will die and you don't want to buy them too early. He waits and waits and finally he has his flowers. When he's leaving the shop he overhears two ladies looking at flowers and talking about wedding transportation and Billy groans and thinks ""I need a limo.""

Wouldn't you know it, prom season is prime wedding season as well, and when he gets to the rental agency theres a huge long limo line. Billy spends even longer waiting in the limo line than the other shops, it's nearly dark when he finally gets his limo.

Billy is relieved to finally have everything he needs for the prom and phones his girlfriend Penny to tell her the good news. Penny asks ""Did you get the prom tickets?"" Billy starts to panic when Penny laughs and told him she got them a week ago and scolds him for waiting so long to reserve everything.

The night of the prom arrives and when Billy and Penny get to the prom theres a huge long prom line to get in, because of course in this day and age they need to search the prom goers for drugs and alcohol and weapons. Billy submits to a pat down and goes into the prom.

Penny says lets go dance for a bit, and after some hard core boogying, Penny suggests they eat. Billy agrees and follows her to the buffet table where there's a huge long buffet line. So they wait and they wait getting hungrier and more impatient until they are finally laden with food and make there way to their table.

They had just begun to eat when Penny realizes she forgot drinks, to which Billy insists upon getting for the both of them. He heads over the the drinks table and there is no punch line.

Knowing that it was not likely that a young child would be left at home alone, the boss decided he would just leave a message with the person who should be there watching over the child. ""Is there any one there besides you?"" the boss asked the child.

""Yes"" whispered the child, ""a policeman"".

Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee's home, the boss asked ""May I speak with the policeman""?

""No, he's busy"", whispered the child.

""Busy doing what?"", asked the boss.

""Talking to daddy and mommy and the fireman"", came the whispered answer.

Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like a helicopter through the ear piece on the phone the boss asked, ""What is that noise?""

""A hello-copper"", answered the whispering voice.

""What is going on there?"", asked the boss, now alarmed.

In an awed whispering voice the child answered, ""The search team just landed the hello-copper"".

Alarmed, concerned and more than just a little frustrated the boss asked, ""What are they searching for?""

Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.
“How long did it take you to catch them?” The American asked.
“Only a little while.” The Mexican replied.
“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” The American then asked.
“I have enough to support my family’s immediate needs.” The Mexican said.
“But,” The American then asked, “What do you do with the rest of your time?”
The Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos, I have a full and busy life, senor.”
The American scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds you buy a bigger boat, and with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats.”
“Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own can factory. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually NYC where you will run your expanding enterprise.”
The Mexican fisherman asked, “But senor, how long will this all take?”
To which the American replied, “15-20 years.”
“But what then, senor?”
The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right you would announce an IPO (Initial Public Offering) and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.”
“Millions, senor? Then what?”
