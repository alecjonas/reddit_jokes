At the Pearly Gates, they are met by St. Peter. He says, ""Sisters, you all 
led such exemplary lives that the Lord is granting you six months to go back 
to earth and be anyone you wish to be.” 
  
The first nun says, ""I want to be Sophia Loren."" And ‘poof’ she's gone. 
  
The second says, ""I want to be Madonna and ‘poof’ she's gone. 
  
The third says, ""I want to be Alberta Pipalini."" 
  
St. Peter looks perplexed. ""Who?"", he asks 
  
""Alberta Pipalini,"" replies the nun. 
  
St. Peter shakes his head and says, ""I'm sorry, but that name just doesn't 
ring a bell."" 
  
The nun then takes a newspaper out of her habit and hands it to St. Peter. 
  
St. Peter reads the paper and starts laughing. He hands it back to her and 
says, ""No sister, the paper says it was the 'Alberta Pipeline' that was laid by 
1,400 men in 6 months.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, David, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So David and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""David! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, David's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells David that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" David says.

""President Trump,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" David says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Trump spots David on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting the Governor, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up, you know I don't give a shit about the Governor.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House he expresses his doubts to David, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says David. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

David and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when David says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later David emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time David returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, David asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with David?'

At the fortress he meets an old man who is to show him is new job and is told he has been assigned as a messenger, riding out between this fortress and others spread further out.  

The old man leads the new recruit over to the watering hole, and shows him two sets of camels.
“In this area, we have the seven day camels.  If you need to ride for any distances that will take less then seven days, these are where you come to collect a camel” the men walked further round the watering hole.  Pointing to a much smaller group of camels, the commander says “and here we have the ten day camels, these are for if you wish to ride for up to ten days”. “Now, before you go journey, you take your camel to the water and make sure they drink their fill, otherwise they won’t make the distance.

The new recruit is then directed to the dispatch office and sent on his first assignment.  Over the weeks he learns that each fortress is exactly seven days or ten days journey from each other.  There are always a lot of messages flowing back and forth between the fortresses so the young man is kept very busy.  

One day, he wakes to the sound of gun fire, and is told that must ride to get reinforcements which are days ride away.  He quickly runs to the watering hole and sees there are only seven day camels,  but he must act fast, so he grabs one, leads it to the water and makes it drink as much as it can, and rides off hell for leather, to the next fortress.

Six days in everything is going great, the camel seems in good health, and then just as they hit the seventh day, bang, the camel falls over dead. The soldier is stuck in the middle of the desert, seemingly without hope of rescue.

After wandering the desert for several days, he has the good luck to be found be some soldiers from the fortress that he was heading to. He explains what’s going on, and is taken back to the their fortress.  The commander of the fortress asks him what happened and why didn’t he take a ten day camel.  The young soldier explains there were no ten day camels and that he tried to fill the seven day camel as much as he could.

“Didn’t anyone tell you how to turn a seven day camel into a ten day camel?”

“No sir”

“Did you see the two bricks beside the watering hole?”

“Yes sir”

“So what you do is, let the seven day camel have his fill of water, and just when he’s about finished, you grab the bricks and whack them together between his legs.  As he goes ssshhh, he sucks in enough water for three more days”

Nobody liked him because he was really stupid, least of all his school teacher who was always annoyed with him.  

One day Billy's mother came to the school to learn how her son was doing. The teacher plainly told the mother that her son was a complete failure, he received the lowest grades and honestly she had never seen anyone half so stupid in her entire teaching career.  

Billy's mother was so enraged and embarrassed that she took her son and moved to another state.  

25 years later the teacher was diagnosed with a very serious illness. The doctors told her that a heart surgery was necessary, and a very complex operation was required, an operation so difficult that only one doctor in the country was qualified enough to perform it. The teacher weighed her options and decided that she had no choice other than to do the surgery. Before being administered a general anaesthetic, the teacher was told that the famed surgeon was already boarding the plane and would soon be here.  

When she opened her eyes after the successful surgery, she saw a handsome young doctor who smiled at her. She wanted to thank him, raised her hand, but suddenly everything went numb, she found that she couldn't produce a sound and her face went blue. She died instantly. The doctor was shocked and while trying to discover what had gone wrong he turned around and saw Billy the hospital janitor who unplugged the oxygen supply equipment to plug in the vacuum cleaner.  

Come on, did you really think that Billy would become a surgeon?",There was boy named Billy and he wasn't very smart,30

The man with the giant, orange head replies, “It’s fine, I don’t mind telling the story. One day long ago I was walking along the beach when I stubbed my toe on a magic lamp.”  

The woman is skeptical, but continues to listen.

“I rubbed the lamp and was greeted by a genie who offered me three wishes. I could hardly believe it, but I quickly told the genie to make me rich beyond my wildest dreams.” 

The woman looked at his impeccably tailored Italian suit and solid gold wristwatch and thought he must be telling the truth. 

“For my second wish, I asked the genie for perfect health, for what good are untold riches if I become too sick to enjoy them? I haven’t gotten so much as a cold since that fateful day.”

The woman, getting impatient now, says “Well that’s all well and good, but what happened to your head?”

The man sighs and gulps down the rest of his drink.

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on.

The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

Well, as time went on, they grew closer and closer, but always kept their promise to each other.

Eventually, times changed, and people became more accepting, more welcoming, and so one day, the carpenter decided to confide in a colleague that he was gay, and that he deeply loved Brad. Word spread, and things seemed to go well, nobody batted an eye! After waiting a couple of days, to make sure his news was good, he admitted to Brad that he had shared their secret and that they didn't have to hide.

Brad reacted poorly, and felt as though his trust was betrayed. He left the carpenter, upset at being outed without his consent. This upset the carpenter so much that he fell into a deep slump, and eventually quit the job he was so dedicated to. At the end of his last day, he lamented what had happened.

Once upon a time there lived a man whose name was Saul the Dreamer. Saul was a man of roving and adventurous disposition, always ready to travel and explore. One day, an itinerant maggid told him about a far away country where onions were unknown.   


""No onions!"" mused the Dreamer. ""Now what kind of pleasure can they derive from their food without onions? I'll go there and introduce the delicious vegetable."" Without further delay he acquired a wagon-load of onions and started out for that country. It was a distant land and the journey took many months.   


Immediately upon his arrival he went directly to the royal court and asked for an audience with the emperor.   


""Your highness, I bring you a new vegetable that possesses the unique quality of improving all food,"" began Saul. ""Even by itself it is a gourmet's delight. I urge you to try it.""   


""Very well,"" agreed the monarch. ""But if this strange vegetable should prove injurious you will forfeit your head.""   


The dinner at which the onions were to be served was a formal one. All the ministers of state, the nobles, and high priests  of the mighty realm were invited. The dishes which contained the onions were first tasted by Saul the Dreamer, then by the slaves, and then, in turn, by the potentates and prelates. Finally the emperor tasted the new vegetable. The reaction among all was of great enthusiasm. Serf and sovereign alike pronounced it most excellent in flavor and succulence. The monarch appropriated the wagon-load of onions for his court and gave Saul their weight in gold.   


When the adventurer returned home, a committee of prominent citizens gathered to congratulate him on his good fortune. For hours he told his curious landsleit of the splendor and magnificence he had witnessed in this distant land where gold was cheaper than onions.   


Fired by these tales, one enterprising individual, Kolboynik by name, conceived a plan by which he was certain to make even a bigger fortune than had Saul the Dreamer. Garlic, he figured, is not only more expensive than onions but infinitely more fragrant. So why not take a few sacks of that delicacy to the faraway land? Sure, if they would exchange gold for onions, they would give him the equivalent weight in diamonds! Whereupon he set out for that mystic country with a cargo of five bags of garlic.   


As did Saul the Dreamer, he succeeded in inducing the emperor to give his innovation a trial. And, just as he had foretold, the garlic was relished much more than the onions. The monarch held a consultation with his ministers as to the form of recompense to be paid this noble visitor. Gold, they unanimously decided, would not be an adequate remuneration for such a desirable food in which even God and his angels might take delight. Therefore they decided to reward him with the most precious commodity in all the kingdom.   


And so Kolboynik returned home with his reward - five sacks of onions. ",Saul the Dreamer (An Old Yiddish Joke from Centuries Back),142

But when he asked her she said she'd love to, but she already had a date. 

""That's okay,"" said Joe. ""Who are you going with?""

""Tommy,"" said Wendy. 

Joe couldn't believe it! At lunch when Tommy sat down, Joe was giving him a death stare.

""What?"" Asked Tommy.

""You knew I liked Wendy and you asked her out!"" Joe yelled.

""I'm sorry. I didn't think you were going to! You've liked her for 10 years and did nothing so I thought you wouldn't mind.""

""It's fine. But now who do I go with?""

""Well I heard Jennifer likes you,"" said Tommy. ""She's pretty. You should go with her.""

Joe reluctantly agreed.

Jennifer agreed and when the day came, everyone was excited. They all showed up at Tommy's house, took some pictures, and went to the prom. The prom was held at this huge ball with these beautiful chandeliers. There was a giant dancefloor and  surrounding it. Everyonecing and having a great time. Joe, Tommy, Wendy and Jennifer were all dancing together having a great time. 

Joe was a bit sad that he couldn't be with Wendy, but at the end of the day, Tommy was his best friend, and he wanted him to be happy.

After the slow dance, it was getting late and everyone was tires. Wendy asked Tommy, ""Hey do you mind getting me a drink?"" 

""Oh me too!"" Jennifer said.

""Sure. Joe, wanna come with me?"" 

The two walked towards the drink table which was on the other end of the hall. 

""So there's no hard feelings between us. Right?"" Asked Tommy.

""Of course not."" Said Joe.

For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.

So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.

A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-' 

Then he died.

They decide to go to the doctor for a checkup. The doctor tells them that they're physically okay, but they might want to start writing things down to help them remember.
Later that night while watching TV, the old man gets up from his chair.
His wife asks, ""Where are you going?""
""To the kitchen,"" he replies.
""Will you get me a bowl of ice cream?""
""Sure.""
""Don't you think you should write it down so you can remember it?"" she asks.
""No, I can remember it.""
""Well, I'd like some strawberries on top, too. You'd better write it down, because you know you'll forget it.""
He says, ""I can remember that! You want a bowl of ice cream with strawberries.""
""I'd also like whipped cream. I'm certain you'll forget that, so you'd better write it down!"" she retorts.
Irritated, he says, ""I don't need to write it down, I can remember it! Leave me alone! Ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream -- I got it, for goodness sake!"" Then he grumbles into the kitchen.
After about 20 minutes the old man returns from the kitchen and hands his wife a plate of bacon and eggs.

His catch,  cleaned and filleted,  was wrapped in newspaper on the passenger-side floor.   

He was late getting home and was speeding...   Wouldn't you know that a cop jumped out, radar gun in hand,  and motioned him to the side of the bridge.   

Bob pulled over like a good citizen.  The cop walked up to the window and said,   ""You know how fast you were going,   boy?""  Bob thought for a second and said,   ""Uh,   60?""  ""67 miles per hour,   son!   67 miles per hour in a 55 zone!""   said the cop.  

""But if you already knew,   officer,""   replied Bob,   ""why did you ask me?""  Fuming over Bob's answer,   the officer growled and said in his sarcastic fashion,   ""That's speeding,   and you're getting a ticket and a fine!""  

The cop took a good close look at Bob in his stained fishing attire and said,   ""You don't even look like you have a job!   

Why,   I've never seen anyone so scruffy in my entire life!""  Bob answered,   ""I've got a job!   I have a good,   well-paying job!""  The cop leaned in the window,   smelling Bob's fish,   and said,   ""What kind of job would a bum like you have?""

 “I'm a rectum stretcher!"" replied Bob.  ""What did you say,   boy?""   asked the patrolman.  ""I'm a rectum stretcher!""  The cop,   scratching his head,   asked,   ""What does a rectum stretcher do?""  Bob explained,   ""People call me up and say they need to be stretched,   so I go over to their house.   I start with a couple of fingers,   then a couple more,   then one whole hand,   and then two.   Then I slowly pull them farther and farther apart until it's a full six feet across.""  

The cop,   absorbed with these bizarre images in his mind,   asked,   ""What the hell do you do with a six-foot asshole?""  

Bob said,   ""You give him a radar gun and place him by a bridge!""","Bob, a lawyer,",73

A month later at bedtime, the daughter says - God bless mommy and daddy.  And goodbye grandma.
Sure enough, the next day grandma breathes her last earthly breath.
The dad realizes this is more than a coincidence, but he is not sure what to do.   He doesn't want to disturb his wife by telling her (Grandma and grandpa were her parents).
Months go by and one night the man is listening to his daughter saying her prayers at bedtime - God bless mommy....she turns her head and looks straight at him -  and goodbye daddy.  What!?  are you sure honey?  She nods.
The man's heart begins racing and he breaks out in a sweat.  He is so upset, he can't sleep at all that night.
The next day he goes off to work, but locks himself in his office.  He takes the phone off the hook, cancels all his meetings and awaits the inevitable.
He stays at work past 5 because he feels secure there.   He watches the hours tick by.  Finally it is midnight and, drenched in sweat, he realizes he has cheated death.
He drives home drenched in sweat and with all his nerves frazzled.

He tiptoed as quietly as he could toward the stairs leading to their upstairs bedroom, but misjudged the bottom step. As he caught himself by grabbing the banister, his body swung around and he landed heavily on his rump. A whiskey bottle in each back pocket broke and made the landing especially painful.

Managing not to yell, Flynn sprung up, pulled down his pants, and looked in the hall mirror to see that his butt cheeks were cut and bleeding.

He managed to quietly find a full box of Band-Aids and began putting a Band-Aid, as best he could, on each place he saw blood. He then hid the now almost empty Band-Aid box and shuffled and stumbled his way to bed.

In the morning, Flynn woke up with searing pain in both his head and butt and Mary staring at him from across the room.

She said, 'You were drunk again last night weren't you?'

Flynn said, 'Why you say such a mean thing?'

Well,' Mary said, 'it could be the open front door, it could be the broken glass at the bottom of the stairs, it could be the drops of blood trailing through the house, it could be your bloodshot eyes, but mostly.....it's all those Band-Aids stuck on the hall mirror!’

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

FLOOR 1 - THESE MEN HAVE JOBS

She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

FLOOR 2 - THESE MEN HAVE JOBS AND LOVE KIDS.

""That's nice"" she thinks ""but I want more"".

So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

FLOOR 3 - THESE MEN HAVE JOBS, LOVE KIDS, AND ARE EXTREMELY GOOD LOOKING.

""Wow"" she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

FLOOR 4 - THESE MEN HAVE JOBS, LOVE KIDS, ARE DROP-DEAD GOOD LOOKING AND HELP WITH HOUSEWORK.

""Oh, mercy me!"" she exclaims ""I can hardly stand it!""

Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

FLOOR 5 - THESE MEN HAVE JOBS, LOVE KIDS, ARE DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS, HELP WITH HOUSEWORK, AND HAVE A STRONG ROMANTIC STREAK.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

FLOOR 6 - YOU ARE VISITOR 31,456,012 TO THIS FLOOR. THERE ARE NO MEN ON THIS FLOOR. THIS FLOOR EXISTS SOLELY AS PROOF THAT WOMEN ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE.

THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING AT THE HUSBAND STORE.

PLEASE NOTE: TO AVOID GENDER BIAS CHARGES, THE STORE'S OWNER OPENED A NEW WIVES STORE JUST ACROSS THE STREET, WITH THE SAME RULES.

The First Floor has wives that love sex.

The Second Floor has wives that love sex and have money and like beer.

She saw a sea of blank faces except for Chandrasekhar, who had his hand up: 'Patrick Henry, 1775,' he said.

'Very good! Who said 'Government of the People, by the People, for the People, shall not perish from the Earth?''

Again, no response except from Chandrasekhar. 'Abraham Lincoln, 1863' said Chandrasekhar.

The teacher snapped at the class, 'Class, you should be ashamed. Chandrasekhar, who is new to our country, knows more about our history than you do.'

She heard a loud whisper: 'F ___ the Indians'

'Who said that?' she demanded. Chandrasekhar put his hand up. 'General Custer, 1862.'

At that point, a student in the back said, 'I'm gonna puke.'

The teacher glares around and asks 'All right! Now, who said that?' Again, Chandrasekhar says, 'George H. W. Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.'

Now furious, another student yells, 'Oh yeah? Suck this!'

Chandrasekhar jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, 'Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997.'

Now with almost mob hysteria someone said 'You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll kill you.' Chandrasekhar frantically yells at the top of his voice, 'Michael Jackson (musician) to the child witnesses testifying against him, 2004.'

The teacher fainted. And as the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said, 'Oh shit, we're screwed!' And Chandrasekhar said quietly, 'I think it was Lehman Brothers, September 15th, 2008'.",It was the first day of a school in USA and a new Indian student named Chandrasekhar Subramanian entered the fourth grade.,145

The soldier is charged with murder and hate crime, and is sentenced to death by the firing squad. The general wanted to make an example of this soldier. Being an advocate for homosexuality, the general orders the firing squad to be comprised entirely of homosexuals.

I really liked doing massages but one day I stepped over the line and had an affair with my married associate. And she gave me an STD. So now I was Fred Johnson, MD, DDS, LMT with an STD.

Now having affairs with your associates is a big no-no within the LMT business so they took away my LMT. So now I was Fred Johnson, MD, DDS, with and STD.

Needless to say, word got around and the med schools took away my MD. Now I'm Fred Johnson, DDS with an STD.

Soon after, Adam's wife passes by the room again, but this time she's topless and sends a wink in James's direction.

Grabbing his face to turn it back to the wall he's painting, he thinks ""come on now, Adam has been there for you when you've needed him most, he's practically your brother! You must stay focused on the job"".

Adam's wife passes by the door once more, except this time she's completely nude and whispers ""I'll be in the bedroom"".

In awe of her figure, and her beauty reminding him he hadn't seen much action in a few months, he concludes ""well Adam, ol' pal, seems I'm needed elsewhere in your home too"". 

So they both go at it, passionate and wild, they almost didn't hear the closing of the door downstairs. Without much time to react, James jumps up, hops into the other room and continues painting. 

Keen to see the progress, Adam pops over and gasps in shock. 

""James! What are you doing painting the room butt naked!?"" 

Thinking quickly, James replies ""oh, I see, you want me to paint your room AND get my clothes dirty?"".

A little puzzled, Adam continues ""uh, well, sure, but for God's sake man, why do you have a raging boner!?""

To which, James responds with ""well how else am I supposed to hold the paint bucket?"" ",James and Adam are great neighbours...,3

He would send out fancy invitations, and patrons would only be allowed into his party if they met two conditions.:

1) They RSVP'd by mail. 

2) They wore a costume that met his tastes and standards.

The man would stand at the door to his luxurious home and personally judge each costume. His likable and magnetic personality, the quality of the party, and the challenge of entry made this THE event to attend. 

The night of the party came, and the man was standing at the door judging guests. For every ten he welcomed, hundreds were turned away.

Imagine his disappointment when Chuck, his best friend from college, showed up wearing grubby jeans, a stained T shirt, and a backwards baseball cap. On his back was some ditzy girl he probably just picked up at the bar, clinging to him and laughing flirtatiously.

""Sup bro?!"" said Chuck. 

""Dude... what were you thinking?"" he replied.

""Whaddya mean?"" Chuck asked.

""You know the rules, man. You didn't RSVP.""

""Sorry, man. I just thought, you know, we're such good friends...""

""Well,"" said the man. ""I would be willing to make an exception if you had worn a costume. But it looks like you didn't even bother.""

""Excuse me!?"" cried Chuck. ""For your information, I am a turtle.""

The man stared at Chuck incredulously. ""A turtle?""

Chuck nodded. ""A turtle.""

""I don't see how -""

Chuck did a little spin, and the girl on his back spread her arms wide and giggled. Very drunk.

""You see now?"" asked Chuck.

The man shook his head.
