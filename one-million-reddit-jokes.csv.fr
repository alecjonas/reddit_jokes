The second goes shopping to buy the man gifts. She gets him a new set of golf clubs, some new tech for his computer, and some expensive clothes. She tells him that she has spent all the money on him because she loves him so much. Again, the man is impressed.

The third invests the money on the stock market. She earns several times the $5,000. She gives him back his $5,000 and reinvests the remainder in a joint account. She tells him that she wants to save for their future because she loves him so much. Obviously, the man was impressed.

The BBC Reporter said, ""I’m a reporter to the end. I want to take out my tape recorder and describe the scene here and what’s about to happen. Maybe someday someone will hear it and know that I was on the job till the end.”

The ISIS leader directed an aide to hand over the tape recorder and dictated some comments. The reporter then said, ""Now I can die knowing I stayed true until the end.”

The ISIS leader turned to the Israeli commando and said, “And now, Mr. Israeli tough guy, what is your final wish?”

“Kick me in the butt ,” said the soldier.

“What?"" asked the leader, “Will you mock us in your last hour?”

“No, I’m not kidding. I want you to kick me in the butt ,” insisted the Israeli.

So the terrorist leader shoved him into the open and kicked him in the behind. The soldier went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9 mm pistol from under his flak jacket, and shot the leader dead. In the resulting confusion, he jumped to his knapsack, pulled out his carbine and sprayed the terrorists with gunfire. In a flash, all terrorists were either dead or fleeing for their lives. As the soldier was untying the reporters, they asked him, “Why didn’t you just shoot them in the beginning? Why did you ask them to kick you in the butt first?”

Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make a plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win.

Adam, already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/AskReddit. He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to a mere 38 points.

Paul, a big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with a third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered ""nostalgia"" and he got downvoted into oblivion.

Bill, who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found a seemingly unrelated post, and made a top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over a thousand fake internet points.

Mike, who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber VI. Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory.

While the other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie ""Up"". He took a picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/Jokes with the title ""STOLEN"".

When the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. ""How did you know that would win?"" ""Easy,"" Chris replied. ""Everyone knows stolen content on /r/Jokes gets all the Up votes.""","Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest",282

Some folks see me as a know-it-all. I'm not, but I have a reasonable memory, and it got me on a game show, once.

The television game show was being recorded - they do a whole week at a time, and this was the wrap-up. I was in the hot seat for the last big question.

The host turned to me, and read the question slowly and carefully. But I didn't know the answer!

Fortunately, I had a backup plan (there was no way I was missing out on this million bucks!). I haven't figured out how to do the fingers-in-the-mouth bit, but still manage to make a pretty piercing whistle. From the back of the stage, four mounted knights-in-armor appeared, waving their lances threateningly at the show's host. Little did I know HIS hidden talents...

The host looked scared for a moment, and then a steely look came over him. He leapt into the air, and karate kicked the first knight onto the floor. He picked up the lance from the stricken knight, and fought off the second, who also fell sprawling on the floor. The second knight's horse shied, and bolted, colliding with the third knight in the process.

The game show host was just beginning to enjoy himself now. He waved the spear he was still carrying at the fourth knight, looked back me, and said...

""Is that your final lancer?""",Game Show,23

Now lent started and the smoky smell wafting from his garden had many people drooling, but being devout Catholics they couldn't partake. After 2 weeks of temptation, they all got together and had their padre approach the guy for a resolution.

The padre approached the guy with the idea of conversion, that way he couldn't eat meat during lent. So the padre came up with his arguments and why he thought it would benefit the man. The padre sweetened the pot by adding the condition that should he convert they would give me large orders like replacing the church roof and all the other orders in the area. The man thought and weighed his options and saw profit so he agreed. They scheduled a baptism for the man for the next day itself.

The padre splashes holy water on the man and says

""You were born a Muslim, you lived a life of a Muslim, but now you are Christian""

The baptism done everyone was happy and placed their woodwork orders with man and paid him advances. The padre told him he has to stop his barbeques till lent is done though he can have fish if the urge is strong.

The next afternoon again the smell of grilled meat began to waft through the area. The people complained to the padre and they made a mob to confront the man for eating meat during lent.

A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""",This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory,87

A Mom visits her son for dinner who lives with a girl roommate.

During the course of the meal, his mother couldn't help but notice how pretty his roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship between the two, and this had only made her more curious.

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and his roommate than met the eye.

Reading his mom's thoughts, the son volunteered, “I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, we are just roommates.""

About a week later, his roommate came to him saying, “Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?""

He said ,""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure.""

He sat down and wrote :

Dear Mother:

I'm not saying that you ‘did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you ‘did not' take the silver plate .. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.

Love,

your son

Several days later, he received an email from his Mother which read:

Dear Son:

I'm not saying that you ‘do' sleep with your roommate, and I'm not saying that you ‘do not' sleep with her. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver plate by now, under the pillow…

Soon, though, security levels may be raised yet again to ""Irritated"" or even ""A Bit Cross."" The English have not been ""A Bit Cross"" since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorized from ""Tiresome"" to ""A Bloody Nuisance."" The last time the English issued a ""Bloody Nuisance"" warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.

The Scots have raised their threat level from ""Pissed Off"" to ""Let's Get the Bastards."" They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.

The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from ""Run"" to ""Hide."" The only two higher levels in France are ""Collaborate"" and ""Surrender."" The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability.

Italy has increased the alert level from ""Shout Loudly and Excitedly"" to ""Elaborate Military Posturing."" Two more levels remain: ""Ineffective Combat Operations"" and ""Change Sides.""

The Germans have increased their alert state from ""Disdainful Arrogance"" to ""Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs."" They also have two higher levels: ""Invade a Neighbour"" and ""Lose.""

Australia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from ""No worries"" to ""She'll be alright, Mate."" Two more escalation levels remain: ""Crikey! I think we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!"" and ""The barbie is cancelled."" So far, no situation has ever warranted use of this final escalation level.

""You know what to do,"" says the Bear.

Back at home after the hunter uses a bottle of mouth wash and calms down a little he goes and buys all the latest hunting equipment.

On the big day they felt ready. The Japanese won by a mile. Afterward, the American team was discouraged by the loss. Morale sagged. Corporate management decided that the reason for the crushing defeat had to be found, so a consulting firm was hired to investigate the problem and recommended corrective action.

The consultant's finding: The Japanese team had eight people rowing and one person steering; the American team had one person rowing and eight people steering.

After a year of study and millions spent analyzing the problem, the consultant firm concluded that too many people were steering and not enough were rowing on the American team.

So as race day neared again the following year, the American team's management structure was completely reorganized. The new structure: four steering managers, three area steering managers and a new performance review system for the person rowing the boat to provide work incentive.

The next year, the Japanese won by two miles. Humiliated, the American corporation laid off the rower for poor performance and gave the managers a bonus for discovering the problem.

Farmer Joe replied, ""Well I'll tell you what happened at the accident, I had just loaded my favorite mule, Bessie into...""

""I didn't ask for a story,"" the lawyer snapped. ""Just answer my question. Did you say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine'?""

Farmer Joe replied, ""Well I had just got Bessie into the trailer and I was driving down the road...""

The lawyer interrupted again and said, ""Judge, I am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the police officer on the scene that he was fine. Now, several weeks after the accident, he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question.""

By this time the judge was fairly interested in what Farmer Joe had to say, so he told the lawyer, ""I'd like to hear what he has to say about hi favorite mule, Bessie."" 

Farmer Joe thanked the judge and continued, ""Well, as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite mule, into the trailer and was driving her down the road when all of a sudden, this truck ran the stop sign and hit my car smack on the side. I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into another. I was hurting real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie in the other ditch moaning and groaning. I could tell she was in a terrible shape just from her whining. Shortly after the accident, a police officer came on the scene. He could hear Bessie whining so he went over to her ditch and, after looking her over, took out his gun and shot her in the forehead. Then the policeman came across the road with his gun in his hand and looked at me and said, ""Your mule was in such bad shape I had to shoot her.

The wind came along, And blew the leaves away. At the sight, Adam did stare, 
There was Eve's treasure, All covered with hair. And wonder came, Under Eve's eyes,
 As Adam's thing, Started to rise. 
They found a spot, That suited them best,
 A nice big tree, Where they began to rest. 
Her legs spread wider, And wider apart, 
While thrill after thrill, Came into her heart. 
The head of Adam's thing, Peeked into the hole, And filled her with passion, Beyond her control. Backward and forward, His thing did slide,
 And Eve's treasure, Was all wet inside. 
The joy was good, She wouldn't let loose, 
Until Adam's thing, Was all out of juice. 
Then down through the years, People did screw, And now it is time, For me and you. 
So pull down your pants, And lay in the grass, Cause I'm in the mood, For a piece of that ASS! ",My longest Pickup line.(Its actually a poem),3

People can submit any pun they like in writing, to be read before the panel of judges, or bet on puns submitted by others.

Steve read through some of the puns, and was genuinely *shocked,* and certainly *greatly* amused.

He had found new puns! This was a rare thing for Steve, and he laughed so hard at these he was sure one of them would win.

With no other options, the other florists enlist the help of the meanest man in town - a thug named Hugh. The florists pay him to storm into the friars’ shop, wreck it with a baseball bat and warn the friars that he’ll be back if they don’t shut down their operation.

The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat. The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog.

The war weary soldier asked, ""Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?"" The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my Little Fifi is using that seat?"" The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.

Again he asked, ""Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired."" The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant.""

The soldier didn""t say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.

The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, ""You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand.

post,atsqvr,2qh72,jokes,false,1550906161,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/atsqvr/three_men/,self.jokes,,"Once there were three men who walked into an empty clearing in the middle of a huge forest, uncomparable by any means to that of any cluster of trees. However, this clearing had a peculiar item lodged in the ground near the center, a shiny golden lamp. The first of the three men slowly worked on dislodging it from the ground, then proceed to rup it for good measure. Just like in the stories, a genie slowly drizzled out of the lamp. So, the genie, who has been through this ordeal for millions of years, gave the shortened version: three wishes, whatever you want, no infinite wishes, and be careful what you wish for. So, the first man takes up his first wish, thinking for a bit, then say,

""I wish I was immortal""

POOF the first man was immortal. The second man thinks for a bit longer, then proceeds to say,

""I wish I was forever 21""

POOF the second man was looking younger already. The third man thinks the hardest of them all, pondering, then finally looking up with a big smile and saying,

""I wish that my right arm was spinning clockwise until I die.""

For the second wish, the first man though a little, then says,

""I wish I had 10 billion dollars""

POOF the man checked his bank account and 10 billion dollars appeared. The second man, again, thought harder, and finally said,

""I wish I was the wealthiest man in the world""

Instantly, 100 billion dollars appear in his bank account. Finally, the last man though even harder than before, a long hard hour, before finally saying,

""I wish that my left hand would spin counterclockwise until I die""

So, the last wish has come rolling up, the first man thinking back, then saying,

""I wish I had the most beautiful wife in the world""  
Instantly, a woman appears and they get instantly married. The second man thought even harder, then finally wishing,

""I wish to be the most attractive man in the world""

Instantly, the first man's wife becomes the second man's wife. Finally, the third man thought for the longest of them all, long and hard. Then, finally, with a triumphant look on  his face, he said,

""I wish for my head to nod up and down until I die""

Ten years later, the three men meet up in a bar. The first man has 100 billion dollars in stock and countless fortunes, with a loving family in a mansion. The second man has 1 trillion dollars in stock, with six families living in six mansions. Finally, the third man walks into the bar, his right arm still spinning clockwise, his left arm still spinning counterclockwise, still nodding his head, and he finally says to the two men,
