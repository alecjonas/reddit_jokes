he hill so he figures might try to see if they have a landline. He knocks and the owner ushers him on account of the rain. He asks to use the phone but the owner says no one will come in the middle of this terrible storm and he has plenty of room so just stay the night, have breakfast and call a mechanic first thing tomorrow. The man looks out at the weather and agrees. 

""Great! My chef will make you anything you want in the morning.""

A few moments later a woman knocks at the door. Her car has also broken down and she needs to use a phone. The owner tells her the same thing he told the man and ends with ""Mi casa, su casa. My chef is world renowned. He'll make any breakfast you can imagine tomorrow."" She thanks him and goes to bed. 

Ten minutes later there's another knock on the door. A man is soaking wet and explains that he lost control of his car in the rain and crashed into a ditch. He asks to call a tow truck, but the owner insists he stay the night and can join the guests for breakfast in the morning. ""My chef is amazing. You can have anything you like!"" 

The next morning the three guests make their way downstairs. The owner asks the man what he'd like to eat.
""Cheerios please.""
""You can have anything! Eggs Benedict, Belgian waffles with fresh berries and cream - anything you want!""
""Cheerios is perfectly fine, thanks.""
The owner is incredulous but serves him Cheerios. 

To the woman he says, ""Now I know you're craving something amazing. French toast, poached eggs and steak...""
""I'll take Frosted Flakes,"" she replies. 
The owner and chef eye one another with disbelief. 
""I swear it's no trouble. You're my guests, you can have anything.""
She insists on Frosted Flakes and the owner reluctantly agrees. 

To the last man, he says:
""Now I know you'll take advantage of my chef's skills. A quiche, candied bacon, cinnamon pancakes, anything!""
""I'll take Frosted Flakes if you don't mind.""
The owner is besides himself. 

With all the options available, it just goes to show that two out of three people prefer Frosted Flakes.",A man's car breaks down on a stormy night,0

The Communist then turns to another friend.

""No hard feelings, my friend. You are forgiven"" says Petya.

""Misha, I must confess to you that I had you sent to the penal battalion in 1942. I am terribly sorry about that day.""

""Please my friend, we all forgive you. You may go in peace"" says Misha.

""Thank you so much guys for being with me throughout all these years"" says the old communist with a tear streaming down his face. ""I don't know where I'd be if it wasn't for you. I never knew you loved me that much despite me being a stool pigeon and a complete dick.""

His friends are visibly touched by his words. Finally, he gathers his last strength and says.

""And in honor of our deep friendship I want you to fulfill my last wish. See that cactus plant on the windowsill? As soon as I die, I want you to take it and shove it up my ass.""

Just as his friends were about to say something, the old communist took his last breath and died.

So Petya rushes to the window, takes the cactus plant off and together they shove it up their dead friend's butt. Suddenly, the friends hear a loud banging on the door followed by a gruff voice shouting:

Cruising around the Irish countryside he turns a lot of heads and he really loves the attention. During one of these trips, he has to stop for gas and pulls up to a small gas station manned by a young kid named Patrick. The golfer gets out and rests against the car while the kid works the pump.

""So, ever seen a car like this?""

The kid shakes his head beaming excitement.

""No, never. It's the coolest car I've ever seen!""

The golfer smirks and reaches into the car, pressing a button. With a mechanical whirl, the canopy folds up and Patrick is looking on excitedly.

""Wow! What kind of car is this?!""

""It's an American car. It's a Buick. Only one in Ireland.""

Again he reaches into the car and turns on the radio, pointing at the antenna that extends automatically.

""Amazing! This car can do everything!""

The pump rings out and Patrick informs what it's going to cost. The golfer reaches into his pocket for his wallet and when he pulls it out, a golf tee drops out of his pocket. Patrick points at it.

""What's that?""

""It's a tee. It's something you put your balls on when you're driving.""

The bartender agrees, thinking it impossible, but the man takes out his eye, revealing it to be glass. 

     The man then bets the bartender $500 he can bite his own eye. The bartender agrees, only for him to take out the same glass eye and bite it. The bartender is annoyed that he took the bet, considering he already knew he had a glass eye. 

     The man says to the bartender, “You know what, here’s a chance to make all your money back and then some. I bet you $50,000 dollars that if you slid a shot glass across the bar, I could run alongside it and piss into it and not miss a single drop, given two tries.” The bartender thinks this really is impossible, so accepts.

    So the man pulls his pants down to his ankles. The bartender slides the glass down, but the man is only able to get two drops in the glass, the rest all over the counter. The man points out he has a second try, so he goes again, only for the glass to be completely dry once it reaches the other end of the bar. 

     The bartender jumps up and down with joy, having just won $49,300. Just then, a man in the back of the bar loudly yells “FUCK!” The bartender hurries over to ask what was wrong.

Trump hasn’t seen a man this alpha since he was last in a room with Putin. Maybe Pelosi. Only this man is more muscular than Putin and has a skin completion that is quite a bit darker than bulk of his base. In fact, this man looks like something he only saw on Fox news and was told by Laura Ingram to be very afraid of.  He has never seen anyone like this in real life before. 

The cell door shuts with a violent clang behind Trump and his new cellmate stands slowly and looks at him for a very long time without a word.  Trump’s new cellmate scans this declining orange blob in front of him.  Flabby. No toupee. Only a small trace of raccoon eyes. 

“Well?” Says the large man says after what seems to be an eternity.

“Well what?” Asks Trump his bowels starting to loosen.

Is really happening? Can he really get away with being the “husband” in this relationship? Can Trump turn one last deal and make this behemoth of a man his prison bitch? Trump weighs his options quickly.  

Trump straightens his flabby body the best he can. He looks the man dead in the eye and says with as much confidence as he can muster: “Well, of course Donald Trump is going to be the husband!”

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

*POOF*, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact, $1,000,000,003.50  

    
The second man thinks for a  bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive.""   

*POOF*, he's holding  papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.  

  
The third  guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to  rotate clockwise for the rest of my life.""  

 *POOF*, his arm starts  rotating.  

  
The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.  
First  guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth.""   

*POOF*, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.  

  
Second guy says  ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I  want.""   

*POOF*, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately  starts flirting with him.  

  
Third guy says ""I want my right arm to  rotate counter-clockwise until I die.""   

*POOF*, now both his arms are  rotating, in opposite directions.  

  
The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.    
First  guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or  injured, I want to stay healthy until I die.""   

*POOF*, his complexion  improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.  

  
Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever.""  

*POOF*, he looks younger already.  

  
Third  guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod  back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.  

  
The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.  

&amp;#x200B;

Many  years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going.  

First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many  times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich  pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.""

 Second guy smiles and says  ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm  still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I  haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

post,brvtrm,2qh72,jokes,false,1558567517,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/brvtrm/joseph/,self.jokes,,"A couple of years ago, one night, I was about to propose to my girlfriend when my roommate Joseph barged into the room out of nowhere, tripped and fell over, breaking a glass table with his face. Totally ruined the mood. Now, I didn't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let' just say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.

Joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

In conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?",Joseph,2

A man from Western Europe goes on an adventure to Eastern Asia. While there he is shocked to learn how different their culture is to his own. The food, the general lifestyle etc etc. One difference that really stands out to him is religion. In particular Buddhism and the monks that observe the faith. 

He decides to go to a temple and get a closer look at what it’s like to be a Buddhist Monk.

After a fairly short taxi he arrives at a beautiful temple. He goes in and he is blown away by what he sees. The wonderful architecture, flowers and small streams. The total peacefulness of it all. Nothing like back home. He goes to the head monk and asks if he could stay there for a while to learn their ways.

The monk agrees as long as the man agreed to abide by their rules.

The man accepts this condition and moves in.

About a month goes by and the man is loving it. He has shaved his head, adopted monk clothing and taken up regular meditation sessions. 

One night he hears of a gathering, a party, if you will. Interested he asks a monk who has been working on one of the small patches of land about how it will work.

""Will there be food and drinks?”, he asks. The monk says yes but no alcohol, we do not allow that. He then asks what the Monk plans on growing in the land, the monk replies “We do not choose, we let the nature decide.”

The man nods and prepares for the evening ahead. 

A few hours into the get together, after all the swaying, he decides to go outside to get some fresh air. He sees a table with a few bowls of different snacks and drinks outside, however no one else seems interested.

He also sees 13 monks including the one from earlier who was working on the patch of land, this time hammering away at wooden fences surrounding it. He asks the Monk from earlier why no one else is enjoying the food and drinks? 

The Monk smiles and responds, ""There never is a punchline when trying to post a karma farm.""",A mans adventure to the East,0

The driver, obviously confused, says to him, “Officer, I don’t understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems to be the problem?”  
The officer replies, “Ma’am, you weren’t speeding, but you should know that driving much slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers.”  
“Slower than the speed limit? No sir, I was doing the speed limit exactly... Twenty-two miles an hour!” The old woman says, pointing to a sign next to the road.  
The State Police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that the sign was the route number, not the speed limit. A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error.   
“But before I let you go, Ma’am, I have to ask... Is everyone in this car OK? Your passengers seem awfully shaken and they haven’t muttered a single peep this whole time,” the officer asks.

Swords were chosen. They faced off and drew their weapons. Jacques struck first, thrusting his sword toward Pierre, but Pierre daftly swatted his sword to the side and returned a thrust, piercing Jacques in the shoulder. They circled each other a few times as Jacques shook off his injury, merely a flesh wound. Again Jacques thrust his sword toward Pierre, and again Pierre perfectly parried and quickly countered, this time stabbing Jacques deeply in the thigh. Jacques limped back, realizing that Pierre's defense was impeccable, so he waited for him to make the next move. Minutes passed as they slowly circled each other, but Pierre made no offensive move. Jacques was growing tired of waiting, and he thought he saw an opening so he again thrust his sword toward Pierre. With cat-like reflexes Pierre sidestepped and quickly returned a thrust, striking Jacques in the other shoulder. Jacques reeled back, fearing that Pierre's defense was impenetrable. He hoped that if Pierre made the next move, he'd be able to counter and win the duel. So again they circled. Five minutes. Ten minutes. Twenty minutes went by, but Pierre didn't even feint toward an offensive move. By this time, Jacques had lost a considerable amount of blood, and was beginning to feel weak. He knew that if he didn't act soon, he would lose consciousness. So with every ounce of strength he had left, he let out a great yell, and with pain searing through both his shoulders, he lifted his sword high above his head, slashing it down toward Pierre with every fiber of his being. Pierre daftly deflected his blow as if it was nothing, and with lightning speed he thrust his sword straight through Jacques' chest. Jacques collapsed, and his loved ones rushed to his aid.

Johnny missed the bus for school one morning, so he had to walk to school. And on the way there, he saw the most beautiful purple flower he had ever seen in his life, so he picked it. 

Once he got to school, he realized that he was late, so he tried to sneak into class without his teacher noticing. Well she did notice, and asked, ""Johnny, why are you late for class"". 

He replied, ""I missed the bus this morning, and so I had to walk up here, and while I was doing so, I saw the most beautiful purple flower, and had to pick it"". 

""WHAT YOU PICKED A PURPLE FLOWER"", she screamed. She got up out of her seat, ran around the desk, and proceeded to kick the shit out of Johnny. ""Go to the principal's office you little bastard"", she said as she threw him out of her ckassroom.

Johnny walked into the office, and the secretary looked up at him and asked, ""Can I help you"". 

Johnny replied, ""I missed the bus this morning, and so I had to walk up here, and while I was doing so, I saw the most beautiful purple flower and had to pick it. I told my teacher and she beat me up, and told me to go to come here"". 

""WHAT, YOU PICKED A PURPLE FLOWER"", the secretary screamed. She got up, ran around her desk, and beat him up even more than his teacher did, and then threw him through the principal's door, didn't bother opening it, just chunked him right through it.

The principal clearly shocked at what he just witnessed, jumped out of his seat cursing. ""What the fuck is going on here"", he asked as he picked  Johnny up, and helped him to a seat.

Little Johnny, looked at his principal and said, ""I missed the bus this morning, and so I had to walk up here, and while I was doing so, I saw the most beautiful purple flower, and had to pick it. I told my teacher and she beat me up and told me to go to the office. I told the secretary what happened, and she beat me up even more, and threw me through your door"".

The principal suddenly became enraged, and shouted, ""WHAT, YOU PICKED A PURPLE FLOWER"", the princpal grabbed Johnny by the back of his jacket, and slammed him down to the ground, kicking him in his side a few times before picking him up again and throwing him out the window of his office. And screamed, ""YOU ARE EXPELLED, I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE YOU ON THIS CAMPUS AGAIN"".

Little Johnny made his way back home, hoping that he could hide the fact he got expelled from school, and noticed his mom's car in the drive way. He dreaded walking into the house, because he didn't want to have to explain why he was expelled. As he walked into the house, his mom looked over at the door and saw him with bruises all over his face. She ran up to Johnny, looking him over hugging him and asking if he was alright.

He looked down at the floor, and said, ""I missed the bus this morning, and so I had to walk to school, and while I was doing so, I saw the most beautiful purple flower, and had to pick it. I told my teacher, and she beat me up and told me to go to the office. I told the secretary what happened, and she beat me up even more, and threw me through the principal's door. I told my principal, and he threw me to the ground, kicked me a bunch of times, threw me out of the window and expelled me"".

His mom screamed ""WHAT, YOU PICKED A PURPLE FLOWER"", while she pushed him against the door, smacked him across the face, and told him, ""I don't want to see you, or hear you, go to your room until your father comes home, and I'll let him deal with you"".

So little Johnny went to his room, and cried himself to sleep, still not understanding exactly what he did wrong. A few hours later, Johnny woke to his parents fighting downstairs. After a few minutes he heard a knock at his door and his father said, ""Son, what's going on, I understand you were expelled from school today"". 

Little Johnny jumped from his bed and ran to his father sobbing, and said, ""I missed the bus this morning, and so I had to walk up there, and while I was doing so, I saw the most beautiful purple flower, and had to pick it. I told my teacher and she beat me up and told me to go to the office.  I told the secretary what happened, and she beat me up even more, and threw me through the principal's door. I told him, and he threw me to the ground, kicked me a few times, and then threw me out of his window, and expelled me. I told mom, she pushed me against the door smacked me around and sent me to my room until you got here"".

The father face turned bright red as he started screaming, ""WHAT, YOU PICKED A PURPLE FLOWER, YOU ARE NO SON OF MINE, GET OUT BEFORE I KILL YOU"", beating the boy with his belt as he ran out of the house.

Days passed, and as little Johnny was walking down the street a police officer noticed him, and said, ""Shouldn't you be in school young man"".

And  Johnny replied, ""I was expelled, and then kicked out of my house"".

The officers' eyes teared up a little, and asked, ""what could you have possibly done to deserve that"". 

""I missed the bus a few days ago, and so I had to walk to school, and while I was doing so, I saw the most beautiful purple flower, and had to pick it. I told my teacher and she beat me up and told me to go to the office.  I told the secretary what happened, and she beat me up even more, and threw me through the principal's door. I told my principal, and he threw me to the ground, kicked me a few times, and then threw me out of his window, and expelled me. I told my mom, she pushed me against the door smacked me around and sent me to my room until my dad got home. I told my dad, he beat me with a belt, and kicked me out the house, and told me I wasn't his son anymore"".

""WHAT, YOU PICKED A PURPLE FLOWER"", the officer screamed while beating Johnny, and pepper spraying him while tazing him. ""You are under arrest"", the officer said as he threw Johnny against the car and handcuffed him.

A couple weeks went by, and Johnny was finally able to see the judge. The judges looked at Johnny, and asked, ""What could you have possibly done to deserve going to jail over"". 

Johnny stood up, looked at the judge and said, ""I missed the bus a couple weeks ago, and so I had to walk to school, and while I was doing so, I saw the most beautiful purple flower, and had to pick it. I told my teacher, and she beat me up and told me to go to the office.  I told the secretary what happened, and she beat me up even more, and threw me through the principal's door. I told him, and he threw me to the ground, kicked me a few times, and then threw me out of his window, and expelled me. I told my mom, she pushed me against the door smacked me around and sent me to my room until my dad got home. I told my dad, he beat me with a belt, and kicked me out the house and told me I wasn't his son anymore. I told the police officer he beat me, tazed me, pepersprayed me, and threw me against the car, and arrested me"".

There was an audible gasp from everyone in the courtroom as he finished his story, and then immediate yelling, screaming, and cursing while the judge banged his gavel on his podium yelling ""ORDER, I WILL HAVE ORDER IN MY COURTROOM...wait, did you say you picked a purple flower"". 

Johnny nodded saying, ""yes, your honor, I did pick a purple flower"".

The judge jumped out of his chair and vaulted over his podium, screaming as he did, ""YOU PICKED A PURPLE FLOWER, I FIND YOU GUILTY OF ALL CHARGES, AND SENTENCE YOU TO DEATH"". And then proceeded to beat Johnny up with the help of the other people in the court room.

About ten years later, Johnny, a priest, and a couple prison guards are walking to the execution chamber, and the priest looks at Johnny and asks, ""Do you believe in God my son, do you believe that no matter what you have done in your life he loves you and will forgive you"". 

Johnny stops walking, looks down, and said, ""I used to father, but I'm not so sure anymore. I don't believe that he will forgive me for this"".

The priest replies with a sad look on his face, replies, ""No matter what you have done, God will forgive you, I promise, all you have to do is confess, and be truly sorry for your sins"".

Johnny smiles a little, and says, ""If you say so father, this is the reason I am here today, about ten years ago, I missed the bus and so I had to walk to school, and while I was doing so, I saw the most beautiful purple flower, and had to pick it. I told my teacher, and she beat me up and told me to go to the office.  I told the secretary what happened, and she beat me up even more, and threw me through the principal's door. I told my principal, and he threw me to the ground, kicked me a few times, and then threw me out of his window, and expelled me. I told my mom, she pushed me against the door smacked me around and sent me to my room until my dad got home. I told my dad, he beat me with a belt, and kicked me out the house, and told me I wasn't his son anymore. I told the police officer he beat me, tazed me, pepper sprayed me, and threw me into the car, and arrested me. I then told the judge what happened, he beat me up along with all the other people in the court room, and then told me I would be executed"".

The priest smacked him with his bible, kicked and punched Johnny saying, ""WHAT, YOU PICKED A PURPLE FLOWER, I HOPE YOU ROT IN HELL YOU MONSTER"". The priest freaked out, ran down the different halls of the building, until he ended up outside, he then ran down the steps to the side walk, and got about half way into the street before getting hit by a bus.


What is the moral of the story?


Most people will say, ""Don'tpick the purple flower"".

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.

“Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

Unfortunately, she did not speak English. He could not use his smartphone to translate to French as the battery died, so he had to give up trying to start a conversation. But the bartender gave him a brilliant idea, and he asked for some napkins. 

He drew some food on the napkin and showed it to the woman. She smiled and nodded her head, and he bought her dinner. As the bar's band played on, he drew some musical notes and two figures dancing. She smiled and nodded again, so he took her hand and led her to the floor for a dance. Later, he drew a cocktail glass and she nodded as well, so he bought her a few rounds. As the night wore on, the woman got tired and drew a bed on the napkin. The man shook his head and looked lost, so the woman left him and he walked back to his stool alone.

Start with a cage containing five monkeys. In the cage, hang a banana on a string and put stairs under it. Before long, a monkey will go to the stairs and start to climb towards the banana.

As soon as he touches the stairs, spray all of the monkeys with cold water. After a while, another monkey will make an attempt with the same response -- all of the monkeys are sprayed with cold water. Keep this up for several days.

Turn off the cold water. If, later, another monkey tries to climb the stairs, the other monkeys will try to prevent it even though no water sprays them.

Now, remove one monkey from the cage and replace it with a new one. The new monkey sees the banana and attempts to climb the stairs. To his horror, all of the other four monkeys attack him. After another attempt and attack, he knows that if he tries to climb the stairs, he will be assaulted.

Next, remove another of the original five monkeys and replace it with a new one. The newcomer goes to the stairs and is attacked in the same manner. The previous newcomer also takes part in the punishment with enthusiasm.

Replace another of the original monkeys with a new one. The new one attempts to the climb the stairs and is attacked as well. The second newcomer will join the attack like the first one did. Now two of the four monkeys that beat the latest arrival both have no idea why they were not permitted to climb the stairs, or why they are participating in the beating of the newest monkey.

After replacing the fourth and fifth original monkeys with the same method, all the monkeys which had originally been sprayed with cold water have been replaced. None of the monkeys now in the cage have ever been sprayed with water whilst attempting to climb the stairs. Nevertheless, no monkey ever again approaches the stairs.

Why not?

Despite doubting his doctor, John spends his day playing good old American football. After he returns home he finds that although his face is normal again, the skin around his eyes flaking away and turning black, so he decides to go to the doctor again.

After the visit, the man reluctantly spends his day doing mundane chores around his house. When he finishes though, he sees that although his eyes are fine, his chin is wrinkling and turning purple, so he visits the doctor for a third time.

When his doctor sees his chin, he says ""That must be Thanos syndrome - I've only read about it in the books"". Since John starts looking very depressed, his doctor asks ""What's wrong? The cure for Thanos syndrome is quite easy"" John then says ""Doctor, I've spent 2 days getting tackled by linebackers and bending over with chronic back pain, and now you're saying that shoving ants up my ass is easy?!?""","One day, John goes to his doctor for a red face",4

Two Mexicans are stuck in the desert after crossing into the United States , wandering aimlessly and starving. They are about to just lie down and wait for death, when all of a sudden Luis says.........

""Hey Pepe, do you smell what I smell. Ees bacon, I theenk.""

""Si, Luis, eet sure smells like bacon. ""

With renewed hope they struggle up the next sand dune, &amp; there, in the distance, is a tree loaded with bacon.

There's raw bacon, there's fried bacon, back bacon, double smoked bacon ... Every imaginable kind of cured pork.

""Pepe, Pepe, we ees saved. Ees a bacon tree.""

""Luis, maybe ees a meerage? We ees in the desert don't forget.""

""Pepe, since when deed you ever hear of a meerage that smell like bacon...ees no meerage, ees a bacon tree.""

And with that, Luis staggers towards the tree. He gets to within 5 metres, Pepe crawling close behind, when suddenly a machine gun opens up, and Luis drops like a wet sock. Mortally wounded, he warns Pepe with his dying breath,

""Pepe... Go back man, you was right, ees not a bacon tree!""

I had nothing more than a flatcap, a shovel, and my favorite pint glass to my name. It was around the time where cars were a brand new luxury and a lass would let you put a thumb in her bum just to honk the horn. Well as luck would have it, I was out peat poaching for the winter when none other than Jonas John Jameson himself broke down on the side of the road near the man's field from which I was stealing. Having had spent a stint in the rebellion of June 1919 as a tractor mechanic, it was no time flat that I fixed the buggy. Being the 13th son of Mr. Jameson himself, Jonas was charitable and, I suspect, in the early stages of alcohol poisoning. He gave me the keys and told me to pull into town while he slept it off. I tried my best to ignore Jonas beating his dick like a Protestant as we pulled into town. A group of women soon formed and I had my thumb at the ready. A bright eyed blond came up and swiftly presented her brown eye. By the time I had her in my palm like a bowling ball, it was too late to realize she was my brother's fiancee. 

 Now what you need to realize about my brother my sweet children is that he raised fighting ducks at the time. The ducks and mallards that came out of his godforsaken training regiment were so vicious they make Margaret Thatcher look like a Saint in comparison. I once saw them peck a five-year-old coalminer to death just for walking within 10 feet of them unharnessed. In a panic I uncorked my hand from her rear end, then sped off into the distance; I must've hit 8 miles an hour in my haste. Pubs were flashing past me as I pulled into the family home. Jonas, oblivious to the whole affair, was snoring with his trousers undone. I covered his turgid member as best I could with his tophat and went inside.

As soon as I walked in, i realized in horror that not only could I not avoid my brother, today was his wedding and all 8 of my sisters were getting dressed up. Upon seeing me, with stolen peat under one arm, a crankshaft starter held in the other fist with a noticeably brown thumb, and perhaps most noticeably a steel cutter for a hard on, I was less than dressed for the occasion. With no time to spare, and a lump in my throat and my pants, I made my way to the church. 

Not two steps from the door I could hear the menacing honking from inside;my brother was celebrating his big day by letting all the most vicious of his ducks corral the churchfolk into a corner. I watched in disbelief as they threw handfuls of corn and barley to keep them at bay. No sooner had I walked through the doors than my brother's fiancee pointed me out to her husband to be and said ""Oi, there's the cunt that thumbed me."" With a cold look that still haunts me, children, my brother raised his duck whistle to his lips.

Before he could blow, none other than Jonas John Jameson, revived from his Nap 'n Wank, as we called it back then, strutted into the church. A hush fell upon the crowd and even the ducks, more than familiar with his libations, bowed their bills in reverence. Jonas remarked how I had saved his life and gotten him from a remote peat farm to the safety of our local pub. Once he understood the peril I was in, he proposed to my brother, and I quote ""if your brother can survive a cagematch with your top duck, you will absolve him of thumbing your fiancee. In fact, £15 says he can do it in nothing but his flatcap."" 

The onlookers, mesmerized by the demigod before them, and equally grateful no more lives would be lost to the bloodthirsty ducks, cheered at the proposition. My brother relented to the pressure and the match was on.

I don't want to bore you, children, but suffice to say I stripped to my flatcap and gave it my all. Likewise, I don't want to traumatize you, but your grandfather has woken up every morning with a rod that could and had chip a tooth. The duck was on my chest, my hands around its throat. His honking comrades only added fuel to his fire. His bill was taking nips out of my flatcap. I thought all was lost. 

It was at that moment I felt a slender hand from the crowd dart between my cheeks and punch my prostate like a sledgehammer. In one fell swoop, I launched off the ground, seemingly from the force of my ejaculate, got ahold of the duck's neck, and brought it down on my knob with a fury never before seen.

I looked for whoever has given me that angelic touch, but the crowd was swelling to raise me into their shoulders, walking me out of the church and into the street, Jonas John Jameson at the head of the parade. My brother, crushed by his loss of £15, the equivalent of 3 years duck training, was crushed. I searched the crowd for my mysterious savior when, coyly, across the street, my brother's fiancee gave a thumbs up with a dainty brown finger.

And that, my sweet grandchildren, is how I met your grandmother.","""Grandpa, tell the story again when you broke a duck's neck with your erection at your brother's wedding!""",176

The rumor around the water cooler was that she was a downright mean customer, and could yell loud enough to hurt your ears for a day. So he was understandbly a bit nervous as he knocked on her door that sweltering Monday afternoon. Harder knocks went unanswered and the man, feeling a bit relieved, went back to the office to report.

His boss was unmoved by anything though, and kicked him right back out, telling him not to come back until he'd found the woman and her payment. So the man set out grudgingly again and began going door to door, asking the neighbors where he might find the woman. His feet were hurting and he was sweating all over. It didn't help that most of the neighbors shut their door in his face. But one older woman a couple blocks down felt sorry for the guy and sat him down with an iced tea. She had a story to tell.

""This ain't no ordinary woman, sonny. She's fixin' to build herself a damn kingdom or something, as far as any of us can figure. She's been hoarding cars from different companies and watchin' over them like a hawk. No idea why, but she's damn near maternal about it, swiping away at anyone who comes close with that awful voice o' hers. Not only that, but she's keepin' them only a few blocks down in either way from a huge line of leasing places, pretty much spittin' in their faces. And these are some of the nastiest leasers you've ever seen, makes your boss look like a little girl when it comes to gettin' their stuff back. And not a single one of them has been able to get any money out of her or get their car back. I don't think you want to be messin' with her.""

The man, shaken, thanked her for the tea and the info. But as he's trembling and cursing his luck, a sudden wave of strength came over him from out of the blue. He stood up straight and a look of utter determination etched suddenly onto his face. ""Ma'am, I think you better tell me where this woman is at. Someone needs to set her straight, and it's going to be me. Just tell me where to find her and I'll do the rest. I'm going to be the most popular man around here when I'm done with her.""

The neighbor, astonished, broke out into a big smile at this young man's sudden resolve.

He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong.

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk. “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”

post,brkd1q,2qh72,jokes,false,1558499462,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/brkd1q/a_woman_owed_money_on_her_car/,self.jokes,,"So the young man from the leasing office was sent out to find and collect from her. The rumor around the water cooler was that she was a downright mean customer, and could yell loud enough to hurt your ears for a day. So he was understandbly a bit nervous as he knocked on her door that sweltering Monday afternoon. Harder knocks went unanswered and the man, feeling a bit relieved, went back to the office to report.

&amp;#x200B;

His boss was unmoved by anything though, and kicked him right back out, telling him not to come back until he'd found the woman and her payment. So the man set out grudgingly again and began going door to door, asking the neighbors where he might find the woman. His feet were hurting and he was sweating all over. It didn't help that most of the neighbors shut their door in his face. But one older woman a couple blocks down felt sorry for the guy and sat him down with an iced tea. She had a story to tell.

&amp;#x200B;

""This ain't no ordinary woman, sonny. She's fixin' to build herself a damn kingdom or something, as far as any of us can figure. She's been hoarding cars from different companies and watchin' over them like a hawk. No idea why, but she's damn near maternal about it, swiping away at anyone who comes close with that awful voice o' hers. Not only that, but she's keepin' them only a few blocks down in either way from a huge line of leasing places, pretty much spittin' in their faces. And these are some of the nastiest leasers you've ever seen, makes your boss look like a little girl when it comes to gettin' their stuff back. And not a single one of them has been able to get any money out of her or get their car back. I don't think you want to be messin' with her.""

&amp;#x200B;

The man, shaken, thanked her for the tea and the info. But as he's trembling and cursing his luck, a sudden wave of strength came over him from out of the blue. He stood up straight and a look of utter determination etched suddenly onto his face. ""Ma'am, I think you better tell me where this woman is at. Someone needs to set her straight, and it's going to be me. Just tell me where to find her and I'll do the rest. I'm going to be the most popular man around here when I'm done with her.""

&amp;#x200B;

The neighbor, astonished, broke out into a big smile at this young man's sudden resolve. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, if you're looking for Car Ma, you have to go to Repo St.""",A woman owed money on her car,3

About a week after Joe moved in, I realized that we actually had a lot in cimmon. We liked the same movies, the same food, all of that. We were best of friends until one night.


On that night, I was planning to go on a date with my fiancé. I called her an hour before the date and she said that she cancelled. She was apparently sleeping with Joe! Outraged, I hung up and planned my revenge.



The next day, I went to Joe's house. He greeted me with a nice and friendly ""hey."" I asked why he stole my fiancé from me and he said that it was because Joe had fallen in love with her. She even wanted to marry Joe more than me! I was so furious that I slammed Joe's head against the glass table, making him bleed. I instantly ran to my car and drove home.


The next day, I received news that Joe wasn't happy with me. I messed his eye up pretty bad and now he had to wear a cotton patch where his left eye was for a couple of months. After I received the news, he called me and said that he was moving out of town with my ex-fiancé. He didn't say where he was going, but I still have so many questions about him. Where did he move from? Where did he go with my fiancé

He starts talking to a local bar fly and it turns out this man’s uncle had once met Pancho Villa!

“Once, when my uncle was a young boy, Pancho Villa came riding through his town.  My uncle, who was young and stupid at the time, ran up to Pancho Villa and stopped his horse.  The horse reared  causing Pancho’s pistol to fly out of its holster and on to the ground right next to my uncle.

My uncle, who was still young and stupid, picked up the gun and immediately aimed it at Pancho Villa.

‘Get off your horse,’ he barked, half-jokingly.

Pancho weighed the situation and realized he didn’t have much of a choice, so he climbed down off of his horse.

‘Get on the ground,’ my uncle ordered.

Pancho very reluctantly dropped to his knees and lie on the ground.

‘Eat that pile of horse shit right there.’

Pancho Villa scanned around, but his men were no where in sight.  He had no choice but to grudge it out and take a bite of the horse’s shit that lie there in front of him.

When Pancho Villa ate the shit, my uncle lost it.  He started laughing so hard that he couldn’t contain himself and Pancho saw his opportunity.  He lunged at my uncle and ripped his gun back from his hand.

Just then, Pancho’s men rode up.  They almost killed my uncle right there on the spot, but Pancho Villa stopped them.

‘You may live another day boy, but you must do one thing first.  Eat that pile of horse shit right there.’

My uncle had no choice but to choke down the entire pile of horse shit as Pancho Villa and his soldiers looked on.  When he was finished, they rode off out of town.”

“Wow! What an amazing story!” the traveler said. “But you really can’t expect me to believe that, do you?”

“You don’t believe me?  My uncle still lives just outside of town.  You can ask him for yourself!”

So the two men walked down to the uncle’s farm.  When they arrive, they see an old man sitting on the porch.”

“Hey there uncle. This man here has a question for you.”

The traveling man then asked, “Um, excuse me sir, but is it true that you once met Pancho Villa?”

The uncle bounced up and happily replied, “Met him?!  I had lunch with the guy!”",Pancho Villa,7

But the social workers there raise doubts about their suitability.

So the couple produces photos of their 50-foot motor home, which is clean and well maintained and equipped with a beautiful nursery.

The social workers are finally satisfied and ask the couple, “What age child are you hoping to adopt?”

The husband says, “It doesn’t really matter, as long as the kid fits in the cannon.”",A husband and wife who work for the circus go to an adoption agency looking to adopt a child,178

&gt;u/_cg88
&gt;I'll start saying I have nothing against casual sex. I've done it. Everything was good for it, and I've made bank doing it.  
&gt;  
&gt;The thing is, I developed this conviction that sex is way more productive with feelings involved. When the other person feels comfortable with your presence and is really into you, sex is amazing. And this might sound like hyper-competitive attitudes, but I like to assure myself that the other person likes me even more than I like them. Maybe it has to do with me getting that little control edge, but of course, not being selfish during sex.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm in a relationship right now, and having the most productive sex of my life.  
&gt;  
&gt;What's your opinion on casual sex vs sex with feelings involved?

post,brglub,2qh72,jokes,false,1558476373,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/brglub/five_minute_management_lesson/,self.jokes,,"Lesson 1: 
A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower, when the doorbell rings. 

The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. 

When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next-door neighbour. 

Before she says a word, Bob says, 'I'll give you $800 to drop that towel.' 

After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob, after a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 and leaves. 

The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. 

When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks, 'Who was that?' 

'It was Bob the next door neighbour,' she replies. 

'Great,' the husband says, 'did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?' 

Moral of the story: 
If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.

Lesson 2: 
A priest offered a Nun a lift. 

She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. 

The priest nearly had an accident. 

After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. 

The nun said, 'Father, remember Psalm 129?' 

The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. 

The nun once again said, 'Father, remember Psalm 129?' 

The priest apologized 'Sorry sister but the flesh is weak.' 

Arriving at the convent, the nun sighed heavily and went on her way. 

On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, 'Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.' 

Moral of the story: 
If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity.

Lesson 3: 
A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. 

They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, 'I'll give each of you just one wish.' 

'Me first! Me first!' says the admin clerk. 'I want to be in the Bahamas , driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.' 

Puff! She's gone. 

'Me next! Me next!' says the sales rep. 'I want to be in Hawaii , relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life.' 

Puff! He's gone. 

'OK, you're up,' the Genie says to the manager. 

The manager says, 'I want those two back in the office after lunch.' 

Moral of the story: 
Always let your boss have the first say.

Lesson 4:
An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing. 

A small rabbit saw the eagle and asked him, 'Can I also sit like you and do nothing?' 

The eagle answered: 'Sure, why not.' 

So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the eagle and rested. All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it. 

Moral of the story: 
To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up.

Lesson 5:
A turkey was chatting with a bull. 

'I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree' sighed the turkey, 'but I haven't got the energy.' 

'Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?' replied the bull. ‘They're packed with nutrients.' 

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. 

The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. 

Finally after a fourth night, the turkey was proudly perched at the top of the tree. 

He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot him out of the tree. 

Moral of the story: 
Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.

Lesson 6: 
A little bird was late flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. 

While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. 

As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. 

The dung was actually thawing him out! 

He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. 
A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. 

Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him. 

Morals of the story: 
(1) Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy. 
(2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.
(3) And when you're in deep shit, it's best to keep your mouth shut!

They are together listening to the radio through the window of the barn and the Horse hears am the guitar and he says “ hey I really love the guitar, you know what I’m gonna learn it”, so he goes off and learns how to play the guitar and he comes back but he’s really good at the guitar.

The cow says” I’m gonna Learn the drums” so just like the Horse he goes off, learns the drums and comes back but he’s really good at the drums. The Pig says” since you guys have, I’m gonna learn an instrument”. So he goes off and learns the piano.
He comes back and is amazing at the piano.
So the three best friends decide to go on tour. 

As soon as they are about to leave, the horses mother falls ill with cancer. “Sorry guys I’m gonna have to stay here to help my mother, I’ll send some guitar samples for you to use while your on tour. The cow and the pig agreed hastily.

Since the tour was overseas, the cow and the pig had to go on an airplane, but the Horse finds out that the plane had crashed and he is mortified. He goes to tell his mother and she has died of cancer while he was gone.

He becomes depressed and goes to the pub. 

The horse walks into the bar and the bartender says, “why the long face”.

The horse responds “ my best friends and my mother just died and I’m meant to be attending therapy in a week”.

2 years pass and the horse is mentally stable again and he has moved on. While returning to the barn he comes to find that the farmer has bought to new farm animals, a chicken and a goat.

The horse introduces himself and over the next few months they all become close friends. The chicken and the goat become interested in the horses stories about his band and they decide to make a new band to live on the legacy of the pig and cow.

The chicken decided to learn drums and the goat decides to learn piano. So they go on tour.

They all landed in China and celebrated their successful tour. And they go on a shopping spree.

Why did the chicken cross the road?
Because he found a bottle of strawberry perfume. 
So the chicken decided to buy the perfume.

At dusk, they all decide to go eat at a Chinese restaurant and order shrimp. They all love it especially the chicken.

The waiter comes over to ask them about drinks and he compliments the chickens perfume.

The chicken thanks the waiter and asks if there’s any chance that he knows where the Shrimp is from.” No sorry “ said the waiter, “ but I know that the chef does”.

So the chicken follows the waiter to the kitchen.

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe. 

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Suddenly, out of the nearby woods, a goat appears, running like the wind. It rushes toward the two men, then right past them, running as fast as it’s legs will carry it. Suddenly it leaps in the air and into the hole.

The two men are astonished with what they’ve just seen and look at each other in amazement.

Then, out of the woods comes a farmer who spots the men and ambles over. He asks them, “Hey, you two guys seen my goat out here?”

A policeman walked into the pub and asked the old landlord if he had seen 3 men enter. The man pondered for a while, before pointing a wrinkled old finger to the door leading to the basement.

The policeman entered the basement to find the 3 sacks leaning against the wall. Curious, he kicked the first one, inside of which hid Charles. Thinking on his feet, Charles did his best impression of a dog. ""Woof woof, woof woof"", he barked. 

The policeman frowned, but said nothing. He moved to the next bag, where Angus hid, and decided to kick it too. Following Charles' lead, Angus began to purr like a cat. Again, the policeman frowned, but said nothing.

The ant sidles up. ""Sure but, uh ... what's in it for me?""

Of course, the elephant can't feel a bloody thing, but he can hear the ant grunting and working away.
