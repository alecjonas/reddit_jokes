Another bird joke I just read, combined with the date, suddenly jarred my memory. I've never written it so there's probably a better version out there, but here goes.

A guy goes to a pet store looking for a Christmas gift for his wife. He looks around for a while, but nothing is really hitting the spot. Finally a salesperson asks if they can help him find anything. After explaining the situation the attendant says ""you should meet Chet, he's perfect for a Christmas gift!"". The man is surprised to be shown a rather plain looking, unremarkable, parrot. 

""What's so great about him?"" he asks. ""Watch this"" says the salesperson who then takes out a lighter and holds it under the birds left foot. Suddenly Chet breaks out in song with a beautiful rendition of  'O Holy Night'. ""Wow! That's amazing!"" the man exclaims. ""Oh, that's not it"" says the salesperson as she moves the lighter under the birds other foot. Once again Chet starts singing, this time a fun 'Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer'. The man purchases the bird and rushes home to show his wife, repeating the same demonstration as the the salesperson. 

A few days later the wife has a friend over, and decides to show off her new pet. She finds a lighter, introduces her friend to Chet, then lights the lighter and holds it between the birds legs. Chet starts off in song... ""Chet's nuts roasting on an open fire...""",A bird named Chet,13

Would you mind giving me some advice or telling me some secrets?"".

The Queen replies ""It is very easy and simple. Just surround yourself by smart people. For example, listen to this"". 

The Queen's tells her butler to add the Prime Minister, Theresa May, to the phone call. 

""Theresa, I have a simple question - if your mother has a child and your father has a child, and it's not your brother or sister, then who is it?"" says the Queen. 

Theresa May thinks for a moment and responds ""Well it would be me""

""Correct. Thank you very much Theresa"" says the Queen.

Donald says ""Ahh, you know, that's real clever, I might have to try that on some of my cabinet members. Thank you very much"".

The next day Trump calls Jeff Sessions to his office. 

""Jeff, I have a question for you. If your mother has a child and your father has a child and it's not your brother or sister, who is it?""

Jeff thinks long and hard and says ""You know what Donald, I'm not sure, but I'll give you an answer by tomorrow""

Trump agrees and sends Jeff on his way. 

Jeff then gathers up the cabinet and asks them the question. Nobody knows the answer, and after many failed attempts someone speaks up and says ""I know! Lets ask Sean Hannity! He's a smart man, he should know"". So they call up  Sean Hannity.

They ask him, ""Sean, we have an important question for you... if your mother has a child and your father has a child and it's not your brother or sister, who is it?""

""You bunch of morons, it would be myself!"" says Sean Hannity.

""Ahhh!! We get it now!"" says the members of the cabinet.

The next day Jeff Sessions approaches the president.

""Sir, I believe I have the answer to that question you asked me the other day."" says Jeff.

""Well ok, what is the answer?"" says Donald.

""Sean Hannity!"" says Jeff Sessions

Trump looks at him for a second and gets up and yells ""No you god damn idiot, it's Theresa May!""",Donald Trump has a phone call with Queen Elizabeth II,5

post,7m2asg,2qh72,jokes,false,1514221140,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7m2asg/proof_that_santa_doesnt_exists/,self.jokes,,"There are about 2 billion children on earth. But Santa  does not have to visit Muslims, Hindus, Jews or Buddhists, which reduces the number to 15% or 378 million. Thus, with a world average of 3.5 children per household, there are 108 million households to visit if we can assume that there are at least one nice child in each home.

Because of the different time zones and rotation of the earth, Santa Claus has about 3.5 hours to work, assuming he travels westward, which makes the most sense. He thus visits 967.7 homes per second. This means that for every Christian home with at least one nice child, Santa has about 1/1000 s to park the sledge, run out and jump down the chimney, divide Christmas presents, say Ho HonHo, eat the porrigde, up through the chimney again, in the sledge and off to the next house.

If we assume that all homes to be visited are evenly distributed, it is approximately 1km between each house on average. The area thus travels about 100km, vists to bathroom and other breaks are not included. In other words, the sledge of the plot flies approximately 1000 km per second.. As in comparison, it is mentioned that the fastest craft man so far created, the Ulysseus spacecraft, travels about 50 km per second. As an anecdote, we can mention that the normal reindeer can come up at a speed of about 30 km per hour. 

The load in the sled is another interesting object. If we assume that each child receives presents corresponding to 1 kg, the sledge has a load of 500,000 tonnes, the weight of Santa is not included. On land, a normal reindeer can carry about 200 kg. Even if we assume that the special flying reindeer can draw a weight ten times this, the sled will not come out of the spot unless the plot provides approximately 360,000 reluctant reindeers. This will give the sledge a total weight of approximately 600,000 tonnes.

600,000 tons, flying at 1,000km per second, produce enormous air resistance. This will heat the reindeers, much like a meteorite that enters the earth's atmosphere. The two leader reindeers will then absorb an energy equivalent to 14 300 trillion Joule per sec, or 14 300 trillion watt. The leader rails will simply burn up immediately and the back will be exposed to a bang when the air barrier breaks and then burn themselves up. All the reindeers will meet their ancestors in less than 4.26 million seconds, i e when the plot reaches its fifth house.

However, this is hypothetical, because when the sleigh accelerates from 0 to 1000 km / s in 1/1000 seconds, all of the sleigh will be exposed to a G-force 17500 times greater than gravity. If Santa weighs approximately 150 kg (weight estimated according to existing copies) he will be stuck in the back of the sled, corresponding to a weight of approximately 3 million kg, which would immediately crush each leg in his body and turn him into a wet spot.

The conclusion should be that if the damn Santa ever lived, he is definitely dead now.

Edit: Correction for speed of light. ",Proof that Santa doesn’t exists,3

So a friend at work told me about a friend of his, who wanted to get this large tree stump out. It was at least a metre across with a massive root system and sat close to his house. It would be in the way, since he needed to do repairs to one of the walls. A friend of his works as an explosives guy at construction sites. This guy probably should never have been trusted with explosives in the first place. He would drive around with sticks of dynamite in his car trunk at all times and so on.

Anyway, this explosives guy sees his friend digging around the tree stump and it looks like he's getting nowhere. He suggests that they put half a stick of dynamite under the tree stump, ""It will just pop up slightly and with the roots cut off you can tow it away with your car. Easy!"" The first piece of dynamite, he drops into the root system. They can't find it, so he says they'll just put in another one, ""it won't make much of a difference.""

Without any cover over the tree stump, they proceed to detonate. It's a huge explosion. The explosion leaves a wet mud hole, like a small swimming pool. The house is covered in it and the they can't find the tree stump anywhere. Then the house owner's wife calls from the neighbor's place about 300m away, wondering if their electricity also is out. Some time later the power company finds a tree stump in some power cables hanging over a road leading up to the house. ",The tree stump,0

He had been part of this project from its inception, and during its long development he had risen in influence becoming one of the lead engineers on the project. During all this time, he had met his beautiful wife and had become the father of a wonderful child named Timmy. He loved his family very much, but his identity was in this project. He would see it through, unlike those before him. After a decade and a half of sweating every detail, building working models, and constructing the base of the island, the time had come to set sail on the floating city, the largest man-made vehicle in history.

__He was one of the first people to move onto the island, in the developed area near the center. He would visit home from time to time, but overall he trusted his wife with the task of raising his son. He only hoped he could keep his family together. He thought about backing out, but in his mind it was too late.

__He could not. He came home to divorce papers. He could hardly blame her for leaving but was nevertheless angry over how she clearly desired to hurt him. She took much of his wealth and was never seen again. This left the engineer with a dilemma: he was more invested than ever in the project, but he had a son to raise. His colleagues encouraged him to take a smaller role on the team and move off the island, but he could not do it. He would be on the island when it was finished. Timmy, his son, would join him on the island. Anyway, he'd be done with his part sooner than later, so there was no reason in his mind to give up his position.

__This did Timmy no favors. He had gotten to that age where he'd started to make distinct friends, his first network, and he was torn away from that. The people on the island were sympathetic to his predicament, but there was little they could do to help. They were adult engineers. Timmy had little interest in their activities. They also did their best to keep him safe.

__In the center of the island, there was a valve used to regulate water flow through the center of the island. To reduce turbulence during storms among other things, water could be allowed to fill a central pool. When the island was to be finished, the valve would be operated by a computerized system, but at this point it was operated by a large, red lever to be operated only by professionals.

__The adults told Timmy the same thing over and over: ""Don't touch that lever. Don't touch the lever, or you could sink the island. Don't even THINK about touching that red lever."" They would tell him in the middle of recreation or fun. He felt like the grown-ups cared a lot more about the island than about him. He grew disinterested in their company and resentful of his father. Instead of humoring them, he became an imaginative boy, and lived in his own thoughts most of the time.

__His father sensed his son's resentment toward him, and it broke his heart. He thought quite a lot about leaving the island, but it seemed too late now. He was here to stay. That being said, outside of leaving, he would do anything to please his kid.

__Everything changed when Timmy came home one day. He ran into their suburban home and shouted, ""Daddy! I met a friend today! I met a friend, and his name is Nate."" His father asked if he could meet this Nate. ""He's in the garage,"" his son said nonchalantly.

__To the engineer's great surprise, in his garage was a wild-looking dog. It was a mutt so thoroughly interbred, one could not decipher the breeds at play. It moved its head erratically. It was lean about the belly. It had no tags or labels. Timmy must have named it. It looked like a street dog. The engineer was taken aback by this because there were no animals allowed on the island. ""How the heck did you get here?"" he said to Nate. Nate foamed at the mouth a little. The dog appeared sickly. A contagious illness could do very bad things on an isolated ship. He knew he ought to shoot the dog before it was too late.

__But that was impossible. His son had taken such an instant liking to it. It already had a name. He couldn't remember ever seeing Timmy this happy. He could hardly remember ever seeing Timmy happy at all. A supply ship would be there in five days. They could take Nate back to land. He told Timmy he had five days with Nate before he had to go away. He also told Timmy that the dog must stay in the garage, and that Timmy was to wash his hands if he were to touch the beast.

__Nate's puzzling appearance lit up Timmy's well-trained imagination. He figured that the only way Nate could have come to this water-borne limbo was by flying through the air like Superman. Nate must have known that he needed a friend, and flew through the sky to lift his spirits. Nate coughed up foam. Timmy was very grateful. Nate the Wonder Dog. He was the smartest dog in the whole world. He could fly from place to place. His barks could tear through walls. He helped kids and stopped criminals. He was immune to both bullets and loneliness. Nate rolled over.

__Timmy relayed this fantasy to his father over and over again. It was killing his father inside. The dog appeared more and more sickly. He wouldn't kill it now. It was too late. Throughout his life, the engineer had always felt he was too late. One night, the engineer awoke to the sound of the garage door opening. He leaped out of bed. Timmy was in the garage. He said that he was going to go exploring with Nate. Nate couldn't fly in the confines of a garage, and he wanted to see it happen for real.

__But the moment he had a path, Nate bolted from the garage, running mad. He bolted at an ungodly speed toward the lever. The engineer knew what he had to do. He ran upstairs and grabbed the shotgun. Timmy followed. ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THAT'S MY FRIEND!"" he screamed.

__""He's going for the valve. He could sink the island."" The engineer set his sights on the dog, approaching the red switch with no sign of diverting or slowing down.

__""He's not gonna hit the lever.""

__""I have to be sure. I thought you said he was bulletproof.""

__""I DON'T KNOW!""

__He'd said the wrong thing. He'd have to live with that. At this moment there was one thing left to do. The dog was only about ten feet away now. The engineer took in a fluttery breath and squeezed the trigger. He whispered to himself,

""*Better Nate than lever.*""",Nate the Wonder Dog [Very Long],0

She looked up at me and told me that she was gathering the strength to pull herself over the railing to kill herself.  

She seemed nice, if distraught, and I noticed that she was kind of cute in a wallflower way.  I asked her why she wanted to commit suicide and she explained she was paralyzed at a young age, and had never had any interest from boys or men.  I tried to comfort and reassure her that the right guy would come along.  As we were talking, she asked if I would hold hands with her, as she had never done that with a guy.   I figured there's no harm in that, so I held her hand as we continued talking.  

Soon, she mentioned that she had never been kissed, and asked if I would kiss her.  Again I figured there would be no harm in it, so I gave her a tender but passionate kiss.  After the kiss, she told me that she really liked it and thanked me with a shy smile.  

We talked some more, and then we kissed a few more times.  After a few minutes of kissing, she mentioned that she had never been made love to, and that I seemed like a kind and caring person and she asked me if I would take her virginity and turn her from a girl to a woman.  I looked deeply into her eyes and gently lifted her out of her wheelchair as I kissed her passionately.  

I sat her on the pier railing, looked into her eyes again and pushed her off the pier while telling her ""There, now you're fucked.""",I stopped a young woman from committing suicide today,4

post,7lu63y,2qh72,jokes,false,1514104025,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7lu63y/merry_christmas_reddit/,self.jokes,,"Twas the night before Christmas, and God it was neat
The kids were in bed, and the wife was in heat.
The doors were all bolted, and the phone off the hook
It was time for some nooky, by hook or by crook.
Wife in her teddy, and I in the nude
Had just hit the bedroom and reached for the lube
When out on the lawn there arose such a cry,
That I lost my hard on and the wife, she went dry.
Up to the window I sprang like an elf,
Tore back the curtains while she played with herself.
The moon on the crest of the snowman we'd built,
Showed a broom up his ass, clean up to the hilt.
When what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a rusty old sleigh and eight mangy reindeer.
With a fat little driver, half out of his sled,
A sock in his ear, and a bra on his head.
Sure as I'm speaking, he was as high as a kite.
And he yelled to his team, but it didn't sound right.
Whoa Shithead, whoa Asshole, whoa Stupid, whoa jock,
Either slow down this rig or I'll cut off your cocks.
Look out for the lamp post, and don't hit the tree,
Quit shaking the sleigh, 'cause I gotta go pee.
They cleared the old lamp post, the tree got a rub,
Just as Santa leaned out and threw up on my shrub.
And then from the roof we heard such a clatter,
As each little reindeer now emptied his bladder.
I was donning my jacket to cover my ass,
When down the chimney Santa came with a crash.
His suit was all smelly with perfume galore,
He looked like a bum and he smelled like a whore.
""That was some brothel,"" he said with a smile,
""The reindeer are pooped, and I'll just stay here awhile.
He walked to the kitchen, himself poured a drink,
Then whipped out his dick and pissed in the sink.
I started to laugh, my wife smiled with glee,
The old boy was hung nearly down to his knee.
Back in the lounge, Santa reached in his sack,
But his toys were all gone, and some new things were
packed.
The first thing he found was a pair of false tits,
The next was a dildo with a penis that spits.
A box filled with condoms was Santa's next find,
And a six pair of knickers, the edible kind.
A bra without nipples, a penis extension,
And several other things that I shouldn't even mention.
A cock ring, a G-string, and all types of oil,
A dildo so long, it lay in a coil.
""This stuff ain't for kids, Mrs. Santa will moan,
So I'll leave 'em here, and then I'll be gone.""
He filled every stocking and then took his leave,
With one tiny butt plug tucked under his sleeve.
He sprang to his sleigh, but his feet were like lead,
Thus he fell on his ass and broke wind instead.
In time he was seated, took the reins of his hitch,
Saying, ""Take me home Rudolph, this night's been a bitch!""
The sleigh was near gone when we heard Santa shout,
""The best thing about sex is that it never wears out!""
So I'll wish a merry Christmas to one and to all",Merry Christmas reddit,0

All the creatures read poems while scrolling their mouse  
I scooted upstairs to lay down in my bed  
Waiting for my my wife to join me for head  
Then my eyes grew heavy so I tipped down my cap  
And said fuck it I’ll cum after a 5 minute nap

Then I heard an odd noise  
And awoke to a clatter  
When what did I smell but full release of my bladder  
Cum piss Cum Shit Cum Spit and Cum Shit  
All over my bed sheets   
Some barf and some shit  
A nose bleed some puss bursts I tried to clean it up quick  
When in through my doorway busted Saint Nick

He hooted and hollered then let out a cheer:  
You don’t fuck with Santa, treats are mine next year!

He says, ""Candy fish? Are they sweet?""

 I ask, ""Don't you think you're going a little overboard?""

He says, ""No. But you are!""

Right before I jump off, I ask him one last thing. 

I request, ""Before I jump, can I have one last mug of rootbeer?""

He says, ""I don't see why not""

So he gives me the mug of rootbeer and both the rootbeer and I jump. And I would have drowned had it not been for one thing...

“Bartender, get me something new and fresh from r/jokes.” He chirped

“Sorry mate, all we have are reposts from the last 8 years”

“How can this be!” The Redditor exclaimed “If I can’t get my fix from r/jokes, then what is the point of living!”

“Yeah, what IS the point of living” the bartender grumbled

The Redditor then sat there for what felt like hours, pondering the meaning of his pitiful existence. Over the later days, he began to become erratic, asking Scientists, Men of God and even random strangers what they thought the purpose of living is.

Unsatisfied with all his answers, he climbs to the side of a bridge in hopes of throwing himself off. His feet where on the edge and he was about to jump when and old man taps his side and says to him

“Do not jump. I know the answers you seek. Look to the stars and continue onwards”

The old man the shuffled off without another word.

With renewed hope swelling in his chest, he gathers all his life savings and builds a rocket ship. Tirelessly, he worked day and night for many, many years until it was finished.

Immediately he jumped in and launched off towards the stars, aimlessly wandering space for so long that the passage of time had slipped from his grasp, until he landed on another planet inhabited by alien creatures.

Clambering out of the ship, he desperately asked each alien who came across his path

“Do you know? Do you know the purpose of living?”

The alien creatures could not understand what he was saying, but understood that glint of questions in his eyes like so many others that have come past. They pointed him to a nearby comet that was orbiting the planet. He climbed back into the rocket and shot off to the comet.

Upon landing, he realises that the ball of ice is completely barren, so he then decides to dig. 

So he digs and he digs and he digs, but the Redditor was now an old man and those years of searching where finally taking his toll on him.

But as he gets to the center, he finds a piece of parchment with something written on it. The Redditor could feel that these were his last breaths but he was so close to the answer that plagued him his entire life.

The parchment simply read

“OP’s Mom”

The Redditor gave a faint chuckle

“The real joke is always in the comets”

Boris used to be a famous race horse. He'd won countless trophies, and was famous across the world.

Then, suddenly, at the peak of his career, Boris was involved in a horrible accident. Between races his private jet was hijacked and crashed, and only Boris survived. However, Boris was devastated. His friends, his family, and his colleagues had all been lost on one fell swoop.

""I'll never race again!"" he vowed.

So Boris quit his job, and found an old farmer who agreed to take him in. Old Farmer John was his name, and he loved Boris like a son.

However, the incident in Boris' past had led him to a life of recluse. He was fearful that everything would go wrong again, and so he spent every day in the barn.

And Old Farmer John took pity on Boris, and so he decided something.

Every week, Old Farmer John would go onto the town to sell his produce. And every week, he would set aside a small amount of money for Boris.

And every week, he would buy Boris a present, in the hope that one day, he'd be reminded of the wonderful life outside the barn, and he'd be happy again.

One thing he bought Boris was a CD player.

Another was a brand new computer..

But the best thing he ever gave to Boris was this:

Ten gallons of beer.

Let me explain.

On his many trips to town, Old Farmer John would pass a pub. It was called The Fine Race Horse, and among those who drank there, it was famed for having the best beer... In the world.

But it was only a small pub, and as such it wasn't visited by very many people, and it one day went out of business.

And when Old Farmer John heard this, he immediately got up and went into town, and spoke to the old owner. And John agreed to buy all his remaining beer.

And so, John came back from town one day, and gave Boris the beer. He'd never seen Boris so happy. It made his heart rejoice.

And for months, Boris would talk about this beer, and how it was the best gift he'd ever been given.

But one day, Old Farmer John came home with a brand new guitar. And Boris remembered the CD player he'd been given, and he remembered his favourite songs.

And Boris picked up the guitar, and he began to play a song.

And he was __good__.

And after hearing his song, John went over to Boris and said

""that was the best thing I've ever heard. You should go out into town and see the record company about starting a band!""

At first, Boris was hesitant. But eventually, he decided that Old Farmer John was right. He'd been his barn for so long. But now it was time for him to rise to fame again!

So he packed a few things, and grabbed his guitar and got on the next bus into town.

And on the way, he met a pig.

The pig's name was David, and David could play the drums.

And just like Boris, David the pig was on his way into town trying to make his name as a musician.

So Boris said

""hey, why don't we team up and make a band, after all, we're both animals with a talent. We could be the next big thing!""

And David agreed, and the two of them continued on into town.

At the next stop, a Hen got onto the bus. And her name was Sophie, and Sophie liked to sing.

She knew all the words to all the songs in the world.

And so, Boris the Horse and David the Pig went over to Sophie the Hen and said

""hey, why don't we team up and make a band, after all, we're all animals with a talent. We could be the next big thing!""

And Sophie agreed, and the three of them went to the record store, and started their band.

And they were an instant hit. They became a worldwide phenomenon almost overnight. They scored TV deals and sponsorships, and once again Boris had reached the life of fame.

They toured with all sorts of other famous bands, appearing alongside the likes of The Rolling Stones and Electric Light Orchestra.

And then, one day, they got the biggest deal of their lives.

They got invited to go on a world tour. They would play their music in every country on earth. By the time they were done, the whole world would know their name.

And so, of they went, from one country to the next, playing their music every step of the way.

They played in every city and in every town. And the Horse, the Hen and the Pig became a household name.

And when they got back home, they knew, they had reached the peak of their careers.

And they kept touring, playing in many countries across the globe.

But one day, everything changed.

One day, before they were set to fly out for their next performance, Boris received a phone call from the hospital in his home town.

And he found out that Old Farmer John had passed away.

So he decided to head back home so could Bury the man he treated like a father. So he said to Sophie and David

""you go on ahead, I'll be with you in a day or two.""

So the pig and the hen went of in their private jet, and Boris the Horse went home to Bury Old Farmer John.

But when he got home, he was in for a shock.

He received a call from his agent, and discovered that the private jet that David and Sophie were on had exploded in a freak accident, and there were no survivors.

And Boris was struck with grief.

For the second time in his life, he had lost everyone he loved.

And he became depressed, and stumbled into his old barn, and decided to take his own life.

But then he saw something that stopped him. 

Because in the old barn, was the huge tank that once contained the 10 gallons of beer.

And so, Boris decided that instead of suicide, he would have a few drinks, and would go on and turn his life around.

So Boris goes into town, and sees the pub, The Fine Race Horse, and underneath the sign on the door, he sees another sign, saying ""grand re-opening.""

And Boris knows that this is where he will have his beers, and forget all his sorrows, and turn his life around.

And so Boris the Horse enters the bar. And the bartender takes a look at him, and he asks

""why the long face?""",Boris the Horse. (X-Post /r/ShaggyDogStories),1

The man is amazed, and the employee says that's not even the best! He then holds the match under the parrots right foot and the bird starts singing Silent Night.

The man is stunned, and buys the bird right then and there.

On Christmas Day, his wife opens the parrot and asks him the same question: does he speak?

'No,' says the man, 'but watch this.' He lights a match and shows his wife chad's singing abilities.

His wife is stunned, and asks, 'well, what happens if you hold it under his middle?'

The flight attendant goes into the cockpit and tells the pilot and the co-pilot that there is a blonde bimbo sitting in first class, that belongs in economy, and won’t move back to her seat.

This horse had one passion, playing the guitar. The horse would play his guitar all the time and his favorite artist to listen to was Jimi Hendrix. This horse LOVED Jimi and knew every single one of his songs by heart. One day he said to himself ""I want to start a Jimi Hendrix cover band and people all around the globe will get to see how awesome Jimi's music really was!"" 

So, he went around the barn and looked for animals that could play bass and drums and be on vocals. Boy was he in luck because the first animal to respond to his request was another Hendrix fan. This fan was a cow and knew how to play bass very well. The horse and the cow got along great and the cow already knew some of Hendrix's songs by heart too! So, now the horse and the cow had to look for someone who would be willing to play drums and sing. They came across a lamb who could really wail on the drums; and sure enough, the lamb was in and wanted to be a part of this Jimi Hendrix cover band. Now, said the horse, we just need someone who could really belch and just be an amazing singer for our cover band to be complete. That's when the lamb said there was a chicken in one of the coupes on the far side of the farm who was very good at singing. The band raced over there and this chicken was indeed a very good singer. 

But there was one problem: the chicken did not like Jimi Hendrix so much that he wanted to be a part of a tribute band for him. The horse, of course, was upset and said, ""If you really don't like Jimi that much, then you can just go back into your coupe and never see the real world"". The chicken glared into the horses' eyes and thought about the future and how if he does stay in the coupe he wouldn't be able to see what anything outside the farm was like. Then the chicken made up his mind and said, ""I will join your Jimi Hendrix cover band, and if this band takes off and goes outside of the farm, I will have had my dream come true of being a free chicken"". 

A few weeks later after practicing in the barn, the band had gained so much recognition throughout the farm that even animals next door would try to sneak their way onto the land just to listen to the Jimi Hendrix cover band. This went on for sometime and eventually the band grew and began playing gigs and pubs in the city and small house parties; it was crazy. About 3 months later, the band was beginning to become very popular throughout their city and their county and then their state and then the entire midwest and even the whole country! The Jimi Hendrix cover band was so good that they were touring from Portland to Santa Cruz to Orlando to Des Moines. The cow, horse, lamb, and chicken were getting recognized throughout the nation and even the globe! Hitting top 20's on iTunes and breaking record sales, this tribute band was the best tribute band to ever be! 

But not much later when the band was taking a short break from touring, the horse decided to stay in the suite up in NYC while the rest of the gang (cow, lamb, and chicken) went to Vienna, Austria for a week. All of a sudden, the horse received a call...and it was from...DAVID LETTERMAN, the best lat-night talk-show host to have ever lived! David said to the horse, ""Hey, I know this is last minute, but can your band play for me in the studio tomorrow night? I know you guys are very good and I was just wondering if that would work out for you...I'll pay ya'll a bunch too"".

The horse was ecstatic; this was the REAL David Letterman and he just asked if the cover band could play for him tomorrow night! The horse said that he was the only one in NYC at that time but would call back if the rest of the gang would be down for leaving Austria for NYC that night. So, David said, ""That's cool, just lemme know and I'll talk to ya soon hopefully"". So, the horse immediately called the rest of the band and said, ""Hey guys guess what?"" ""What"" ""David Letterman freaking called me and asked if we could play for him tomorrow night! YOU IN!?"" ""Wow, the REAL David Letterman!?"" ""Yeah man"" ""SICK!!! we'll be at the suite soon!""

Once the band heard this news they immediately packed their bags and boarded their private jet. Meanwhile, the horse called David and said they would be able to play tomorrow to which David replied, ""Excellent"". But then something crazy happened as the plane was crossing the pacific; the right engine blew out and the plane started a downward spiral...

NOOOOO, shouted the crew as the plane smashed into the rough sea. Dead. All of them. The cow, chicken, lamb, and pilot. Dead.

Word spread quickly and was reported on every mainstream media: Famous Tribute Band No Longer Able to Jam, read one article minutes after the tragedy. The entire globe felt a heavy loss that hour; but it was worse for the horse, he felt so much distraught building up inside along with the sorrow of losing not just his band, but his best friends. David called and gave his condolences but that didn't change how the horse felt. He lost everything. 

Months later after the horrific event, while the world went on about its business, the horse still had anguish, grief, and heartache.He slowly spiraled into a depression and began contemplating his own existence. He tried taking anti-depressants but those did nothing to help. He was now turning towards drugs and would shoot up when given the opportunity. He even started to drink and hit bars on a regular basis just to try and wash away the pain that reminisced in his heart. And one day he walks into a bar and the bartender says, ""Why the long face?""

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, and even fix his car.


As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.


Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth; tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task.


After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self-deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""


The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went, that he needed keys to the doors of emerald, pearl and diamond, each. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" 


The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...... Of course, I can't tell you what it is, because you're not a monk.",A man is traveling down the road,0

Upon making several false alarm trips to the bathroom, he decided the latest episode was another and stayed put. He suddenly filled his bed with diarrhea and was embarrassed beyond his ability to remain rational.

In a complete loss of composure he jumped out of bed, gathered up the bed sheets, and threw them out the hospital window.

A drunk was walking by the hospital when the sheets landed on him. He started yelling, cursing, and swinging his arms violently trying to get the unknown things off, and ended up with the soiled sheets in a tangled pile at his feet.

As the drunk stood there, unsteady on his feet, staring down at the sheets, a hospital security guard, (barely containing his laughter), and who had watched the whole incident, walked up and asked, ""What the heck is going on here?""

The drunk, still staring down replied: ""I think I just beat the shit out of a ghost.""

The police get called in to break up the fight. The following week, all members of both families appear in court. The fight continues in the courtroom until the judge finally brings calm with the use of his gavel, shouting ""Silence in Court."" The courtroom goes silent and DANNY (the best man) stands up and says, ""Your honor, I was the best man at the wedding and I think I should explain what happened."" 

The judge agrees and asks Danny to take the stand. Danny begins his explanation by telling the court that it is traditional in an Austrailian wedding that the best man gets the first dance with the bride. The judge says ""OK."" 

""Well"", said Danny, ""After I had finished the first dance, the music kept going, so I continued dancing to the second song, and after that the music kept going and I was dancing to the third song.

Thanks, your neighbors""

Now, Ronald had really enjoyed last year's party, so he was delighted to be the host for this year.

After a grand day of eating, drinking, and merrymaking, All of Ronald's neighbors left - without helping clean up.

""That's fine, its just one party, and I've done the same other years"" said Ron.

Fast forward the next year, Ron was looking forward to this year's harvest, and the celebration that would follow.

After attending this year's anonymous vote, he gets another letter in the mail.

""Dear Mr. Kse, After the amazing time everyone had last year, the vote was decided again for you to be the host! We look forward to seeing you again, and thank you.""

Ron sighs, but thinks ""Yeah, last year's party was pretty great. I guess the cleanup wasn't too bad. No worries.""

Again, he gathered with his neighbors, and they feasted and drank themselves silly... but there were twice as many people this year. Friends, family, friends of family were all invited...

The cleanup was far worse this year. ""But,"" Ron thought, ""there's no way I'll get it three years in a row.""

Next year, Ron's sister was visiting, and went with him to check the mail. She handed him a very lavish envelope, garnished with golden filigree and laden with caligraphy.

She exclaimed ""Wow! This is beautiful! It must be something very wonderful and important!""

As fate would have it, his office transferred him to another country for work a few weeks before his wife’s due date, and he had to join immediately.

Before going, he asked his father-in-law to send a telegram confirming the birth of his child. Having already gotten 3 sons, the man was hoping for a daughter this time. But in order to avoid giving a party to his office colleagues, he asks his father-in-law to write ""The Clock Has Arrived"", and he will understand that the daughter is born.

The D-day arrived. His wife delivered a handsome little baby boy. Now the Sindhi's father-in-law didn't know what to do. If he writes “The Clock Has Arrived”, the son-in-law will think he has a daughter. If he writes “The Clock Has Not Arrived”, the son-in-law will get worried that something serious has happened. Being a very intelligent person, he finds a solution, and sends the telegram.

The son-in-law received the telegram, opened it eagerly &amp; read ""The Cock Has Arrived”.","A man’a wife was expecting, and the baby was due any day...",0
