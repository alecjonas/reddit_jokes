She’s really worried because she’s never had a boyfriend before, and has no idea what it’s gong to be like. Dave assures her his family will love her, and that she’ll be fine.

The girl is still incredibly nervous, but they eventually arrive at the Noe family house. It is a grand estate, and a bit of an imposing one, but the girl buries her fears, puts on a brave face, and takes Dave’s hand. Dave reaches for the door knocker and knocks three times. The door opens, and the couple are greeted by Dave’s mom, Kaitlyn.

“Hello Dave!” Says Kaitlyn, warm and friendly. “Oh, and you must be Sabrina! It’s wonderful to finally meet you, Dave has told me so much about you! I must introduce you to everybody!” Sabrina, while still nervous, feels more comfortable around Kaitlyn, and lets her shuttle her around.

Kaitlyn introduces Sabrina to all manners of people, working their way to Dave’s young-ish cousins Ann and Mark, who have just had a child. However, when Ann shows her the child, Sabrina is taken aback. The baby looks exactly like Dave. It’s a frightening sight, but Sabrina reassures herself, thinking that they are related after all, so it’s not too weird.

After a few more people, Kaitlyn introduces Sabrina to Dave’s other married cousins, Darlene and Andy, and Isabelle and Roger. They also have recently had babies, and as Sabrina looks at them, she begins to have a full on panic attack. They both look exactly like Dave. She begins to start freaking out, and Kaitlyn asks “what is wrong?”. “These babies...” Sabrina says, barely able to get out the words, “these babies all look like Dave! It’s crazy!”.

“Um... excuse me, Godfather, I coulda sworn you just told me to—“

The Godfather holds up his hand, silencing him.

“Jimmy, it’s for the family.”

Jimmy snaps to attention. 

“Got it, Godfather. For the family.”

Whereupon he goes back to the bathroom. A few minutes later, he comes out, throws up his arms in a Victory salute and cries, “Mission accomplished.” Then he goes back over to The Godfather.

“So, Godfather, is there anything else I can do for you?”

The Godfather says, “You’re a good boy, Jimmy. I like your style.” Then he says, “Do it again.”

“WHAAA—!” Jimmy starts to protest. But The Godfather cuts him short with, “Jimmy, it’s for the family.”

Jimmy says, albeit dubiously, “Ok, Godfather. Whatever you say.”

This time he’s gone for a bit longer. When he comes out, he’s nowhere near as enthusiastic. Still, he goes back to The Godfather and reluctantly asks, “Is there...um... you got anything else, Godfather?”

The old man just stares at him, a slight smile at the corners of his mouth. Slowly, Jimmy gets the message. 

“Oh nooo...”

The Godfather holds up one finger. “One more time, Jimmy.”

This time, he’s in the John a lot longer. When he comes out, a layer of sweat coats his pasty skin. His eyes have a glassy look. He says to The Godfather in desperation, “Godfather, this thing you have asked of me: I’ve given it my all. I swear to you, Godfather, I have given everything I’ve got. There is nothing left to give.”

“Take it easy, Jimmy. You done good. I got something else I want you to do.”

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of keys and hands them to Jimmy.

“Here’s the keys to my car. I want you to drive out to the airport and pick up my daughter.”",The Godfather’s relaxing at his social club...,1110

Early one morning, I received a call from the doctors office to tell me that I had been rescheduled for that morning at 9:30 am. I had only just packed everyone off to work and school, and it was already around 8:45am.

The trip to his office took about 35 minutes, so I didn’t have any time to spare. As most women do, I like to take a little extra effort over hygiene when making such visits, but this time I wasnt going to be able to make the full effort.

So, I rushed upstairs, threw off my pajamas, wet the washcloth that was sitting next to the sink, and gave myself a quick wash in that area to make sure I was at least presentable. I threw the washcloth in the clothes basket, donned some clothes, hopped in the car and raced to my appointment.

I was in the waiting room for only a few minutes when I was called in. Knowing the procedure, as Im sure you do, I hopped up on the table, looked over at the other side of the room and pretended that I was in Paris or some other place a million miles away.

I was a little surprised when the doctor said, My, we have made an extra effort this morning, havent we? I didnt respond.

After the appointment, I heaved a sigh of relief and went home. The rest of the day was normal… Some shopping, cleaning, and cooking. After school when my 6 year old daughter was playing, she called out from the bathroom, Mommy, wheres my washcloth?

I told her to get another one from the cupboard.

She replied, No, I need the one that was here by the sink, it had all my glitter and sparkles saved inside it.

Never going back to that doctor again…Never.

He decided he would set up a Christmas light display like he'd heard about others doing. It took him some time to gather all the lights necessary, but eventually through the sweat of his farmhands and an absurd number of extension cords, he was finished. When sunset came, the first car to come down that road got an amazing sight.

The entire fence was covered in lights! Fence post after fence post, crossbeam after crossbeam, the most dazzling, amazing collection of lights they'd ever seen! The driver immediately called his friends and family and told them to get out to the old country road and within hours, the traffic was backed up for a mile.

At the end of the display, he had a couple of farmhands waiting with donation buckets and sure enough, he raked in several hundred dollars that night. This went on for weeks only getting more and more popular and even despite the high electricity bill, he turned quite a profit on the display.

And so it went for the next few years. His light displays got more and more elaborate. They synced to music. They twinkled in time to the passing cars. There were LEDs and lasers, inflatable reindeer and glowing manger scenes, and everything in between. He started to notice, however, that the number of cars began to dwindle each night.

Whereas folks used to come from counties around to see the fence, the numbers grew smaller and smaller each night. At the end of the season, he'd seen maybe a tenth of the cars.

The months passed and November crept up again. The farmer headed down to the feed and hardware shop to gather a few necessary supplies for the display and couldn't help but overhear a couple of the customers talking.

""Yeah, it just ain't what it used to be. I mean, don't get me wrong, it were pretty and all when he got it started, but something 'bout it nowadays just ain't fresh.""

""I know. I wish he'd do something different. Something original. Everybody's got them Christmas lights now.""

This incensed the farmer. He spent hundreds of hours every season making something amazing for the world to see and they were treating it like so much manure from his barn. He would show them.

He raced back to his farm and he ripped out every single light from post after post. He tore out the inflatable Santa and knocked down the wise men. And when he was done, he meticulously strung the exact same red and green lights on every square foot of that fence. ""I'll show them. They think they can take me foregranted, we'll see how they like this boring mess.""

The first night of the display, the visitors (small in number as they may have been), were astonished. Their phones lit up with dials to their friends and neighbors. Soon enough, the line of cars stretched back miles and miles, longer than it ever had in the heyday of the display.

The farmer shook his head while his farmhands stood agape at the traffic. ""I don't believe it! How could this be so popular?"" the lead farmhand asked the farmer.

""It's simple. Everybody says they want to see something original but what really gets them going is the same old post over and over again.""",A farmer got an idea for how to make money off his farm in the off-season.,1957

The man gratefully accepted the offer and followed the monk to the room. He quickly changed out of his wet clothes and lay in bed, only to notice a muffled but jubilant hum somewhere nearby. 

Curious, he got up and followed the sound down a narrow hallway, until he came to a great door, light streaming out from under it.

He made to grab to handle when the monk came running and frantically batted his hand away. 

&amp;#x200B;

""*Don't* go in there! That is exclusively for monks and you are not one of us! Do you perhaps wish to be?""   


The man declined, thinking of his wife and children back home. Becoming a monk just for that would be idiotic.

The next day, the storm had settled and the man could return home. 

About a year later, the man was hiking, as he often did, and was caught in a storm of similar power as the one a year before. Already knowing where he would go for the night, he headed up to the monastery.

&amp;#x200B;

""Of course, you may stay here for the night."" the monk said.

&amp;#x200B;

In the same room, the man lay under the covers, trying to fall asleep when a familiar humming drifted to him. He'd forgotten about that door since last time, and couldn't quite believe, that they were there again. He couldn't think of anything, that could make a person as happy as those behind that door seemed to be. 

Sneaking quietly through the dark hallway, he made it to the door and reached out to open it, just as he had last year. As if he had been waiting, a monk sprang from the darkness and seized the man's wrist.

&amp;#x200B;

""No entry! Become a monk, and you may enter."" The monk's gaze was hard and unwavering.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite a small spark of desire in his stomach, the man refused, going back to bed.

For the duration of the following year, the man thought every single day about that door and what heavenly pleasures it might contain. He looked at his wife and children and actually found himself unsure of which he wanted more - to be with his family, or discover what was behind that door.

Predictably, a year and some months after his last visit, he was caught in a storm once more and sought shelter in the monastery. 

As soon as he was left on his own in the guest room, he went to the mysterious door. 

&amp;#x200B;

""You can only enter if you become a monk!"" a monk said, as he appeared, almost out of nowhere, when the man tried to enter. 

&amp;#x200B;

The man swallowed nervously. He hadn't realized until now, but he had been prepared to abandon his family since he went on the hike. It was now or never. 

&amp;#x200B;

""I'll do it. I'll become a monk!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Excellent! Follow me inside please."" said the monk, opening the mysterious door and closing it behind the man after he had gone inside.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, you're probably wondering what was in there, but you aren't a monk, so I can't tell you.

The Englishman accepting his impending death said “I want to die by suffocation, but please make it quick.” So the serial killer picked up a pillow, smothered the face of the Englishman and suffocated him. He then turned to the Scottish man.

The Scottish man said “I want to die by drowning in scotch whisky.” So the serial killer filled up a bucket with whisky and held the Scottish man’s head in the bucket until he had drowned. He then turned to the Irish man.

The Irishman thought for a moment and said “I want to die by being injected with the HIV virus.” So the serial killer locked the Irishman in the room and went to find his final murder weapon. He later returned with a dirty syringe and injected it into the Irish man’s arm. The serial killer said “you may go free. The death that awaits you will be a slow and painful one.”

post,a49va5,2qh72,jokes,false,1544266860,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/a49va5/my_uncle_steve/,self.jokes,,"I have an Uncle named Steve. He was really down on his luck cause he was fired from his job. Worst thing was that it wasn't even his fault. Anyway, He had a hard time finding another job because he isn't the nicest looking guy. He's got a really high forehead, like airplane runway big. He's also got a really pointy head. You could put him in an areodynamics tank and he'd be more streamlined then a racecar. So a few months had gone by and his luck was so bad that he had run out of money as he didn't have a job yet. A few weeks later and he was living on the streets. He was so poor that he could barely afford food. 

One day, he met up with one of his long time friends from highschool who he hadn't seen in a long time. They chatted for about an hour and Uncle Steve was telling him about whats happened. How he got fired from his job, lost all his money and ended up living on the streets. His friend was appauled at this and offered Steve a deal. He said ""Steve... I'm gonna give you $20, but you have to promise me something."" Steve asked, ""Well, what is it?"" He said ""Well, if I give you this $20, you have to promise me that you will change your life with it."" So Uncle Steve agreed and said his farewells.

He left and he was thinking, ""Well, what should I get with this?"" And he thought he could get some new clothes as his were a bit torn up and the only things that wern't torn up were his speedos. While he was on his way to the store, he passed an advertisement on a bus stop about a cruise ticket for only $20! ""He thought, that's not right. He went to the local internet cafe and looked it up. ""Wow, it's actually true!"" thought Steve.

He browsed the site some more and looked at all the restraunts he could go to and all the activites he could do. And then he saw it, at the bottom of the page. ""THIS CRUISE CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE!"" He bought the ticket then and there. 

Anyway, the day had come for him to board the cruise, he had everything he owned in a backpack, including the speedos and he was ready with the ticket. He got in lineand was waiting to board when one of the guards pulled him out of the line. He asked ""Where did you get this ticket?"" Steve said ""I bought it with my last $20!"" And so the guard looked him up and down and he said ""Alright but before I let you board, there are a few rules I should say that go with this ticket. Number 1, you aren't allowed out during the day."" 

Uncle Steve thought this was crazy, but he agreed. ""All the restraunts and activities will still be open but you can only come out during the night. Number 2, the reason this ticket is so cheap is because you won't be sleeping near the others."" ""Well, where will I be staying?"" asked Steve. ""You'll be on the lowest deck."" Steve said ""Well, that's not too bad."" 

The guard replied ""No I'm talking the lowest of the the ship, not even we go down there."" So the guard led Uncle Steve onto the boat to an elevator. He told Steve ""Now when you go down, you are gonna press the lowest floor for the elevator, then once that's done, you are gonna turn right and go down the hallway until you reach a set of stairs. Once you reach those stairs, go all the way to the bottom and turn left into another hallway. Once you reach the end, your room will be on the right.""

So Steve followed the directions and he was going down the elevator, and he was still going down, and still going down, and still going down. When finally, he reached the bottom! He looked out of the elevator, and he saw this long dark hallway. He could hear a faint crunching noise coming from down the hall. Reluctantly, he followed the wall and walked down the hall. The sound was getting louder the further he got until he got to the stairs and he realised the sound was coming from down the stairs.

Uncle Steve was a bit nervous, he didn't know what was down there! He thought, ""Well, I came on this cruise to change my life, I may aswell keep going."" So he went down the stairs, and walked down the hallway, the sound was getting louder and louder! He couldn't hear himself think! He kept going though, not knowing what the sound was, and when he got to his room.

He could hear the sound on the other side. ""I don't wanna sleep in there! I'll get mauled by a vicious beast or something!"" thought Steve. But curiousity overtook him as he had to know what was on the other side of this door. He said, ""Screw it!"" and counted to 3. 1... 2... 3! And on 3, he opened the door. And there it was, making all that noise! The engine of the boat! He was sleeping down with the engine! Steve walked in the room and plopped his bag down and walked over to the bed. There were some earmuffs sitting on the bed. ""Well at least I can sleep in peace.""

Anyway, night time came and Steve was ready to go back up for dinner. He went up and he couldn't believe it! Everything was still open! And no-one else was around! Steve went to everything, from the water slide at the pool to the restraunts and ordered everything he could get (which was everything on the menu). Right now, things were looking up for Uncle Steve. He had everything he ever wanted for only $20.

But after a week, Steve realised he was lonely. No-one was around when he went up and he wasn't allowed out during the day. So a week later when he couldn't handle the isolation any longer. He decided he'd break the rules and go up during the day. So he decided he'd go to the pool again so he put his speedos on and made his way up. He went to the pool and as he was about to get in, he saw the captain stitting on one of the chairs at the pool side.

""What if I get caught?"" thought Steve. ""He hasn't seen me before? Maybe he won't notice."" So he acted as naturally as he could and went over to the diving board. He thought he'd have some fun so he did a front flip. Landed in the pool perfectly, not even a splash, not even a ripple.  He swam to the edge of the pool and was got out to go again when the Captain stopped him.

He asked, ""Hey, sir. What's your name?"" Nervously, Uncle Steve replied ""Uhhh, umm. My name is, uhh, Steve."" The captain said ""Well Steve, that was the best god damn front flip I'd ever seen. Do you see everyone looking at you in amazement?"" He looked around and he'd attracted a small crowd. ""If you don't mind Steve, can you do it again?"" Steve agreed but a bit nervous to not get caught. He went to the diving board and decided he may aswell put on a show.

So he did a perfect back flip with a 360 twist. Landed in the water, not a splash, not even a ripple. He swam to the surface and could see a bigger crowd they were all cheering for him. One called out ""What natural talent! Amazing!"" He got out of the pool and the captain said ""I've seen enough!"" He thought he was caught. ""Steve, I am going to build you your own diving board. And I want you to do your best dive off it when it's done."" Steve was glad he didn't get caught so he agreed to to the show. 

A bit nervous about getting so close to getting caught. He stayed in his room for a week, only ever going up for food. 2 weeks went by and he'd still heard no word of this diving board. One day, when he was down in his cabin, he heard a knock at his door. It was the captain! ""Hey Steve, I've been looking for you! The diving board is finished! After your show we'll get you in a luxury cabin and you can come out when ever you'd like!"" Steve followed the captain all the way up to the pool.

He'd never seen the diving board so it came to a shock to him when he saw it and couldn't see the top. The captain was a bit chuft with the build and said ""Steve, tgis beauty is all ready for your perfect dive. Steve was really nervous, it was really high up, like he thought he might touch the sun at the top. But he is a man of his word and he agreed to put on a show, so he started climbing.

After all those time of going up and down the stairs and hallways, he was strong enough to keep climbing. He look down and the boat was so small it seemed like and ant was bigger than it. He still hadn't reached the top though so he kept climbing. And climbing. And climbing. He was starting to get tired when he finally reached the top. He looked down, Steve couldn't even see the cruise anymore.

He was scared but he made a promise. So he got ready and said ""heres to changing my life."" and jumped. He did 20 front flips perfectly, looked down, still couldn't see the ship so he thought he'd do some more flips, so he did like 30 backflips with twist. Looked down and he could finally see the ship. So he got ready and aimed for the pool. It was coming up so fast now that he hit the water with so much speed, he went straight under. And guess what.... Not a splash, not even a ripple.

He was still going fast though, and here is why Uncle Steve is thankful for his pointy head. He went straight through the bottom of the pool. He was still going to fast so he kept going through floor after floor. Still going so fast, he went straight through the bottom of the ship. He finally slowed down enough that he swm to the surface and he was at the side of the ship.

He had a slight ringing in his ear but could here someone calling his name. ""STEVE!!! STEVE!!! WHERE ARE YOU!?!"" He called out ""I'm over here!"" He looked up to see the captain. ""Steve, are you ok? Do you need any help?"" Steve said, looking at himself ""I all good captain, I've been through many a hardships in my life.""",My Uncle Steve.,13

Ecstatic, Dan drove to the town and arrived at the theater. Bob was there when he got there, just as his agent had told him.

""Hey, Dan, nice to meet you,"" Bob said. ""Your role is very simple,"" he told Dan, ""when I give you the signal, you go out on stage and say 'Hark! Is that a cannon I hear?'"" Excited, Dan then goes off to practice his line.

As he's practicing, Dan realizes that he knows nothing about what the play is about or how he is supposed to deliver his line, so he decides to practice it in many different ways so that he can be flexible when the night of the premier came.

First, he thought *maybe it should be a bold proclamation.* So that's how he said it **""Hark! Is that a cannon I hear?""**

Then, he thought *maybe it's a proper British man saying it.* So he said it with a British accent.

And so he continued to practice his line in various different voices and styles. For hours on end, he practiced until he thought he was fully prepared.

Soon, the night of the performance came. He stood patiently back stage and waited for his cue. When the time finally came, he walked out on stage. He prepared to deliver his line, and suddenly from behind him he heard a deafening BOOM and screamed ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!?""

""We have fallen in love, but our parents do not approve of our marriage. Whatever shall we do?""

""To be young and in love is a beautiful thing, but there is no need to be hasty and alienate your families. Postpone your engagement and spend some more time together with each of your families. Eventually they will warm up to your betrothal.""

""Thank you. We have nothing to offer you, but when the time comes to sire, we will name our first born son after you.""

Next, a young man comes to see him.

""I am new to this country having immigrated from Russia with nothing but my knowledge of cured meats.""

""The path to success is not easy, but it is rewarding. Start your own cured meats business. Explore and forge new paths by tracking your marketing efforts. Repeat the ones with a higher rate of success and refine them. Scale your production to meet demand, not the other way around.""

""Yes, thank you. I hadn't thought of it like that. Please accept these sausages for your wise words.""

A woman is next in line.

""My career has stalled. I no longer enjoy my work, but I can't find a new job.""

The wise man starts going on a tirade about fixing the economy and job market by voting Republican.

""Not to interrupt sir, but what is that you are chewing on?""

post,a442n1,2qh72,jokes,false,1544216610,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/a442n1/ernie_the_hamster/,self.jokes,," I had to take my son's hamster to the vet. Here's what happened:  


Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there was something wrong with one of the two hamsters he holds prisoner in his room. ""He's just lying there looking sick,"" he told me, ""I'm serious,  


Dad. Can you help?""  


I put my best hamster-healer look on my face and followed him into his bedroom. One of the little rodents was indeed lying on his back, looking stressed. I immediately knew what to do. (Call my wife.)  


""Honey,"" I called, ""come look at the hamster!"" ""Oh, my gosh,"" my wife diagnosed after a minute. ""She's having babies."" ""What?"" My son demanded. ""But their names are Bert and Ernie, Mom!"" I was equally outraged. ""Hey, how can that be?! I thought we said we didn't want them to reproduce!"" I accused my wife. ""Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?!"" She inquired. (I actually think she had the gall to say this sarcastically.)  


""No, but you were supposed to get two boys!"" I reminded her (in my most loving, calm, sweet voice, while gritting my teeth together). ""Yeah, Bert and Ernie!"" My son agreed. ""Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, ya know,"" she informed me. (Again with the sarcasm, ya think?) By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on.  


I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it. ""Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience,"" I announced. ""We're about to witness the miracle of birth."" ""OH, Gross!"" They shrieked.  


""Well, isn't THAT just great! What are we going to do with a litter of tiny little hamster babies?"" My wife wanted to know. (I really do think she was being snotty here, too. Don't you?) We peered at the patient.  


After much struggling, what looked like a tiny foot would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. ""We don't appear to be making much progress,"" I noted. ""It's breech,"" my wife whispered, horrified.  


""Do something, Dad!"" My son urged.  


""Okay, okay."" Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next appeared, giving it a gingerly tug. It disappeared. I tried several more times with the same results.  


""Should I call 911?"" My eldest daughter wanted to know,"" Maybe they could talk us through the trauma."" (You see a pattern here with the females in my house?)  


""Let's get Ernie to the vet,"" I said grimly.  


We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in his lap.""Breathe, Ernie, breathe,"" he urged. ""I don't think hamsters do Lamaze,"" his mother noted to him. (Women can be so cruel to their own young. I mean what she does to ME is one thing, but this boy is of her womb.)  


The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the little animal through a magnifying glass. ""What do you think, Doc, a c-section?"" I suggested scientifically. My son appeared impressed by my observation.  


""Oh, very interesting,"" he murmured. ""Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I speak to you privately for a moment?"" I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside. ""Is Ernie going to be okay?"" My wife asked. ""Oh, perfectly,"" the vet assured us. ""This hamster is not in labor. In fact, that isn't EVER going to happen .. Ernie is a boy."" ""What!?""   


""You see, Ernie is a young male AND occasionally, as they come into maturity, like most male species, they um .... er ... masturbate, just the way he did, lying on his back."" He blushed, glancing at my wife. ""Well, you know what I'm saying, Mr. Cameron."" We were silent, absorbing this.  


So Ernie's just ... just ... excited?""! My wife offered. ""Exactly,"" the vet replied, relieved that we understood. More silence. Then my vicious, cruel wife started to giggle. And laugh. And then even laugh loudly! What's so funny?"" I demanded, knowing, but not believing that the woman I married would commit the upcoming affront to my flawless manliness.  


Tears were now running down her face. ""It's just ... that ... I'm picturing you pulling on its ... its ... teeny little ..."" she gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more. ""That's enough,"" I warned.  


We thanked the Veterinarian and hurriedly bundled the hamsters and our son back into the car. He was glad everything was going to be okay.  


""I know Ernie's really thankful for what you've done, Dad,"" he told me.  


""Oh, you have NO idea,"" my wife agreed, once again collapsing into laughter.  


Enough said.

when the horse fell into a bog and began to sink. Scared   
for his life, the horse whinnied for the chicken to go   
get the farmer for help!   


Off the chicken ran, back to the farm. Arriving at the   
farm, he searched and searched for the farmer, but to no   
avail, for he had gone to town with the only tractor.   
Running around, the chicken spied the farmer's new Z-3   
series BMW. Finding the keys inside, the chicken sped   
off with a length of rope, hoping he still had time to   
save his friend's life.   


Back at the bog, the horse was surprised, but happy, to   
see the chicken arrive in the shiny BMW, and he managed   
to get a hold of the loop of rope the chicken tossed to   
him. After tying the other end to the rear bumper of the   
farmer's car, the chicken then drove slowly forward and,   
with the aid of the powerful car, rescued the horse!   


Happy and proud, the chicken drove the BMW back to the   
farmhouse, and the farmer was none the wiser when he   
returned. The friendship between the two animals was   
cemented: best buddies, best pals.   


A few weeks later, the chicken fell into a mud pit, and   
soon, he too, began to sink and cried out to the horse to   
save his life! The horse thought a moment, walked over,   
and straddled the large puddle.   


Looking underneath, he told the chicken to grab his ""thing""   
and he would then lift him out of the pit. The chicken got   
a good grip, and the horse pulled him up and out, saving his   
life.   


The moral of the story?   


When you're hung like a horse, you don't need a BMW to   
pick up chicks. ",On the farm lived a chicken and a horse,15

The Japanese says, ""It is only through my undying devotion to the Emperor that I will be able to withstand their torture.""

The Italian says, ""I'm fucked.""

""Even my perfect genes could not protect me from their methods. I have failed my country,""

Next, the Japanese is up to be interrogated. 3 days pass and he returns to the cell. His eyes are both black, fingers broken, and body bruised and bloodied. 

""I have dishonored myself and my Emperor. When they release me, I must commit honorable seppuku.""

Lastly, the Italian is up, and he leaves already begging for his life. A whole week passes before he returns. Beaten nearly to death, he is carried in by 2 soldiers. One of the soldiers jeers, ""I can't believe you guys broke instead of this dago.""

The other 2 are shocked. Amazed that this Italian could take their punishments and not break. They ask him how he did it.

""I wanted to give in immediately, but I couldn't speak.""

Here’s what you do,” said the Doctor, “stand about 40 feet away from her, and in a normal conversational speaking tone see if she hears you. If not, go to 30 feet, then 20 feet, and s o on until you get a response.”

That evening, the wife is in the kitchen cooking dinner, and he was in the den. He says to himself, “I’m about 40 feet away, let’s see what happens.” Then in a normal tone he asks, ‘Honey, what’s for dinner?” No response.

So the husband moves to closer to the kitchen, about 30 feet from his wife and repeats, “Honey, what’s for dinner?” Still no response.

Next he moves into the dining room where he is about 20 feet from his wife and asks, Honey, what’s for dinner?”

Again he gets no response so, He walks up to the kitchen door, about 10 feet away. “Honey, what’s for dinner?” Again there is no response.

So he walks right up behind her. “Honey, what’s for dinner?”

""Dear, Dad.

It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you.

I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy.

She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, Dad.

She's pregnant.

Stacy said that we will be very happy.

She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter.

We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.

We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better.

She sure deserves it!

Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself.

Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

Love, your son, Joshua.

P.S. Dad, none of the above is true.

I'm over at Jason's house.

I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table.

Call when it is safe for me to come home!""","I was passing by my son's bedroom and was astonished to see the bed was nicely made and everything was picked up.

This practice continues week after week until one evening when the bartender, curious about the man’s weekly ritual, says, “Sir, you’re one of my regulars here. If you’d like, I can serve you your pints one at a time, so that each one will be fresh. Whenever you finish one, I’ll have the next on hand for you.”

“You don’t understand,” says the man. “I’ve got 2 brothers: one in New York and one in Sidney. We made a pact a few weeks ago that we would each go into our local pub at the same every Friday and order 3 pints—one for ourselves, and one for each brother. That way, even though we’re oceans apart, it’s like we’re drinking together again. “

The bartender is moved by this sentiment and agrees to continue serving the pints according to the man’s wishes. That is, until one Friday, when the man walks in and only orders 2 pints. Assuming the worst, the bartender says to his patron, “I’m terribly sorry about your brother. Tell me, which one passed away?”

With a confused expression on his face, the man replies “Me brothers are fine. I just quit drinking!”","A Dublin man enters his local pub on a Friday night, takes a seat at the bar, and orders 3 pints of Guinness",62

Out of nowhere. Someone takes notice, and after a long and complicated series of accusations and charges the man winds up going to court. He shows up with his defense attorney.

The judge asks him bluntly “Sir, how did you come into possession of this money?”
The man responds “I am the world’s greatest gambler, and I can prove it.”
“Is that so?” The judge asks incredulously
“Here, I’ll show you... I bet you $1000 that I can bite my own eye.”
“Okay, go for it.”
The man removes his glass eye and bites it. The judge is dejected, as he just lost $1000. Still, he’s not sold. 
“That’s a good trick, but I’m not sure that makes you the world’s greatest gambler.”
“Alright... Double or nothing. I can bite my other eye.”
The judge reads the man’s face, and can clearly see that he’s not blind. He takes the offer... The man then removes his dentures and presses them down on his other eye. At this point, the judge is torn. The man is an excellent scam artist, without a doubt, but he doesn’t know if that’s enough for him to clear his charges. Plus, he just lost $2000 to him. The judge sits quietly for a moment. The man speaks up again “How about double or nothing again? I bet you that I can do a handstand on one side of your desk and pee into the wastebasket on the other side.” Obviously, this is wildly inappropriate behavior for a courtroom... But we’re talking about $2000. The judge looks back and forth across his desk a couple times, and decides there’s no way he could possibly pull this off. He agrees. So, the man walks up, does a handstand on his desk, and attempts to pee across the desk into the wastebasket. He doesn’t even come close to making it.
The judge exclaims “Yes!” 
The man’s lawyer shouts “No!” And covers his face with his hands.
The judge asks “Wait, what’s wrong?”

The lawyer says “He bet me $10,000 he could come in here and pee all over your desk and you’d be happy about it.”",The World’s Greatest Gambler,293

The staff always crushed the patients every year but this year the patients had an ace up their sleeve. His name was ""Nuts"", because well he was nuts despite this he had the strongest arms anyone had seen. He could hit a ball into the stratosphere if he desired. Nuts however had gotten into a pretty brutal car crash where he got away with severe brain damage and could only perform actions if explicitly told to do so. This meant that the coach had to tell Nuts every step.
The game started and the coach told Nuts ""grab your baseball bat Nuts"". Nuts proceeded to pick up his bat.
""Alright Nuts now get up and step up to the plate"". Nuts stepped up.
""Now Nuts when the pitcher throws the ball I want you to hit it as hard as you can"". By this point all the patients were cheering Nuts on.
Nuts got ready for the ball to come whizzing, all the while the crowd were yelling ""hit the ball Nuts!"" Over and over again. 
The first ball was a wicked curve ball that came speeding towards Nuts, but he had prepared for this and he hit with startling strength. As the ball flew over all the staff's heads the pitcher realized how formidable Nuts was.
The pitcher with renowned strength threw the ball with everything he could muster, but alas it was not enough as Nuts scored another home run. The pitcher completely aghast knew that they had no chance to take Nuts out. So he accepted defeat but not without a fight as he threw all his remaining strength into one final curveball. 
The crowd was hollering nonsensical cheers, they knew victory was achieved as the person currently pitching was their strongest pitcher. Even he could now stand up to the might of Nuts. As the ball grew ever closer and closer to Nuts and as he reeled for another homerun, off to the side a vendor was handing out his wares to the cheering crowd and with one last hurrah he yelled out ""PEANUTS!""","The chronicles of ""Nuts""",2

He proudly announces his result, and the king is impressed. The king says, ""I understood that intuitively. Good job!""  

The mathematician goes next.  
He wraps a thread around the widest point of the ball, and announces that it has a diameter of just a hair under 8 centimeters. He goes to a chalkboard and writes ""r=4""  

Then on the chalkboard, he integrates (pi \*r^2 )/2 from 0 to 2\*pi, and announces that the formula for volume is (4/3)\*pi*r^3, gets out a slide rule, fiddles with it, and announces that the volume of the rubber ball is 265 milliliters.  

The king says, ""Well, you kind of lost me with the calculus, but I have faith that you know what you're doing.""  

The engineer goes last. He looks at the ball, and says, ""This is Jenkins 2175-a red rubber ball."" He fishes around in his jacket and pants pockets a bit, and comes up with a tech specs brochure.  
""The Jenkins 2175-a has a volume of 250 milliliters.""

Moral: Engineers just look stuff up.



My dad was an engineer, and he loved this joke.

 A 'friend of a friend' put him in touch with a nefarious, dark-side underworld figure who went by the name of 'Artie.' Artie explained to the husband that his going price for snuffing out of a spouse was $10,000.

 The husband said he was willing to pay that amount but that he wouldn't have any cash on hand until he could collect his wife's insurance money. Artie insisted on being paid at least something up front, so the man opened his wallet, displaying the single dollar coin that rested inside.

Artie sighed, rolled his eyes and reluctantly agreed to accept the dollar as down payment for the dirty deed.

A few days later, Artie followed the man's wife to the local Costco Warehouse. There, he surprised her in the produce department and proceeded to strangle her with his gloved hands. As the poor unsuspecting woman drew her last breath and slumped to the floor, the manager of the produce department stumbled unexpectedly onto the murder scene. Unwilling to leave any living witnesses behind, ol' Artie had no choice but to strangle the produce manager as well.

 However, unknown to Artie, the entire proceedings were captured by the hidden security cameras and observed by the shop's security guard, who immediately called the police. Artie was caught and arrested before he could even leave the premises

Under intense questioning at the police station, Artie revealed the whole sordid plan, including his unusual financial arrangements with the hapless husband who was also quickly arrested.

 The next day in the newspaper, the headline declared.
