An exquisitely sweet aroma would follow her in the summer, and she was widely known to be the best cook for miles. One day while they were busy swooning over her, they decided it was time to take action, as she could only marry one man.
""Hear,"" said the British man, ""I wish to claim her heart. So for her, I will present an elegant bouquet of tsubaki and sumire.""
""Very well,"" responded the other, ""but I shall give her an ensemble of chocolates to impress her instead.”
The pair spent the rest of the day preparing, and as evening fell, they went to present their gifts.
The flowers brought to her face a dainty smile, and she clearly appreciated the attention to detail in the arrangement. However the chocolates were just to her liking; bittersweet, but with a caramel twist. She did not say to either man which gift was preferred, but it was obvious to them both nonetheless.
“I suggest we bring her clothes next week” the Brit mused, “perhaps she would enjoy an outfit more.”
The Asian agreed, and they spent the following days stitching and sewing until their hands were stripped raw. By the end, the British man had produced a traditionally-styled Japanese garment of pastel blue silk, embroidered with unique depictions of white dragons and lotus flowers. It wasn’t perfect, but it was clear he had tried his best to tailor it to her likings. On the other hand, the Asian fellow had made a prudish bikini in a lustrous red satin, complete with decorative lace and tiny bows. This gift made her blush, but it was obvious she did not appreciate it nearly as much as the blue kimono.
Later that night, the Asian man began to discuss the romantic affairs. “We are yet to reach a conclusion”, he began, “perhaps we should make her a katana instead?” *It would be a lot of work*, the Brit thought to himself, *but perhaps it could be worth it*. They spent the following month toiling and forging a perfect blade to give to their desire; of course, descending from a long line of traditional swordsmiths, the Asian fellow had a large advantage. He crafted a perfect, razor sharp katana. It was as deadly as it was beautiful, with intricate embellishments carved up the length of the blade. It could strike through steel with ease, unlike the British man’s blade. On the day she received them, it was clear she was to test them first. The higher quality blade survived with easy, but the second blade shattered on its first test, along with the British man’s hopes of ever being with her.
The wedding was arranged 7 months later; the Japanese woman had been taken by the man of Asian descent, but this story does not stop here. The Asian man was abusive, and shortly after their marriage, she had realised that her heart did not belong with him. She was forced to stay with the man due to her pregnancy, though kept a secret line of communication with the British man. Several months later, she had given birth, though the child was clearly not of full-asian descent. The child was not his own, and this infuriated him; unsurprisingly, he was furious and already suspected this was the works of his old friend. He decided to confront him. “What have you done?” he screamed, “You have defiled my wife, my love and my family! For this, you must die!” The men fought for what seemed like hours, until the Asian’s wife caught up with the commotion. “What is this madness?” she asked, nervously. “You clearly went behind my back, and had sex with this monster!” he quipped, frothing with rage, “And for that, you must die together!”. They tried to fight back, but they were overpowered and eventually slain. 
In the moment, the Asian man felt proud. He was stronger than them, and he knew what he did was right. Or did he? Over the following months, he began to doubt himself. They had both loved the woman dearly, and now, he was the only one left… *Perhaps I had acted irrationally* he thought to himself, *but what I did was clearly not right. You should not have control over who lives and who dies, that is not for us to decide.* The man sobbed to himself for months, as the guilt ate away at him. He may never forget the fateful day he destroyed the lives of two friends, and his own, it will forever taint his memories to the day he dies…
The moral of this story is that two wongs don’t make a white.

post,5cjgat,2qh72,jokes,false,1478935978,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5cjgat/just_one_customer/,self.jokes,,"A young guy from North Dakota moves to Florida and goes to a big ""everything under one roof' department store looking for a job.

The Manager says, ""Do you have any sales experience?""

The kid says ""Yeah. I was a vacuum salesman back in North Dakota.""

Well, the boss was unsure, but he liked the kid and figured he'd give him a shot, so he gave him the job. ""You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did.""

His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor. ""How many customers bought something from you today?""

The kid frowns and looks at the floor and mutters, ""One"".


The boss says ""Just one?!!? Our sales people average sales to 20 to 30 customers a day. That will have to change, and soon, if you'd like to continue your employment here. We have very strict standards for our sales force here in Florida. One sale a day might have been acceptable in North Dakota, but you're not on the farm anymore, son.""

The kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing him out on his first day. He asked (semi-sarcastically), ""So, how much was your one sale for?""

The kid looks up at his boss and says ""$101,237.65"".

The boss, astonished, says $101,237.65?!? What the heck did you sell?""

The kid says, ""Well, first, I sold him some new fish hooks. Then I sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 Expedition.""

The boss said ""A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and a TRUCK!?""

The kid said ""No, the guy came in here to buy tampons for his wife, and I said, 'Dude, your weekend's shot, you should go fishing.'",Just one customer.,235

We would just like to inform you that we’ve been listening to your many requests and beautifully worded suggestions, and we’re giddy like school boys to bring you the biggest update for the game yet. 

The biggest headline feature is that we’re incredibly proud to announce that we’ve added one of the most requested distinguished gentleman into the verbal battle arena. This legendary fine fellow requires no introduction, as he’s been saving our planet from vile alien creatures since most of us were still holding on to our mother’s pants leg. So please welcome the one-and-only, Sam “Serious” Stone!!! He’s not here to dilly-dally around and comes packing a whole arsenal of new devastating verbal weapons of mass destruction! 

Besides the inclusion of Serious Sam, this update also introduces the following key improvements to the game and its multiplayer:
 
- New Guest Character: Sam “Serious” Stone - Can you figure out how to unlock him? 
- Important! This version is NOT compatible with the previous one in the online multiplayer mode: The bad news is you won’t be able to play with your slower friends, but the good news is that you won’t be playing with pirates neither (for a while…) So in order to play with all available players online, make sure you install this update 
- Requested multiplayer scoring changes: Disconnecting now counts as escaping, which constitutes a win for the opposing player. 
- Multiplayer score changes are now saved after one of the players wins, but before the final dialogue (so you are free to disconnect during the dialogue) 
- Bigger penalties if a player delays making their move for more than 10seconds, several times in a row 
Small tweaks in how the insults are spoken (they should sound a tiny bit more natural) 
- Additional minor scoring changes 
- Fixed some typos: Thanks to gentlemen in our community for rightfully reporting these unacceptable violations of the Queen’s English!

Please do not scurry too far away after installing this update though, as we have a lot more exciting surprises planned for the game. To this end, know that we’re keeping track of all guest character suggestions being put forward in the forums, so please keep these coming. We have more famous new faces lined up to join the verbal arena, so keep your eyes glued to your digital windows … you never know what other new surprises the dead parrot might bring you! 

Thank you very much again for all of your venerable support!

He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""","A man wakes up in a dingy slum,",1991

“What, this? Nah, this is like a Spring day in Chicago.”

The Devil doesn’t take lightly to such a slight, so he decides to really turn things up. The renewed eternal hellfire and inferno has made the screams of the tormented souls in hell even louder.

 Rivers of lava overflowing their banks. The Devil goes to check on his two Chicagoans, and sure enough he sees them lounging in shorts and t-shirts.

“Not hot enough for you?” the devil queries bewilderedly.

“What, this? Nah, this is like a July in Chicago. In fact, I think the humidity was worse in the summer of ’96.”

The Devil is even more incensed. He comes up with a new idea. Turn the thermostat way down. The cursed souls in Hell are greeted by new but equally unbearable type of torture. The lava stops flowing, brimstone stops glowing, and wouldn’t you know it, the ground they stand on has frozen solid.

The Devil again searches out his two Chicagoans, and to his dismay, they’re hugging and cheering.

“What’s this all about!?” the Devil roared.

---

A Marine comes across a terrorist leader by a mountain.  The terrorist leader, having heard of the skill of the American Marines, challenges the young man to fight his most fearsome warrior.  The Marine accepts, and he and the terrorist go behind the mountain to fight.  A few minutes later, the Marine emerges unscathed.

The terrorist leader is upset, and sends five men behind the mountain to attack the Marine.  There are distant sounds of a scuffle, and again the Marine emerges unscathed.

This time the leader sends one hundred men after the Marine, sure that this time the young man will not escape.  There are loud sounds of a fight, and when it's over, the Marine emerges with a few bruises, but otherwise unharmed.

The terrorist leader is angry and astounded.  ""Enough of this!"" he shouts, and sends his entire army behind the mountain to fight the Marine.  There are deafening sounds of struggle, screams and yelps and gunshots.  Finally, when it quiets down, a single terrorist comes out from behind the mountain, wild-eyed and barely clinging to life.

""It's a trick!"" he yells to his leader.  ""It's a trick!  There's *two* of them!""",A Marine Corps Joke for Veteran's Day,2

Soon, almost 20 people are standing around the table. This includes the chef and the restaurants owner. Every single one is trying to convince the old man that it is, in fact, a 1928 Mouton. The waiter then asks: ""How can you be so sure this isn't a 1928 Mouton?""

The elderly man then states: ""My name is Phillip de Rothschild, and I produce this wine!"" 

The waiter then admits that the wine actually is a Clerc Milon 1928. 

""I could not bear the thought of us parting with the last bottle of Mouton 1928. You know, Clerc Milon is produced in the exact same village, with the exact same grapes, the same type of baskets and aged in the exact same barrels.

So, Reddit, about 6 weeks ago I was suicidal. Everything was just crashing over my head and I was constantly busy. I was lucky to even get 6 hours of sleep a night. (I was usually getting between 3-5, I couldn't sleep I was so stressed). My roommate, let's call him Jake, knew this and did his best to accommodate for me, by fixing meals for me, taking me to appointments and therapy, etc. One day, after another sleepless night, and getting chewed out at my job, I had had enough.
I was on a lot of pills at the time, and then had a surplus of generic pills that are commonly found in households. (Aspirin, pain, laxatives, etc.). My roommate was supposed to be gone for the day, so I decided that this life wasn't worth it and took one of every pill I could find.
The next thing I knew, I was in a hospital bed with tubes in my arms and Jake sitting next to me. He had asked if we needed anything from the grocery store and got worried when I didn't answer any of his texts or calls. He came home to find me out in the bathroom, with a strange pallor to my skin.
My recovery was slow, but I was feeling better, up until today.
Jake would send me funny pictures or memes every time I would visit a doctor to cheer me up. Today, as the doctor was preparing to go through his regular well-being checkup on me, Jake sent me a link, I opened it, and it was on 9GAG.

""It will be okay, son."" The Pope reassured Dave, who was nervous about getting fired. The police officer walked up to the driver's side. The Pope lowered the window, to the officer's surprise.

""Uh, do you know how fast you were going, your Holiness?""

""I didn't mean to, sir. It won't happen again.""

The officer let the him off with a warning. He then called into dispatch.

""Any problems, officer?""

""Sir, I just stopped a really important person.""

""Is it the Mayor?""

""No, Sir"" says the officer, ""someone more important""

""The Governor?""

First briefing to the President by CIA, Pentagon, FBI:

Trump: We must destroy ISIS immediately. No delays.

CIA: We cannot do that, sir. We created them along with Turkey, Iran, Qatar and others.

Trump: The Democrats created them.

CIA: We created ISIS, sir. You need them or else you would lose funding from the natural gas lobby.

Trump: Stop funding Pakistan. Let India deal with them.

CIA: We can't do that.

Trump: Why is that?

CIA: India will cut Balochistan out of Pak.

Trump: I don't care.

CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to fund Pakistan to keep India busy in Kashmir.

Trump: But you have to destroy the Taliban.

CIA: Sir, we can't do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia in check during the 80s. Now they are keeping Pakistan busy and away from their nukes.

Trump: We have to destroy terror sponsoring regimes in the Middle East. Let us start with the Saudis.

Pentagon: Sir, we can't do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it.

Trump: Then, let us invade Iran.

Pentagon: We cannot do that either, sir.

Trump: Why not?

CIA: We are talking to them, sir.

Trump: What? Why?

CIA: We want our stealth drone back. If we attack them, Russia will obliterate us as they did to our
buddy ISIS in Syria. Besides we need Iran to keep Israel in check.

Trump: Then let us invade Iraq again.

CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) are already occupying 1/3rd of Iraq.

Trump: Why not the whole of Iraq?

CIA: We need the Shi'ite gov't of Iraq to keep ISIS in check.

Trump: I am banning Muslims from entering US.

FBI: We can't do that.

Trump: Why not?

FBI: Then our own population will become fearless.

Trump: I am deporting all illegal immigrants to south of the border.

Border patrol: You can't do that, sir.

Trump: Why not?

Border patrol: If they're gone, who will build the wall?

Trump: I am banning H1B visas.

USCIS: You cannot do that.

Trump: Why?

Chief of staff: If you do so we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. Which is in India.

Trump (sweating profusely by now): What the hell should I do as President?

CIA: Enjoy the White House, sir! We will take care of the rest!",Trump's first day at the Oval Office after being elected President,6

Hearing of his rivals success, Jim immediately went to the police and disclosed to them Bob's revolutionary but illegal new method. While standing on trial Bob told the judge that the beef from his weed enhanced cows was the most delicious meat on the world. The judge, liking red meat as much as the next guy, demanded to taste it. So Bob slaughtered a steer and grilled up a cut for the judge. Upon tasting it, the judge immediately found Bob not guilty. Later, at a barbecue to celebrate his victory, bob and the judge were discussing his trial.

A couple stops later the man goes to the bus driver and asks him, ""Hey do you know how you can bang a nun? Particularly the one who got off a couple stops back.""

So the bus driver says, ""Well, you can't really just go up to a nun and get her to bang you, but I know for a fact that that every night that nun goes to the graveyard at exactly midnight to pray. You should dress up in your best God costume and make her have sex with you.""

The man is impressed, and decides to do just that. So he goes to the graveyard in his best God costume, and waits behind a gravestone. At exactly midnight, the nun enters and kneels at a tombstone, and beings to pray. He then jumps out and says ""I am God!""

The nun is surprised and says ""Oh Lord, please take me with you to heaven!"" The man says, ""Of course! But you must prove yourself worthy by having sex with me!"" The nun a bit more surprised and says, ""Ok, but I prefer anal.""

The man thinks 'Wait what?' but doesn't give enough shits to not have sex with the hot nun. So they bang.

After he finishes he pulls out and takes off his mask, laughing. ""Ha! Joke's on you! I'm the guy from the bus!"" He says.

The nun then gets up, pulls off her mask, and says, ""Ha! Joke's on you! I'm the bus driver!""","A man is on a bus, and then a hot nun gets on...",56

""I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us, it's about us, on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I mean that very sincerely.

""Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. It's time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me.

""For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.

""As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement made up of millions of hard-working men and women, who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their families. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people - and serve the people it will.

""Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well, tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realise his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.

""We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.

""We will also finally take care of our great veterans. They've been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honours. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen.

""We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great.
Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best.
We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again.

""I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone -- all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility. Partnership, not conflict.

""And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now.
Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents.

""I also want to thank my sisters, Mary Anne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And, where are they? They're here some place. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that's OK. They're great. And also my late brother, Fred. Great guy. Fantastic guy. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters; great, unbelievable parents.

""To Melania and Don, and Ivanka, and Eric and Tiffany and Baron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all.""

(Mr Trump goes on to thank some political allies, such as Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie, as well as praising the work of police and the secret services.)

First briefing by the CIA, Pentagon, FBI:

Trump: We must destroy ISIS immediately. No delays.

CIA: We cannot do that, sir. We created them along with Turkey, Saudi, Qatar and others.

Trump: The Democrats created them.

CIA: We created ISIS, sir. You need them or else you would lose funding from the natural gas lobby.

Trump: Stop funding Pakistan. Let India deal with them.

CIA: We can't do that.

Trump: Why is that?

CIA: India will cut Balochistan out of Pak.

Trump: I don't care.

CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to fund Pakistan to keep India busy in Kashmir.

Trump: But you have to destroy the Taliban.

CIA: Sir, we can't do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia in check during the 80s. Now they are keeping Pakistan busy and away from their nukes.

Trump: We have to destroy terror sponsoring regimes in the Middle East. Let us start with the Saudis.

Pentagon: Sir, we can't do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it.

Trump: Then, let us invade Iran.

Pentagon: We cannot do that either, sir.

Trump: Why not?

CIA: We are talking to them, sir.

Trump: What? Why?

CIA: We want our Stealth Drones back. If we attack them, Russia will obliterate us as they did to our buddy ISIS in Syria. Besides we need Iran to keep Israel in check.

Trump: Then let us invade Iraq again.

CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) are already occupying 1/3rd of Iraq.

Trump: Why not the whole of Iraq?

CIA: We need the Shi'ite govt of Iraq to keep ISIS in check.

Trump: I am banning Muslims from entering US.

FBI: We can't do that.

Trump: Why not?

FBI: Then our own population will become fearless.

Trump: I am deporting all illegal immigrants to south of the border.

Border patrol: You can't do that, sir.

Trump: Why not?

Border patrol: If they're gone, who will build the wall?

Trump: I am banning H1B visas.

USCIS: You cannot do that.

Trump: Why?

Chief of Staff: If you do so, we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. Which is in India.

Trump (sweating profusely by now): What the hell should I do as President???

CIA: Enjoy the White House, sir! We will take care of the rest!
