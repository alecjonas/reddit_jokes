The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulation requiring that family unity be maintained to the highest degree possible.

The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him.

After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.

After two recesses to check legal references and confer with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Cleveland Browns whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone.",Local Boy Stuns Courtroom in Custody Case,11

The Rabbi protests and says ""Wait, that's it, we're not even gonna talk about this?"" So the Pope asks what he wants to do and the Rabbi says that he wants to have a debate the following week. The Pope agrees and they part ways.

A few days before the debate, the Pope realizes that he's just agreed to debate with a Jew. He realizes that he needs to level the playing field a bit, so he calls the Rabbi.

Pope: ""The way I see it, you challenged me to a duel. So, I get to pick the weapons.""

Rabbi: ""Okay, what are the weapons?""

Pope: ""We can't use words.""

Rabbi: ""Well then how are we going to debate?""

Pope: ""We'll figure that out.""

So the day comes when the debate is set. The Pope and the Rabbi sit down with each other. Everyone is silent and watches the two as they begin silently debating.

Pope: \*Holds up three fingers\*

Rabbi: \*Holds up one finger\*

Pope: \*Crosses himself\*

Rabbi: \*Points at the ground\*

Pope: \*Takes out a bottle of wine and a loaf of bread from his robes\*

Rabbi: \*Takes an apple out of his robes\*

To everyone's astonishment, the Pope then declares to all present that the Rabbi has won and the Jews would be permitted to stay in Rome. Upon returning to the Vatican later that evening, a bishop asks the Pope what happened. The Pope replies:

""We started and I said that there was the Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He said that we all pray to one God. I replied that God sent His son to do His work. He said that we were all here to do God's work. So then, I showed him the body and blood of Christ. He showed me an apple and said that we were all children of the Original Sin. I couldn't argue with that, so he won.""

Across town, the Rabbi gets home and his wife asks him what happened. The Rabbi replies:

""I should know what happened? That son of a bitch gets in there and he says we got three days to get out! So I tell him that ain't one Jew gonna leave this town. And then he says that's he's gonna get us out if he has to rope us up and drag us out, so I say well I'm not leaving this spot! So then, he pulls out his lunch, I pull out mine, and then he tells me I win!""",The Pope wakes up one day and decides he doesn't want any Jews in Rome,12

Do you have any recommendations for a pet to keep me company?”

The sales rep says “What about a dog?”

“No no no, I’ve already had a dog and they’re a lot of work to clean up after”

“Well what about a cat? They’re low maintenance..”

The woman replies “No thank you, all that hair to clean up? And the litter to scoop?”

The representative thinks for a while and says “I have the perfect idea in mind for you. We just got a chimpanzee in and he can do it all, he can even help with chores around the house.”

The woman seems taken aback in disbelief, but the pet store worker assures her that he’s 100% serious. “Look, there’s a grocery right next door. Why don’t you take him grocery shopping and give him your list?”

The woman reluctantly agrees and takes the chimpanzee with her to do her grocery shopping. Sure enough, the chimpanzee went through the whole store and got every single item on the list, and even faster than the widow would have done. The widows returns to the pet store and says “You weren’t kidding! I’ll take him.”  

The excited widow had an event to go to that evening, but was so impressed with the chimpanzee that she decided to take him along to the event including the bus ride there and back. 

On the way back from the event there was a horrible accident involving the bus and every person died except the chimpanzee. The police are so impressed at the chimpanzee’s ability to communicate they start to interview him about the accident.

One of the officers sits down to interview the chimpanzee and asks “At the time of the accident, what was everyone doing?”

The chimpanzee gives it some thought and places his hand on his stomach and wiggles his hips back and forth.

“They were dancing??” asks the wide-eyed officer.

The chimpanzee confidently nods repeatedly.

“Well were they doing anything else?

The chimpanzee thinks and mimes drinking out of a cup.

“They were drinking?!” exclaims the officer.

The chimpanzees assuredly nods back to the officer.

The cop is completely taken aback by their behavior and asks “Well, while they were all doing this what were YOU doing?”

Raises his hands up and wiggles them like he’s driving the bus.",That’s one amazing chimpanzee..,26

Doc assures him,”we have the latest in technology, just go to the men’s room and give me a sample”, which he does. The doctor pours it in the top of a complex analysis unit and a short time later, it spits out a tape reading.
Doctor looks at it and says, “ you have tennis elbow”.
“That’s ridiculous” he says’ “I don’t play tennis!”
Doctor informs him it’s just a term for tendinitis in the elbow and sends him home with instructions not to overuse his arm and return in two weeks.

The guy returns two weeks later and the process is repeated. The doctor sends him home with the same instructions.

After several visits like this the guy is certain the doctor is just racking up billable hours, so before he goes to his next appointment he; has his wife pee in a can; his daughter pee in a can, catches his dogs pee in a can; puts some used oil from his car in the can and, for good measure; jacks off in it. He then hides it in the men’s room before the nurse takes him back to the examining room.  

When the doc hands him the sample cup, he doesn’t question it and goes to the men’s room, pees in the cup and adds some of his stash to it, returning it to the doctor who blindly pours it in.

The unit goes freakin nuts; smoking, whirring, lights flashing, alarms going off-so the doctor asks him to have a seat in the waiting room.

An hour later the guy is called back, a smirk on his face and the doctor pulls out a two-foot long printout and reads the diagnoses: your wife, Sarah, has syphilis; your daughter, Tina, is pregnant; your dog, Jack, has cancer; your 2016 BMW is low on oil..............and if you don’t quit whacking off you’ll *never* get rid of that tennis elbow!",A guy goes to his doctor for elbow pain...,48

God looks at the priest's ledger of good and evil and smiles after finishing it. Looking up at the priest, God says ""I'm satisfied with how you've lived and how you've spent your life. I give you the option to choose — Hell or heaven?""

The priest is surprised. 'Who in their right minds would ever *choose* hell?'
Confidently, he says ""Heaven, my master.""

God nods. Instantly the priest is sent to the Heaven.

The priest looks around and finds a single, modest house. There's a tiny garden nearby and a few animals graze in it silently. The priest, having lived a life of modesty, settles quickly into the life. For lunch, he's given bread and butter. For dinner, he's given bread and butter.

The next day, he finds bread and butter for breakfast. He wonders, 'Maybe this is temporary.'

Finding a tiny hole in the wall, he walks to it and peeps into what the status is in Hell. He's shocked at what he sees.

A full banquet has been laid. People eat all kinds of fruits and sandwiches. They're drinking merrily and laughing. It doesn't look like Hell at all, for the priest had imagined Satan burning the men and women at stakes and laughing devilishly.

Dissapointed at the Lord's ways, but accepting them nevertheless he goes back to his hut.

For an entire week, he endures bread and butter. The silence around his hut suffocates him. Unable to sustain it anymore, he walks to the Lord.

""Why, if I've chosen Heaven, am I treated so badly? Where is my banquet and my half of fun? Is my service all in vain? Why do I have to eat the bread and butter every day?"" he laments.

God looks at the priest as if he has missed the obvious and says, ""Well, we're not going to keep the kitchen busy and running just for one person, right?!""",A priest dies and stands in front of God.,20

A lot of them are simply awful, but they're all original, and my Gramps was a huge inspiration for me becoming a comedy ""writer."" But this is an old joke, and he loved to tell it every time I saw him. He knew quite a few others too, but this was always my favorite.* 

A man is out on a golf course, when he hears someone shout ""FORE!"" 

He looks this way and that but doesn't see the ball, until *WHACK!* He shouts and curses and moans, holding both hands over his crotch. 

""Oh, you poor thing!"" a woman cries, running over to assist him. She gets on her knees and starts to rub his groin with her hands. ""Is that better?""

He shakes his head, so she pulls his pants down and starts rubbing it in earnest. After a few minutes, she smiles and says, ""That seemed to help a lot!""

""Oh, it was wonderful!"" he says. ""But the ball hit my thumb!""

*EDIT: Yesterday was really hard, but you guys really brightened it up. I read every comment I could and I loved every joke I came across.

'Why not, you asked me what was wrong and I told you,' he said.

The man enjoyed the two mile walk to work in the morning, but the cold of the night made the way back numb, rigid, and surreal. The man followed long, curving roads through the dark pine forests, illuminated by cold sunlight reflected off the moon. He had a lot on his mind, since he was not only recently married, but he had a four year old daughter to take care of.

The thought of not being able to provide for his toddler weighted down his head, and his eyes stayed focused on the ground. Though his mind drifted between thoughts and worries, the cold kept his body rigid and alert. The ethereal night seemed to not even faze the young man, content on going home. He was far enough away from town now to see the stars, but he'd never get far enough away to see the explosive beauty of the unpolluted night sky.

At last he arrived at his home. Though his mind remained inactive, his body reached into his suede jacket and removed the keys within, turning the lock without issue. He stumbled inside, leaving his shoes and his mind by the door. His hands curled around his neck and tugged on his red tie until it came loose, and then they loosed their grip until it fell to the ground. His body dropped into bed, and his mind joined it, without even worrying about bathing. The heat of his loved one warmed his frozen muscles, and he fell joyously into the arms of sleep.

He emerged from rest at 10 o clock AM. It was a Saturday now. The young man, reinvigorated, quickly bathed and put on new clothes. The heat of the water nearly lulled him back to sleep, but the sudden rush of cold he experienced after his shower brought him back out. The nervous young man carried his lazy bones into the kitchen, where they were greeted by the aroma of pancakes and bacon. His love, bless her soul, had prepared breakfast for them. The whole family gathered around the table and enjoyed a meal. At one point, the young girl noticed her father's glass was empty. ""You're glass went empty, daddy,"" she mumbled with an innocent smile on her face that only toddlers can have ""would you like another one?"" Her father grew a massive grin ""Why would I want two empty glasses?""",A young man is walking home from his job at a local software company,58

As he drives along a beautiful country road, he sees something odd in the distance. As he gets closer, he can see that it is a farmer standing under a tree near the road holding a pig. Curious, he pulls to the side of the road. He watches intently as the farmer picks up one pig after another to let them eat an apple from the tree. This curious behavior fascinates the businessman as he watches this go on for several minutes. Finally, he can no longer contain himself. He calls out to the farmer, “Excuse me sir, but what exactly are you doing?” The farmer calmly replies, “Why, feeding the pigs, of course.” The businessman is a little surprised.

When she picks her crop in the autumn, her carrots, potatoes, onions, and spring beans have all failed, but her cauliflowers have grown a treat.

She picks them, cooks some for Sunday lunch in a cheese sauce, and they taste wonderful.

After eating them for a week she notices two things. Firstly, her lips are full and glossy, unchapped, uncracked, and require absolutely no lip gloss to make them look full and pouty.

Secondly she has really awful bad breath and even her cat won't come near her.

Pleased with her lips, however, and spotting a money-making idea, she contacts a big cosmetics company and explains about the lip-enhancing qualities of her cauliflower crop.

After a month of testing the company buys the entire crop of cauliflowers for a phenomenal amount and requests that Mary grow some more as soon as possible.

The company proceeds to make lipstick out of them but experiences problems in the the final product manufacture. The lipstick does not gel correctly into a solid stick and ends up crumbling upon application. Quality controllers also find that, even as a lipstick, the bad breath remains and have to put it down as an unfortunate side effect.

As they are nearing their production deadline and adverts for this new wonder lip enhancer have hit the streets, the cosmetics company has no choice but to produce the packaging with the following caution.

When he arrived at the first house on his route, he was greeted by the whole family who congratulated him and sent him on his way with a tidy gift envelope.

At the second house, they presented him with a box of fine cigars. The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.

At the fourth house, he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful blonde woman in a revealing negligee. She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door, which she closed behind him, and took him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced.

When he had enough, they went downstairs and she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied, she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge. ""All this was just too wonderful for words,"" he said, ""But what's the dollar for?""

""Well,"" she said, ""Last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you. He said, 'Screw him. Give him a dollar.' The breakfast was my idea.""",George's Last Day,119

""Are you the dumb fucker that runs this shit hole of a bar?"" 

The manager, taken very much aback, responds, ""Excuse me? I am the manager, yes, can you please stop swearing in front of my patrons?""

""Good! 'Cause I need some fucking work and I'm half decent on the keys!"" 

And he sits down and begins to play the sweetest, grooviest, bluest-of-blues tracks the bar manager has ever heard. 

""D..did you write that? That was beautiful! What's it called?"" 

""That I did! It's called, Why don't you go fuck the ass off of a low flying duck you insolent cunt?"" 

Aghast, the manager gestures for the pianist to hush, and quietly asks ""Do you know any jazz? Anything a little more intricate?"" 

""'Course I do!"" 

And again the pianist plays the most delightful and devilish jazz piece the manager has heard. 

Bracing for the name of this track, he asks ""Well what do you call it?"" 

""I'll fuck your mother's hairy minge under the cover of pale moonlight!"" 

Appalled, though aware of the man's talents, the manager offers him a spot on the bill, on the proviso that he doesn't name his songs after he plays them, and the pianist happily agrees. 

*Later that evening...* 

About 5 from showtime, the pianist has set himself up on stage and is perusing the crowd, gauging the energy of the room, when he suddenly spies the most beautiful, drop-dead gorgeous woman he's ever seen - tight fitting red dress with red lipstick to match, high heels - you name it. After slight deliberation, and with the 5 minutes to spare, the pianist decides it a good idea to go try rub one out in the men's room, to ""deal with the stress of performing"", as he justifies it. 

Well, lo and behold it takes a little longer than 5 minutes, and the manager comes bursting into the bathroom (on the other side of the stall, mind you), and yells

""Christ mate, where have you been?! The people are getting agitated - you've a show to play! Don't you fuck this up for me!""

Before leaving the bathroom abrutply. 

The pianist rages on with the task at hand, and after wrapping up he bursts from the bathroom back onto the stage and sets right to playing. 

After his first song, the lovely woman he had spied earlier approaches him from the side of the stage, leans into his ear and whispers 

""Excuse me, do you know your dick is hanging out of your pants and there's cum dribbling onto your shoe?""

Stunned, the pianist turns to her and says 

""Know it?! I wrote that fucking song!""","[LONG]So, a pianist walks into his local jazz bar...",45

So she consented, they were married, and off they went on a honeymoon at a very nice resort...

One morning they were lying by the pool, when he got up off of his towel, climbed up to the 10 metre board and did a two and a half tuck, followed by three rotations in the pike position, at which point he straightened out and cut the water like a knife...

After a few more demonstrations, he came back and lay down on the towel...

She said, “That was incredible!”...

He said, “I used to be an Olympic diving champion. You see, I told you we'd learn more about each other as we went along”...

So she got up, jumped in the pool and started doing lengths...

After seventy-five lengths she climbed out of the pool, lay down on her towel and was hardly out of breath...

He said, “That was incredible! Were you an Olympic endurance swimmer?”...

“No”, she said, “I was a prostitute in Liverpool but I worked both sides of the Mersey”...",Beautiful lady,17

They do just about everything together. And one day, they’re sitting at the window of the house, and the farmer’s kid is watching MTV, and they’re watching it, and they hear the music, and the horse says “you know what? I’m gonna learn how to do that.”  
  
So the horse calls up Guitar Center, and he says to the guy on the phone, “Hey, listen. I wanna learn to play guitar.”  
  
Guy on the phone says “no problem. Come on down.”  
  
“No, there might be one problem. I’m a horse.”  
  
“Naw, it ain’t a problem. We’ll get some attachments, I can teach you to play. Promise.”  
  
So horse turns out to be a natural. He gets GOOD. And he calls over Cow and Chicken and he’s like “LOOK WHAT I CAN DO” and he jams out like Jimi Hendrix. And Cow says “holy shit. That’s awesome. I want to learn to do something like that too. What’s like that?” And horse says “Bass. Learn to play bass.”  
  
So Cow calls up Guitar Center, and she says “Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play bass guitar.”  
  
Guy on the phone says “No problem, miss, come on down.”  
  
“Eh, this might be a problem. I’m a cow.”  
  
“Nah, no problem. I helped a horse recently, I can teach you to play too. Promise.”  
  
So Cow learns to play the bass, and Cow is fucking amazing at it. So Cow and Horse are jamming, and Chicken gets a bit jealous. He says “Damn, I wanna learn something too. But not like that.”  
  
Horse says “Well, I mean, we need a drummer around here.”  
  
So Chicken calls up Guitar Center, and he says “Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play drums.”  
  
Guy on the phone says “No problem, man. Come on down.”  
  
“Eh, maybe a problem. I’m a chicken.”  
  
“Naw. Ain’t no thing. I taught a horse guitar and a cow bass. I can teach you drums.”  
  
So chicken learns the drums, and he’s fucking amazing. So Cow, Horse, and Chicken all start having jam sessions whenever the farmer’s out. And one day they’re playing, and a big record agent is driving down the road. And he hears them, and he’s like “what the fuck? that sounds amazing.” so he stops at the farm, and he finds them all playing in the barn. And he says “Holy shit. You guys sound AWESOME. I wanna represent you, make this a real band, make some music. You’re gonna be HUGE.”  
  
So Cow and Chicken and Horse take this guy’s deal, and they move to the city, they cut albums, and they’re big. REAL big. Top 10 hits, platinum albums, the works. They get set for their first tour. But there’s a problem, see. Horse gets a phone call, his mom’s real sick. Cow and Chicken, though, they’re cool as hell. They say “Listen. Go see your mom. We’ll delay the first show a couple of days, so fly back home, spend some time with her, and then jump on a plane and come meet us.”  
  
Horse says “Thanks, guys. you’re the best,” and he takes off.  
  
Couple of days later, Horse’s mom is just fine. Turned out to be a real bad cold, she gets over it, and he spends another night there. The following morning, he gets a call. It’s his agent. Cow and Chicken’s plane went down, they died in the crash. The band is done. he’s lost his best friends. And horse, this breaks him, man. He’s been through so much with them, and he feels real down in the dumps. So he takes a walk, and while he’s on that walk, he just can’t shake the blue, so he figures to himself “Alright, alright. One drink, just to get over it.”  
  
So Horse walks into the local bar. Bartender looks at him and says “Hey. Why the long face?”",So there’s a farm.,95

My friend works as a biosecurity agent at Auckland Airport and told me about a time when his Korean colleague, Alex, had to process a Chinese passenger with a thick accent.

Alex: ""Is there anything in your bag we should be concerned about?""

Passenger - "" Fuck you Korea!""

 Alex can't believe what he's hearing, ""Sorry?""

Passenger - "" Fuck you Korea!""

Alex becoming more and more agitated and confused. ""Excuse me?""

Passenger - ""Fuck you Korea! Fuck you Korea!""

Now people around him are taking notice. Other passengers, other customs agents, they're all wondering what the commotion is.

Alex now losing his temper a bit: ""Alright mate, open up your bags.""

The passenger then puts his bag on the counter. Opens it up, and shows Alex a VACUUM CLEANER.",Fuck you Korea,12

The doctor is amazed at what good shape the guy is in and asks, 'how do you stay in such great physical condition?'

I'm Irish and I am a golfer,' says Don, 'and that's why I'm in such good shape. I'm up well before daylight and out golfing up and down the fairways. I have a glass of Irish whiskey, and all is well.'



""'Well' says the doctor, 'I'm sure that helps, but there's got to be more to it. How old was your Father when he died?

""Who said he was dead?""

The doctor is amazed. 'You mean you're 80 years old and your Father's still alive. How old is he?'

'He's 100 years old,' says Don. 'In fact he golfed with me this morning, and then we went to the topless beach for a walk and had a little Irish whiskey and that's why he's still alive. He's Irish and he's a golfer, too.'



'Well,' the doctor says, 'that's great, but I'm sure there's more to it than that. How about your Father's Father? How old was he when he died?'

'Who said my Gramps was dead?'

Stunned, the doctor asks, 'You mean you're 80 years old and your grandfather's still living!

Incredible, how old is he?'

He's 118 years old,' says the Old Irish golfer.
The doctor is getting frustrated at this point, 'So, I guess he went golfing with you this morning too?'

'No, Gramps couldn't go this morning because he's getting married today.'

At this point the doctor is close to losing it. 'Getting married? Why would a 118 year- old guy want to get married?'

'Who said he wanted to?

""I am in a good mood so I will let you go if you participate in a small social experiment we are having.""

""Sure, what is the experiment?"" all three of them answer unanimously.

""Come with me.""

Ans they are led through the village to a hut on the other side. Once in front of the Hut the leader speaks again:

""All you need to do is go in the hut and interact with the things you will find inside. You must interact with all of them, anyway you see fit and in any order you like. You have one hour.""

""Doesn't sound hard, I will go first."" says the German and opens the door. Inside he finds a beautiful naked woman, a big tasty sandwich and some clothes waiting to be ironed next to an old iron. He irons the clothes and once he is done eats the sandwich and then touches the woman's breast. Once he exits the hut he is asked by the leader:

""Please explain your logic.""

""Simple, in Germany we work first, then we eat and if there is time we have fun.""

""Alright, I am next."" says the Italian and opens the door.

He immediately goes for the woman and makes love to her for some time. Once they are both satisfied he goes for the sandwich. In the end he just folds the clothes without ironing them and exits the hut.

""Please, explain.""

""In Italy, we have fun, then we eat and if there is time we work.""

Lastly the Greek enters the hut. Once everyone looks from the window they see him making love to the woman from behind, eating the sandwich while she is ironing the clothes. Once he is done he opens the door and steps out.

The leader is shocked but still manages to ask him to explain.

One day a good doctor was walking down the street. 

As he was walking, he saw a group of teenage boys smoking, taking drugs and drinking alcohol in the alley.

After seeing these young minds of the country in such a bad situation, he wanted a change.

He invited all those boys to his lab in his office. They came. He took two bowls, added pure alcohol in one bowl and pure water in another.

Doctor : ""Now watch carefully""

Boys: ""Alright mister""

Doctor takes out two worms, adds one in alcohol and the other one in water. The one in alcohol explodes and dies instantaneously

whereas the one in water floats happily.

 After the observation.

Doctor: ""You see? Now tell me the moral if this experiment""

.

Boys: ""Drinking heavy alcohol causes bacteria inside us explode like that!""",Conclusion of an experiment,2
