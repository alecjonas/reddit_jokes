His only son, Vincent, who used to help him, was in prison.  The old man wrote a letter to his son and described his predicament:

""Dear Vincent, I am feeling pretty sad because it looks like I won't be able to plant my tomato garden this year.  I'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot.  I know if you were here, my troubles would be over.  I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me, like in the old days.  Love, Papa""

A few days later, he received a letter from his son.

""Dear Papa, Don't dig up that garden.  That's where the bodies are buried.  Love, Vinnie""

At 4 a.m. the next morning, FBI agents and local police arrived and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies.  They apologized to the old man and left.  That same day the old man received another letter from his son.

""Dear Papa, Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now.  That's the best I could do under the circumstances.  Love you,  Vinnie""",An old Italian gentleman lived alone in New Jersey.,96

The auditor said, ‘Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.’

‘I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,’ says Grandpa. ‘How about a demonstration?’

The auditor thinks for a moment and says, ‘Okay. Go ahead. ‘

Grandpa says, ‘I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.’

The auditor thinks a moment and says, ‘It’s a bet.’

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.

Grandpa says, ‘Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.’

The auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.

Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

‘Want to go double or nothing?’ Grandpa asks ‘I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.’

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. 

But Grandpa’s own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

‘Are you okay?’ the auditor asks. 

‘Not really,’ says the attorney. ‘This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.’",Grandpa was summoned for an audit.,15995

The gorilla went absolutely apeshit (pun intended) and started screeching at the top of his lungs. He burst open the bars of his cage, grabbed Jason, and threw him against the cement. Only when the zookeeper found them did the gorilla give up.

Charlie, caring for the life of his friend, asked the zookeeper what happened. The zookeeper explained that in gorilla language, sticking out your tongue is the equivalent of flipping someone off.

""Mr. Smith?""

""Present,"" responds another man.

""What about Mr. Wong?""

The Chinese man replies, ""Here,"" just as another Chinese man raises his hand says, ""Here,"" as well.

Unfortunately, it's going to take about a week to get it all straightened out in our system.  You know how it goes.  But, in the meantime we'd like to make it up to you here at Reincarnation Services!

""In this department, we are responsible for sending souls back up to Earth to haunt the living once again.  We do zombies, wraiths, liches, you name it!  Usually we reserve these services for some of our more senior Hell residents, but seeing as these are special circumstances, I think we can make an exception.  Let's see here... I think we can pencil you in for this Halloween, we can have you come back as a wight to haunt a small town for a week.  How does that sound?""

""Yes, I am, but what does that have to do with my car?!?!"" the lawyer asked.

The bishop decided that he would conduct the interviews personally and went up into the belfry to begin the screening process. After observing several applicants demonstrate their skills, he had decided to call it a day. Just then, an armless man approached him and announced that he was there to apply for the bell ringer's job. The bishop was incredulous.

“You have no arms !” laughed the Bishop

“No matter,” said the man. “Observe !”

And he began striking the bells with his head, producing a beautiful melody on the carillon. The bishop listened in astonishment; convinced he had finally found a replacement for Quasimodo. But suddenly, as he rushed forward to strike the bell again, the armless man tripped and plunged headlong out of the belfry window to his death in the street below. The stunned bishop rushed down two hundred and ninety five church steps, when he reached the street, a crowd had gathered around the fallen figure drawn by the beautiful music they had heard only moment before. 
As they silently parted to let the bishop through one of them asked, “Bishop, who was this man ?”..

“I don't know his name,” the bishop sadly replied, .................... “but his face rings a bell”.


The following day, despite the sadness that weighed heavily on his heart due to the unfortunate death of the armless campanologist, the bishop continued his interviews for the bell ringer of Notre Dame. 

The first man to approach him said, “Your Excellency, I am the brother of the poor armless wretch that fell to his death from this very belfry yesterday. I pray that you honour his life by allowing me to replace him in this duty.” The bishop agreed to give the man an audition and, as the armless man's brother stooped to pick up a mallet to strike the first bell, he groaned clutched at his chest, twirled around, collapsed and died on the spot.

Two monks hearing the bishop's cries of grief at this second tragedy, rushed up the stairs to his side. “What has happened ? Who is this man ?” the first monk asked breathlessly.

'I don't know his name,' sighed the distraught bishop, 'but....''he's a dead ringer for his brother.'",Long but worth it,1

You couldn't hire anyone off the street. Someone too rough or inconsiderate could tear your delicate gums. You need someone with experience, someone with knowledge of the intimacies and finesse of the tooth brush.

How much do you pay this person? Minimum wage? No, $7.25 an hour is what you pay people when you want them to spit in your food. You pay the person a professional wage, a wage worthy of middle class, $12 an hour.

It's not rocket science. Listen, this is how you fix the economy. Everyone needs to brush their teeth, that's your demand. Supply is already taken cared of, there are plenty of willing college kids.

The toothbrush professional, America's new middle class.

He looks back at the ring and realizes Ruby Ron has knocked down his opponent! He's a little annoyed that he didn't get to witness the knockdown punch.

The fight continues and is pretty slow moving. Then, in the third round, again he hears ""Hey Jimmy!!"" He looks back to see who is yelling and then the crowd goes wild again. He looks back at the ring and sees that Ruby Ron is on his back. But again, he was looking the wrong way and missed it! Now he's outright pissed off! Ron makes it back to his feet and the fight goes on.

Now it's the seventh round and both of the fighters are exhausted and beaten bloody; someone is going down soon. The announcers are now shouting and the crowd is going insane. Then, again, he hears someone yell ""YO JIMMY!!!"" He looks behind him and, you guessed it, the crowd explodes!

Ruby Ron is out cold! Now this guy has just lost his bets and didn't even get to see the punch that ended it. He is livid! He aggressively puts on his hat and coat and begins to shuffle out of the stands with the rest of the crowd. 

He doesn't remember ever being this angry in his entire life. It's a miracle that he isn't strangling someone. And just then, from somewhere behind him he hears that familiar voice yell ""Hey Jimmy!""

He loses it! This time, he doesn't even bother to turn his head to see who is yelling at him. Instead, with the fury of the sun, he yells back ""My name is NOT JIMMY!""",A guy goes to a boxing match. (long ...but worth it),1

I believe in the power of free speech, which is obviously why I am writing this letter. I also believe in the powerful tools of science and mathematics. I believe these tools can help people brainstorm some new inventions that can help humanity.

The reason why I am applying for this job is because I began to study the dismal science of economics. I began to realize that we have a highly corrupted, fundamentally and philosophically flawed monetary system that discriminates against poor people and causes an incredible amount of uncertainty in the lives of millions of people. I am going to spend my free time doing nothing about this problem, which of course is why I am applying for this job.

The big chief comes forward and says ""You have walked upon our sacred land and the penalty is death. However, we will spare you if you go out into the desert and find 8 of the same fruit and bring them back to us""

The three guys look at each other and figure they better give it a crack, so off they go.

The first guy cannot believe it, but obey he does and after squeezing in the 4th orange, he dies and goes to heaven.

I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.
Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.
I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).
Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.
My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.
After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.
My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.
Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.
But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.
A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised. But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.
It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.","Now that is valentine, I started thinking how close I came to actually f-ck my sister",1
