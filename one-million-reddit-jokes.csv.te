""No"", said the other Indian. ""It is mating time for us Indians and when you see a cave and holler, ""Woooooo! Woooooo! Woooooo!"", and get an answer back, that means that she is in there waiting for you.

At the very last minute, she realized that she didn't have any snails for the dinner party, so she asked her husband to run down to the beach with the bucket to gather some snails.

Very grudgingly he agreed. He took the bucket, walked out the door, down the steps, and out to the beach. As he was collecting the snails, he noticed a beautiful woman strolling alongside the water just a little further down the beach.

He kept thinking to himself, ""Wouldn't it be great if she would even just come down and talk to me?"" He went back to gathering the snails.

All of a sudden he looked up, and the beautiful woman was standing right over him. They started talking and she invited him back to her place. They ended up spending the night together. At seven o'clock the next morning he woke up and exclaimed, ""Oh no!!! My wife's dinner party!!!""

He gathered all his clothes, put them on real fast, grabbed his bucket, and ran out the door. He ran down the beach all the way to his apartment. He ran up the stairs of his apartment. He was in such a hurry that when he got to the top of the stairs, he dropped the bucket of snails. There were snails all down the stairs. The door opened just then, with a very angry wife standing in the door way wondering where he's been all this time.

He looked at the snails all down the steps, then he looked at her, then back at the snails and said, ""Come on guys, we're almost there!!""

It presence just bothers him sometimes.

""Soo..."", his Doctor says while examining Donalds parts. ""It looks quite unsettling, but if you don't mind I would suggest that this is perfectly fine as long your dont feel your virility is disstressed. Does it, if I may ask, Sir?"" ""Nooo, in no way my virility could be affected, Hank!"" Donald assures slightly alleviated. ""And by the way, please just call me Donald.""

As Donald leaves the doctor's office he is in a very good mood. He has three eggs in his ballsack and he just got the medical credential to it! He almost feels invincible and also a little cocky.

As he sees his old friend Bernie standing at the receptionist's he spontaneously offers a bet: ""Hey Bernie, I bet 300 Bucks that if we count our balls right now, we all together have five eggs in our ballsacks!""

My breath caught in my throat. 

I knew I should be afraid, but somehow I didn’t care.

His touch was so experienced, so sure.

When his hands moved up onto my thighs, I gave a slight shudder, and partly closed my eyes. 

My pulse was pounding.

I felt his knowing fingers caress my abdomen, my ribcage. 

And then, as he cupped my firm, full breasts in his hands, I inhaled sharply.

Probing, searching, knowing what he wanted, he brought his hands to my shoulders, slid them down my tingling spine and into my panties.

Although I knew nothing about this man, I felt oddly trusting and expectant.

A striking, beautiful german was captured by the Allied powers, and after a short trial (only 5 minutes long) she was condemned to die, by firing squad.

A squadron of french soldiers was given the task. The time has come. The Gaul captain prepared to give the order: MAKE READY!...TAKE AIM!...but before he could have uttered FIRE!, the teutonic beauty opened her mink coat that covered her perfect body and presented herself naked to all the soldiers present.

At the uncertain light of dawn, the figure of the most beautiful lady appeared to be more an alabaster statue than human flesh, her supple limbs, her perfect pair of breasts, marmol chalices so that you were able to drink in them the sweet love nectar, her...(Redaction note: our collaborator keeps describing the body and face of the captured spy for 6 more pages, so we were forced to redact it for brevity´s sake).

Seeing the striking image of the woman, the french soldiers, romantics like every Frenchman, refused to shoot at her. One of them declared: ""Beaute porte sa bourse"". Beauty carries its dower in its face, I would shoot my own wife before the demoiselle.

Seeing the failure of the soldiers of France, a second squad was called, this one composed of British. It was thought that the traditional British poise, along with the customs that ruled in Her Majesty army, would prevent them to fall in the seduction of that provocative woman.

Those who thought that were wrong: a second time, at the crucial time, the spy revealed her naked body beneath the garments and the British soldiers lowered their weapons upon seeing such beauty.

The judges were alarmed. Would they have to do the dirty deed? they havent even killed a rabbit in their lifetime. The oldest of the judges had a moment of insight: In Paris there was a group of Mexican Revolucionarios, in a goodwill mission. Perhaps they could take over the firing squad, if they greased their palms enough.

The Mexican squad was called and the idea was proposed. They responded that they were unable to take any money, for national pride, but if there was a large enough feast with champagne and some muchachas they would be willing to finish the job, the French accepted that deal, and the spy was taken again in front of the bloody wall. The Mexican Sargento yelled ""PREPAREN!""....the Mexican soldiers readied their weapons....""APUNTEN!"" seven rifles were pointed to the unlucky lady...and as always, the spy shook off her clothes...

There was a loud boom, and she fell to the floor, lifeless.

Everyone was surprised, not single soldier had shot his weapon, and yet the woman didnt even suffered the coup of grace.

the next day, the autopsy revealed: ""Tama riha, the spy, died after receiving the impact of seven pant buttons at high velocity to the chest"".

""I guess Joe, everything seems....""

Just then the big golden doors on the front of the basilica open, and the Pope walks out, toward their tailgate party.

""Oh, fuck this Joe, I'm outta here!""  Jerry sprints and hides in the bushes.

Jerry looks up, and sees the Pope walk up to Joe and make the sign of the cross.  Then the Pope turns around, walks back into the basilica, and the big golden doors close.

Jerry can't believe it.  

""Joe, you're here drinking beers and cooking food in the middle of St. Peter's Square, the Pope comes out, and he blesses you.  You really are world famous!""

""Nah, Jerry.  He didn't bless me.  He said (as he makes the sign of the cross), 'you, the barbecue, and the nigger in the bushes get the fuck outta here.'""",A Trip To the Vatican,6

The blonde figures there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, so she agrees. The lawyer asks, ""What's the distance from the Earth to the moon?""

The lawyer is puzzled. He uses his laptop to search for references. He taps into the air-phone with his modem and searches the Net and the library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends emails to his coworkers and friends. No luck. After an hour, he gives up.

He wakes the blonde and hands her $500 the blonde politely takes the $500 and turns away to get back to sleep.

Our mutual friend looks at both of us, chuckles when he sees his pals in the bar freaking out about apples. ""Alright bartender I want your finest....pussy""

""Uhhh, let me see what I can do""

The bartender goes into the back and not more than a minute later comes back and puts an apple on the bar ""Take a bite""

Our buddy takes a bite and immediately spits it out ""WHAT THE FUCK MAN THIS TASTE LIKE ASS""

The bar keep smiles and says...""Turn it around""


I'm sorry if it's not funny over text but this is my all time favorite joke to tell, I hope you guys enjoy it!",...and the bartender hands him an apple,152

Enamored with her, he asks if he can have sex with her. Naturally, she says no, and gets off the bus. The man goes to the bus driver and asks him if he knows of a way for him to have sex with the nun.
""Well,"" says the bus driver, ""every night at 8 o'clock, she goes to the cemetery to pray. If you dress up as God, I'm sure you could convince her to have sex with you.""
The man decides to try it, and dresses up in his best God costume. At eight, he sees the nun and appears before her.
""Oh, God!"" she exclaims. ""Take me with you!"" The man tells the nun that she must first have sex with him to prove her loyalty. The nun says yes, but tells him she prefers anal sex. Before you know it, they're getting down to it, having nasty, grunty, loud sex. After it's over, the man pulls off his God disguise.
""Ha, ha! I'm the man from the bus!""
""Ha, ha!"" says the nun, removing her costume. ""I'm the bus driver!""",The Bus Driver,80

The story goes a gentleman (our main character) picks up a few rounds of golf with some of the guys at the office once a week after work. On this particular evening a few rounds turned into a few more, and a few more, and (as most games do) a few more. Looking at the time, our protagonist has a sudden shock, he's late, beyond late. His wife will certainly break and burn his clubs after this one. So he makes like a tree and leaves.

It's beginning to pour rain as he's driving home, and on the side of the road he spot a damsel with her car broken down. He pulls over offers help, she asks for a ride home and so she can leave her car till after the rain calms down.

Having arrived at her house, she ask if he can come in to make sure everything is safe. He's really late to get home to his wife but she persists and he folds. After going in she offers him a drink to repay him for the ride, he insists that he must head home to his wife, she persists and he folds. There's no debate as the two begin embracing each other, tearing at each others clothes they enjoy the company of each other (to say the least). Now fast forward.

He's beyond late at this point, he's cheated on his wife, he doesn't know what he could possibly say to his wife to fix this. He decides he can't lie, he has to be honest with her. Walking into his house he finds the living room light on, his wife sitting in the arm chair, red in the face with fury as she's waiting to hear what he has to say. He comes clean, he explains the girl on the side of the road, explains that what he thought was a good deed became sour real quickly. His plea for forgiveness silences as he looks to her for a response, for a moment all is quiet. Suddenly she speaks...

post,4kunfs,2qh72,jokes,false,1464107603,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4kunfs/big_john/,self.jokes,,"A man moves from New York City to the heart of Texas and applies for a job as a bartender.

The owner of the bar says to the man, ""You know it's pretty rough around here, I'm not sure you could handle it, There's a stabbing about every night.""  

The man says he can handle himself, he's seen a lot, and in the big city he had to be tough.

The owner continues to warn the man, ""There's also a shooting about once per week...""

Again the City slicker assures the bar owner that he can handle himself and he's still interested in the job.

The owner agrees to put the man on and starts giving some instructions.

""This here bartop is solid oak and has been here for about a hundred years.  It's practically indestructible and has withstood all the barfights, shootings and stabbings.  When things get rough - and they *will get rough*, I just want you to hunker down behind the bar, stay safe and don't worry about any messes, I'll take care of everything.""

The man agrees and is excited about getting started.

Then the owner remembers one last thing.  

""One more thing, "", he says, "" if you ever hear someone say 'Big John is coming', you just get out of town as fast as you can, don't stick around, don't waste any time, just get out and get out fast!""

That seemed a little over cautious to the man but he agreed.

So weeks and months go by with the man doing a great job mixing drinks, talking to people and staying safe through all the shootings and stabbings.  He's got his routine down pat.

Then one night he hears someone yell, ""Big John's coming!"".

The man stops and thinks, trying to remember what he was supposed to do, and by the time he looks up, the bar is cleared out, nobody in sight.

The man goes to leave the bar, but he sees a **Gigantic** man heading right toward the bar.  The man is shirtless and muscular, riding a mountain lion and swinging a rattlesnake above his head.

Terrified, the man runs back into the bar and hunkers down behind the oak bar.

In bursts the big man, knocking the saloon doors off their hinges.  Gigantic booming footsteps shake the floor as he approaches the bar.  He peers over the bar and shouts at the bartender, ""WHISKEY!""

Shaking, the bartender finds a bottle of whiskey and nervously pours a shot for the big man.

The big man drinks the shot and slams the glass back down on the oak bar, and a crack starts to form in the bar.  

""THE BOTTLE!!"" shouts the big man, and the bartender hands it to him timidly."" 

The big man snatches the bottle, bites the neck off of it and swallows the glass, then drinks the entire bottle down and when he slammed the bottle on the bar it splinters into a million pieces leaving the bartender exposed.  

He looks up at the big man and manages to stutter out, ""C-Can I get you an- anything else...sir?""

The big man replied, ""NO! I gotta get outta town.  Big John's coming!""",Big John,234

So a man and his wife were having their 10th anniversary, and the wife decided she wants to spice things up a bit for her husband. In all the years they've been married, they've had nothing but boring missionary position sex. So that night after dinner, when they're getting ready for bed she says to him, 'Hunny, I love you and I want to give you whatever you want tonight, your wildest fantasies.' And the guy of course is like fuck yes I've been waiting for this for so fucking long, 'I wanna 69' 
So things get hot and heavy and they end up doing a lot of kinky shit that night, and 69'd repeatedly, all night long.
Now in the morning he wakes up to an alarm and a reminder on his phone- 'Dentist 11am' and he's like oh fuck , forgot all about that. He's running late but he's like damn, I really don't want him to smell anything on my breath, so he gets up and brushes his teeth 20 times, flossses a bunch and rinses with mouthwash. Hell he even drank some for safe measure. 
So he's at the dentist and the dentist has him leaned back in the chair, and he's bent over the top of him, right in his face, checking out his mouth when he suddenly straightens up. And he's like 'Look man, I've got a real personal question to ask you' 
And dudes like oh fuck, what what is it??
And the dentist says, 'Did you by chance 69 with your wife last night?'
And the guy says 'Oh man, how did you know?? Do I have a pube stuck in between my teeth, does my breath stink?? I flossed and brushed so many times!'

And the dentist is like, 'Nah man, your breath smells fine,
But your forehead smells like shit!!'",69 and the dentist,4

“So, what can I do for you?” the talent agent asks.

“Well”, says the father, “we believe we have something special, and we wanted to see what you thought of it.”

The talent agent mulls it over for a bit, and says, “Ok, show me what you got.”

Immediately, the father and the son start ripping each other’s clothes off and slapping each other in the balls. Once completely nude, they both get on the floor and start giving each other footjobs.
While this is happening, the mother and the daughter just go to town on each other. They shove each other’s tongues down their throats and start stripping as well. They also get on the floor, but they start 69’ing each other.

The father and the son up their footjob game, and go at such a speed that both their feet and their penises are mere blurs. Once they accomplish this, the son loosens his butthole and expels a nine-inch dildo out of his ass with such force that it gets partially lodged into his father’s asshole.

“Dangnabbit, boy” says the father. He takes the dildo out of his own ass and loosens his own anal sphincter – afterwards, he farts out two belts.

The father and the son then both slide towards the dildo until it’s evenly lodged up both their asses and their balls touch. All the while, they’re still giving each other furious footjobs. They then take the belts and tighten them around each other’s throats, until both of them can barely breathe. All the while, they’re shitting extreme diarrhea onto the dildo and moving it back and forth between them.
The mother and daughter, on the other hand, are upping their 69’ing game. They start biting down hard on each other’s pussies, and moving their mouths up and down and left and right while exerting a considerable amount of pressure on each other’s vaginas. Naturally, they draw blood. The blood from their vaginas starts filling up the other’s mouth, and they get to work on expanding the other person’s buttholes. 

They start with one finger and decide to cut out the middlemen, and just start shoving both fists into each other’s butts until they make them the size of baseballs.

The father and the son get super hard from all their experienced pleasure, and start pissing. The piss streams rise, then fall into each other’s mouths. Then, they ejaculate. The cum from their penises land on each other’s forehead and noses. They quickly remove the shit-covered dildo and the cum-and-piss covered belts from their bodies, and rush over to the ladies.

The mother and the daughter are done expanding each other’s assholes, and get up to meet the father and the son. They pour the pussy blood from their mouths onto the faces of the father and the son – the mother gives her daughter’s blood to the father, and the daughter does likewise to the son. The mother and the daughter then  get on their heads, with their gaping assholes facing up into the air and having their arms and each other’s bodies supporting one another. The father and the son use the belts to tie the two together, to further support them.

The father and the son then scoop the cum from their faces into their mouths, and pour the collective accumulation of blood, piss, and cum into both the mother and the daughter’s gaping assholes. The father pours his collection into the mother, and the brother does likewise to the daughter. They then take the diarrhea-covered dildo and proceed to mix the contents of the event using the females’ assholes as the bowls and the shit-covered dildo as a stirrer. Once they’re done, they shove the dildo into the mother and daughter’s mouths and force the girls to deepthroat it. The father and the son then take out a straw from both the mother and the daughter, and proceed to drink the concoction out from their respective female’s asshole, all the while singing “yummy, yummy, choc’ly milk!” over and over again.

The talent agent, shocked, just sits there for a few minutes. Finally, he’s regained his composure and is able to speak again. “My, that’s really something you've got there. What do you call it?”

The father and son stop singing and drinking, look into the agent’s eyes, and say: “The Aristocrats!”

I respond, surprised how this day is turning out. So we go to lunch, and one thing leads to another, and we're eventually calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend. A couple months later, another girl moves in. She's cute, but not the best. I'd say a solid 7. So, I offer her some help. Moving in, and she thanks me profusely. After moving g a couple boxes, I see some that are full of video game stuff. I ask "" Are these your boyfriends?"" ""No, they're mine"" she responds. I'm surprised, as you don't often see girl gamers. Especially this hardcore. So, we hang out, as we have similar interests. I'm talking to my girl one night, after playing some Diablo III with the other girl, and she says that she's jealous. I'm like, what???? What world are you living in for a nine like you to be jealous about some one like me??? But, I dont say that. I say ""Look, we're both very similar, and if you like me, I'm sure you'd like her, so just talk to her, and maybe we can all hang out."" So she goes, and when she comes back, she looks traumatized. ""Okay, you are never talking to that girl AGAIN. As soon as I walked in, she started screaming, and saying how your hers, and threatened to kill me."" ""What?"" I reply ""There's no way that's her, look, I'll talk to her in the morning Okay?"" So we say our good nights, and I go home.I wake up, and knock on her door, she doesn't answer. So I go to my girls house, and she doesn't answer either. This continues for a couple days. One day, while watching the news, I see the 7 girl, in handcuffs. The news reporter goes on to say how she murdered someone. She shows the image, and that girl, is my girlfriend, and it looks like, there are chunks of her missing, like someone ate her. I start freaking out, and the news show goes back to her "" She's dead, you're next. She's dead, you're next"" and she keeps repeating that to the camera. I quickly turn it off, as her lines repeat over and over. She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next. SHE'S DEAD, YOU'RE NEXT. SHE'S DEAD, YOU'RE NEXT! Its screaming in my brain, and the only thing I could think of was, Why was six afraid of seven?

Announce that you are the great Mandini, renowned magician and you are going to turn this light bulb (display it) into a peach!

Invite a female in the audience to be your ""assistant."" Do a little dialogue with her so that your audience knows that she knows nothing about your magic  or your illusions.

You: ""I will now place the lightbulb under this mysterious cloth."" (flourish the cloth and drape it over the lightbulb) "" and I and my assistant will grab the lightbulb at the same time so you know there isn't any hijinx.""

""Now I am going to remove my hand from the lightbulb and it is going to be up to my assistant to hold it tightly while I perform the magic to turn it into a peach.""

""See, I am going to gather up the ends of this cloth (cluster together the hanging draped ends) and my assistant is going to slowly twist and twirl the bulb. As she twists, you can see there is absolutely no way that the bulb can escape.""

At some point, the twisting will create a crude pink cylinder of cloth with a bulbous end. You keep up the banter with the assistant. ""Is the bulb still there?... Grip it tightly now.""

Suddenly you take your end of the cloth, gently stretch it and place it in your groin area, while your assistant holds the bulb end, and you turn to your audience and say...

post,4krld3,2qh72,jokes,false,1464055976,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4krld3/there_once_was_a_man_named_yuri/,self.jokes,,"Yuri had lived in Russia all of his life, in a small town near Moscow. The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.

Every day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, ""SWIMMING LESSONS"" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.

Yuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, ""If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough..."" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.

Every day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri's.

A few months had passed, and Yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.

Later that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words ""DIVING PRACTICES"" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles.

Yuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.

The practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.

Many people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. ""It is only something I am fond of, a hobby"" Yuri would say. ""I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy."" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.

For yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. ""TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!"" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.

Yuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.

Finally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. ""It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life..."" Yuri would always respond to his fans.

One day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. ""Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!"" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, ""And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!"" Yuri replied, ""Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.""

Yuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.

Unfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. ""Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!"" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.

""It is OK, everybody"" Yuri yelled back. ""I have endured many hardships in my life.""",There once was a man named Yuri,132

Captain Grapje spent the rest of the war as a chaplain, giving spiritual aid to soldiers, both Allied and enemy.  After the war, he became a priest, serving as a missionary in Africa, piloting his own plane (in spite of his handicap) to villages across the continent.  


 
In 1997, Father Grapje was serving in Zimbabwe when an explosion in a silver mine caused a cave-in.  Archbishop Grapje went down into the mine to administer last rights to those too severely injured to move.  


 
Another shaft collapsed, and he was buried for three days, suffering multiple injuries, including the loss of his right eye.  The high silver content in the mine's air gave him purpura, a life-long condition characterized by purplish skin blotches.  


 
Although Cardinal Grapje devoted his life to the service of God as a scholar, mentor, and holy man, church leaders agree: he will never ascend to the Papacy.  


 
And who can blame them?

The Italian is the first to go. He approaches a nearby tree and, with all the honor he can muster, tries to hang himself with his belt. However, he grossly underestimated its strength. Twisting, shouting, and asking the German for help, he eventually ends up hanging upside down, his face bloody and, although he put in the effort, he just didn't get the desired results. As ordered, Russians begin to skin him and move on to the next prisoner.

Next was the German. He produces a pistol from his belt and, full of pomp and circumstance, goosesteps behind the tree line. The Ruskis wait for the gunshot and are rewarded. But when they check behind the tree line to retrieve the body, they find none. They shrug, thinking that there's no way he could possibly have run off to some place warmer. But with one less skin and winter approaching, they move on to next prisoner. 

Last is the Japanese. Stoic to the end, he gets on his knees and draws his sword. Plunging it into his gut and twisting it every which way, he never even flinches.

The man approaches the barman and says ""Hey, what's up with the guy with the big orange head?"", to which the barman replies ""Buy him a drink and he'll tell you his story"". So he does, and he sits beside the man with the big orange head and he starts telling his story.

""One day"", he says, ""I was walking along the beach and I found this ornate lamp. Rubbing it with my sleeve, out emerged a genie. The genie boomed ""You have freed me from my infernal restraints, I shall grand you three wishes"".

""So first off, I said ""I'd like to be married to the most beautiful woman in the world"", and sure enough the waves by the shore parted, and out walked this stunning blonde with a diamond the size of a football on her finger. Secondly, I requested ""I want to never have any lack of money in my life"", and pulling out my wallet, saw that it was bursting with money. Any attempt at removing a twenty resulted in it being magically replaced seconds later.""

At this point, the man is confused: ""I didn't understand, this seems like a good situation to be in: beautiful wife, rich as kings, why are you so down in the dumps?""

""Ah"", replied the man with the big orange head, ""This is where things took a turn for the worst. ""For my next wish"", I said, ""Can I have a huge fucking orange head?""""",The Man With The Big Orange Head,2

The old man softly replied, ""Do you have any cigarettes?""

The passenger, terrified, looked at the driver and said, ""He wants a cigarette.""

""Well, give him a cigarette! HURRY!!"" the driver replies.

So he fumbles around with the pack and hands the old man a cigarette and yells to the driver, ""Step on it!!!"", rolling up the window in terror.

Now going about 80 miles an hour, they calm down, and they start laughing again, and the passenger says, ""What do you think of that?""

The driver replies, ""I don't know. How could that be? I am going pretty fast.""

Then all of a sudden AGAIN there is a knock, and there is the old man again.

""Aaaaaaaaaaaaah, there he is again!"" the passenger yells.

""Well, see what he wants now!"" yells back the driver.

He rolls down the window a little ways and shakily says, ""Yes?""

""Do you have a light?"" the old man quietly asks.

The driver throws a lighter out the window at him and rolls up the window and yells, ""STEP ON IT!""

They are now going about 100 miles an hour and still guzzling beer, trying to forget what they had just seen and heard, when all of a sudden again there is more knocking!

""OH MY GOD! HE'S BACK!""

The passenger rolls down the window and screams in stark fear, ""WHAT DO YOU WANT?""

The old man replies, ""You want some help getting out of the mud?""",There was a beer party out in the woods,171

The captain - a buccaneer known the world over for his utter lack of mercy, his terrible greed, and his hearty girth - lumbers off of the ship and, as per tradition, makes a beeline for the nearest hard-hitting watering hole.

Upon stepping into the tavern, he is immediately greeted by the barkeep, who is a close friend of his. ""Captain!"" the man cries out in delight, ""It's wonderful to see ye again in these waters, ol' boy!""

He puts down the clay mug that he's wiping and walks towards his friend, arms open wide in welcome.

However, before he gets close enough to embrace his customer, he doubles back in shock, almost tripping over a table behind him. ""Fuck!"" he yelps, ""What happened to yer leg, man?!""

The pirate captain looks down at the wooden pole stretching from his right knee and shakes his head in memory. ""Aye,"" he replies solemnly, ""That's a story, that is. Me 'n me crew, we're sailin' off the shore of Montego Bay with a hull full o' fresh Jamaican slaves when a heavily armed merchant vessel comes right up to our starboard side, tellin' us that we've gotta let go of our cargo 'cause we've got their employer in there. But we ain't lettin' go of one slave, no way, so we tell 'em to fuck off or we'll send 'em right down to ol' Davy, but no, they don't listen. In fact, they fucking fire one of their cannons as a warnin' shot, and it fuckin' blows me leg clean off!""

""Golly!"" the barkeep gasps, ""That must've been right bloody painful!""

""It sure was. But we showed 'em, we did. They took me leg, but I'm an honest man, ye see, I don't go back on me word. So we sent 'em right down to 'ol Davy.""

""Masterful work, captain!"" the barkeep applauds. However, he quickly goes quiet again, his eyes moving from the peg leg to...

""But captain,"" he says, ""What happened to yer hand?""

The pirate looks down at the hook curving from his severed wrist and shakes his head in memory. ""Aye,"" he replies solemnly, ""That's a story, that is. Me 'n me crew, we were sailing 'cross the Moru Passage when another crew, one of 'em bastard Welsh sons o' sea-cucumbers that dare call 'emselves buccaneers, and they go on demandin' our booty. MY booty! The fuckin' gall! D'you have any idea what we had to go through to get that there treasure? So we tell 'em to fuck off, or we'll pin their gizzards to the masts, but no, they don't listen! They just go right on an' board us, and one of 'em ninnies chops me hand off with that puny cutlass of his!""

""Golly!"" the barkeep gasps again, ""That must've been right bloody painful!""

""It sure was. But we showed 'em, we did. They took me hand, but I'm an honest man, ye see, I don't go back on me word. So we cut 'em right up and pinned their gizzards to the masts.""

""Masterful work, captain!"" the barkeep applauds once more. However, he quickly goes quiet again, his eyes moving from the hook to...

""But captain,"" he says, ""What happened to yer eye?""

The pirate touches the patch covering his empty socket and shakes his head in memory. ""Aye,"" he says, ""That's a story, that is. A bird shat in me eye.""

The barkeep is taken aback. ""A bird shat in yer eye?""

""Aye,"" the pirate captain replies.

He knows however, that Chancellor Bismarck will strike no easy bargain and will demand steep cessions from the French.  Thinking frantically as the peace talks approach, Napoleon finally comes up wth an idea.  He sends a telegram to Bismarck stating that in the interest of mutual friendship between the two nations, he will grant Prussia’s ambassador any request of French territory desired, but only the first request and no others.  

Bismarck is ecstatic, knowing that he has truly struck a master blow and gained glory for Prussia for generations to come.  He dispatches a young ambassador to Paris with instructions to request all of Burgundy, Dijon, and Normandy for Prussian annexation.  

The ambassador arrives in Paris and treats with the French delegation, and is about to make the formal Prussian request when Napoleon interrupts him.  “My friend,” he says.  “I can tell that you are earnest and talented, and I believe that Herr Bismarck may indeed intend for you to be his successor upon his death.  In the interest of the future of relations between our nations I will give you a most wonderful gift, but you must take it or leave it before you make Bismarck’s request.  Afterwards I cannot grant it.  There lives a woman in a small village here in France, a most beautiful woman with breasts so ample and soft that men forget their names upon seeing them, a smile so charming it makes men’s hearts sing, and the ability to give pleasure in a way to make men scream in ecstasy.  I had the fortune of lying with her for a day and I tell you, the experience is the height of human pleasure. If you are a worthy man I will take you to her.” 

The young ambassador is torn between doing Bismarck’s bidding immediately and the prospect of such immense pleasure, but since Napoleon had assured the Chancellor that any request would be granted, he figures he has nothing to lose and accepts Napoleon’s offer.  

“A good choice my friend,” continues Napoleon.  “Like I told you this woman is beautiful, with ample breasts and an alluring smile, and the ability to pleasure a man in such a way to make him scream like the harpy in ecstasy.  Truly she is the pride of all France.  As Emperor I cannot simply allow an unworthy man to be with her.  But prove your worth and I shall take you to her, I promise you this.  At the top of Mont Blanc there is a man named Alphonse, who was one of my officers and who also had the pleasure of knowing this girl.  After being with her he knew that he would experience no greater pleasure in his lifetime, and so became an ascetic hermit atop the highest mountain.  If you are worthy then go to him, tell him I sent you, and ask him the name of this woman, the jewel of France with breasts so ample and soft that men forget their names upon seeing them, a smile so charming it makes men’s hearts sing, and the ability to give pleasure in such a way to make men scream in ecstasy and give up worldly existence.  Ask this of Alphonse and bring me his answer, and I will bring you to her.” 

The young ambassador rushes out of the Elysee Palace, to climb Mont Blanc and learn the name of this incredible woman.  Days go by, then weeks.  Napoleon begins to fear that he sent the young Prussian to his grave.  Finally nearly a month later, the young ambassador stumbles back into the Palace, bedraggled and frostbitten.  Panting to catch his breath, the young man is finally able to summon the strength to give his answer to Napoleon and the French.

post,4kpbom,2qh72,jokes,false,1464027275,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4kpbom/a_horse_is_watching_mtv/,self.jokes,,"As he is watching, a music video for ""Purple Haze"" by Jimi Hendrix comes on. The horse gals in love with the song. Then, he explores more of Jimi Hendrix's discography and soon enough he's a full on Jimi Hendrix fan.

After some time of being a Hendrix fan, the horse is inspired to be a guitarist. He gets all the money he has and buys a low-end used Stratocaster.

He begins to learn how to play, and quickly enough, he knows how to play every Jimi Hendrix song. He can play every riff flawlessly.

Then the horse decides, ""This isn't enough"". He wants to start a band. He had heard about this chicken who is an absolute beast at bass. So he finds the chicken and he asks him to join him. The chicken, who has a deep passion for music, accepts gladly. The chicken begins to listen to Jimi Hendrix, and soon enough, he can play the bass of every song perfectly.

But the two needed more band members. There is an older cow on the farm who used to play drums. They ask him, ""Would you like to join our band?"" But the cow seemed sad. The cow said, ""I would love to, but I sold my drums some time ago."" The horse and chicken decide to buy a drum set for the cow. After they presented him with the drum set, the cow jumped with joy. Nostalgia running through his veins, he gets on the drums and rips it. The rumors were true; the cow was a legendary drummer. Flattered by the horse and chicken's efforts, the cow couldn't help but join the band. The cow began to listen to Jimi Hendrix, and could play every one of his songs in no time.

Now they have three amazing musicians, but something was missing: vocals. None of them could sing. The chicken then remembers a pig from college who used to be in music class with him. After much searching, they found the pig's whereabouts; it was a farm only 10 miles north! They travel to the other farm and find the pig. He is working on the field in his farm. They ask him, ""We're starting a band, but none of us can sing. Would you like to join us?"" The pig looks at the ground under him, and then at his dirty hooves. He tells them, ""Since I was a boy, my dream had always been to have a career in music. How I ended up here, I don't know. I'll join, because a career in music is my dream. No matter the risks, I'm on board."" And so, the pig joined, and listened to Jimi Hendrix, and learned every lyric to every Jimi Hendrix song.

Thus started the beginning of the Barnyard Bros. At first, they were just a Jimi Hendrix cover band. They received a nice, modest following of fans. They could emulate the Jimi Hendrix Experience flawlessly. The resemblance was uncanny. They were started to get the ball rolling.

Then the horse, the one who started it all, said again, ""This isn't enough"". They decided that if they were going to be big, it had to be their own music they were playing. They started to write their own music, and eventually recorded their first studio album. And everyone loved it. Their fan base was growing faster then they could ever imagine. Their album has sold over a million copies. Number 1 on iTunes. Number 1 on Google Play. Number 1 played album on Spotify. They were everywhere. They were the most popular band in the world.

The horse's old farmer gets a call. It's from Jimmy Kimmel's manager. Kimmel wants them on the show. The farmer calls up the horse and tells him of this opportunity. The horse is ecstatic. He and his band get to be on TV! What the horse did not know is that his farmer is a huge Jimmy Kimmel fan. It's been his dream to attend the show, but he hasn't had the finances to do so. He asks the horse, ""Please, can you find it in your heart to take me?"" The horse loved his farmer very much. His farmer was the one who gave him his job. Had it not been for that job, he would have never got that guitar, never started a band, and never would have been in the position he was in. The horse then agrees to take the farmer to see Jimmy Kimmel, and decides to give a little more. An all expenses paid, week long trip to LA, so the farmer can enjoy the city after he goes to the show.

The horse flies to LA a week before the rest to finalize the deal. He meets with Kimmel and his manager and sings the deal. It's official; the Barnyard Bros will be on the Jimmy Kimmel show.

The rest of the band and the farmer get on their flight to LA. But tragedy strikes. An engine fails. The plane is losing stability, but can still fly. In a few minutes, the other engine begins failing. The plane begins to plummet. The plane nose dives into the ground and crashes. There are no survivors. Everyone, the chicken, the cow, the pig, and the farmer, gone.

The horse hears about the news, and begins to break down in tears. ""This is my fault."" he said to himself. The horse blamed himself for their deaths because he had started this band. They wouldn't be on that plane if he hadn't had the stupid idea to get the band together and go on the Kimmel show. He cancelled his appointment to be on the Jimmy Kimmel Show, as the Barnyard Bros were no more.

The horse, seeing as his friends were no longer alive, decides that he doesn't deserve to live either. He buys a bottle of oxycodone. His idea is to just overdose and end his life. He goes to a bar in LA and asks for the drink with the most alcohol. The bartender looks at the horse. The horse is visibly upset. Now the bartender is a nice guy. He doesn't like seeing people in a bad mood and always does his best to help.

So the bartender approaches the horse, and asks him, ""Hey, why the long face?""",A horse is watching MTV...,105

So one day the father was taking the kid to the mall for a haircut, they walk out the door and the father suddenly remembers he forgot his keys. 

He forgets him and his SO's idea and says ""Shit! I forgot my keys"" the kid is surprised by this word and asks for its meaning the father replies ""uhhh, it means doormat, Yeah! Doormat like this one."" He pointed at the Doormat next to their house's entrance, afterwards the father got his keys and they were on the road.

While they were driving the father drove faster than the speed limit by a few kph, he hears sirens, looks behind and sees a Cop telling him to pull over. The man tries to reason with the Cop, but he's not having none of it and gives him a ticket. The father mutters ""Bastard!"" Under his breath, and the son promptly asks what that word means the father thinks up something quickly, and nervously replies ""It uhh, means Police officer.."" 

After the kid had gotten his haircut, and is driven home by his father, he goes to see what his mom's cooking in the kitchen.

He walks into his mother cutting some chicken breasts, and surprised her by yelling out ""Hi mom!"" She jumps up and cuts her finger while shouting ""Oh F*ck"" multiple times, and as usual the kid asks what that word means, his mother says ""It means cutting, Yeah cutting..."" the kid gladly takes that answer and leaves his mother, because she seems busy bleeding out...

He sees his dad start to shave his beard, and he seems really focused on the task at hand. So naturally, the kid screams ""Hi Dad!"" As loud as he could, causing his father to ruin his perfect goatee. The father engulfed with anguish says ""Oh balls! It's ruined."" The kid asks what that means, and his father let's out a sigh, probably asking himself why he's doing this in the first place, he responds ""Ohh, balls? It means beard.."" the son is sorta unsure about it, but takes it as middle aged man slang...

While both parents are busy with their predicaments, someone knocks on their door. The kid answers and it's the Cop from earlier, so he proceeded to greet him, ""Hey, bastard! Wipe you feet on shit.""
The Cop is taken back by this but decides to just ignore the kid, since he probably doesn't know what he's talking about. He asks ""Hey kid, are any of your parents here?"" The kid replies ""Yeah, my mom is f*cking the chicken, and my father is shaving his balls...""",A kid'a parents didn't want him to learn bad words...,65

At least he was honest by calling himself a stalker, so there was a Kernel of truth in his Corny joke.


No responsibility is taken in the damage to your faith in humanity after reading these puns. No Corn was harmed in the making of these jokes. 90% of people reading this have now read more fake legal junk than real legal junk in a terms of service.

""Good morning sir.  I am a Jehova's Witness, do you have time to speak about our Lord?""  

The man didn't have any plans until later that afternoon, and so he answered ""Sure, come in.""

The man shows the young man to the living room and gestures to the couch while he goes and gets 2 cups of coffee. The man returns and sits down, and gives the young man one of the cups.  

""Well son, what did you want to tell me about?""  the man asks.

The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story.
Little Suzy raises her hand. ""My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.""
When the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, ""Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.""
Little Lucy went next. ""My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.""
Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.
Lucy replied, ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch.""
Next up was little Johnny. ""My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""
The teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.
""Well,"" Johnny replied, ""Don't f**k with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.""",A LESSON IN MORALS,6
