The train was quite crowded, and a U. S. Marine walked the entire length looking for a seat, but the only seat left was taken by a well dressed, middle-aged, French woman's poodle.

The war-weary Marine asked, 'Ma'am, may I have that seat?' The French woman just sniffed and said to no one in particular 'Americans are so rude. My little Fifi is using that seat.'

The Marine walked the entire train again, but the only seat left was under that dog.

'Please, ma'am. May I sit down? I'm very tired.'

She snorted, 'Not only are you Americans rude, you are also arrogant!'
This time the Marine didn't say a word; he just picked up the little dog, tossed it out of the train window, and sat down.

The woman shrieked, 'Someone must defend my honour! This American should be put in his place!'

Tragic, especially considering they didn’t exactly spend their days helping old ladies cross the street or volunteering at the Boys and Girls club. Nope, these fellows went straight to Hades.
The Devil, as is his custom, goes to greet his two newest eternal residents, and despite rivers of lava and torrents of brimstone, they’re standing around in jackets.
“Not hot enough for you?” asked the Devil.
“What, this? Nah, this is like a Spring day in Toronto.”

The Devil doesn’t take lightly to such a slight, so he decides to really turn things up. The renewed eternal hellfire and inferno has made the screams of the tormented souls in hell even louder. Rivers of lava overflowing their banks. The Devil goes to check on his two Torontonians, and sure enough he sees them lounging in shorts and t-shirts.
“Not hot enough for you?” the devil queries bewilderedly.
“What, this? Nah, this is like a July in Toronto. In fact, I think the humidity was worse in the summer of ’96.”

The Devil is even more incensed. He comes up with a new idea. Turn the thermostat way down. The cursed souls in Hell are greeted by new but equally unbearable type of torture. The lava stops flowing, brimstone stops glowing, and wouldn’t you know it, the ground they stand on has frozen solid.

The Devil again searches out his two Torontonians, and to his dismay, they’re hugging and cheering.
“What’s this all about!?” the Devil roared.
“THEY’VE DONE IT, IT’S FINALLY HAPPENED, THE LEAFS WON THE STANLEY CUP!!!”

Now watch the Leafs turn things around, win the cup, and make me look like a jerk for saying this.",Two Torontonians die in a car accident.,4

As he neared a lake, he came across a very large male beaver sitting at the water’s edge.

He realized he’d left his gun at home and so he couldn’t shoot the magnificent creature.

Out of habit he raised his cane, aimed it at the animal as if it were his favorite hunting rifle and went bang bang.

Miraculously, two shots rang out and the beaver fell over dead.

Now, what do you think of that? asked the doctor.

Apart from that, all goes well and he has to go back to the recruiters afterwards, who are very satisfied with his job. They agree to hire him, but can't resist the urge to ask, why he brought so many condoms in his backpack.

He tells the new manager that each time he runs into a crisis that he cannot solve to open an envelope, starting with the first one, and follow the instructions inside.

For the first couple of months, everything seemed to be moving smoothly for the new manager until some issues with production developed and his division began to underperform. Trying to figure out what to do, he went to the envelopes and opened the first one. The note inside said: ""Blame everything on your predecessor since he's gone and isn't here to defend himself."" So the new manager blames the present problems on the previous operations manager and everything works out.

About a year into the job, something causes the poducts to have defects which then causes a dip in sales for the company. Not knowing how to solve this problem, the manager goes to his desk and opens the second envelope. The note says: ""Reorganize."" So the manager reorganizes his division and the company recovers.

Another year goes by when a shortage of raw materials causes the cost of production to sky rocket and the manager can no longer stay on budget while meeting his production quota. Unable to think of a solution, he goes and opens the third and final envelope. In it was a note with instructions that read: ""Prepare three envelopes.""",A newly hired operations manager spends a week with the outgoing operations manager in order to learn his new duties and responsibilities.,13

""Do you need a one day camel or a two day camel?""

The guy thinks for a second and says, ""The place I'm going is a three day trip. Do you have any camels that can make it that far?""

And the guy who runs the place says, ""You need a bricked camel.""

""What's a bricked camel?""

And the renter guy says, ""Follow the camel handler.""

So the guy who runs the camel rental calls the camel handler, who picks up two bricks and starts heading past the camels. As he walks he explains.

""These smaller ones are the one day camels. These bigger ones EPSTEIN DIDNT KILL HIMSELF standing to them are the two day camels, that of course means they can last two whole days crossing the desert without water.""

And the guy who needs a camel asks, ""Where's your three days camels?""

""You don't keep three day camels in stock,"" said the camel handler, ""You have to make one.""

""How the heck do you do that?""

And the camel handler tells the guy to be quiet. There was a huge two day camel at the moment taking a drink of water. The camel handler snuck up on the camel from behind with his two bricks. Then without warning he claps the two bricks together right on the camel's ballsack. And as the camel is drinking he goes;

The letter read:

Dear God,
I am an 83 year old widow, living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had £100 in it, which was all the money I had until my next pension cheque.
Next Sunday is Christmas, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner.
Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with. I have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope.
Can you please help me?
Sincerely,
Edna

The postal worker was touched. He showed the letter to all the other workers. Each one dug into his or her wallet and came up with a few pounds. By the time he made the rounds, he had collected £96, which they put into an envelope and sent to the woman.

The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of Edna and the dinner she would be able to share with her friends.
Christmas came and went.

A few days later, another letter came from the same old lady to God.
All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened.
It read:


Dear God, 
How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your gift of love, I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day and I told my friends of your wonderful gift.

By the way, there was £4 missing.

When I joined the Navy, I got stationed at the submarine base in San Diego. The captain of my submarine asked that all the new recruits meet with him the first morning at 6am. 

So the first morning we all arrived at 6am and one new recruit named Bob walked up and handed the captain starbucks and elmer’s glue. We all thought it was really weird but at the end of the day, the captain declared that Bob would be in charge of all the other recruits the next day and they should meet with Bob at 6am. 

So the second day we all arrived at 6am and another new recruit named Jim walked up and handed Bob starbucks and elmer’s glue. Sure enough, at the end of the day, the captain announced that Bob had been promoted and that the next day Jim would be in charge and all the new recruits should meet with Jim at 6am the next day. 

So the third day about half of the recruits brought Jim starbucks and elmer’s glue. At the end of the day the captain announced that Jim had been promoted and all those recruits that brought starbucks and glue to Jim would get first picks of the bunks for our next deployment. 

I was really ticked, so I went to the Captain’s office and asked him what the hell the deal was. He looked up at me and said, “On this particular sub, the only real way to get good Karma is to use coffee and paste.”",When I joined the Navy,4

  Steve the intern, not quite yet knowing how to climb the corporate, quietly chuckles as he hands Calvin His coffee. 

“What’s so funny?” Asks Calvin. 

Steve shakes his head and smirks while retorting “Joel McHale?” Steve puffs his chest out just a little, raises his chin, and barks out just loud enough for everyone to hear “why, I had breakfast with Robert Downey Jr. just this morning!” 

Calvin rolls his eyes and clasps his hands, and leans back into his chair. 

“Perhaps you would be better seen and not heard, lest you make a fool of yourself, you make quite large claims.”

“No, really. There’s not a person in this world who doesn’t know me.”

Calvin throws back his head and laughs. 

“Really now? Would you be able to arrange, well..... I don’t know, after work drinks with tiger woods?”

Steve dips out of the room, “just a moment” he calls out. After a minute he steps back in. “Tonight at 6:30.” Steve says. 

Lo and behold they get to the bar and tiger woods is there to greet them. 

“I don’t believe it!” Remarks Calvin. “I bet you 10 grand that you can’t get the queen of England on the line!”

Steve smirks, and whips out his hand Nokia. He steps away, and two minutes later he comes back. “The queen of England is quite busy,” Steve begins to say, “Ha! I knew you couldn’t get a hold of her!” Interrupts Calvin.

“Patience,” Steve says, “she can only meet us for tea tomorrow,” he continues. Calvins jaw drops. Steve raises an eyebrow and says “I’ll take the 10 grand in cash. 

Sure enough, teas time the next day a helicopter arrives, and the queen of England steps off just as Calvin hands a briefcase. 

“Fuck this” Calvin shouts, “you know what? Double or nothing I want to see you with the pope!”

“Not an issue.” Steve calmly says while whipping out his phone. 10 minutes later flights were booked to Italy. 

Fast forward a little bit, and Steve is on the balcony with the pope. 

All of the sudden Steve the intern  spots a commotion in the crowd. He rushes down to see Calvin being rushed into ambulance. 

“Calvin! What happened??!” Steve asked.

“Well I was doing fine up until this guy behind me tapped me on the shoulder and asked me who was the guy on the balcony next to Steve!”","(Long) Calvin was sitting in a board meeting, and as everyone was sitting down the usual humble bragging begins.",3

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. 

However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the ...bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.

The Agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist from Harvard to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. 

The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. 

They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike""",The Highways Agency found over 200 dead crows on the A90 near Boston recently,75

Finally when he grew up, he achieved his goal and became the conductor of the Happytown train. He was so excited to conduct the train that he decided to see how fast he can go. He went faster and faster until the train derailed and killed one person. Bob was taken to trial and was found guilty of murder, sentenced to death by electric chair. 

Now Happytown was no ordinary town. They strongly believed in religion. This caused the town’s special rule: if a person survives the electric chair for fifteen minutes straight, it is considered divine intervention and they are free to go. 

So Bob is sent to the electric chair. The executioner offers him his final meal. Bob asks for a single banana. Then, the executioner hooks Bob up to the electric chair and turns it on. Fifteen minutes goes by and Bob is still alive and well, so he is let go. 

Two days later, Bob manages to get his job back as conductor for the Happytown train. Just like before, he decides to see how fast he could go.  He goes faster and faster until the train derails once again, killing two people this time. He is arrested and sentenced to murder and death by the electric chair. 

Bob shows up to the chair and is offered his last meal by the executioner again. This time, Bob asks for two bananas. He eats the bananas and the the executioner turns on the chair. Low and behold, fifteen minutes later, Bob had not yet come even close to death. The executioner let him go and Bob went on his way. 

Around a week goes by and Bob manages to get his job back as the conductor (Happytown must have been really desperate for train conductors to hire him once again). Just like the last two times, Bob goes too fast and details the train, killing three people. He is arrested and sentenced to murder and death by electric chair. 
When Bob arrived for his execution, he asked for three bananas for his final meal, but the Executioner recognized him and was annoyed. The executioner told Bob “I’ve had enough of this. I’m not just gonna let you get by murdering people again  and again, so I’m not letting you have your magic bananas that somehow keep you alive.” The executioner then attached Bob to the chair without giving him his bananas and turned the chair on. 

Fifteen minutes goes by and Bob is still sitting there as if nothing is going on. Astounded, the Executioner stares at Bob and exclaims, “How are you doing this?”

Bob replies, “The bananas have nothing to do with it. I’m just a really bad conductor.”

""Why don't you ever do something like that? You are boring as hell!""

The boy was very upset about this, but there wasn't much he could do. He had no car, no money to buy one and no job to earn money. He told his girlfriend that everything would be alright in a few weeks, he would find a job and get a car and they would go for trips together. The girl didn't believe a word about this, but she felt that she was upsetting him and stopped accusing him.

A few weeks passed. The boy had actually found a job. He had started working at funeral service. One day after work, he texted his girlfriend that he was going to pick her up and that she should get ready. The girl grew curious about this, so she quickly dressed up and started waiting for him. 

After a few minutes, a funeral coach arrived and parked in front of the girl's house. The girl was shocked, but then recognized her boyfriend's face, smiling with confidence. He lowered the windows: 

- You asked for a car right? So where are we going?  
- I don't know... I don't quite like this 'car' of yours.  
-  What do you mean you don't like it? People are dying to ride one of these!

post,dyij2l,2qh72,jokes,false,1574158129,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dyij2l/the_tiny_kingdom/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, there was a tiny kingdom.  Tiny holdings, tiny castle, tiny population.  Everything was tiny.  


Except the aspirations of the King.  


The King wanted more.  More land, more power, more everything.  


One day, he heard a tale about a neighboring kingdom.  This kingdom had everything this King wanted.  And he had learned that it was all the result of a magic throne held in the other King's castle.  


Oh, how the King wanted that throne for his own.  


So one day, he assembled all of his knights, and their servants, to go and steal the throne for him.  


(Now, bear in mind, this was a very tiny kingdom.  All he could pull together was about five knights, and two servant boys to go with them.)  


Well, once they arrived at the other castle, they quickly learned that the power of the magic throne extended to the defense at the gates.  What they saw at the bridge leading into the castle was a giant pair of glowing yellow hands.  These moved about with an apparent life of their own, moving things around, clearing the area, and, as the unfortunate knights learned, throwing any unwanted visitors back they way they came, or into the moat.  


Eventually, the knights fled.  The two poor servants were huddled in the bushes, afraid to go forward, but just as afraid to go back, knowing their King would punish them terribly for failing.  


After some hours of indecision, it began to get darker.  The boys watched the giant yellow hands look as though they were slowing somewhat in their motion.  Like they were maybe getting tired.  As time passed, they slowed more and more, until they just leaned against one another, barely moving.  Had they fallen asleep?  


The boys crept cautiously from their hiding place, and watched the hands warily.  But there was no response.  The boys moved closer.  Still no response.  With this, the boys boldly attempted to cross the bridge into the castle, having to move carefully around where the hands were resting together.  


Now safely past the magics at the gate, they found there was no further security or resistance inside, as the local King had apparently been entirely dependent on the hands to protect the castle, and all it contained.  So they were able to get to the throne room unchallenged, where they found the magic throne, and hauled it away, squeezing between the hands, and running for their home kingdom.  


The moral of the story is:  **Let your pages do the walking through the yellow fingers.**  


*--- But that's not all! ---*  


Once the boys were back in their home kingdom, they realized that they held the power of the magic throne in their hands!  Why should they give this up to their King, when they had done all the work for it?  


So they instead took the throne back to their own house!  (Well, it was more of a hut, really.  As I said, tiny kingdom.  Tiny house.)  To keep it a secret, they stored it in the space above the thatching of their ceiling.  


Their King learned that the neighboring kingdom had lost the throne, and so he assumed that one of the people he had sent had succeeded.  But, because all the knights had been driven off, and nobody had seen the boys' success, nobody could say who might have the magic throne.  


Eventually, the King sent his guards to every house, to search for it.  (You might think it went really fast, because of how few houses there were, but you would be wrong, because he only had a couple of guards to do the work!)  


These guards hadn't considered that it might be in this 'attic' space, and so missed the now twice-stolen throne hidden in the attic of the family of the pages.  


Once the king had given up on the search, and the pages' family felt safe, they had a large party to celebrate.  (Well, large for them, which was about five people.  As I said, tiny kingdom.)  


However!  In the middle of the meal, the weight of the throne proved to be too much for the thatching, and it crashed through their ceiling, killing them all!  


The moral of the story is:  **He who lives in a grass house should not stow thrones.**  


*--- But that's not all! ---*  


One of the members of the nobility, through his network of spies and connections, had learned of the location of the throne after the tragedy that befell the family.  He managed to get there before anybody else found out about it, and hid the throne away in a place where he thought nobody else could find it.  


However, this nobleman wasn't the only one with spies, or connections.  The King learned of this betrayal, and that the throne was somewhere within his borders.  


Given that there were only about three Counts in the kingdom (it was tiny, you see), the knowledge that it was one of them allowed him to narrow it fairly quickly to the guilty party, who was then thrown into the castle's jail cell.  


For three days, the King would go to the Count, and demand to know the location of the throne.  Each time, the Count would refuse to tell him, figuring that, once he was out, the power would be his.  


On the fourth day, the King told the count that, if he persisted, he would be executed the next day.  Still, the Count refused to answer.  


On the fifth day, the Count was led to the executioner's block.  The executioner stood there in his hood, with his axe.  (Tiny axe.  Tiny kingdom.  You know this by now.)  


""Tell me where to find the throne!"" demanded the King.  


""I will not!"" shouted the Count.  


The king signaled for the executioner to raise his axe.  ""For the last time!  Where can I find the throne!""  


""I'LL NEVER TALK!"" shouted the Count.  


The king, enraged, gave the sign for the executioner to proceed.  


As the axe fell, the Count finally called out, ""NO, WAIT, I'LL TAL-""  


And the moral of the story is:  **Never hatchet your Counts before they chicken.**",The Tiny Kingdom,6

The father often told the boy, ""You should be more respectful of others"", to no avail as his words fell on deaf ears. His pranks were, quite frankly, annoying to the neighbours, but what did the son care as long as he got a good laugh? 

This went on for many months, and the frustrated neighbours (and the teen's father) decided one day they'd had enough. They came together to try and teach him a lesson, brainstorming plan after plan, yet even the most well thought out plans could not stop the boy in his tracks. Whether it was skill, sheer luck, or even divine intervention, was debated regularly, often with many exasperated sighs and shouts.

However, one day the son was nowhere to be found. The neighbours enjoyed their peace, but his father was incredibly anxious - where was his son? 

Exhausted and weary, the father returned home after spending the day fruitlessly searching for his son, and sat down at his dining table, where he found a strange wax figurine. A note beside it read, ""Let me be frank, your son played a prank, told me I stank, then he called me a crank. I am a witch, so I decided to switch, your sons body and soul, for this form where he has no control.""

Upon realising the fate of his son, the father cried for several days before stopping and reluctantly accepting it. 
He said, morosely, ""At least now he's a model citizen.""",A father had a very rowdy son,4

To make matters worse, a large reptilian appears to be swimming under and around his boat as the sun is starting to drop.

At his wits end, he yells “goddammit im lost”

The animal surfaces and says “see that island ahead? Go to around the right hand side of it- If you try to go left of the island, you’ll run into shallow water and a bunch of mangrove roots

Then, follow its contour until the sun is directly to your right- the correct heading will have your compass at about 285 degrees,30 minutes.

300 meters straight ahead from there, you should see your truck.”

Frightened, the man begins paddling hard, but relys on what he’s heard, thinking he’s hallucinating and hearing his subconscious. The crocodilian follows him.

Astoundingly, he sees his truck just as the animal pulls up next to him. Unfortunately, he’s exhausted, and hesitant to hop onto the shore for fear of becoming dinner.

The animal surfaces and says “There you go! See your truck? Have a great night”

The man, now realizing that he was not hallucinating, gasps “Thanks!..... waitaminute. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life but never seen your kind. What kind of alligator are you?”

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he’s ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn’t sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.”
The man sets about his task.

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

“In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is beyond that door.”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life’s wish is behind that door!

With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound……

But, of course, I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk…

While his parents were understanding, they weren't exactly rich. So when Bert turned 18, before searching a job and settling down, he decided to pursue his dream by travelling slowly south and picking up odd jobs along the way.

Two months later, two of his more affluent friends decided to go on a trip of their own, to the Riviera in southern France. Great was their surprise when they stumbled upon Bert in the local grocery store, who was diligently replacing all the price tags of the inventory.

They greeted him enthusiastically, and Bert returned the feeling. 'So what brings you here?', he asked, while ripping off a €1.00 label on a crisp bag and replacing it with a €1.20 price tag. 'Oh, you know, Marseille, Nice and their party life.' his friends answered. 'But we didn't expect *you* here. Weren't you going to Italy?'

On the way home he stopped at the hardware Store and bought a bucket and a gallon of paint. He then stopped by the feed store and picked up a couple of chickens and a goose. However, struggling outside the store he now had a problem – how to carry his entire purchases home.

While he was scratching his head he was approached by a little old lady who told him she was lost. She asked, ‘Can you tell me how to get to 1603 Mockingbird Lane ?’ The farmer said, ‘Well, as a matter of fact, my farm is very close to that house I would walk you there but I can’t carry this lot.’ The old lady suggested, ‘Why don’t you put the can of paint in the bucket. Carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?’ ‘Why thank you very much,’ he said and proceeded to walk the old girl home.

On the way he says ‘Let’s take my short cut and go down this alley. We’ll be there in no time..

‘ The little old lady looked him over cautiously then said, ‘I am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me.. How do I know that when we get in the alley you won’t hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and have your way with me?’

The farmer said, ‘Holy smokes lady! I’m carrying a bucket, a gallon of paint, two chickens, and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?’

The old lady replied, ‘Set the goose down, cover him with the bucket, put the paint on top of the bucket, and I’ll hold the chickens.",A farmer stopped by the local mechanics shop...,1462

He asks the vet, “Can you give me vocal cords so I can sing?” The vet agrees and gives the horse vocal cords.

A chicken sees this and wants to join the band, so he asks the vet, “can you give me lips so I can play the harmonica?” The vet agrees and gives the chicken lips.

A cow comes along with his buddy the pig, and they want to join the band too. They ask the vet for hands, so they can play the guitar and the drums. The vet agrees and gives them hands.

Together the animals form the Barnyard Boys, the first ever all animal band. They flew off the charts. Everybody wanted to hear them play, and they were completely booked for months to come. Then one day they got the big one, a gig overseas. This was how they would seal their name as one of the greats.

They flew over, blew the roof off the stadium, and left everybody dazzled. They had done it; they were now internationally famous. However, when it was time to go home, they ran into some problems with customs.

They were informed that the horse would have to be placed on a separate flight for their return home, but that both flights would arrive at their destination at relatively the same time. The band was pissed, but it was only a minor inconvenience. They got on their planes and departed.

When the horse’s flight landed, he couldn’t find his buddies anywhere. So he asked an attendant where their flight was. The attendant told him that during their flight there had been a terrorist attack, and that nobody on the plane survived.

The horse was devastated. In the blink of an eye everything was taken away from him. His friends, his hard work, his fortune. He was overcome by grief and needed a drink. 

He left the airport and found a small bar located in the quiet side of town.

The horse walks into the bar and the bartender asks, “hey why the long face?”",A horse wants to start a band,15

post,dxyw3p,2qh72,jokes,false,1574055243,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dxyw3p/because_its_funny/,self.jokes,,"“You can’t be serious,” the tall, slender man screamed up at the silver metallic saucer hovering over his rose garden. As if tickled by this reaction, the object hummed and displayed a line of multicolored lights around its sides for approximately three seconds before replying. 

“Yes, that’s right. Because it was fucking funny.” The object waited for the man’s next reaction, it had been hundreds of galactic years since the last time he’d gotten to reveal the cosmos to an unwitting vassal species. These humans had been incubating for some time and had accrued excellent ratings, all the beings responsible for the idea were compensated handsomely. 

“Why do you keep swearing so much?” The object stopped humming and blinked once in confusion. 

“What?!”

“I said, why do you keep swearing so much?”

“Of all the god damned questions to fall out from behind your face horns and you pick that one.”

“What? What’s so off about that?”

“I’m just saying, you’re only now hearing about the wonders of the universe and you’ve finally had answered basically all of your specie’s oldest questions and the only thing you can think of to ask a corporeal extraterrestrial in front of you is why he likes to use the fuck word?”

“Yeah, that’s about right. I just sorta figured if there’s some big alien civilization up there maybe they’d moved past swearing. I mean obviously you haven’t and that’s fine, I guess I’m just a little underwhelmed is all.”

The spaceship silently floated there for a few moments, not blinking, not humming, not doing anything at all, really. Just lost in the absolute asinine display before their very eyes. Then all at once, the object erupted into laughter, wildly flashing lights and humming a pitch that later historians would take care to note was a slightly out of tune B flat. 

Humans! All their fucking movies are about space! Their gods come from space! Their biggest damn expenditure other than war is space exploration and even then they manage to get bored. Were they all psychopaths or something? The captain flexed his reproductive sack in thought, perhaps they’d accidentally raised a planet of complete sociopaths. Given their history, it was certainly possible. He glanced over to the open files displaying the juiciest bits of human history, the Bronze Age collapse, Ice Age extinction, Mongol Conquest, it would certainly be possible. 

“So alright if you’re not going to ask any interesting questions, I’ll just tell you stuff.”

“Really mate, I wanna know why you guys never figured out how to quit being so darn foul mouthed. It’s really rather unbecoming of you.”

“You’re relentless! This is incredible, you still won’t shut the hell up about swearing! Alright fine you little shit listen up because we’re only going to say this once. If you think for a single one of your seconds that the very worst thing about our species is our liberal use of expletives then I’ve got some bad news for you sunshine.”

“Yeah no, I get it. You guys raise species to wage civil wars against themselves for thousands of years for entertainment and then sweep in once they break FTL travel and add a new vassal with all their fresh tactics to your little consumerist confederacy. It’s not that complicated, mate.”

“Yeah but why aren’t you upset about it? The last species we informed violently committed suicide and destroyed their entire home world in shame and anger. The one before that instantly declared war and was atomized, what’s making you different?”

“I already told you why, clearly your biology lacks a pair of working ears.” The object began humming again, this time the entire object turned a particularly angry shade of red.

“We have five working ears thank you very much and we can hear way better. You’re literally a hairless ape standing in a robe in a flower garden, do you really want to compare biology?”

“Fair. I suppose it’s rude to compare tentacle sizes upon first meetings.” This did the trick. The object immediately slammed down to earth, hissing as a door vaporized. A small, blue creature analogous to hairy, tripodal cuttlefish with a single compound eye in the middle of the face. The creature walked towards the man abruptly and came so close that their bodies were almost touching. It angrily shot an extension an the man and held it in one of its other appendages. 

“This is the closest thing to my penis and I bet your planet’s existence that it’s bigger than yours.” 

The Englishman roared and said, “lad I’ll take that bet. Prepare to leave this world for good. Your show has ended and that navy I’ll bet is hiding up in space can go back to whatever world you come from.” With that, he loosed his trousers and placed his hands valiantly on his hips. “How do you like us now?” 


Unfortunately for fans of cosmic gladiators, the human was a full three inches longer than the extraterrestrial, much to the shock and horror of both captain and crew. The alien suddenly went completely alabaster and sucked in his penis with a horrible clicking noise. The human made no attempt to clothe himself, instead proudly waving his member back and forth in the breeze, the stupidest smile cemented into his skull. 

“A deal’s a deal. Off you go!”

“You’re right, we’re nothing if not a species of our word. But before I go, I’d just like to let you know how much fun we had watching you guys kill eachother. That special with Atilla is really a classic and the follow up about the Vandals just always makes me think of childhood. You are talented warriors and we wish you the best.”

“Yes, yes. Thank you kindly and please get the fuck off this planet please.” 

With that, the creature turned and once again entered through the hissing portal. The humming returned for the last time as the object began to slowly rise above the earth, only a few meters at first, then to the heights of trees. It gave one final flash before it zipped off into the stars, leaving the man alone with his pants around his ankles and only his roses to keep him company. It was also at this moment that the local constabulary noticed the man staring off into his neighbors window with his pants around his ankles. 

The judge did not buy his story.",Because it’s Funny,11

Hoppity replied, ""Man, those bastards hurt!  And what kind of god creates a fly specifically to torment us!!  But seriously, what's eating you bud?"".  

Hippity replied, ""Well, after all these years, all those races, did you know we ended up in a tie?  In total wins?"".  Hoppity said, ""What??!!  I had no idea!  That's crazy!"".  So Hippity says, ""Well, I love you bro, but I want to know, once and for all, who the better horse is."".  Hoppity, in return, ""Well hell yeah, me too!!  So how do you propose we do this?"".  Hippity says, ""Well, I think we back our asses up to that fence right over there, and we count it down and sprint over to that fence right over there, and whoever gets there first is the best of us."".  Hoppity says, ""Let's do it."".

He trotted up to the fence and said, ""Hey you two!  I heard what's going on, and I figure that you two old blind bastards won't be able to tell who wins this race, so I'll stand over there at the other fence and with my keen vision I'll let y'all know who wins the race.  Sound good?"".
