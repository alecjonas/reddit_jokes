Hoping for water, he pops it open, only to see a swirl of smoke issued forth, coalescing into a giant figure.

""My deliverer!"" booms the figure. ""I am a long imprisoned Djinn, and as a reward for freeing me, I grant you three wishes.""

""Water!"" gasps the Arab, and in a flash a huge pool of crystal clear water appears before him. He drinks until sated, then falls back to consider his situation.

""Your second wish, my deliverer?"" says the Djinn.

""A palace,"" says the Arab, ""of hundreds of rooms, filled with servants and riches beyond any king."" And as he wished, so it appeared beside the pool of water.

""And your third wish, my deliverer?"" says the Djinn.

The Arab thinks. ""Well, Djinn, with my first wish I secured my life, while my second wish secured my future, and the future of my family. With my third wish, I should like to secure the future of my people, and my country. Therefore, I wish that the country of Israel should be destroyed!""

And in a crack of thunder the palace, pool, and flask vanished, leaving the Arab alone in the sand, dying of thirst.

&amp;#x200B;

The moral of the story? Some genies are Jewish.","An Arab is lost in the desert, dying of thirst",29

“I bet you will not find a braver soul on this ship!” says the marines general smugly.
The army general, not to be deterred, calls to his man “Private!! I want you to stand on that airstrip and catch that  F-18 when it lands!”
“Hell no!! Are you fucking crazy?!”

Defiled  what ye defiled

Ye are decorous like the composer, upon my coat tails

How thinkest thou it fitting, to take a courtesan to the inn

The courtesan shall say that  *thou* wert in to all,

Raise this even to the heavens

Harken lad, the courtesan is as the courtesan shall always be

Never chaste, but chartered like banquet halls

Behold, courtesan-pudding for thy lot of courtesans

And all will want of it for courtesans must also eat

Claiming yourselves the benefactors, not clients, of courtesans on your taxes

I foretell the rise of courtesans

Scantly a surprise

Tis a court of courters

Homely maiden’s faces

But courtesans despair ye not

As we blackamoors are also courtesans

Debauchers, I so tire of ye blackamoors asserting

He also decided to get a large life insurance plan that would give him $500,000 after she was killed. However he didn’t want to do it himself, so he asked his close friend if he knew of anybody who would be willing to do such a thing.

         His friend pointed him to an infamous hitman named Artie. The man meets with Artie and tells him what he wants done. Artie demands $5,000 for the job. The man tells Artie he would have the money after the hit. Artie demands at least something up front, the man proceeds to open his wallet showing a single dollar bill. Artie reluctantly takes the dollar and they talk about where it will be done. After some time they decide it can be done on the wife’s next shopping trip.

         Two days later, while the woman is shopping at Walmart, Artie sets up for the hit. He slides on his glove and proceeds to follow the wife to the vegetable isle. Artie takes a quick glance and seeing that nobody is around he walks up and chokes the woman. However a worker walks around and, not wanting there to be any witnesses, Artie chokes him too.

       Unfortunately for Artie the whole incident was caught on camera and Artie was arrested. While talking to the police, Artie revealed the whole plot and the husband who paid him to do it. The husband was promptly arrested later that day. 

       The following day, the newspaper headline read:

                             “Artie chokes 2 for $1 at Walmart!”",The Murder at Walmart,7

He gets to the set and they start working. They work and work and work right through till noon. The director wants to stop and go to lunch because he's super hungry but he knows they're running late. He decides to call in a caterer for the crew.  

Being a good leader, he lets his crew eat first to the point where there is only scraps left, nothing that could possibly fill him. 

He pleads to the caterer to make him a sandwhich, he's really craving a sandwhich. The caterer has to go and grab some more supplies so he leaves and they continue filming. 

Its now 6 and the director is starving. The caterer comes in with the biggest, juciest, tastiest looking sandwhich anyones ever seen. The caterer walks up to the director and shows him the magnificent sandwhich.  

The director sees the sandwhich. He licks his lips. He yells out to his crew ""That's a wrap""!

The farmer explained that the bees just made honey and have never stung anyone.

The buyer felt unsure about the sale until he proposed that he be tied to a nearby tree, naked, overnight. If he was stung once he would get the farm for free, but if he wasn't stung then he would pay the farmer double the price.

The farmer agreed and tied the now naked man to the tree.

The next morning the farmer saw the man leaning over and very pale.

""Oh no,"" the farmer thought, ""he got stung and now I have to give him the farm!"" As he reached the man he gently shook him and asked where he got stung and if he needed a doctor.

""No, no, I'm okay I guess,"" gasped the naked man. ""I have no choice, do I?

The typical.

One of my coworkers, Amanda, recently invited me to a ""party"" at her home, which was really a recruiting event to try to rope friends and family into signing up to be her downstream ""Independent Businesses Owners."" I wouldn't touch that pyramid scheme shit with a ten foot pole, but hey! Enough free samples of cake and muffins and stuff to last me a week? I'll go to your party, Amanda!

It actually went a lot better than I thought. I was expecting chocolate chip cookies, but Amanda was showing off the business's new Global Flavor line of products. Some of them I was familiar with like Italian pannettone, German stollen, and Mexican pan dulces. But I also got to try a lot of things I had never eaten before, like that Japanese melon bread that I had seen in squishies and keychains, but never in real life!

I endured the sales pitch (barely) and enjoyed the free samples (thoughly), but there was this one chick in a big black coat who was having the opposite experience. She was on the edge of her seat for the PowerPoint about ""unlimited earnings potential."" But when it came time to eat anything more exotic than Wonder Bread she was clearly out of her comfort zone.

She would go up to one plate, look it over, smell it suspiciously, read the little Culture Card. And then squirm around in her coat and whisper to herself through her teeth, before ultimately rejecting every dish.

To her credit, Amanda was a really good hostess. She and went out of her way to try and make Coat Lady feel welcome and include her in everything with the other women. The hostess tried to offer her various popular breads, but Coat Lady was not going for it. 

""You don't got anything regular American?"" Coat Lady kept asking. ""Like for sandwiches and burgers?""

Amanda tried to explain that she didn't have any tonight, but Coat Lady was hungry now so she kept trying.  ""Why don't you try this one from India? It's just like garlic bread, but flat!""

""No! Don't you just got those little rolls like they serve at [bland buffet restaurant]?""

""Just taste it, you might like it! You never know until you try!""

At this point, Amanda held out the India plate but Coat Lady knocked it away and turned to run. Amanda reached out reflexively to grab her but just caught her coat. The lady jerked away and the coat ripped off...

...to reveal the *biggest fucking snake* I have ever seen in my life! It was alive and wriggling, and she had it wrapped all around her neck and body like a nightmare infinity scarf.

Mortified, the lady stared back at everyone like a deer in the headlights. Until the snake reared up and hissed something in her ear. She nodded compliantly to the snake, and turned on the hostess, shrieking:

""MY ANACONDA DON'T WANT NAAN UNLESS YOU GOT BUNS, HUN!!!""

“I own nearly every valuable rare item known to man” said the rich collector.

  
“I know something you don’t own” said his friend.

  
“What’s that?” the collector asked

  
“It’s an item that’s so rare that only one man in the world is known to make it.” His friend said.

  
“Well now I must have it!” the collector said, and after much convincing he finally got the details.

  
So the rich collector goes to the man who apparently creates this rare item. When he gets there he’s lead into a large empty warehouse. 

  
The maker stands there and strokes his beard.

  
“Yes, I can make this item for you. But it will cost a lot of money!” the bearded maker says.

  
“Money is of no problem to me. Please make this item for me” the collector demands.

  
He leaves the warehouse after paying a substantial amount of money and returns 3 months later, as instructed, to see how his item was coming along.

  
He walked into the warehouse to see many steel girders being welded together into a large frame.

  
“We are making the frame at the moment, please return in 2 months to see where we’re up to” the maker says.

  
So the collector leaves and then returns 2 months later. When he gets back he finds tons of sand and cement, but nothing else in the warehouse.

  
“Where’s the frame?” asked the collector, bewildered.

  
“Oh we have moved it to a location that can fit it.” said the maker, “Don’t worry, it’s still being made. The sand and cement will begin being moved to the new location in the next couple of days. The next time you visit it’ll be completed, just come to this address”.

  
The collector took the address and left the warehouse. 5 months later he travelled to the location the maker had written down.

  
When he arrived he found himself in a desert standing in front of a giant pyramid, the largest he’d ever seen.  
The maker approached.

  
“Is this the item?” asked the collector.

  
“Yes, it is complete” the maker replied.

  
“What is it?” 

  
“It’s a kadink kadonk machine” the maker told him, “let me show you how it works”.

  
They begin climbing the stairs up the pyramid, stopping many times so the collector, who was not in the best shape, could rest his legs and catch his breath. They even stopped to have lunch and the collector marvelled at the view he witness from so high up on the pyramid.

  
Finally they reached the peak.

  
“Well…?” the collector grunted impatiently.

  
The maker reached into his pocket and pulled out a single marble. He flicked it onto the steps and as it fell upon each step it made a sound.

In front of his house he sees a brand new huge stadium, big crowds and the best tennis players in the world playing matches. He is amazed by it and asks his friend how did it happen. His friend says:

""There is this lake, and as I was fishing there I catched magical goldfish. She made my wish come true! I released her, so you can try to catch her. But be careful, because she is old and doesn't hear well. So you have to speak very loud and slow.""

So the guy goes there to fish and very quickly catches goldfish. The goldfish indeed looks kind of old and wrinkly. So the guy says very loud and clear: 

""Dear goldfish, please give me a big mountain of gold in front of my house!"" 

""Mountain of what? I can't hear you."" 

""Big mountain of gold!""

""Ok got it. Your wish came true. Now please release me.""

The guy releases the goldfish and very excited goes to see his treasure. 
But instead of mountain of gold in front of his house he sees mountain of mold. 
The guy is very sad, goes to visit his friend and says to him:

""This old stupid goldfish misheared me and gave me mountain of mold instead of mountain of gold."" 

To which his friend replies:

 He would do this with every one of our chores, cleaning, cooking, you name it. He wasnt a bad parent just instilling us with self dependance and a good work ethic.

 Any way one day my brother and I are told to clear out our rooms for spring cleaning. No problem. Then we are told to put them back in order but my dad specifically said ""Your rooms should look like hotel rooms"" before he left to go buy groceries.

 He comes home later to messy rooms and us playing xbox

Eventually, he started attending a nearby primary school for humans and he turned out to be very very smart indeed, even by human standards. Typing, thanks to his symbiotic oxpecker buddy, made him a prolific author.

Our hero was always curious as to why he, unique among all hippo-kind, was so smart. So after secondary school he went to university and eventually got a Phd in zoobiology, writing his thesis on large mammalian brain structure.

Funding his studies during and after his doctorate was no problem, of course. Who wouldn't want to underwrite the research of the only hippo scholar? So eventually he built his own research institute dedicated to the study of non-human intelligence.

After a decade or so, his star reaches its apex: Annie Leibovitz and Neil deGrasse Tyson travel to his institute to do an interview/photo spread for the New Yorker.

They travel to the town that hosts his institute. But it's a small town in Africa, so google maps are a bit spotty and they have to stop to ask for directions from a man walking down the road.

As the dinner speaker sat down to his meal, he realized he had left his dentures at home. How embarrassing. 

He leans over to a cool man in a nice suit just next to him and, hoping not to cause a scene, says, 

""I'm terribly sorry but I seem to have forgotten my dentures at home. Do you happen to have an extra pair?""

The neat man leans over and whispers with an air of understanding,

""Of course, let me see what I can do for you.""

The man reached under his chair and drew up a pair of dentures.

""Thank you so very much, you saved me from a rather awkward problem.""

The neat man nodded and went back to eating.

""Sorry to bother you again,"" said the dinner speaker, ""but these are just a bit too small.""

Taking it back, the man brought up a second pair.

""Mmph, Jusht a shize too warge""

Again the man took the improper dentures are brought back another pair.

""Ah!"" exclaimed the dinner speaker, ""These are just perfect, thank you really so much.""

And the dinner speaker finished his meal pleasantly and delivered his speech.

Afterward, the dinner speaker found the neat man and said,

“Wow, Bob, looks like you guys had one hell of a party last night!” the postman says.

Bob, in obvious pain, replies — “Actually we had it Saturday night. This is the first I have felt like moving since 4 am Sunday morning.”

“We had about 15 couples from around the neighborhood over for some weekend fun and it got a bit wild. Hell, we got so drunk around midnight that we started playing Who Am I?”

“Is that a game?” the postman asks, all curious. “How do you play that?”

Bob replies — “Well, all the guys go in the bedroom and we come out one at a time with a sheet covering us and only our ‘privates’ showing through a hole in the sheet.”

“Then the women try to guess who it is.”

The postman laughs and says — “Damn, I’m sorry I missed all that fun.”

So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.

His last name has the odd distinction of having two z's at the start of it and since everything in the military is done alphabetically hes always the last guy in line.

One day their sergeant gets the entire company together for training:

""Alright! We're gonna have you all use dummy weapons and go out onto this course behind me, the objective is to be the last soldier standing!""

The company is then instructed to get into a line (alphabetically by last name) and proceed to three separate trucks to get their weapons. Naturally our hero is the last one to get gear and when he gets up there the sergeant shakes his head and says:

""Sorry son, we dont have enough rifles for all of you, so we've notified the rest of the company that when you walk up and yell 'bang bang bang!', they all know to drop like they've been hit.""

Our hero shrugs and moves on. Same thing happens with grenades and knives; and he receives instructions similar to the first, 'boom boom boom' and 'knife knife knife' respectively. Now each time hes told to imitate shooting a rifle, throwing a grenade, and slashing knife along with the sounds.

He enters the field and takes out the first guy with his 'rifle', yelling 'bang bang bang!'. Sure enough the trooper falls. Next is the grenade, that works too. So does the knife, soon hes on his way to being the last one standing.

Eventually he finds a hill with a single soldier standing on it. He pretends to shoot him with the tried and true 'bang bang bang', but nothing happens. He tries the grenade, nothing. So he runs up and yells 'knife knife knife' and slashes at the guy.

The trooper turns, knocks our hero down and stomps over him before turning back and saying with a grin:

The bartender looks at the customer bewildered, not able to 
understand how a duck is able to talk. So he pours it a shot of 
vodka and watches the animal. The duck drinks its shot, pays 
and walks out. The next day the same thing happens. So, the 
bartender after pouring the requested drink asks the duck:

- 'What's your deal dude?'

- 'Oh you know, I work as a plumber at the construction site right around the block and I have to unwind after a long day.'


Alright, the bartender accepts the answer. This goes on for a 
week or so, always at the same time and always a shot of 
vodka. One of these days a friend of the bartender, who works at 
the circus, comes up to the bar to have a drink and chat with his 
buddy. He complains about his circus not doing very well, due to
the fact that they do not have anything interesting to show the 
audience, just the usual lions and clowns. The bartender tells 
his friend that he has something the circus might be interested 
in: A talking duck. The circus man just has to stick around for 
few more hours to check it out. So the friend stays, and of 
course, the duck walks in, as always, to have a shot of vodka.

So, the circus manager walks up to it, really excited, and starts 
talking the duck up, promising a life of glory and wealth, if only it 
would join his circus. The duck sits there in silence, listening to 
his pitch. Then after a minute of silence it asks:

- 'This circus of yours, its just a big tent, right?'

- 'Well, yeah' - The circus man answered.

- 'And the ground, its just dirt and grass, right?' - The duck 
continued.

- 'Yeah, of course'

- 'Then what the fuck do you need a plumber for?'",A duck walks into a bar,96

A week ago, I came back home and, yet again, saw my wife sleeping with a poor shopkeeper. I grabbed my gun and threatened him. He asked me for a cup of coffee to settle down the issue. He said he was very poor and he has a starving family, and so I forgave him.

Two days ago, yet again, I came back home, only to find my wife sleeping with a fighting soldier. I was so infuriated, I grabbed my gun and threatened him. He begged me to a cup of coffee and to solve the issue. He told me he has a wife and newborn children he hasn't met yet, and therefore I forgave him.""

Wearing his finest suit, he prays to God that he might be able to meet the Holy Father.

During the morning’s Papal procession, he manages to work his way to the front of the barrier as the Pontiff walks by.

Instead of blessing him, His Holiness completely ignores him, yet stops several feet past to stoop down and talk to a ragged-looking hobo. The wealthy man is insanely jealous, considering he traveled all this way just to be shunned.

He later finds this homeless-looking person and offers him his own fine suit as well as $5,000 in exchange for the raggedy clothes. Eternally grateful, the hobo hastily hands the wealthy man his clothes and thanks the Virgin Mary for such a miracle.

The following day, the wealthy man, now wearing his “new” ragged clothes, works himself back to the front of the barrier as close to the same spot where the hobo was before. Sure enough, as the Pope came down the procession, he stopped by the man, bent down to speak, and whispered in his ear:

So, again Peter tries to climb the cross to get to his lord, when the roman soldier draws his sword and chops Peter’s arm off. Peter is getting a little pissed and wants to go back to his buddies, but again Jesus summons. The roman guard can’t believe that Peter is trying yet AGAIN to climb to the cross, and chops off another arm. Peter is now covered in blood and demented from the blow to the head and wants to call it a day. Jesus hoarsly croaks, “Peter, please, come to me!”

By now, the roman guard is tired of chopping limbs, so he lets Peter be. The faithful disciple struggles to reach near the cross and after a long while he finally arrives at his Lord’s side. Hurting, suffering, bleeding, Peter looks into his Master’s eyes and asks, “yes, my Lord. What is it?”

In order to shake off the heat, the couple rushed into a Victoria's secret to blend in with the crowd and hide.

By the time two officers had shown up, the weird looks and perfume that everyone was berating them with were incredibly distracting, they couldn't figure out who was who without making a commotion and possibly letting the robbers get away. Now fragrant and ashamed, the two officers stepped out and called the detective.

The detective shows up and the officers explain what's going on, gritty and rude, just like in the TV shows, the detective scoffs and says he'll do their job for them this time, as there were more important things on his agenda at the time, like instant coffee and bourbon and being gritty (all at the same time too).

20 minutes pass and the grumpy detective comes out smelling like a combination of a nice lady's purse and an ashtray with an attitude (but that last part was probably just the cheap cigarettes he always smoked and his bad attitude). No luck, he couldn't find em'. Even more pissed off, than before, the detective told the officers the bad news. Worried about their jobs and what the chief would say, the group started to panic: *Who was gonna find these guys?* 

A middle-aged white man who looked like he hated his job only a little bit more than his wife's cooking walked by and saw the trio of law enforcement officers squabbling outside the lingerie shop. Confused, and almost entertained, he walked over to see if he could help (that and the fact that the longer he was here, the longer he *wasn't* at dinner.

The cops and detective, all hesitant, decide to tell the man what's wrong (they really didn't have any better options). The man says he can help, and goes into the store.

Two minutes pass, and the man stumbles out of the panty shop and is pulling the reluctant robber in one hand and the beat up husband (with a black eye) in the other. 

Relieved and ecstatic, the cops throw cuffs on the criminals and get them into the patrol car.

""That was friggin' amazing pal! How'd you even do that?!"" one of the policemen asked.

The mopey man grew a grin on his face and said:

""I just found the only guy in there with a smile on his face and shouted **Oh hey pal! why weren't you at the strip club today?!**

The officer chuckled, and asked him, why the husband had a black eye?

""Oh, after I shouted out loud, his wife came out of the dressing room and beat the shit outta him""
