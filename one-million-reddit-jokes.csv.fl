e outperformed every one of his classmates. 

One day, his teacher invites his parents to class for a meeting. In this meeting, the teacher suggested that Bart be sent to a human high school. While at first skeptical, they decide that this would be the best opportunity for their son. They send Bart to a human high school, where surprisingly enough, he flourishes even more as a student. At the age of 16, Bart the bee graduated as a valedictorian at this human high school. 

When it came to furthering his education, he applied and was accepted to all the major ivy league universities across the country; Yale, Princeton, Harvard, you name it. He ultimately settled on MIT, where he studied as an honor roll student and became a Political Science major. After graduating at the age of 20, he used his knowledge to pursue politics, first running for the mayor of Boston, near MIT. Much to a shock of just about everyone, Bart the bee was elected almost unanimously, proceeding to become the most liked mayor of all time. Furthering his political career, he ran for the governor of Massachusetts, once again being unanimously elected with unprecedented approval levels. Bart the bee became the Governor of Massachusetts.

To top it all off, Bart the bee decided that he would run for president of the United States. This, obviously, has never been attempted in the history of, well, ever. However, Bart had become so universally adored by nearly all of humanity, that there virtually no opposition to Bart's campaign. By default, Bart the bee became the POTUS. 

Having accomplished just about everything he could have possibly accomplished in his bee life, he looked back on his life and came to the realization that none of what he achieved would have been possible had his parents taken the leap of faith on his behalf. Thusly, he decided he would return to his home hive and spend some time with his parents.

When Bart returned to the hive, he was welcomed as a celebrity, being loved by humans and bees alike. His parents were absolutely overjoyed to see their bee son once again. He decided that he would treat them to a delicious steak dinner at his favorite restaurant. After a bit of a flight, he arrives at the restaurant and finds that the wait time is over an hour long. Not wanting to abuse his status as president to obtain a table, he decides to take his parents to the pub for a drink. However, upon arriving at this pub, he realizes that the queue line is out the door and all the way down the block. Frustrated, he decides that he will simply take his parents for a nice glass of fruit punch. They fly down to the fruit punch stand down the street, and anyway there's no punchline.",The Bee Joke,10

I remember hearing about a pianist who also fixed orchestras (booked players for concerts) who got put in prison for defrauding clients and musician contractors for hundreds of thousands of pounds, sentence was two years, expected to be out in 18 months.

Inside, he only had one possession, a copy of Bartok's Piano Concerto No 2, one of the most difficult pieces in the repertoire. For a month he just stared at it, studied it, drank it in. Then he spread his fingers and just moved his downturned palms left and right as if covering the ground on an imaginary piano keyboard. The prison guards laughed at and taunted him, but as time went on they were just quietly curious. Other inmates quizzed him and he said he had never played the piece before but it was his life goal and he didn't want to waste his 'enforced recreation time'.

This went on for months and through the bars the guards could see his fingers flying while his eyes were either up and closed or open and aimed right at the score; his cellmates would even turn the pages for him, they'd got so used to his repeated movements. He just looked like he was not only playing the concerto, but absolutely smashing it, like when someone looks so comfortable it's effortless.

Word got out via visitors and visitors' acquaintances and eventually to the local paper who sent someone to the prison. Eventually the buzz spread and the increased attention, regional TV news etc, really started feeding the guy's ego - a group of his ex musician contractors got together and organised a low-budget orchestra to play the concerto with him on his release, which got national media attention which led to a larger and larger orchestra and eventually the city's concert hall as venue, ticket proceeds for charity, all sold out on the day of his release, concert scheduled for that evening.

I was sat in the stalls, three quarters of the way back, as he made his way to the stage.

Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.

In it, was Richard Nixon and a large pool of water. Nixon kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed.

Over, and over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in hell.

""No,"" Donald said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair. I don't think I could do that all day long.”

The devil led him to the door of the next room. In it, was Ronald Reagan with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks.

All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time. ""No, this is no good; I've got this problem with my shoulder.”

“I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day”, commented Donald.

The devil opened a third door.

Through it, Donald saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose.

Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.

Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, ""Yeah man, I can handle this.""

The devil smiled and said, “Okay: Monica, you're free to go.""","One day in the future, Donald Trump has a heart-attack and dies. He immediately goes to Hell, where the devil is waiting for him.",88

One by one the high profile vets took turns and became frustrated when they could not ease the hog's suffering. Suddenly the front door flew open and a man stroms in, pulls a vial from his coat and pours the contents down the hog's throat causing the hog to immediately perk up. The man then turned to the billionaire and said ""It took me longer than I thought to get here from Madrid but I knew the swine cure-all I've invented would take care of any problem the animal may have!"" ""Thank you sir! Bless you sir!"" Exclaimed the old man, ""I had no idea such a thing existed but I am forever in your debt! I just wish you would have told me you were coming and that you had a cure."" The vet then turned to him and said

The fellow is a little startled, but manages to say ""Hi, my name is Joe. I'm here for Flo. I'm here to take her to the show. Is she ready to go?""

The farmer considered him for a moment, then shouts up the stairs ""Flo! It's Joe, come to take you to the show. Get ready to go!""

So, Flo and Joe leave for the show.

Before too long, there's another knock at the door. Again, the old farmer gets up and opens the door with his shotgun already aimed at the young man stranding there.

After a minute, the daughter's sweetie begins to speak, ""Hello sir. My name is Freddy and I'm here for Betty. We're going for spaghetti. Is she ready?""

The old man lowers his weapon and says loudly ""Betty! It's Freddy. You're going for spaghetti, so get ready!""

So, Betty and Freddy go out for spaghetti.

Finally, only the youngest daughter is left in the home. A few minutes pass before there's another knock at the front door. Just as before, the farmer yanks the door open and points his gun at the fellow there.

The happy beau says ""Hi, my name is Chuck!""

So the farmer shot him.

His toes are crooked and gnarled, but the man has a perfectly good reason for this.

""When I was young, the doctors diagnosed me with Toelio.""

A look of confusion washes over her face. ""Toelio? You surely must mean Polio."" she says.

""Similar, but it only affected my toes.""

He stands and unbuttons his pants, and unzips his fly. He wiggles out of his slacks only to reveal pockmarks and scarring all over his knees.

Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one, ""Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what's your story?""

So the first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this naked man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell-but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died right then and there on the balcony.""

""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. ""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and one of my favorite hobbies is dancing around naked while eating pickles out of a glass jar. As I was doing so the other day, I slipped on an errant pickle and slipped over the balcony. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but thankfully I fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right.  I thought I was the luckiest guy in the world, but a refrigerator fell out of the sky and crushed me to death!""

Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated. Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story. The man responds:

""I died naked inside a refrigerator.""",Three men were standing in line to get into heaven one day.,19

The angel said ""how did you die"" 

The man then told the story of how he died 

I was suspecting my wife was cheating on me so I had a plan. I acted like I was leaving for work but I waited an hour and cake back in while also having trouble with the door, when I finally get in I see my assumption was right. I found my wife naked under the covers of our bed. In a blind rage, I go searching around my house, I saw a man hanging from the balcony so I grabbed a knife and I stabbed his fingers a hundred times. He then fell but I noticed he was still alive so I grabbed the fridge then throw it on him when I finally realized what I have done, I took my own life because I couldn't live with myself knowing I killed someone.

The angel said ""wow ok you can come in""

The angel then said ""next person approach"" 

The other fully dressed man approached and told the angel how he died and he said

Well, I was biking down the road and I was enjoying my day when I see a truck turn the corner fast. I didn't have time to swerve so I got hit and fling into the air and I caught a balcony. Then after 10 seconds, I hear a door slam and a guy comes running towards me with a knife and stabs my fingers and I fall. I thought it was a miracle how I was alive. I opened my eyes to see a fridge fall on me and that's how I died.

The angel said with a surprised look on his face ""ok you may enter""

The angel said ""next in line please""

The naked man approached and the angel said ""how did you die"" 

The naked man then says ""I was hiding in a fridge""",3 men are in line for heaven,86

While they’re in the middle of things, the guy says, “How do you do that? The singing is so clear!” She responds, “It’s a secret.”

The guy decides he has to see this for himself, so when they’re done, he turns on the light and sees her popping in a glass eye.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'","Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy.

On his first appointment he is greeted and shown to a room where the treatment will proceed. He enters the room but immediately afterwards the door closes and gets locked from the outside.
Inside the room a really beautiful young woman is standing, completely naked saying:

""If you catch me we can have sex""

John is really excited and starts chasing after her for hours until he finally succeeds. 

He loses about 10 pounds during this process. 

Next appointment same thing happens, big door, locked but even a more beautiful woman awaits him. Again she says:

""If you can catch me we can have sex ""

Again he chases after her and after 5 hours finally  gets her.

The third time John is really excited as he can't imagine any more beautiful women than this plus he's already down 20 pounds and became pretty swift and agile. Still, he makes the third appointment.

Same procedure, door, room, locks from outside.

post,b072zv,2qh72,jokes,false,1552392851,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/b072zv/a_woman_joins_the_army/,self.jokes,,"A woman was walking through a store when she noticed a colorful flyer pinned to a billboard. It reads:

JOIN THE ARMY NOW! You will receive benefits such as:
• Free college education 
• Many veteran benefits 
• Experience in many fields of work
• Travel
• Any free car after a special base trial 
The woman took the flyer home and gave it much thought. Although she was close to 40, if she joined the military she could finally afford to go to college, get a good job and make more money for her son and husband. 

Her family supports her and she after she enlists, the army makes some exceptions and she successfully joins.

After undergoing training, traveling around a little, shes stationed at a base somewhere in afganistan. 

As shes doing her base work, she starts thinking about her family. Her son is going to be 16 soon and is going to get his lisence. Her husband works overtime every week to make mortgage and isnt home at all. They will need a second car if they're going to make everything work once she gets back. 

She heads over to her superior and asks about the ""free car"" she read about in flyer before she joined the army. She wanted to spend her last 6 months in the army trying to get this car. 

""Oh yes! The army do these trials to improve efficiency on base and provides an incentive to do so. Because this is the first year, they've made it easy. Just guard every lookout station at least an hour per station every day until the trial is over."" 

It seemed easy enough but after a few days it proved rather difficult. 

She would wake up, do her exercises, guard one station, move to the next an hour later, do more exercises, guard another, do her base work, guard another, train, and guard another until she went back to sleep. 

She kept this up for her last 6 months in the army, spending any breaks she had going from lookout station to station until the trial and her service in the army was over. 

Her superior then held a meeting with her the day before she was headed home. 

""I've never seen a soldier as determined as you during that trial! You deserve to ride around in any vehicle you want. When you get back, a certificate with be mailed to you. Just show the certificate to any car dealership you want and they will be obligated to give you any car for free""

The woman thanked her superior and headed home. Once she landed, her husband and son were so happy to see her home. 

""Honey I'm so glad you're finally home, we've been so eager to see you. We can start this new life we've been talking about"" said the husband.

""Yeah Ma, I'm excited too! I've been wanting to surprise you. I applied to a bunch of colleges already and 3 already accepted me!"" said the son. 

""Well I have a surprise for you guys too. If you're headed to college soon, you need something to ride around in! You ready? The army gave me a brand new car! Any car of my choosing in fact!"" 

The husband and son look at each other with confused faces and asked her what she was talking about. 

""I told you before I joined the army about the car. There was this trial on the base I was stationed at. All I had to do every day for 6 months was go from one lookout post to the other until I covered all of them in one day. It was hard work, but it paid off""

The husband and son still looked confused. 

""Are you sure honey? I dont remember the 'any free car' thing. The military isnt some game show"" asked the husband.

""No really! It was on the flyer I first showed you! What's so hard to believe?""

""Well, think about it"" said the son. ""I find it hard to believe a bunch of re-posting would get you any free car, Ma""

After having studied for many months and having completed all the necessary readings of varied tomes, Sarah was taught the most simple forms of fortune telling - reading the future from tea leaves in a cup, or the casting of chicken bones - but it wasn't until two years of studying that she finally graduated to the most renowned tool of all fortune tellers, the crystal ball.


Madame Lointain explained the process to her. First an old sack cloth needed to be laid across the table, then the crystal ball was placed on the cloth. Finally the fortune teller should touch the crystal ball lightly with the very tip of their fingers and allow the divination to flow through them. When this process was complete, the crystal ball would cloud before showing the user a vision of the future.


Sarah followed the steps and touched the crystal ball. There was a tingling sensation, the ball clouded, and she had the briefest of visions of herself as a fortune teller in her own village.


""Congratulations!"" said Madame Lointain ""You have passed the final test of fortune telling - the test of scrying - which means you are no longer a trainee but instead are a fully qualified fortune teller!""


Sarah was extremely pleased and immediately returned to her village, where she began preparing her house for her new business. She bought candles and incense, she bought a one-eyed cat and a toad, and she bought a set of good china, and the finest crystal ball she could find. Then she went to the market stall, where traders from Eastern lands sold their wares, and looked for a cloth to go beneath the crystal ball.


Sarah decided that an old sack cloth would look very shabby beneath her beautiful new crystal ball and instead found herself taken by a beautiful purple fabric on one of the stalls.


""What kind of fabric is this?"" she asked.


""Why, you have an eye for quality,"" said the trader with a smile. ""For this is made from the finest milled silk. It is good enough for royalty in fact.""


Well, that swayed Sarah completely and she purchased the fabric and completed the set up of her business. She was ready to open to the public, finally.


To begin with, it was an immense success. She tossed chicken bones, she stirred tea leaves, but when she finally came to the climax of her display she found herself unable to see anything in the crystal ball. She strained, she pleaded inwardly, but it remained clear without a hint of cloudiness.


Sarah made an excuse and gave her customer a refund, seeing them off with a smile, but was terribly worried. She was *sure* that she had done everything properly but it was no use, she was no longer able to scry. In floods of tears, she sent a message to Madame Lointain pleading for help and shut up shop while she waited.


Three days later there was a knock at the door. Madame Lointain stepped inside and Sarah explained how she had lost the ability to successfully use the crystal ball.


Firstly, Madame Lointain checked the crystal ball but it was in perfect working order. For a moment she was slightly bewildered as to what could be wrong, but then she noticed the purple fabric on the table beneath it. 


""Where is the sack cloth?"" she asked.


""Oh,"" said Sarah, ""I thought this was more beautiful. It is finest milled silk, good enough for royalty.""


""Ah, well that explains it,"" said Madame Longtain with a sigh.


""It does?"" asked Sarah.


""Of course!"" said Madame Longtain, ""Haven't you ever heard it's no use scrying over milled silk?""","Once upon a time, there was a trainee fortune teller...",32

post,b05hq7,2qh72,jokes,false,1552380717,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/b05hq7/there_was_once_a_priest_who_went_to_see_the_world/,self.jokes,,"After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.

Many years passed by like that.

At the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.

With his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:

Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked:

Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.

A week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:

Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked:

Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:

Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.

Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:

Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:

Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.

Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:

Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.

Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!

There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:

But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:

Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?

All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.

The priest was good, and never told anyone.",There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath.,14

One day, the cops came and busted me for something I swear I didn’t do.

But alas, I knew even 6 months away couldn’t keep us apart for long.

And so time passed, day after day, week after week, month after month... until one day.

Eventually, after all the paperwork was sorted out in court, I finally got out of court.

But then I went back to court for an announcement I’d made plans for.

I’d marry that girl.

I loved her, and she loved me.

Our parents supported us no matter what.

And so the law twisted around me once again.

And hence we both laid back on our earthen beds together once more, but this time for life.

We were meant to be together; whether it meant serving time for fucking my sister’s corpse or not, because we were a happy family either way.",She never said much.,0

The barber responds, 'Carrots? This is a butcher shop. We don't sell carrots here.'

'Oh', responds the rabbit, 'My apologies', and he hops out of the store.

The next day, the rabbit comes back. 'Helloooo. Do you have any carrots?'

'You're that rabbit from yesterday, aren't you? I already told you. This is a butcher shop. We don't sell carrots.'

'Ahh. Right.' The rabbit hops out again.

Day three comes around, and again the rabbit appears. 'Hiiiiiiiiiiiii. Do you have any carrots?'

'Look, mate, I've told you. This is a butcher shop. If you come back asking for more bleeding carrots, I'll nail your ears to the floor!'

'My ears, you say? Hmm, okay, thanks anyway.' The rabbit hops out.

Day four passes, and there's no rabbit. Day five and day six pass without any sign of the rabbit, either.

Day seven comes around, and suddenly, the rabbit reappears. 'Heeeeey. Do you have any nails?'

&amp;#x200B;

Macaroni and Beef

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago we decided to cruise out to Ryan's Steakhouse for dinner. It was a Wednesday night which means that macaroni and beef was on the hot bar, indeed the only night of the week that it is served.  Wednesday night is also kid's night at Ryan's, complete with Dizzy the Clown wandering from table to table entertaining the little bastards.

&amp;#x200B;

It may seem that the events about to be told have little connection to those two circumstances, but all will be clear in a moment.

&amp;#x200B;

We went through the line and placed our orders for the all-you-can-eat hot bar then sat down as far away from the front of the restaurant as possible in order to keep the density of kids down a bit. Then I started my move to the hot bar. Plate after plate of macaroni and beef were consumed that evening, I tell you -- in all, four heaping plates of the pseudo-Italian ambrosia were shoved into my belly. I was sated.  Perhaps a bit too much, however.

&amp;#x200B;

I had not really been feeling well all day, what with a bit of gas and such. By the time I had eaten four overwhelmed plates of food, I was in real trouble. There was so much pressure on my diaphragm that I was having trouble breathing. At the same time, the downward pressure was building. At first, I thought it was only gas which could have been passed in batches right at the table without too much concern.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, that was not to be. After a minute or so it was clear that I was dealing with explosive diarrhea. It's amazing how grease can make its way through your intestines far faster than the food which spawned the grease to begin with, but I digress...

&amp;#x200B;

Entering, I saw two sinks immediately inside the door, two urinals just to the right of the sinks, and two toilet stalls against the back wall. One of them was a handicapped bathroom. Now, normally I would have gone to the handicapped stall since I like to stretch out a bit when I take a good shit, but in this case, the door lock was broken and the only thing I hate worse than my wife telling me to stop cutting my toenails with a pair of diagonal wire cutters is having someone walk in on me while I am taking a shit. I went to the normal stall. In retrospect, I probably should have gone to the large, handicapped stall even though the door would not lock because that bit of time lost in making the stall switch proved to be a bit too long under the circumstances. By the time I had walked into the regular stall, the pressure on my ass was reaching Biblical proportions. I began ""The Move.""

&amp;#x200B;

For those women who may be reading this, let me take a moment to explain ""The Move."" Men know exactly what their bowels are up to at any given second. And when the time comes to empty the cache, a sequence of physiological events occur that can not be stopped under any circumstances. There is a move men make that involves simultaneously approaching the toilet, beginning the body turn to position ones ass toward said toilet, hooking ones fingers into ones waistline, and pulling down the pants while beginning the squat at the same time. It is a very fluid motion that, when performed properly, results in the flawless expulsion of shit at the exact same second that ones ass is properly placed on the toilet seat. Done properly, it even assures that the choad is properly inserted into the front rim of the toilet in the event that the piss stream lets loose at the same time; it is truly a picture of coordination rivaling that of a ballet dancer.

&amp;#x200B;

I was about half-way into ""The Move"" when I looked down at the floor and saw a pile of vomit that had been previously expelled by one of those little bastards attending kids night; it was mounded up in the corner so I did not notice it when I had first walked into the stall. Normally, I would not have been bothered by such a thing, but I had eaten so much and the pressure upward was so intense, that I hit a rarely experienced gag reflex. And once that reflex started, combined with the intense pressure upward caused by the bloated stomach, four plates of macaroni and beef started coming up for a rematch. What happened next was so quick that the exact sequence of events are a bit fuzzy, but I will try to reconstruct them as best I can.

&amp;#x200B;

In that moment of impending projectile vomiting, my attention was diverted from the goings-on at the other end. To put a freeze frame on the situation, I was half crouched down to the toilet, pants pulled down to my knees, with a load of vomit coming up my esophagus. Now, most of you know that vomiting takes precedence over shit no matter what is about to come slamming out of your ass. It is apparently an evolutionary thing since shitting will not kill you, but vomiting takes a presence of mind to accomplish so that you do not aspirate any food into the bronchial tubes and perhaps choke to death. My attention was thus diverted. At that very split second, my ass exploded in what can only be described as a wake...you know, as in a newspaper headline along the lines of ""30,000 Killed in Wake of Typhoon Fifi"" or something similar. In what seemed to be most suitably measured in cubic feet, an enormous plug of shit the consistency of thick mud with embedded pockets of greasy liquid came flying out of my ass. 

&amp;#x200B;

But remember, I was only half-way down on the toilet at that moment. The shit wave was of such force and of just such an angle in relation to the back curve of the toilet seat that it ricocheted off the back of the seat and slammed into the wall at an angle of incidence equal to the angle at which it initially hit the toilet seat. Then I sat down. Recall that when that event occurred, I was already half-way to sitting anyway and had actually reached the point of no return. I have always considered myself as relatively stable gravitationally, but when you get beyond a certain point, you're going down no matter how limber you may be. Needless to say, the shit wave, though of considerable force, was not so sufficient so as to completely glance off the toilet seat and deposit itself on the walls, unlike what you would see when hitting a puddle with a high-pressure water hose; even though you throw water at the puddle, the puddle gets moved and no water is left to re-form a puddle. There was a significant amount of shit remaining on about one third of the seat rim which I had now just collapsed upon. Now, back to the vomit...

&amp;#x200B;

While all the shitting was going on, the vomit was still on its way up. By the time I had actually collapsed on the toilet, my mouth had filled up with a goodly portion of the macaroni and beef I had just consumed. OK, so what does the human body instinctively do when vomiting? One bends over. So I bent over. I was still sitting on the toilet, though. Therefore, bending over resulted in me placing my head above my now slightly opened legs, positioned in between my knees and waist. Also directly above my pants which were now pulled down to a point just midway between my knees and my ankles. Oh, did I mention that I was wearing not just pants, but sweat pants with elastic on the ankles. In one mighty push, some three pounds of macaroni and beef, two or three Cokes, and a couple of Big, Fat Yeast Rolls were deposited in my pants...on the inside...with no ready exit at the bottom down by my feet.

&amp;#x200B;

In the next several seconds, there were a handful of farts, a couple of turds, and the event ended, yet I was now sitting there with my pants full of vomit, my back covered in shit that had bounced off the toilet, spattered on three ceramic tiled walls to a height of about five feet, and still had enough force to come back at me, covering the back of my shirt with droplets of liquid shit. All while thick shit was spread all over my ass in a ring curiously in the shape of a toilet seat. And there was no fucking toilet paper.

&amp;#x200B;

What could I do but laugh. I must have sounded like a complete maniac to the guy who then wandered into the bathroom. He actually asked if I was OK since I was laughing so hard I must have sounded like I was crying hysterically. I calmed down just enough to ask him if he would get the manager. And told him to have the manager bring some toilet paper. When the manager walked in, he brought the toilet paper with him, but in no way was prepared for what happened next. I simply told him that there was no way I was going to explain what was happening in the stall, but that I needed several wet towels and I needed him to go ask my wife to come help me. I told him where we were sitting and he left. At that point, I think he was probably assuming that I had pissed just a bit in my pants or something similarly benign.

&amp;#x200B;

About two minutes later, my wife came into the bathroom not knowing what was wrong and with a certain amount of worry in her voice. I explained to her (still laughing and having trouble getting out words) that I had a slight accident and needed her help. Knowing that I had experienced some close calls in the past, she probably assumed that I had laid down a small turd or something and just needed to bring the car around so we could bolt immediately. Until I asked her, I'm sure she had no idea that she was about to go across the street and purchase me new underwear, new socks, new pants, a new shirt, and (by that time due to considerable leakage around the elastic ankles thingies) new sneakers. And she then started to laugh herself since I was still laughing.

&amp;#x200B;

She began to ask for an explanation as to what had happened when I promised her that I would tell her later, but that I just needed to handle damage control for the time being. She left.

&amp;#x200B;

The manager then came back in with a half dozen wet towels and a few dry ones. I asked him to also bring a mop and bucket upon which he assured me that they would clean up anything that needed to be cleaned. Without giving him specific details, I explained that what was going on in that stall that night was far in excess of what I would expect anyone to deal with, what with most of the folks working at Ryan's making minimum wage of just slightly above.

&amp;#x200B;

At that moment, I think it dawned on him exactly the gravity of the situation. Then that manager went so far above the call of duty that I will be eternally grateful for his actions. He hooked up a hose. Fortunately, commercial bathrooms are constructed with tile walls and tile floors and have a drain in the middle of the room in order to make clean up easy. Fortunately, I was in a commercial bathroom. He hooked up the hose to the spigot located under the sink as I began cleaning myself up with the wet towels. Just as I was finishing, my wife got back with the new clothes and passed them into the stall, whereupon I stuffed the previously worn clothing into the plastic bag that came from the store, handing the bag to my wife. I finished cleaning myself off and carefully put on my new clothes, still stuck in the stall since I figured that it would be in bad taste to go out of the stall to get redressed in the event I happened to be standing there naked and some little bastard kid walked in. At that point, I had only made a mess; I had not yet committed a felony and intended to keep it that way.

&amp;#x200B;

When I finished getting dressed, I picked up the hose and cleaned up the entire stall, washing down the remains toward the drain in the center of the room. I put down the hose and walked out of the bathroom. I had intended to go to the manager and thank him for all he had done, but when I walked out, three of the management staff were there to greet me with a standing ovation. I started laughing so hard that I thought I was going to throw up again, but managed to scurry out to the car where my wife was now waiting to pick me up by the front door. The upshot of all this is that I strongly recommend eating dinner at Ryan's Steak House. They have, by far, the nicest management staff of any restaurant in which I have eaten.",Macaroni and Beef,5

They knew, however, that there was a beautiful field of valuable Flurd just on the other side of the hill, and if they could get their hands on some of that Flurd, their lives would improve immeasurably.

Unfortunately, there was a large, foul-tempered Ogre who lived on the top of the hill and guarded that Flurd night and day. 

The Trids tried everything to get over the hill to the fields of Flurd. They charged up the hill in great numbers. Didn't matter; the disgusting Ogre kicked them all back down the hill. They attempted to sneak past the Ogre at night. Didn't matter; the despicable Ogre kicked them all back down the hill. They attempted a flanking maneuver; some Trids running to the left of the Ogre and others to the right. Didn't matter; the revolting Ogre kicked them all back down the hill. 

No matter what they tried, the damned Ogre kicked the Trids back down the hill. 

One day, as the Trids were moping around at the base of their hill, a small rabbit happened upon them. ""Why so sad, Trids?"" asked the rabbit. 

The Trids sadly told the rabbit about the beautiful Flurd on the other side of the hill, and how the terrible Ogre kicked them down the hill no matter how hard they tried to get to the other side.

""How about I try?"" said the rabbit.

""Go ahead,"" said the Trids miserably. ""But I don't think you'll have any luck.""

So the rabbit hopped up the hill, approaching the Ogre. The Ogre ignored him. The rabbit hopped right alongside the Ogre. Still no reaction from the Ogre. The rabbit hopped right past the Ogre, and the Ogre did nothing!

So the rabbit hopped down the hill, gathered as much Flurd as he could hold in his short rabbit arms, and hopped back up the hill. He then hopped right in front of the Ogre, holding the Flurd right in front of him.

The Ogre opened one eye, sighed, and closed it again.

""Excuse me, Mr. Ogre,"" said the rabbit, ""but how is it that you let me hop right past you and take as much Flurd as I can carry, but you kick the Trids down the hill whenever they get close to you?""

And the Ogre said, ""Silly rabbit, kicks are for Trids.""

The bird is upset and dive bombs the farmer and the mule all day. The farmer only gets half the plowing done that day.
 
Next morning, the nest is back. Again the farmer rips out the nest. And again the bird harassed the farmer all day. Once again he only gets half of the plowing done. 

Perplexed he goes to see  his grandfather and explains what is going on. 

His grandfather tells him that the same thing happened to him back in the day and that he solved the problem by rubbing soft cake yeast (not that powdered stuff) into the mule’s mane at night. Works like a charm says the old man. 

Desperate, the farmer rubs cake yeast into the mule’s mane that night. 

Next morning, no nest and the farmer gets a full day’s plowing in.

While the disparity between the average gamer and the very best gamer is lost on the layperson, he assured her that the gap was incredibly vast. 

The average viewer lacks the capacity to perceive this difference in skill, and indeed, part of being so damn good at what you do is making it look easy and seamless. Honing your craft requires years of dedication, sacrifice, discipline, repetition, strategic ingenuity, clever thinking...in short, you practically have to live and breathe video games. The gamer explained how he had sacrificed multiple friendships in pursuit of this single-minded goal to be the best. He even personally designed practice routines and finger training exercises for whatever he struggled with on a particular day, whether it be reaction speed, accuracy of input sequences, precision of movement, etc. At night, he would dream of simulated scenarios that may occur in his games and appropriately respond to them, effectively practicing while sleeping. It was an all-consuming path and his brain was an engine that kept running.

He claimed that he used to think he was great at video games because he was the best in his neighborhood, and then the best in his circle of friends, but that with the advent of the internet and online games, he quickly realized that his skills were far from the best. He began to study the play of the REAL best gamers who time and time again would prove their mettle on the world stage, bringing home championship after championship. He wasn't delusional enough to continue thinking he was the best, but he was convinced that with enough practice, that could be him one day.

At this point the girl was rather impressed. ""That's so funny, I never thought of it that way, but I guess you're right. It's just like being good at anything else really.

The spy was initially hesitant to rendezvous at the beach, as she preferred more secluded settings where she had a chance to blend in with the crowd. On the beach, this was not possible, as she possessed an unrivaled figure that would be sure to attract attention from horny onlookers. But the spy recognized the futility of her efforts to persuade her stubborn friends so she ultimately decided to dress as modestly as possible in hopes of deflecting unwelcome eyes. It didn't work. She was the only person within a five-mile radius who came overdressed for the occasion. The artist noticed that there were a group of teenagers playing volleyball nearby and went over to ask them if he could join. The basketball player was puzzled by his friend's initiative, as everyone considered the artist something of a recluse. Perhaps the sun worked in mysterious ways and inspired in the artist what little social sensibility he could muster. The spy didn't think much of the gesture and turned her attention to the basketball player. ""Why don't you go join them?"" She asked. ""After all, you're a professional athlete."" ""You know why"" responded the basketball player. ""I most certainly do not"" replied the spy. ""In that case, I'm not going to tell you."" The day was growing old and the three friends said their goodbyes before retreating to their abodes. The spy reclined on her love seat and had a glass of wine while putting on her favorite record. The artist sat in his attic and painted a scene inspired by the day's events on the beach. He would take intermittent breaks to meditate and reflect. By the time he was finished with his painting, it was so marvelous and captured the authentic feeling of his experience on the beach so accurately that it was almost too beautiful to bear. He was impressed by his ability to directly translate his complicated emotions to the canvas and vowed to never grow complacent or satisfied with his progress for fear of resigning himself to idleness. Across town, the basketball player reached her home. That's the joke, the basketball player is a woman. You don't have to like it.","A spy, an artist, and a basketball player are chewing the fat on the beach",0

One night, she follows him, all the way to the rich neighborhood on the other side of town. She watches as he rips out a fence from the front lawn of a house, and lays it down next to its foundations. Just before he leaves, she confronts him.

""Why have you been destroying other people's fences?"" she asks.

""They will pay me the next day to fix it,"" Sandy answers, ashamed. ""Rich people can give me up to £100 just for putting their fence back.""

Lil Johnny’s teacher had been warned never to make a bet with him unless she was absolutely sure she would win. 

One day Lil John came up to her and bet $50 that he could guess the color of her panties. The teacher thought for a moment and then said, “sure, come see me after class and we will find out.” The teacher is pretty sure she can win, but just to be safe she went to the bathroom and took off her panties out from under her skirt then went back to class. 

After class Lil John went up to her and she told him he could guess now. Lil Johnny thought for a few seconds then guessed blue. The teacher smiled and said no. Lil John asked her to prove it, the teacher lifted up her skirt to prove that she was not wearing panties. Lil Johnny said, “okay you won fair and square, come out to my dad’s car he will have your $50.” 

When they got out to the teacher explained that his son had made a bet with her that he could guess the color of her panties and lost and that she proved it by showing him that she had none on. The dad said, “that little shit, he bet me $100 this morning that he would see his teacher without clothes on by the end of the day.”",Lil Johnny &amp; the Bet,21

They snuck up one night, and in their masses, surrounded the sleeping calf, and swam away, carrying him miles away from his father. 

Safe to say, when the whale awoke, he was distraught. He swam and swam, searching everywhere, but to no avail. 'WHERE IS MY SON' he bellowed, disturbing fish everywhere. This distress caught the attention of a wise old sea turtle. 

'I saw your son', said the turtle swimming over to the whale, 'he was kidnapped by krill. I think I can take you to him'

Grateful, the whale accepted this offer, and the pair set out, searching hastily. After many hours of fruitless looking, they came to a large white cloud, and they came to a stop. The turtle looked sombre. 

'I have bad news', he said mournfully. 'The krill have used their surprisingly adequate war skills once again. They have lactated so much, that they have created this giant, impenetrable white cloud. It's so wide, so high, so thick. I'm so sorry, but it's over.'

The whale would not accept this. 'I'll swim through it! He said'

'No', returned the turtle. The milk is bizarrely poisonous for whales. 

'Okay then, we'll wait for it to disperse, then we can go after them again!', the wale countered

'It will take days!' cried the turtle. The cloud is miles wide, and miles thick. There's no hope.

'Alright then, can't I go over it, can't I even look over it?', the whale nearly sobbed in desperation.

The turtle looked him dead in the eye. 'You don't understand. There's no use spying over krill milk'",The scariest and most feared whale in the entire ocean had his son kidnapped by krill... (an original joke),51

Adviser: So, logic says if you have a weed-eater you probably own a lawn-mower, too. Do you? 

Larry: Yes

Adviser: So, logic says if you own a lawn-mower, you probably own a house with a lawn. 

Larry: Yes I do. 

Adviser: So logic says if you own a house, you probably have  a family. 

Larry: Yeah I have a family. I have a wife and a kid.

Adviser: Well, in that case, logic says if you have a wife that you're hetero-sexual. 

Larry: Absolutely. I think I see where this is going. Thanks for your help.

Larry goes back outside and meets with David.

Larry: Well, it's kind of hard to explain, but, do you have a weed-eater?

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested.. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.""

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1,500!"" she cried,""$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.""",Your DUCK IS DEAD,19159

I noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty. She told me that she hadn’t eaten for three days. So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night. The ones you wouldn’t eat because you’re afraid you’ll put on weight. The poor thing devoured them in moments!

Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so I threw them away. Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don’t wear because you say they are too tight.

I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don’t wear because I don’t have good taste. I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don’t wear just to annoy her and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don’t wear because someone at work has a pair the same.”
