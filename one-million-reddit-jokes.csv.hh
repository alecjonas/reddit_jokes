Smurfette was doing her thing one day, when her body decided she was a woman now and her first period came along. Not knowing what the hell was happening and with no other ladies to talk to for advice, she naturally became a bit concerned and decided to consult with her fellow Smurfs about the issue. Her first choice was Strong Smurf, who she pulls aside for a private chat.

- ""Strong Smurf, Strong Smurf, you've got to help me, I'm bleeding and it won't stop and I don't know what to do!""  
- ""Ok ok Smurfette, calm down. You're still walking around and conscious so it can't be that bad. Let me take a look and we'll get it sorted.""

So Smurfette discreetly pulls up her dress and shows Strong Smurf what's going on. Strong Smurf's jaw hits the floor, his eyes widen and he stammers out in shock:

""Holy crap Smurfette, that looks really bad! Oh man, I am NOT the right Smurf to handle this, Jesus H. Christ run to Smarty Smurf, he's the smartest of us all, surely he'll know what you need to do! Run, run, go!""

Smurfette, now in a full panic, races to Smarty Smurf's place and bursts through the door. Bawling her eyes out, she manages to gather her wits enough to be able to communicate.

- ""Smarty Smurf, Smarty Smurf, help me! Help me pleeeease! I'm bleedinganditwon'tstopandStrongSmurfsaysit'sseriousandIdon'tknowwhattodoooooohoohooooo!!""  
- ""Smurfette, Smurfette, calm down, it's ok! You're here with me now, there's nothing in the world that I don't know, we'll get to the bottom of this! You'll be right as rain in no time, trust me. Besides, you're still walking around and conscious so it can't be that bad! Show me the wound, and I'll fix it all up right away.""

So Smurfette pulls up her dress again and gives Smarty Smurf a good look. Smarty Smurf's breath catches in his throat as he examines the area, he starts shaking as his powerful mind tries to process the grisly sight.

""Oh my fucking god Smurfette, never in all my years have I ever seen or heard of something like this! I'm so sorry I have absolutely no idea what the problem could be, I can't help you. Run, run to Papa Smurf, he's the wisest and most experienced Smurf in the village, I'm sure he'll know what is wrong and what you need to do!""

Smurfette is now convinced she's at death's door, that she's going to bleed out and pass away to Smurf heaven. Distraught, she hammers on Papa Smurf's door and falls into his arms when he opens it for her.

- ""PAPA SMUUUURFFF,"" she wails, convinced that this is the end, ""help me, help me, you've got to help me! I'm bleeding and it won't stop! I went to Strong Smurf and Smarty Smurf but neither of them could help! I'm so scared, am I going to die? Help me please, you're my last and only hope!""  
- ""Now now, Smurfette, it's ok, it's ok! Strong Smurf and Smarty Smurf don't have my experience in this world, I'm certain I can fix whatever's wrong. Calm down, and show me where it's bleeding so I can figure it all out and heal you up right away!""

Smurfette pulls up her dress again. Sobbing, shaking with fear, barely able to stay standing, she awaits the final verdict.

Papa Smurf takes one look and screams: ""HOLY FUCK GOD ALMIGHTY SMURFETTE SOME MOTHERFUCKER RIPPED YOUR COCK OUT BY THE ROOT!!!!""",Smurfette has her first period,11

After dodging the agent for weeks, his family convinced him to go get a lawyer and go talk to the irs agent. 

The guy goes to see the lawyer and they ride together to the IRS office to see what the problem is. 

The IRS agent meets the guy and tells him he has dozens of huge lumps of income with no taxes paid and no explanation. These were deposits of 1000, 5000, even 75000 dollars. 

The guy listened and offered an explanation. “I make bets with people, and I tend to win”

The IRS agent found this very hard to believe. “You expect me to believe that?  Someone make a 75 grand bet and paid it?”

The guy offered an example. “I’ll bet you a thousand bucks right now that I can bite my own eye”

The IRS agent thought to him self and accepted the bet. Thinking it was impossible. 

So the guy took out his glass eye, bit it, and put it back in his head. 

The IRS was shocked

The guy offered another bet. “You don’t know me and that was unfair. I’ll bet you 5 grand I can bite my other eye”

The IRS agent thought that would surely be impossible. He saw the man drive to his office with the lawyer. And he was the one driving. So he accepts the bet. 

The guy then takes out his false teeth, bites his other eye and puts them back in his mouth. 

The IRS agent was shocked. 

The guy offered him a way to break even. 

“I’ll bet you 6 thousand dollars I can pee into that coffee cup on your desk from across the room without getting a drop on the floor”

Thinking it’s impossible and wanting his money back he accepts again.

She remembered it the morning of the bake sale, and after rummaging through cabinets she found an angel food cake mix and quickly made it while drying her hair and dressing and helping her son Bryan pack up for Scout camp. But when Alice took the cake from the oven, the center had dropped flat and the cake was horribly disfigured. Oh dear, she said, theres no time bake another cake.

This cake was so important to Alice because she did so want to fit in at her new church and in her new community of new friends.

So, being inventive, she looked around the house for something to build up the center of the cake. Alice found it in the bathroom: a roll of toilet paper. She plunked it in and then covered it with icing. Not only did the finished product look beautiful, it looked perfect!

Before she left the house to drop the cake by the church and head for work, Alice woke her daughter Amanda and gave her some money and specific instructions to be at the bake sale the minute it opened at 9:30 and to buy this cake and bring it home.

When the daughter arrived at the sale, she found that the attractive, perfect cake had already been sold! Amanda grabbed her cell phone and called her mother.

Alice was horrified. She was beside herself. Everyone would know! What would they think of her? She would be ostracized, talked about, ridiculed.

That night Alice was lying awake in bed thinking about people pointing their fingers at her and talking about her behind her back.

The next day Alice promised herself that she would try not to think about the cake and she would attend the fancy luncheon/bridal shower at the home of a friend of a friend and try to have a good time there.

She did not really want to attend because the hostess was a real snob who more than once had looked down her nose at Alice because Alice was a single parent and not from one of the founding families of Tuscaloosa.

Having already RSVPed, she could not think of a believable excuse to stay away.

The meal was elegant, the company was definitely upper crust Old South . . . .

To Alices horror, the cake in question was presented for dessert!

Alice felt the blood drain from her body when she saw it being brought in. She started out of her chair to rush to the hostess and tell her all about it, but before she could get to her feet, the Mayors wife said, What a beautiful cake!

Alice, who was still stunned, sat back in her chair when she heard the hostess (who was a prominent church member) say, Thank you, I baked it myself.

Alice smiled and thought to herself, God is good.",Church bake sale,15

“Normally, I’d kill the three of you on the spot for stealing from me! But, I see you are travelers, so perhaps you were not aware of the laws of this land, so I have elected not to execute you. You aren’t free to go, however, as you must atone for your sins. I have decided to give you a severe punishment based off your occupation instead.”

“I’m a fireman.” He says, so the tent owner and his crew burn his penis off. 

The tent owner walks up to the second man and asks what he does for a living.

“I’m a lumberjack.” He says, so the tent owner and his crew chop his penis off.

The tent owner walks up to the third man, but before he could ask what he does for a living, he began to laugh.

Before he signs up, he is required to sign a waiver and is warned about the intensity of this plan. Still he signs up. The next morning, waiting at the door, is a hulking 300 pound muscle man with nothing but a pair of running shoes, a raging erection, and a sign around his neck that says, ""If I catch you, you're mine!""

And as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.

But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.

Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.

Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.

But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.

Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""

Curious, Attila did as he asked.

Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.

""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.

Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.

To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,

""Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun",The story goes that Attila used to collect exotic animals that he found during his conquests,145

There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.  


His one bottle of water ran out, and he poured a whole bottle of windshield wiper fluid into his bottle. He keeps crawling through the desert until nighttime. Once that happened, he started to feel groggy and tired, and soon after he passes out. When he wakes up, he feels the ground is cold and hard, and he opens his eyes. He sees that the ground is made of stone, and then looks in front of him, and sees a huge snake wrapped around a rod of some sort. The man screams and the snake says, ""SHHH! Don't worry! I'm not going to hurt you!""

""Who are you?"", the man asks.

""I'm Nate,"" the snake replied. ""And who are you?"" the snake asked.

""Oh! Um, my name's Jack.""

""Well Jack, you're in the Garden of Eden, and in case you were wondering, this stick I'm curled around is the Staff of Life. It's a lever, and if I pull it, it will end all of humanity. I've been sitting here ever since the dawn of time, and I'm going to have to guard this with my life until I die, so this job can be passed on to my son, who's name is Sammy, and in fact, I want you to meet him. Sammy!"" Nate yelled, and a 4-foot long rattlesnake came from a pile of rocks and slithered up to the base of the lever.

""Hi!"" the young one said to Jack.

""Hello! And you're Sammy, named after Samuel, I assume?"" Jack responded, and Sammy nodded his head.

""Jack, could you do a favor for me and show Sammy around the world? When he went the first time, he told me about his adventures and I wanted to go so badly and see the world, you know? I wanted to go see it all, the grand canyons and the  cities and the forests. Could you do that for me? I want him to see it before he's stuck here for eternity, like me."" Nate asked Jack.

""Yeah, sure!"" Jack answered.

Nate looked back at Sammy, and Sammy said, ""Oh yeah! I've gotta go pack! I'll be ready in a bit!"" He left back to his pile of rocks.

Nate looked back at Jack, and said ""I want only two things-one, show Sammy around the world until he's ready to come back, and two, I want you to kill me It's my time to die.""

Jack was now a little depressed, but he said ""Ok.""

By this time Sammy was ready to leave and go out to the big world, so Sammy told his dad good bye and Nate told Jack which way to go to get back to his hometown, and the two of them left.

They went all around the world and did some really fun things. A few years later, Sammy wanted to go back home, but Jack remembered what he had to do to Nate after all those years, so he said no, and they went around the world for a couple more years, and then they went back to see Nate.

Well, Jack decided to be an idiot, and he drove his new car into the desert again. On the way back to Nate's lever (Somehow, he remembered it after all these years), he started skidding in the sand. This went on until he made it back to Nate. Nate was sleeping about 10-20 feet away from the lever, and Jack was directly into the lever's path. But he realized there was a path that led directly into Nate. Jack had to choose between killing his old friend or ending all humanity, so he said ""BETTER NATE THAN LEVER!"", and drove over Nate.","So, there's a man crawling through the desert.",9

The man certainly isn't going to pass this up. ""What are the three tests?""

""Pay first. Those are the rules,"" says the bartender. So the man gives him the $10 and the bartender drops it into the jar.

""O.K.,"" the bartender says. ""Here's what you need to do:

First, you have to drink an entire gallon of pepper tequila, the whole thing, all at once and you can't make a face while doing it.

Second, there is pit bull chained up out back with a sore tooth. You have to remove the tooth with your bare hands.

Third, there's a 90 year old woman upstairs who has never reached orgasm during intercourse. You've got to make things right for her.""

The man is stunned. ""I know I paid my $10, but I'm not an idiot! I won't do it. You have to be nuts to drink a gallon of pepper tequila and then do those other things!""

As time goes on the man has a few drinks, then a few more, and he asks, ""Where's zat tequila?""

He grabs the gallon with both hands and downs it with a few big slurps. Tears are streaming down both cheeks, but he doesn't make a face.

Next, he staggers out back where the pit bull is chained-up and soon the people inside the bar hear a huge, noisy scuffle going on outside.

They hear the pit bull barking, the guy screaming, the pit bull yelping and then silence.

One of them picks it up, rubs it, and out pops a Genie. It booms “You have finally freed me after all these years, so I’ll grant each one of you 3 wishes.” The first guy immediately blurts out “I want a billion dollars.” POOF, he’s holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says “I want to be the richest man alive.” POOF, he’s holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says “I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life.” POOF, his arm starts rotating. The Genie tells them it’s time for their second wish. First guy says: “I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth.” POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. Second guy says “I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want.” POOF, his looks change and the first guy’s wife immediately starts flirting with him. Third guy says “I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die.” POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. First guy does, and after a while says “I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die.” POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don’t bother him any more. Second guy says “I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever.” POOF, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says “My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth.” POOF, he’s now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.
Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: “I’ve invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I’ve never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.” Second guy smiles and says “Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I’m still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven’t aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.” Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

Two days later, Mick is back at work, better than ever. Working away at his sawbench, he trips and falls once again, severing his leg on the spinning blade. Again, Paddy packs the limb in a bag, with a bit of ice from the freezer, and sends Mick and his leg off to the hospital.

Two days pass, and Mick is back at work, leg and arm working like nothing ever happened. Mick's sawmill is spinning, splitting logs and carving planks. Mick's clumsiness gets the better of him again, and he falls face first into the blade, removing his head cleanly from his shoulders. 

Starting to get sick of this, Paddy sighs, picks up Mick's head, puts it in a bag with ice, and ships it off to the hospital in the ambulance. 

Later that night, Paddy is at home, wondering when Mick will be able to return to work, when the phone rings.

""Hello, is this Paddy? It's the hospital, we have some bad news.""

Paddy was shocked. ""What's wrong?""

""Well Paddy, we had a team of the finest surgeons on the case, but we were unable to save Mick.""

A cab driver picks up a Nun in  San Francisco  . She gets into the cab, and notices that the VERY handsome cab driver won't stop staring at her. 

She asks him why he is staring. He replies: 'I have a question to ask, but I don't want to offend you.' 

She answers, 'My son, you cannot offend me. When you're as old as I am and have been a nun as long as I have, you get a chance to see and hear just about everything. I'm sure that there's nothing you could say or ask that I would find offensive.' 

'Well, I've always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me.' 

She responds, 'Well, let's see what we can do about that: #1, you have to be single and #2, you must be Catholic.' 

The cab driver is very excited and says, 'Yes, I'm single and Catholic!' 
 
'Ok' the nun says. 'Pull into the next alley.' 

The nun fulfills his fantasy with a kiss that would make a hooker blush. 

But when they get back on the road, the cab driver starts crying. 

'My dear child,' said the nun, 'Why are you crying?' 

'Forgive me but I've sinned. I lied and I must confess; I'm married and I'm Jewish.' 

The nun says, 'That's OK. My name is Kevin and I'm going to a Halloween party.'

After the preacher finishes up his work he heads to the butcher shop. He walks in and tells the butcher he wants the best ham they have. The butcher replies ""Well that's a Dam ham.""

So I worked at a metal production facility. On the day I started I got bored out of my mind and was just wandering around the place, so I start up a conversation with the guy right beside me (he's the guy that makes sure the machine is producing the right things, while I am the guy that operates the machine) and then we get into an argument and it's over which metal is best. I choose steel, and he chooses platinum. For the past 8 years, we've become quite good friends but we have this same conversation everyday, and eventually some of our other co-workers join in on the conversation, giving great reasons for all the different metals, but I stick with steel. Now recently the entire factory announced this shitty plan that now there will be a new schedule so it's like now we've been moved to completely different jobs and somehow, me and this guy just happen to be working together still, and a few days pass and I've had enough of this conversation, and this light-hearted conversation became violent. Everyone just gets these rods of metal and we just start bashing everything, machines break, bruises on everyone. Luckily no-one died but it was crazy. It was the craziest bar fight I've ever been in, to be sure. A few days later, and I get fired for starting all if this, and my life goes down hill fast, my wife and I got divorced and took everything from me, just to get in my face. I tried to keep at least a bit with my kids but now they despise me for what I did, and now I'm just living in a pit. Next day, I change everything. I start my own company, and I now make high quality gear. I make tools out of steel, but my financial success mostly comes from the other part of my company, which is some of the best wedding rings in the world. What's great is that the manager of that part is the guy from earlier, who also went through the same sort of thing, and he was a key factor in the rings, since he decided the materials, and chose gold, which I think is pretty Iron-ic",My current situation,2

“I’ll kiss ya” he replies.

“Really? You’d do that?” She says in excitement.

“Sure!” He says as he kneels down and gives her a tasteful kiss.

“Thank you so much!” She says, 
and the man continues to walk down the beach.

He doesn’t get far when he once again hears crying. He turns back and sure enough it’s the same woman crying again.

“What’s the matter? I thought you got what you wanted?” He asks.

“Well... I’ve also never been fucked before” she says.

“Ahhhhhh, I think I can fix that” he says as he lifts her up and carries her toward the water.

""Well, what was the word?"" She asks.

""Raspberry.""

The teacher is shocked that the student would say such a thing. ""That kind of language is not acceptable. Go to the principal's office right now.""

So the kid goes into the principal's office. The principal asks the kid, ""I heard you got in trouble for saying something on the playground. Can you tell me what exactly happened?""

""Well, I heard someone use a word on the playground and I didn't know what it meant so I asked my teacher what it was and she told me to see you.""

The principal, curious what the word was, asks the kid what it was he said.

""Raspberry.""

The principal frowns at the boy. ""Well, I am going to need to suspend you for talking like that.""

Since he was suspended, the child walks home and waits for his mother to arrive. When she gets home, she inquires about why he was suspended. 

""Well, I heard someone use a word on the playground and I didn't know what it meant so I asked my teacher what it was and she told me to see the principal, and he suspended me for saying it.""

""That seems a bit drastic. What was the word, son?""

""Raspberry.""

""Oh dear,"" says the mother. ""Go to your room. When your father gets home he is going to deal with you.""

The kid heads to his room and waits for his father. Thirty minutes later, his dad enters the room. ""Now what's going on?"" He asks.

""Well, I heard someone use a word on the playground and I didn't know what it meant so I asked my teacher what it was and she told me to see the principal, and he suspended me for saying it. I told mom and she sent me to my room and told me you would deal with me.""

""Yes, your mother did seem quite upset with you. But you know how women are. They tend to overreact. What was the word, anyway?""

""Raspberry.""

The father's face turns red. ""That's it! No child of mine would talk like that! Leave my house this instant!""

The kid leaves and a cop sees him wandering the streets. ""It's a bit late for a young kid like yourself to be out. Why are you here so late?""


""Well, I heard someone use a word on the playground and I didn't know what it meant so I asked my teacher what it was and she told me to see the principal, and he suspended me for saying it. I told mom and she sent me to my room and told me that dad would deal with me. He kicked me out for saying it.""

""What was the word?""

""Raspberry.""

On go the cuffs and the kid is in the back seat of the police car. When the time for his trial comes, the judge asks the kid for his side of the story. 

""Well, I heard someone use a word on the playground and I didn't know what it meant so I asked my teacher what it was and she told me to see the principal, and he suspended me for saying it. I told mom and she sent me to my room and told me that dad would deal with me. He kicked me out for saying it. I was found by a cop wandering the streets and when I told him, he arrested me.""

""I see. Now, what was the word in question?""

""Raspberry, your honor,"" the kid answers.

The judge brings the gavel down. ""Guilty! The plaintiff is subject to 30 years hard labor."" 

Thirty years later, the kid, now a man, is released from his sentence. A curious businessman passing by as he walks out asks what he was in for. 

""Well, I heard someone use a word on the playground and I didn't know what it meant so I asked my teacher what it was and she told me to see the principal, and he suspended me for saying it. I told mom and she sent me to my room and told me that dad would deal with me. He kicked me out for saying it. I was found by a cop wandering the streets and when I told him, he arrested me. The judge convicted me for thirty years of hard labor.""

""Wow! That's quite a sentence. Would you mind telling me what the word was that did you in thirty years ago?""

""Raspberry.""

Upon hearing that, the businessman throws a blow at the offender. He's knocked out. Several hours later, when he comes to with a pounding headache. He heads to the doctor across the street.

Bam! The man is hit by a bus as he crosses.

And the moral of this is to look both ways before crossing the street.",A kid hears a word on a playground...,5

""Waiter,"" the man protested. ""I appreciate the offer, but where are the menus?""

""Ah, surely you saw the sign outside, sir.."" the waiter chuckled. ""We employ only the finest psychics in the country.""

""So that sign is telling the truth?"" The man inquired further. ""Your staff really are psychic?""

""Of course,"" replied the waiter. ""For instance, our *maître d'* knew you were going to enter our establishment before you even saw the sign... you are at a 'table for one', no?""

""I just thought he was very observant."" said the man. ""What about the chefs?""

""They are psychic too, sir."" replied the waiter. ""All our chefs are so skilled with their telekinetic abilities, that they can cook and prepare all their meals with just the power of their mind.""

The man looked over at the window towards the kitchen, now noticing the vast number of ingredients and utensils moving around in the air, all seemingly on their own. ""I see... and you yourself, if you don't mind me asking?""

""Oh, but of course, sir."" the waiter chuckled. ""I am one of the best telepathics you'll ever meet. The second I saw you, I knew exactly which drink to get you.. unless you wish to prove me wrong..."" The waiter began to remove the cork on the wine bottle, and poured the man a glass.  
Nervously, the man picked up the glass and brought the liquid to his lips. After one sip, he was completely astonished: The perfect grape, the perfect vintage, the perfect notes and everything else in between! It was if he had been transported right into the vineyard! He had never had a wine like this before!

""Well, waiter,"" the man said. ""You have me sold. I'd like to order now, if that's fine with you.""

""Don't tell me sir..."" said the waiter. ""You'll be having the steak?""

""Of course."" replied the man. ""And I have full faith in your staff.""

With that, the waiter began to walk away towards the kitchens, making small notes in a small book.  
The man, meanwhile, was beginning to get a little excited. He took another sip of wine just to make sure- no, it was still as perfect as before. He didn't even mind how long his meal needed to take - he was no culinary master himself, but he at least knew good food took time.

Soon, the waiter returned to the table, placing down a plate of steak in front of the man. ""I hope you enjoy your meal, sir.""

Thanking the waiter, the man looked down at the plate before him, and started to worry. Was everything the waiter said before true? He never actually *saw* the kitchen staff prepare his meal... what if they got it wrong?  
He took his knife and fork and cut himself a piece. It seemed to be the right colour inside for him.  
But was it just the manner of how much it was cooked that they took into account? Did they factor in flavour? Seasoning? The right cut of meat? Anxiously, he took a bite...

He was six years old. The sun had just set on a short December afternoon and was on his way home from school. He walked into his house where his parents had spent all day been preparing a roast meal; the various smells of stocks, herbs and spices having been making their way all through the house for hours. After setting down his books, he made his way to the table, where a cut of meat had been waiting at his seat. He took a cut and bit into it, savouring in every chew-

-He was back in the restaurant, utterly shocked. The tastes, the flavours, the herbs, the textures; his mother said it was a secret recipe, impossible to reproduce.. but here it was, as plain as day.  
He heard the waiter approach his table one more time with another bottle; not of wine, but of something that, even to the untrained eye, looked remarkably stronger, as well as an appropriately-shaped glass to match.

""Is everything to your tastes, sir?""

The man looked down at the plate in front of him. ""Waiter, I'm going to be completely honest with you. This is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best steak I have eaten in years. I want to meet the chef who prepared this so I can thank them personally.""

""But, of course sir."" replied the waiter. ""Wait here while I fetch him for you.""

A few more minutes passed as the man's plate got emptier and emptier until no steak remained, until the waiter returned one more time, and he was not alone.

""You wished to speak with me, sir?""

The man looked up to see the chef. Excited, he practically jumped out of his seat.

""Chef,"" he began. ""For years, in all the steaks I have had, none has ever compared to the one I have just eaten. Tell me, how did you do it? I never thought I would ever be easting such a fine cut of meat for the rest of my life!""

""It's all very simple."" replied the chef. ""With my precognitive abilities, I knew you would be heading in here weeks ago. So I took a cut of meat and have been stewing it in flavours that I had measured down using my telekinesis to the molecular level, taking extra care to handle the meat itself so that no cut was wasted. I took one look at the waiter and, using my own telepathy, knew instantly you were here. After some final preparations, I added the right amount of garnishes, and sent it out to be served. I will admit though, it's highly uncommon for a psychic like me to be skilled in many different facets of psychic abilities, no less one who knows how to cook.""

The man was stunned. He had never seen a person like this before, let alone what they were capable of. He reached out to shake the chef's hand.

""Chef, I admire - nay, envy - your ability to not only know your customers before even meet them, but also to know how to cook a steak...

*...Rare medium, well done.*""",A man walks past a restaurant that claims its staff are psychic...,8

The boy finished his lunch quickly and asked his mom if he could go play in the play area. The restaurant had a special little play area at the side with some tunnels, a slide and a ball pit for kids, filled with plastic balls.

She watched as the boy crawled through the tunnels, went down the slide and jumped into the ball pit. He jumped up and down on the brightly colored balls, dove into them and burrowed down under them. The boy had been playing for about 10 minutes when, all of a sudden, he stopped and began to cry loudly.

The mother rushed to her son, picked him up and asked him what was wrong. The little boy just wailed and pointed to his arm. His mother pulled up his sleeve and saw two little red marks on his arm. She thought he must have just fell on something sharp, but just to be sure, she took him to the hospital.

A doctor examined the little boy in the emergency room and told the mother that the marks on her son’s arm were a snake bite. The doctor gave the boy an antidote for the snake poison and kept him in hospital overnight for observation.


 
The next day, the boy’s mother returned to the fast food restaurant to complain. She approached the counter and shouted at one of the teenagers who worked there.

“My son was bitten by a snake in your ball pit”, the woman screamed.

“You should count yourself lucky, lady”, said the teenager. “A kid got eaten by a shark in there last week”.",The Ball Pit,3
