One day, when speaking to her husband, he said:
""I need to have my apartment painted, but I work all day and I get tired. I tried to hire a professional painter but the guy asked me for the an arm and a leg ...""

At that moment, I just had a brilliant idea.

""Don't sweat it, neighbor! I'm on vacation and painting walls is my favorite hobby! It would be a pleasure to do this task.""

The guy accepted the offer and was really happy.

I don't want to brag about my conversation skills, but I barely started to paint the apartment and I already had that woman in bed with me.

But, bad luck... We were just starting and I did not expect the husband to forget his documents and that, for that reason, he had to return home at that specific moment.

The woman, listening to her husband opening the door, runs to the bathroom, and the guy enters the room and finds me, naked, at the top of the ladder, giving a few strokes on the wall.

Screaming, he asked,

-""What the fuck is this? ... You started painting in my bedroom, and naked?""

-""Fuck you, I'm working for free, so I start wherever I want!""

-""But naked? ...""

-""You really wanted me to stain my new clothes with paint?""

The device was a gun that launched a dead chicken at a plane’s windshield at approximately the speed the plane flies. The theory was that if the windshield does not crack from the impact of the chicken, it will survive a real collision with a bird during flight.

The Railroad Department heard of this device and decided to use it for testing a windshield on a locomotive they were developing.

So the Railroad Department borrowed the device, loaded a chicken and fired at the windshield of the locomotive. The chicken not only shattered the windshield but also went right through and made a hole on the back wall of the engine cab – the unscathed chicken’s head popping out of the hole. The Railroad Department was stunned and contacted the Aviation Department to recheck the test to see if everything was done correctly.

The Aviation Department reviewed the test thoroughly and sent a report. The report consisted of just one recommendation and it read “Use a thawed chicken.”",Use a Thawed Chicken....!,3

He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.
But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.
Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.
Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.
But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.
Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""
Curious, Attila did as he asked.
Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.
""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.
Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.
To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,

There he was warmly welcomed by his Russian counterpart, who wined and dined him and generally offered him the best hospitality that Russia could offer. 

On his last day, the Russian foreign minister took the African foreign minister into a room with a table on which lay a revolver. ""My comrade, since you are about to leave, I must introduce you to a custom we have here in Russia, something called Russian roulette. It is a true test of manhood and worth, and how it works is that you must take the revolver, spin the cylinders, hold the revolver to your head and then pull the trigger. Only one of the six chambers is loaded.""

The African leader, being of proud warrior stock and a courageous man, took the revolver, spun the cylinder, snapped it shut, pointed it at his head and sighed with relief when all he heard was 'click', but no shot. 

Well impressed with his bravery, he and the Russian drank vodka until the African leader had to be carried aboard his plane.

Six months later the Russian foreign minister visits the African foreign minister¹s country. The African, remembering keenly the Russian roulette he had to play previously, took the Russian into a room on the last day of his visit. In the room were six beautiful, naked young women.

""To prove your courage and manhood, see before you six of the most beautiful women from each of our tribes. This is something I call 'African roulette'. You may pick any one of them and they will give you a blowjob.""

The Russian, not too averse to this idea at all, asks the African, ""But where is the risk? To be called roulette there must be some form of risk involved.""

The African smiles broadly. ""One of the six is a cannibal.""",Russian Roulette,69

That city was filled with memories, good and bad. It was there where I won the U16 Minnesota Golf Tournament; it’s also where my father died. I am a firm believer that God has a plan for everything that happens; and three months after my father died, I met my soon-to-be wife in high school. Her name was Karen. She just moved in from Miami since her father was recently assigned as the Assistant Trainer of the Minnesota Timberwolves, and she wanted to be closer to him. During her first day of class, our teacher told her to sit in any vacant chair. She chose to sit beside me, not because of my dashingly good looks, but probably because that was the only vacant chair left. For the first few days, we didn’t talk to each other. She was very shy and never spoke a single word unless if she was reciting, she also didn’t show any emotions which was pretty odd. Since I was her seatmate, I decided that I should at least talk to her.

“Hey there, what’s your name?” I asked as I slowly leaned towards her.

“Karen, you?” She said.

“I’m Tim, nice to meet you.” I said as I shook her hand. “So, whatcha doin’ in Minnesota, aren’t you from the South?”

“Well, my dad just got a new job, and I wanted to be much closer to him.”

“I see…so, you like it here so far?”

“It’s pretty nice. It’s quieter than Miami, that’s for sure.”

“I hope you enjoy it here! I was born here so I pretty much know everything about this city.”

“Can I ask you something?” She said as she stared me in the eye. “How do you pronounce ‘Stephen’? With a short ‘e’ like ‘seven’? Or with a long ‘e’ like ‘Steven’?”

“I hear some people pronounce it with a long ‘e’ like ‘Steeephen’, but the correct pronunciation is with a short ‘e’ like ‘Stefen’.”

We continued our short conversation until the teacher told us to keep quiet. Ever since that day, we only grew closer and closer to one another. Eventually we started going out on dates, and after one year, we finally got married.

We lived in Stephen for a couple of years but we decided to move to New York so our children would have a “better living environment”. Her sister, Janice, decided to stay in Stephen since she was just days away from finishing her studies to become a pilot. Her dad, on the other hand, was fired as the Assistant Trainer of the Timberwolves. He now just lives with Janice in our old house in Stephen.

When we got to New York, we bought an apartment near the Madison Square Garden. Karen said that it would be good if our children would watch the New York Knicks games. I don’t know with her but I don’t see anything good coming out of watching a team lose 50 games in a year.

We were having a good time in New York until Karen started having these horrible nightmares.

“Hey Karen, you don’t look too good.” I asked while sitting on the dining table for breakfast. “Anything wrong?”

“Sorry, I just had this horrible nightmare.” She said.

“About what? Maybe I can help.”

“About dad and Janice in Stephen. They died.”

“What? How?”

“It all started when these golden glitters started falling down from the sky. We were having an outdoor dinner where suddenly a storm of golden glitters came. When you come in contact with even just a single glitter, you die.”

“Well, that’s not really scary if you ask me.”

“But my family still died.”

“It’s just a dream, it probably means nothing.”

The next day, she had the same dream. As usual, I thought it meant nothing. These dreams continued for the rest of the week, and I was getting fed up with it, so I decided to look up for a solution on the internet.

Upon searching for a solution, I saw this website about deciphering dreams. It was a pretty old website, probably made 15 years ago, since it had such a primitive UI. While scrolling down the website, I saw the picture of an old man. “Dream Doctor Andrew Porter” said under the picture. I decided to give him a call using the telephone number on the website, but no one answered. There was also an address written on the website, it’s probably where his clinic is.

Karen and I went to the clinic the next day. It was only a few minutes away so we didn’t need to pack any luggage. The address led us to a big, old, wooden house covered with trees. The lawn looks like it hasn’t been mowed for a century, and the walls of the house had vines growing on them. I slowly walked towards the front door. I tried my best to keep quiet but every time I step on the porch, it made this loud squeaky sound. I pressed the doorbell but it didn’t work. I pressed it again, and surprisingly, it still didn’t work. I used the door knocker that looked like the head of a cow to knock on the door, and stepped back to wait for someone to open. After some time, I heard the sound of several locks being opened behind the door. A young woman came out from behind.

“May I help you?” She asked.

“Are you Doctor Andrew Porter?” I said.

“Do I look like an Andrew to you?”

“Hey, it’s 2017, I don’t know any of this stuff anymore.”

“Anyway, I’m her daughter Claire. Come in.”

My wife and I entered the house and were surprised on how big it was inside. The walls of the house were lined with bookshelves filled with books. Everything was either covered in dust or spider webs. The house also had that old paper smell. We sat down on the dining table while a butler came in and gave us glasses of water.

“Where could I meet your dad?” I asked Claire.

“Oh, he’s dead.”

“I’m sorry to hear that. My wife and I came to visit him since I recently found out that he specializes in dreams.”

“It’s okay, I’m also a dream doctor. Anything I can help you with?”

“Well, my wife has been having these ‘nightmares’ about golden glitters which kill people.” I said.

“Golden glitters, huh? Are you sure they were gold? I’ve had people come in and talk about silver glitters, but never gold.”

“Yes, I’m pretty sure they were gold.” My wife said.

“Hmm, let me see. Usually, raining glitters means that a blessing would come, but in your case, people die when they touch it.” Claire said. “That’s really odd. Have you been taking any kind of drugs?”

“I’m not that kind of woman.”

“I should run some tests first, come with me.”

Claire made my wife drink some kind of pill. She said that it would make anyone go into deep sleep, making it easier to have dreams. After an hour, my wife woke up and said that she still had the same golden glitter dream.

“This is really weird. Are you sure that the glitters are gold? Are you colorblind?” Claire asked.

“How many times do I have to tell you? Yes, the glitters were gold, and no, I’m not colorblind. My family keeps dying because of these glitters” Karen said.

“Maybe it has something to do with your family. Do you live far away from them? Maybe because you’re homesick.”

“You might be right, I do miss them. They live in Minnesota though and the flight would be very expensive.”

I was against the idea of going back to Minnesota, since the Lakers are fighting the Knicks tomorrow and I want to see Lonzo Ball drop 20 and 20.

“Wait! My sister is a pilot for AirWay Airlines, she just got her license a few days ago.” Karen suddenly shouted. “Maybe she can fly me to Minnesota for free!”

Oh no.

“Do we really have to go, honey? I don’t want to go back to Minnesota, life is fine here in New York.” I said.

“Well if you don’t want to go, then I’m going alone.” She said.

We went back to our apartment and she packed her things and got ready to leave for Stephen, Minnesota.

“I’m taking the kids with me, Tim.” She said.

“What? Why?” I asked.

“Well, you haven’t been the most supportive father in the world. You’re just sitting on the couch all day, slacking off. You don’t even have a job for Christ’s sake.”

“Hey, that’s not true.” I said.

“Really? Ever since we got to New York, all you did was eat chips and sleep. The only time you got out of the apartment was when we went to Claire. You gained like 15 pounds in a week. This isn’t the Tim I fell in love with.”

I lowered my head, looking at the floor. Maybe she’s right, I never took parenting seriously. I should be closer to my family more.

“Do you really have to go back to Stephen? What if they weren’t glitters? Are you even sure if they were gold?” I asked.

“Yes! I’m a 100% sure they were gold. You know what, I don’t care about you anymore, goodbye.” She said as she took the kids and went to the airport.

I took this alone time to reflect on what I’ve done. I’m pretty sure I haven’t done anything THAT bad, maybe it’s just that time of the month again, but I should still at least support my wife, so I dressed up and went to the airport.
	
I took a cab to the JFK Airport, but when I got there I couldn’t find them. I spent 20 minutes searching the whole airport for my wife and kids, but still, they were nowhere to be found.
	
I then met this man with a name tag saying: “Robert Plant”. He was sitting on a bench playing a guitar. He was the kind of guy who would perform in public places to earn money.
	
“Uh, excuse me, Mr. Plant, but have you seen my wife? If I recall correctly, she was wearing a red dress, and with her were two kids.”
	
Robert stopped playing the guitar for a moment and stared me right in the eye, as if he was looking straight into my soul. It felt like he was reading my mind, looking at all the memories I had with Karen.
	
He then started playing a very familiar tone with his guitar and said: “*There’s a lady who’s sure all that glitters is gold. And she’s flying the AirWay to Stephen.*”

""Also,"" continued the Earl of Grantham, ""do you remember when Wills plucked a rose for Kate in the rose garden?""

""I was present on that occasion, My Lord, ministering to their needs.

""While Will was plucking the rose, a thorn embedded itself in his thumb very deeply.""

""I witnessed the incident, My Lord, and saw the Duchess herself remove the thorn and bandage his thumb with her own dainty handkerchief.""

""That evening the hole the rose made in his thumb was very sore. Kate had to cut his venison for him, even though it was extremely tender.""

""Yes, My Lord, I did see everything that transpired that evening.""

""And do you remember the next morning while you were pouring coffee for Her Ladyship, Kate inquired of Will in a loud voice,

'Darling, does your prick still throb?'
….and you, Carson, did not spill one drop of coffee ?

That, Carson is complete composure, or aplomb.""","The meaning of ""aplomb""",1

Again, the clerk apologizes and tells him that's just the policy. So, he goes and gets his dog then purchases the dog food.

A few days later, he comes back to get cat food. The clerk informs him they have the same policy for cats.

""Dammit, my barn cat hates people, do I really have to go back home and and get my face and hands all scratched up trying to catch him just so I can get some cat food?""

The clerk again apologies, and says he going to have to do that.

The next day the same man shows up to the store with a bag and puts it on the counter. The clerk asks what it is, and the man tells him to reach in and find out. The clerk puts his hand in, then quickly pulls it back out.

He turns on the radio and “Welcome To The Jungle” is playing, so he turns it up loud and starts singing, adrenaline coursing through his veins.  He lets out a relieving bellow of laughter. Just before the lights change, the banging on the side happens again. He jumps up, wishing he’d carried today. He breathes in and raises the shutter, ready for whatever is awaiting him. 

Before him, a young woman is panting, hands on her knees, struggling for breath, sweat pouring off her brow. She’d clearly been running, strenuously.

And when the actual battle starts they were late and tired and were easily defeated. 

The king asked his wise ministers for advise and they sent envoys to all the villages and towns and cities for someone who can help them. No one knew what to do. No one was experienced in leading an army. The general was also clueless. 

One fine day, there was a knock on the palace doors and there was a kid who claimed he can help. The king was at the end of his ideas and decided to let the kid handle the situation. The kid requested to  train the solders privately. The king obeyed. 

After sometime. There was time for battle and the soldiers were more than ready. And they actually started to give a good fight. The kid continued to train batches after batches of soldiers and they started to win battles after battles and finally the Great War was won. 

The king in the victory ceremony granted the kid his wishes. Before the kid was about to leave. The king asked. “I’m sorry but what is your name?” The kid replied “I’m Master Bator”. ",The Master,3

She and her husband, a fisherman, loved their children very much, but couldn't think what to name them. Finally, after a few days, the husbanf said,  ""Let's not decide on names right now. If we wait a little while, the names will simply come to us.""

After several weeks had passed, the couple noticed something peculiar. When left alone, one of the boys would always turn toward the sea, while the other would face inland. It didn't matter which way the parents positioned the children, the same child always faced the same direction. ""Let's call the boys Toward and Away,"" suggested the woman. Her husband agreed, and from that point on, the boys were known simply as Toward and Away.

The years passed and the lads grew tall and strong. The day came when the aging fisherman said to his sons, Boys, it is time that you learn to make a living from the sea."" The three of them fillled their ship with supplies, said goodbye, and set sail for a three month voyage. The three months passed quickly for the woman, yet the ship had not returned. Another three months, and still no ship. Three whole years passed before the grieving woman saw a lone man walking toward her house. She recognized him as her husband. 

""My goodness! What has happened to my darling boys?"" she cried. 

The ragged fisherman began to tell his story: ""We just a day out to sea when Toward hooked into a great fish. The boy fought long and hard, but the fish was more than his equal. For a whole week they wrestled upon the waves without either letting up. Yet eventually, the great fish started to win the battle, and Toward was pulled over the side of our ship. He was swallowed whole and we never saw that fish again.""

""How can a fish be big enough to swallow Toward whole?"" sobbed the woman.

""It was enormous,"" the fisherman sighed, ""but not nearly as big as the one that got Away.""",Fisherman's Tale,1

With that, the baby pops right back inside. 

“Damn!”, says the doctor. 

A short while later he sees the head push through again. 

“Are you my dad?”, asks the baby. 

“No, I am your doctor.”, he replies.

“Are you my dad?”, the baby asks of the father. 

The father replies, “Yes, little baby, I am your father!” 

The baby then reaches up and begins poking his father in the forehead with his index finger–”How do you like that?”",A pregnant woman is about to give birth.,430

post,726axs,2qh72,jokes,false,1506273114,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/726axs/dracula_in_italy/,self.jokes,,"Count Dracula, fed up with the miserable weather in Transylvania, decides to take a holiday, so he packs up his coffin and capes and heads to Rome for a long weekend.
Upon arriving at his hotel the concierge greets him and asks if has a reservation.
""Yessss,"" replies the Count.  ""I am Dracula, prince of darkness!""
The concierge consults his computer.
""Ah yes, here we are. Single room, non-smoking with balcony... We've put you in room 317.""

He hands Dracula the key.  Pocketing it, the vampire - seized by a terrible, ravenous hunger - grabs the concierge by the collar, drags him over the desk, and sinks his fangs into the poor man's neck.  After draining every last drop of blood from his victim Dracula tosses the corpse away like a ragdoll.

Meanwhile... just outside the hotel, a tourist from London is strolling by, admiring the architecture.  As he stops to examine a particularly beautiful fountain, the bloodless corpse of the concierge comes flying out of the hotel and CLOBBERS him, knocking him to the ground.

Back the hotel lobby, Count Dracula is approached by a bellboy, who offers to take the Count's suitcases and coffin up to room 317.
""Right this way Mister, um...""
""Dracula,"" the Count intones.  ""I am Count Dracula, Prince of Darkness, despoiler of virgins.""
""Nice to meet you,"" the bellboy says with a cheerful grin.  ""I'm Fabrizio.""
After lugging the cases and the coffin up three flights of stairs a profusely sweating Fabrizio opens the door to Dracula's room, puts the luggage down, and turns to the Count with an expectant look.
""Will there be anything else, sir?""
The Count thinks about this for a moment.  Then his eyes turn a hideous shade of crimson and he pulls back his lips to reveal razor sharp fangs.
""Yessss,"" the vampire hisses as he pounces on Fabrizio.  He sinks his teeth into the poor lad's neck and sucks every bit of blood from him.  

When he has finished feeding the Count looks around the room for a place to dispose of the bellboy's pale, shriveled corpse.  Finding nowhere suitable he drags it out to the balcony and tosses it over the edge, before retreating inside to unpack.

Meanwhile, the rather disorientated tourist has managed to get to his feet and is brushing himself off when - SPLAT! - the corpse of Fabrizio hits him with the force of a freight train, knocking him down to the pavement once more.

In room 317 Dracula is hanging his spare capes in the wardrobe when he hears a timid knock on the door.
""Yessss?""
""Housekeeping, sir.  Just wondered if you needed fresh linens.""

Dracula opens the door and finds himself looking down upon a rather small, mousy-looking Italian girl in a maid's uniform.  Peering at her name-tag the Count says, ""Hello Eliza.  I am Count Dracula... prince of darkness, despoiler of virgins and scourge of all that is Holy.""
""Pleased to meet you,"" Eliza replies.  ""Fresh linens?""
Dracula's gaze travels steadily up past the name-tag... coming to rest on the pale flesh of her delicate, exposed neck.
""Please... Do come in.""

Outside the hotel, our unfortunate tourist is once again coming to his senses.  Sitting on the pavement with an aching head and two bloodless corpses at his side, he has almost gathered himself enough to go and get help when he hears a woman's terrified screams from somewhere above him.  Before he can react, however, the bone-white, shriveled-up corpse of Eliza the housekeeper has come plummeting down from the balcony of room 317 and landed on top of him with a sickening THUMP!

This time, however, there is a policeman nearby.  

Witnessing the bizarre incident the policeman comes running over to see if the tourist is okay.  He helps the poor man to his feet and - noting the three victims of Dracula lying splayed at the tourist's feet - looks at the tourist, his face a mask of utter befuddlement.
""What on earth,"" the policeman asks, ""is going ON here?""
""Well sir,"" the tourist replies. ""It goes a little something like this...""

Then he begins to sing:

The first man looked very quizzically at the dog and asked why the dog was allowed on the plane.

The second man explained that he was from the Police Drugs Enforcement Agency and that the dog was a 'sniffing dog'.

""His name is Sniffer and he's the best there is. I'll show you once we get airborne, when I put him to work.""

The plane took off, and once it has levelled out, the Policeman said, ""Watch this.""

He told Sniffer to ""search"".

Sniffer jumped down, walked along the aisle, and finally sat very purposefully next to a woman for several seconds.

Sniffer then returned to his seat and put one paw on the policeman's arm.

The Policeman said, ""Good boy"", and he turned to the man and said, ""That woman is in possession of marijuana, I'm making a note of her seat number and the authorities will apprehend her when we land.""

""Gee, that's pretty good,"" replied the first man.

Once again, the Policeman sent Sniffer to search the aisles.

The Lab sniffed about, sat down beside a man for a few seconds, returned to its seat, and this time he placed two paws on the agent's arm.

The Policeman said, 'Two paws mean that man is carrying cocaine, so again, I'm making a note of his seat number for the police.'

'I like it!' said his seat mate.

The Policeman then told Sniffer to 'search' again.

Sniffer walked up and down the aisles for a little while, sat down for a moment, and then came racing back to the agent, jumped into the middle seat and proceeded to shit all over the place.

The first man was disgusted by this behaviour and couldn't figure out how or why a well-trained dog would behave like that. So he asked the Policeman, ""What's going on?""

The Policeman nervously replied, ""He's just found a bomb.""",Sniffer dog on a plane,17

There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.

He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, so he decided to start walking.

He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sunblock and pours his windshield wiper fluid into a water bottle in case he gets that desperate, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right.

He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.

By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's walked about 30 miles. That means that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He tells himself that he's got to be close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of the dunes, and that'll be all he needs.

As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.

Full dark comes before he knows it. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.

He wakes up the next morning feeling lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.

He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.

Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday, or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.

Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.

As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.

He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference.

He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick.

After a while of walking, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.

After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it. He's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.

He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.

After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going.

Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.

He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.

Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can't tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look.

He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune. After a couple sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.

So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance. He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason.

Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is, so he just keeps crawling.

His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone, in the middle of a burning desert doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface.

Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating. He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down, just imagining the whole thing.

He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling.

Crawling, he would swear that someone just said, ""Greetings, traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?""

He stops crawling. He leans back to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again - better.

Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post sticking up out of the stone at an angle. And wrapped around the post, tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.

He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from this spot.

Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.

Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet - that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.

He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here because he thought he'd heard a voice. Maybe he had actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe they were nearby.

He shakily pulls the bottle of wiper fluid out, almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips, and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then swallows it. He coughs a little. ""Hello? Is there anyone here?""

He hears, from his side, ""Greetings. What is it that you want?""

He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides to try asking for help.

""Please,"" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, ""I'd love to not be thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?""

Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its mouth, and speak. He hears it say, ""Very well. Coming up.""

A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped around the tilted white post, still looking at him.

He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet. He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes - they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been bitten. By the snake.

""It'll feel better in a minute."" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!

""Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?""

""Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,"" says the snake. ""That's the way I work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.""

""You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real?”

""No,"" says the snake, ""I'm real. As real as you are. I didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting around here.""

The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst.

""I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request,"" continued the snake. ""I can guess why you drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two.""

""Ummm, n-next request?"" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.

""That's the way it works. If you like, that is,"" explained the snake. ""You get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish."" The snake grinned at his own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.

""But there are rules,"" the snake continued. ""The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility."" The snake looks at the man seriously.

""By the way,"" the snake says suddenly, ""my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel used to call me. You can call me Nate, if you wish.""

""Umm, my name is Jack,"" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. ""Jack Samson.""

""Can I ask you a question?"" Jack says suddenly. ""What happened to the poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What do you mean by that's how you work?""

""That's more than one question,"" grins Nate. ""But I'll still try to answer all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question."" The snake's grin gets wider. ""Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink. That's what you asked for.”

""For the third question,"" Nate continues, ""you are still dying. Besides the effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. So technically you’re always dying"" Nate seemed very amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.

""As for the fourth question,"" Nate said, looking more serious, ""first you have to agree to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you.""

""So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really stop the effects of the methanol?"" Jack said.

“with the fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me, this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me, write about me, or give any information about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding anyway, so you won't notice."" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.

Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a little nervous at this. ""Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?""

Well, Jack,"" said Nate sadly, ""I can't tell you that, unless you make the second request."" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.

""Umm, well, ok,"" said Jack, ""what is this about a second request? What can I ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?""

""Sure!"" said Nate, brightening. ""You're allowed to ask for changes to yourself. They're like wishes but they can only affect you. Oh, and before you ask, I can't give you immortality. I'd probably suggest giving you permanent good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd live a very long time, barring accidents, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to recover from accidents well.”

""Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?"" said Jack. ""And keep me healthy for a long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not really a change to me?""

""Right,"" nodded Nate.

""Hmmm,"" said Jack. ""Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request, after this one?""

""Maybe,"" said Nate, ""it depends on what you decide then. There are more rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second request. You know how it goes."" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had shoulders.

""Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially. Do I need to sign in blood or something?""

""No,"" said Nate. ""Just hold out your hand. Or heel."" Nate grinned. ""Or whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said, that's how it works,"" Nate said apologetically.

Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. Despite knowing that it wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.

""Hey, Jack,"" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind him, ""is that someone else coming up over there?""

Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of nowhere? And did they bring food?

Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...

Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through his jeans...

Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. ""I would have decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to hoodwink me like that.""

""I've been doing this a long time, Jack,"" said Nate, confidently. ""You humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you - especially one my size.”

""Yeah, well, still,"" said Jack, ""it's the principle of the thing. And nobody likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or something instead?""

""More meat in the typical human butt,"" replied Nate. ""And less chance you accidentally kick me or move at the last second.""

""Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify to hear,"" answered Jack.

""Ok,"" said Nate. ""Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to just start talking?""

""Just talk,""

""Ok,"" replied Nate, still grinning.

Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second. ""You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.""

Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate skeptically.

""Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,"" said Nate. ""Stand up and look at the symbol on the rock here."" Nate gestured around the dark stone they were both sitting on with his nose.

Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in was a representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches left the trunk to reach out across the stone.

Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the sky.

Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another night out here! Arrrgh!

Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and stood next to Nate. ""In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,"" said Jack. ""Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to have to head back""

""It's about 30 miles that way."" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to the way he'd been going when he was crawling here.

Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting stuff. ""Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?""

""Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,"" said Nate. ""He figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a 'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from across the ocean. He worried about that for a while.""

""Garden of Eden, hunh?"" said Jack. ""How long have you been here, Nate?""

""A long time. It never occurred to me to count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands of years, at least,"" nate said.

""So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?"" said Jack.

""Beats me,"" said Nate. ""Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.""

""Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out of the stone there?"" asked Jack.

""Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've been here ever since.

""What is this place?"" said Jack. ""And what did he ask you to do?""

""Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?"" Nate loosened his coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but Nate was suddenly there in the way.

""You can't touch that yet, Jack,"" said Nate.

""Why not?"" asked Jack.

""I haven't explained it to you yet,"" replied Nate.

""Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,"" said Jack. ""You'd push it that way, and it would move in the slot.""

""Yep, that's what it is,"" replied Nate.

""What does it do?"" asked Jack. ""End the world?""

""Oh, no,"" said Nate. ""Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it 'The Lever of Doom'."" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and grinned.

Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned Jack laughed. ""Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it really do?""

""Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,"" smirked Nate. ""I just thought the voice I used was funny, didn't you?""

Nate continued to grin.

""A lever to end humanity?"" asked Jack. ""What in the world is that for? Why would anyone need to end humanity?""

""Well,"" replied Nate, ""Maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here.""

""Rules? What rules?"" asked Jack.

""The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human can be bound in that way at a time. That's it."" explained Nate.

Jack looked somewhat shocked. ""You mean that I could pull the lever now? You'd let me end humanity?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""if you want to."" Nate looked at Jack carefully. ""Do you want to, Jack?""

""Umm, no."" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. ""Why in the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psycho to want that! Or worse, a suicidal psycho, because it would kill him too. Has anyone ever seriously considered it?"" asked Nate. ""Any of those bound to secrecy, that is?""

""Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while. But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here."" Nate grinned some more.

Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at the same time. After a bit, he said, ""So this makes me the Judge of humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?""

""That seems to be it,"" agreed Nate.

""What kind of criteria do I use to decide?"" said Jack. ""How do I make this decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?""

""Nope,"" replied Nate. ""You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed to know.""

Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.

Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. ""Nate, was Samuel the one bound to this before me?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate. ""He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months ago.""

""Sounds like a good guy,"" agreed Jack. ""How did he handle this, when you first told him. What did he do?""

""Well,"" said Nate, ""he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and then asked me some questions, much like you're doing.""

""What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?"" asked Jack.

""He asked me about the third request,"" replied Nate.

""Aha!"" It was Jack's turn to grin. ""And what did you tell him?""

""I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out."" Nate looked serious again. ""And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.""

""Hmmm."" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.

Nate watched him, waiting.

""Nate,"" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. ""What did Samuel ask for with his third request?""

Nate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly, ""Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him.""

""Ok,"" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, ""give it to me.

Nate looked at Jack's backside. ""Give you what, Jack?""

""Give me that wisdom. As much as you can give” Jack turned to face away from Nate, bent over slightly and tensed up.

Nate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now, Jack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.

""You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like it needs it, right Jack?"" asked Nate, shifting position.

""Yeah, yeah, I got that,"" replied Jack

""And,"" continued Nate, from his new position, ""do you remember that you'll turn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?""

""Yeah, yeah...Hey, wait a minute!"" said Jack, opening his eyes, straightening up and turning around. ""Purple?!"" He didn't see Nate there. With the moonlight Jack could see that the lever extended up from its slot in the rock without the snake wrapped around it.

Jack heard, from behind him, Nate's ""Just Kidding!"" right before he felt the now familiar piercing pain, this time in the other buttock.

Jack sat on the edge of the dark stone listening to the wind stir the sand, occasionally rubbing his butt where he'd been recently bitten.

Nate had left for a little while, had come back with a desert-rodent-shaped bulge somewhere in his middle, and was now wrapped back around the lever, his tongue flicking out into the desert night's air the only sign that he was still awake.

Occasionally Jack, with his toes absentmindedly digging in the sand while he thought, would ask Nate a question without turning around.

""Nate, do accidents count?""

Nate lifted his head a little bit. ""What do you mean, Jack?""

Jack tilted his head back like he was looking at the stars. ""You know, accidents. If I accidentally fall on the lever, without meaning to, does that still wipe out humanity?""

""Yeah, I'm pretty sure it does, Jack. I'd suggest you be careful about that if you start feeling wobbly,"" said Nate with some amusement.

""Wow,"" said Jack as he leaned back until only his elbows kept him off of the stone and looked up into the sky.

""Nate, how long did Samuel live? One of his wishes was for health too, right?"" asked Jack.

""Yes,"" replied Nate, ""it was. He lived 167 years, Jack.""

""Wow, 167 years. That's almost 140 more years I'll live if I live as long. Do you know what he died of, Nate?""

""He died of getting tired of living, Jack,"" Nate said, sounding somewhat sad.

Jack turned his head to look at Nate in the starlight.

""His daughter and then his wife dying almost did him in. He didn't stay in society much longer after that. He eventually came out here to spend time talking to me and thinking about pulling the lever. A few months ago he told me he'd had enough. It was his time.""

""And then he just died?"" asked Jack.

Nate shook his head a little. ""He made his forth request, Jack. There's only one thing you can ask for the fourth request. The last bite.

After a bit Nate continued, ""He told me that he was tired, that it was his time. He reassured me that someone new would show up soon, like they always had.

After another pause, Nate finished, ""Samuel's body disappeared off the stone with the sunrise.""

Jack lay back down and looked at the sky, leaving Nate alone with his memories. It was a long time until Jack's breathing evened out into sleep.

Jack woke with the sunrise the next morning. So, after getting directions to town from Nate, making sure he knew how to get back, and reassuring Nate that he'd be back soon, Jack started the long walk back to town.

Jack caught a bus back to the city, and showed up for work the next day, and within a couple of days Jack had talked a friend with a tow truck into going back out into the desert with him to fetch the SUV. They found it after a couple of hours of searching and towed it back without incident.

Before the next weekend, Jack had gone to a couple of stores, including a bookstore, and had gotten his SUV back from the mechanic. On Saturday, Jack headed back to see Nate.

Jack parked a little way out of the small town near Nate, loaded up his new backpack with camping gear and the things he was bringing for Nate, and then started walking. Jack had brought more books for Nate. He spent the weekend with Nate, and then headed out again, telling Nate that he'd be back again soon, but that he had things to do first.

Over four months later Jack was back to see Nate again. This time he brought a laptop with him - a specially modified laptop. It had a solar recharger, special filters and seals to keep out the sand, a satellite link-up, and a special keyboard and joystick that Jack hoped that a fifteen-foot rattlesnake would be able to use.
After that Jack could e-mail Nate to keep in touch, but still visited him fairly regularly - at least once or twice a year.

Eventually, Jack started writing. Perhaps because of the wisdom, or perhaps because of his new perspective, he wrote well. People liked what he wrote, and he became well known for it. After a time, Jack bought an RV and started traveling around the country for book signings and readings.

On one of the visits Nate, Nate didn't even speak when Jack walked up to the lever. He nodded at Jack, and then went back to staring into the desert. Jack, respecting Nate's silence, sat down and waited.

After a few minutes, Nate spoke. ""Jack, I have someone to introduce you to.""

Jack looked surprised. ""Someone to introduce me to?"" Jack looked around, and then looked carefully back at Nate. ""This something to do with the Big Guy?

""No, no,"" replied Nate. ""This is more personal. I want you to meet my son."" Nate looked over at the nearest sand dune. ""Sammy!""

Jack watched as a four foot long desert rattlesnake crawled from behind the dune and up to the lever.

""Yo, Jack,"" said the new, much smaller snake.

""Yo, Sammy"" replied Jack. Jack looked at Nate. ""Named after Samuel, I assume?""

Nate nodded. ""Jack, I've got a favor to ask you. Could you show Sammy around for me?"" Nate unwrapped himself from the lever and slithered over to the edge of the stone and looked across the sands. ""When Samuel first told me about the world, and brought me books and pictures, I wished that I could go see it. I want my son to have that chance - to see the world. Before he becomes bound here like I have been. Think you can do that for me, Jack?""

Jack nodded. This was obviously very important to Nate, so Jack didn't even joke about taking a talking rattlesnake out to see the world. ""Yeah, I can do that for you, Nate. Is that all you need?"" Jack could sense that was something more.

Nate looked at Sammy. Sammy looked back at Nate for a second and then said, ""Oh, yeah. Ummm, I've gotta go pack. Back in a little bit Jack. Nice to meet ya!"" Sammy slithered back over the dune and out of sight.

Nate watched Sammy disappear and then looked back at Jack. ""Jack, this is my first son, and I had a son for a reason. I'm tired. I'm ready for it to be over. I needed a replacement.""

Jack considered this for a minute. ""So, you're ready to come see the world, and you wanted him to watch the lever while you were gone?""

Nate shook his head. ""No, Jack - you're a better guesser than that. You've already figured out - I'm bound here - there's only one way for me to leave here. And I'm ready. It's my time to die.""

Jack could understand Samuel's decision, and now Nate's. So, all Jack said was, ""What do you want me to do?""

Nate nodded. ""Thanks, Jack. I only want two things. One - show Sammy around the world - let him get his fill of it, until he's ready to come back here and take over. Two - give me the fourth request.

""I can't just decide to die, not any more than you can. I won't even die of old age like you eventually will, even though it'll be a long time from now. I need to be killed. Once Sammy is back here, ready to take over, I'll be able to die. And I need you to kill me.

""I've even thought about how. Poisons and other drugs won't work on me. And I've seen pictures of snakes that were shot - some of them live for days, so that's out too. So, I want you to bring back a sword. it should work, even on me.

""You willing to do that for me, Jack?"" Nate turned back to look at Jack.

""Yeah, Nate,"" replied Jack solemnly, ""I think I can handle that.""

Nate nodded. ""Good!"" He turned back toward the dune and shouted, ""Sammy! Jack's about ready to leave!"" Then quietly, ""Thanks, Jack.""

Jack didn't have anything to say to that, so he waited for Sammy to make it back to the lever, nodded to him, nodded a final time to Nate, and then headed into the desert with Sammy following.

Over the next several years Sammy and Jack kept in touch with Nate through e-mail. They made a goal of visiting every country in the world, and did a respectable job of it. Jack managed to keep the talking rattlesnake hidden. When they finished the tour of countries, Jack suggested that they try some undersea diving. They did. And spelunking. They did that too. Sammy finally drew the line at visiting Antarctica. He'd come to realize that Jack was stalling. So, Sammy eventually put his tail down (as he didn't have a foot) and told Jack that it was time - he was ready to go back and take up his duties from his dad. It was time to head back and see Nate.

When they got back to the US, Jack got the old RV out of storage, he loaded up Sammy, and they headed for the desert.

When they got to the small town that Jack had been trying to find those years ago when he'd met Nate, Jack was in a funk. He decided that he'd go ahead and drive the RV out there. It was only going to be this once, and Jack would go back and cover the tracks afterward. They ought to be able to make it out there by nightfall if they drove.

Jack told Sammy to e-mail Nate that they were coming as he drove out of sight of the town on the road. They then pulled off the road and headed out into the desert.

Everything went well, until they got to the sand dunes. Jack didn't really think about it, he just downshifted and headed up the first one. By the third dune, Jack started to regret that he'd decided to try driving on the sand. The RV was fishtailling and losing traction.

As they came over the top of the fourth dune, the biggest one yet, Jack saw that this was the final dune - the stone, the lever, and somewhere Nate, waited below. Jack put on the brakes, but he'd gone a little too far. The RV started slipping down the other side.

Jack tried turning the wheel, but he didn't have enough traction. He pumped the brakes - no response. They started sliding down the hill, faster and faster.

Jack felt a shock go through him as he suddenly realized that they were heading for the lever. He looked down - the RV was directly on course for it. If Jack didn't do something, the RV would hit it. He was about to end humanity.

Jack steered more frantically, trying to get traction. It still wasn't working. In a split second, Jack realized that his only chance would be once he hit the stone around the lever he’d have traction on the stone for just a second before he hit the lever - he wouldn't have time to stop, but he should be able to steer away. He'd have to time his turn just right.

The RV got to the bottom of the dune, sliding at an amazing speed in the sand. Just before they reached the stone Jack looked across it to check that they were still heading for the lever. They were. But Jack noticed something else that he hadn't seen from the top of the dune. Nate was off to the side of the lever, but still on the stone, waiting for them. The problem was, he was waiting on the same side of the lever that Jack had picked to steer towards to avoid the lever, and there was no way that Jack was going to be able to go around the lever to the other side.

Jack had an instant of realization. He was either going to have to hit the lever, or run over Nate. He glanced over at Sammy and saw that Sammy realized the same thing.

Jack took a firmer grip on the steering wheel as the RV ran up on the stone. Shouting to Sammy as he pulled the steering wheel, ""Better Nate than lever!"", he ran over the snake.

A black hearse was followed by a second black hearse about 50 feet behind the first one.  Behind the second hearse was a solitary Italian man walking a dog on a leash.  Behind him, a short distance back, were about 200 men walking in single file.

The Jewish man couldn't stand the curiosity.  He respectfully approached the Italian man walking the dog and said: ""I am so sorry for your loss, and this may be a bad time to disturb you, but I've never seen an Italian funeral like this.  Whose funeral, is it?""

""My wife's.""

''What happened to her?""

""She yelled at me and my dog attacked and killed her.""

He inquired further, ""But who is in the second hearse?""

“My mother-in-law. She came to help my wife and the dog turned on her and killed her also.""

It was a very poignant and touching moment of Jewish and Italian brotherhood.  Silence passed between the two men.

The Jewish man then asked ""Can I borrow the dog?""

The Italian man replied, ""Get in line.""",An Italian funeral,25704

The bartender graciously pours the woman another stiff martini and slides it over.

Gimme another drooble martuni, and this time, put _two_ pickles in it, I'm getting a little heartburn!""

The bartender, tired of her shenanigans, walks over to her and says, ""Listen, lady, here's the thing... It's _bartender_, not beertender.  You're drinking _double martinis_, not drooble martunis.

The Plumber replies: “A Western model is like a Western president and the Arab model is like an Arab president… If you wish to replace the first, it is a relatively straightforward project; all you have to do is pry off a few floor bolts before freeing the toilet and setting a new one. But if someday you wish to replace the Arab model, you will have to hammer your bathroom, smash the marble, and chisel the tiles. You will most probably damage the sub floor in the process, and establish problems later on when it is time to install a new toilet in the area.”
