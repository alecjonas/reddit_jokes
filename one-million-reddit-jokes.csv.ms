Now this hole is huge, like some sort of endless pit. So the one man says to the other, “I wonder how deep this hole is?”

He then proceeds to pick up a rock and toss it in the humongous hole. They listen... nothing. The other man then grabs a large stick and throws it in.... Nothing.

At this point the two men are really intrigued over this large hole. So they look around a little for something bigger to throw in, and they come across a railroad tie. They both grab an end, walk it over to the hole, and throw it in.

The men are looking down the hole when all of a sudden they hear this noise in the woods. They look over and see this goat running all over the place. It’s ziging and zaging between trees and going all over the place. Then it runs right up and dives into the hole.

Now the two men are thinking, what the hell was that? They had no idea what that goat was doing. So they decide to just keep walking.

A little ways down they run into a farmer, and the farmer asks them if they’d seen his goat. The two men tell him that they saw a goat come running out of the woods and jump into this huge hole. The farmer says, ""that couldn’t have been my goat, cause I tied my goat to a railroad tie.""",There's this big hole in the ground,46

post,6wczmk,2qh72,jokes,false,1503850204,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6wczmk/never_fall_asleep_in_church/,self.jokes,,"A elderly couple by the names of George and Martha go to church one Sunday. Unfortunately, Martha has a terrible habit of falling asleep during the service, and it embarrassed George something awful. So the sly old man came up with a plan: Everytime his wife would nod off, he'd prick her with a needle.

So the sermon starts and the preacher works up the crowd with a couple ""hallelujahs"" and ""amens,"" and sure enough, old Martha nods off.

George readies the pin and, just as the priest says, ""And to whom, my faithful servants, do we owe everything good in our lives?"" George gives his wife a sharp jab in the side, to which she responds with a powerful ""My God!""

The preacher basks in the enthusiasm of his disciples and continues on with the sermon as though nothing has happened.

Martha, embarrassed and confused, rubs her side and continues on worshipping. George slips the pin out of sight, pleased by the results.

Not fifteen minutes later, as the preacher whips his worshippers into another frenzy of praise and passion, old Martha starts nodding off. Her eyelids are drooping and her head's beginning to tilt.

George, always quick to take notice, readies his secret weapon again, poising it just off his wife's hip. Sure enough, just as the preacher calls to the crowd, ""And who, my beloved warriors of light, died for our sins?"" he jabs it home.

Martha jolts as if she's been electrified and gasps loudly amid the others, ""Jesus Christ!""

The preacher takes their word as gospel and continues.

George quickly slips the pin under his leg once more, looking innocent as a newborn.

Martha, with her side smarting, falls back into a pattern of fervent worship.

Not twenty minutes later, however, the poor old girl is beginning to nod off yet again. George, in his sly state, takes note immediately, and readies the pin for yet another assault.

Just as the preacher shouts to the heavens, ""Now, my children, what did Eve say to Adam after siring their 99th child?"" George makes one final jab, but this time Martha sees it, and she shouts:

""IF YOU STICK THAT THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, YOU OLD BASTARD, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS SIDEWAYS!""

Edit: Fuck the choir. It didn't faint. They had an orgy. ",Never fall asleep in church.,460

Guy thinks to himself for a minute and says: Let's try hell first, if it doesn't work out I'll just end up in heaven. 

So down he goes...

The earth opens up and smoke rises to the sky. The sweet scent of marijuana, hashish, and wet vaginas greets him. There are models everywhere. Nude devil girls with ass and tits to die for. Parties all around. Freedom to commit any sin anytime, guilt free. Orgies at every turn. Drinks everywhere. Tables with endless cocaine lines, the best colombian shit the devil can buy.. 

So after two weeks of spending his time with Satan, he says; i must go up and tell god my decision. I'll be back. 

Back in heaven he meets god again. Too excited to return to the parties and the women, he says:
I don't even care to see heaven. I've made my choice. I'm goin to hell! 

So back he goes... 

On this arrival, the smoke smells like cadavers. The gates open, devil girls suddenly have pitchforks, they stab him relentlessy. No water to be found anywhere. Its hot and dry, fire all around. The cocaine has turned to meth. The alcohol to vinegar. He cant find an orgy anywhere but is raped at every turn. 

Finally he goes to Satan once more. I should add, after a few months of calls, petitions and bureaucracies. At the meeting he demands angrily: What the hell Lucifer! I was just here, things were so different! Why this cruel change?!!

Satan replies; friend, you should surely be aware that there is a difference between tourism and immigration ",Mediocre guy dies and arrives at the Pearly gates,26

However, even though the two loved each other, Donkey quickly realized that the differences in their sizes meant that he couldn't please the Dragon with his little Pinocchio.

Wanting the best for his loved one, Donkey travelled all over the land until he found a sex shop. ""I'm looking for something to please my Dragon friend with"", Donkey told the shopkeeper.
""I have just the thing"", the shopkeeper replied, smiling. ""Come with me.""

Donkey followed the shopkeeper into a back room, and found himself in front of an enormous dildo, half the size of the shop. ""This is the Magic Dildo, size XXX"", the shopkeeper said proudly. ""And it's big enough for even a dragon. But it's not just big. Watch this: Magic Dildo, the wall!""

Immediately the Magic Dildo rose up and began throwing itself against the wall. The entire shop shook and threatened to collapse. ""Magic Dildo, stop!"", the shopkeeper said, and the dildo stopped.
Amazed by this product, Donkey bought the Magic Dildo and brought it home to the Castle. ""Whenever your bored, use this"", Donkey told the Dragon. ""Just say 'Magic Dildo' followed by wherever you want the dildo to go.""

So Donkey left for Shrek's house to give his beloved some privacy. The moment Donkey left, the Dragon used the dildo. ""Magic Dildo, my pussy!""

Immediately the dildo entered her pussy, and the Dragon let out a stream of fire in pleasure. At first, the Dragon was beyond ecstasy, but minutes turned to hours, and she couldn't get the dildo out, no matter what she said. Worried, the Dragon flew over to Shrek's house where Donkey was. Her flight was wobbly, but she made it, nearly crashing into Shrek's house.

""For the love of Pete!"", Shrek groaned, walking outside, where the Dragon was rolling on ground, eyes bulging. ""Get......Donkey....Magic Dildo......won't come out!""
Shrek guffawed in disbelief. ""Magic Dildo my ass!""",The Magic Dildo,7

He put the cat in the car and drove about 20 blocks away, then he left him at the park. But when he got home, the cat was there as if nothing had happened.
The next day he decided to take the cat somewhere further away, about 50 blocks. He put him out of the car and drove home. And again, the cat was there waiting for him. ‘This is impossible,’ said the man to himself. ‘tomorrow I’ll make sure he can’t come back!’
The next day he puts the cat in the car and he drives around, taking turn after turn – right, left, right, right and so on. Eventually, after about an hour of driving, he finally lets the cat out and drives home.
A few hours later, the phone rings at his house and his wife answer it. It’s the husband, and he asks: “Is the cat there?” “Why, yes.” says the wife, “he’s been here quite a while, where are you?”

The bartender offers him a drink. The fisherman says he does not have money to pay, so instead he offers a trade-- if he can get the bartender to laugh at his joke, then the bartender should provide a drink for free. The bartender, a smug, old pirate of a man accepts. After all, he is a moderator of /r/jokes, so he has become very accustomed to not laughing.

The fisherman begins his tale. ""Years ago, I set out on a whaling expedition, when a fellow sailor told me about the mystical golden fishing rod.""

""Let me stop you right there"" says the bartender. I can see where this is going. Golden rod. This is a sex joke. I've heard it before.""

""No. It's not a sex joke"" says the fisherman.


The bartender, fascinated, realizes that this may actually be OC.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""There once was a mystical golden fishing rod that was said to be so powerful that anyone using it could catch any fish.""

""Wait a minute"" says the bartender. ""I think you're in the wrong place. This sounds like the tale of Darth Plagueis. You want /r/prequelmemes down the street"".


""No. It's not a prequel meme"" says the fisherman.
The fisherman continues his tale. ""One day, a little boy found the rod and used it to catch a lion fish. Neptune, god of the sea appeared. He was furious because the lion fish was his best friend. In retaliation, Neptune broke the rod into pieces, separating the rod and the reel. The little boy said 'Now I am sad'.

""Oh, come on!"" said the bartender. ""Hey, Sad. I'm neptune! You want /r/dadjokes. Don't waste my time"".

""No. It's not a dadjoke"" says the fisherman.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""The boy took the pieces home, but they never worked again. Eventually, the rod was sold at a flea market, and the reel became the subject of many jokes.""

The fisherman then asks ""So, what did you think?""

The bartender, confused, looks up. ""What? That's it?""

The fisherman nods.

The bartender, now, is very confused. It's OC, sure, but it doesn't make any sense.

He scratches his head and asks a question ""What do you mean about the reel becoming the subject of many jokes?""


The fisherman says ""I can't answer that here"".

The bartender asks ""Why not?""

The fisherman replies ""The reel joke is always in the comments""",A fisherman walks into /r/jokes...,4

The man sees a very nice looking Labrador Retriever sitting there.

""Do you really talk?"" he asks the dog.

""Yes,"" the Labrador replies.

After recovering from the shock of hearing the dog talk, the man asks, ""So, tell me your story.""

The Labrador looks up and says, ""Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I was sold to the SAS. In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one imagined that a dog would be eavesdropping. I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years"".

""But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at Heathrow Airport to do some undercover security work, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded several medals"".

""Then I got married, had a few puppies, and now I've just retired.""

The man is amazed. He goes back into the house and asks the owner how much he wants for the dog.

""Ten quid,"" the owner says.

""£10!!? But your dog is absolutely amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheaply?""

""Because he's a lying bastard, he's never been out of the garden.""",A man sees a sign outside a house - 'Talking Dog For Sale.',123

With Hurricane Harvey currently outside my window, I was reminded of it. Maybe it will give some humor to those currently in worse off areas than I.  


A woman lives on the Texas coastline. Her town orders her to evacuate, but she refuses saying ""Jesus will provide"". 

At first, the storm is light but as the night progresses the wind and rain kill the power. Time passes, and soon the storm surge has her up on the roof of her house. She brings only an electric lantern and prays ""Jesus will provide"". 


Another hour passes, and to her surprise the coast guard is patrolling the floodwaters looking for people trying to brave the storm. They motion her to board the boat, but she refuses. ""Jesus will provide"" 
A few more hours pass, and the boat a second time tries to get this woman into the boat. A second time, she refuses. ""Jesus will provide"" 


At this point, her house is nearly completely underwater. Only a tiny section of her roof is still above water. Seeing how dire the situation is, the coast guard tries to force to woman into the boat. But she fights them off with her lantern shouting ""Jesus will provide"". Seeing the futility of their efforts, the coast guard leaves. Not long after, the woman slips on a shingle, and drowns in the floodwaters. 


In front of St. Peter, the woman is livid and demands to see Jesus. How could her lord and savior not save such a good Christian woman such as herself? 
It takes some time, but she eventually meets Jesus where she asks 

""Lord, I prayed to you every day. Why did you not save me during the storm?""

Confused, Jesus looks at her.

""Lady, I sent the boat back three times"" ",Fitting joke for Hurricane Harvey,1526

The attending nurse came out of the delivery room to congratulate the old gentleman and said, 'This is amazing. How do you do it at your age?' 

The old man grinned and said, 'You got to keep the old motor running.' 

The following year, the couple returned to the hospital for the birth of their second child. 

The same nurse was attending the delivery and again went out to congratulate the old gentleman. She said, 'Sir, you are something! How do you manage it?'

The old man grinned and said, 'You gotta keep the old motor running.' 

A year later, the couple returned to the hospital for the birth of their third child. 

The same nurse was there for this birth also and, after the delivery, she once again approached the old gentleman, smiled, and said, 'Well, you surely are something awesome! 
How do you do it?' 

The old man replied, 'It's like I've told you before, you gotta keep the old motor running.' 

The nurse, still smiling, patted him on the back and said:

Wow, things had changed in all those years. There was a comfy chair, a small screen TV, the WiFi password. Then I opened the cupboard and inside was a bottle of fine malt scotch, and some cigars!

Knocking on the door he was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, gray beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" ""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" ""OK,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder.

A drunk man climbs a street light, and starts yelling that he will commit suicide.

A woman who was passing by, sees the scene, and start trying to convince the man to climb down, to what he answers:

""You don't pay my bills, you know nothing about my problems! I'm gonna jump and end it all!""

Unable to convince him otherwise, the woman cries for help.

Two men appear and try to convince the drunk man to give up on his suicide, but in vain.

""I'm gonna jump! I'm gonna end my misery"", the drunk man goes on.

Suddenly, it is a commotion. People start to gather around, some trying to convince the man to climb down, some making bets on it, some filming, and stuff. After a while even the press arrived.

At this point, comes a cop.

The cop yells to the man: ""COME DOWN, NOW!!!"", to which the drunk man responds:

""You have nothing to do with this! I want to kill myself and I'm going to!""

""COME DOWN, IT'S MY LAST WARNING!!!"" says the cop.

""NO!"" replies the drunk man.

The cop then draw his gun and point to the drunk man, and yells:

""COME DOWN NOW!""

The drunk man then replies ""OK, OK, no need for violence, I'm coming down now.""

(I know you giggled a little but this is not the joke yet, keep reading)

The drunk man, not without difficulties, finally climb down the street light, for everyone's relief (except the ones who bet he was going to jump)

As the man reaches the ground, everyone is calmed down, and some even start to leave, but the cop is pretty pissed with him.

""FIRST OF ALL, WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?"" Yells the cop to the Drunk man.

""What?, you dont remember me, buddy?""

""DONT CALL ME BUDDY YOU DRUNK SCUM!!! IM NOT YOUR BUDDY!!! IM NOT FRIENDS WITH DRUNK PEOPLE LIKE YOU! NOW TELL ME WHO YOU ARE!!!""

""Aww, c'mon! Of course you remember me! ""

""I ALREADY SAID I'M NOT FRIENDS WITH SCUM LIKE YOU! I DONT KNOW YOU, SO TELL ME ALREADY, WHO ARE YOU!""

""Well, I'm deeply offended. Really. Cant believe you don't remember me, man.""

""STOP SAYING THAT AND TELL ME WHO ARE YOU?""

""You really dont remember me, then?""

""NO!!! ONCE AND FOR ALL, WHO. THE. HELL. ARE. YOU????""
