Curious, he reaches out to it and starts reading, but it had only 11 pages, and on the tenth page it said ""You can do anything, you can find anything, except for one thing ..."" When he flipped the page, he found out that the 11th page was torn out. Filled with curiosity, he sets out to figure out the thing that he cannot find or do. He first goes to the publishing company written on the book, to find out that it was closed two years ago, a passer-by sees the puzzled look at the man's face. ""You searching for the guys in this publishing company?"" Said the passerby ""I know someone who worked there, I can give you his address if you wish"". Happily, the man asked for the address and thanked the passerby, but oh no, the guy lives in another town. However, the man's curiosity is way stronger than to leave it go. He sets to go to the guy who used to work in the company. When he arrived, he saw a small house with a small garden that has beautiful flowers in it. He rings the bell, filled with expectations, few seconds later, an old man appears in front of the guy. After he greeted him, the guy showed the old man the book and asked him ""I found this in the abandoned library in the other town, do you happen to know what was written in the last page?"". ""Ah,"" The old man sighed. ""so it exists after all ... we always thought that this book was a myth, it was said that there was only one copy printed of it, and nobody could find it. Weird enough that you could find it in the old library. I'm sorry young man, I did not read the book so I have no idea. However, I know the guy who was the chief of the company before the company closed, here is his address."" Disappointed, the man looks at the paper, and he finds out that the chief lives in another country. But that is not enough to let him stop searching for it, so he books flight tickets and flies there. When he reached next morning to the house of the chief, a beautiful house with a beautiful garden and an expensive car parked there, he rings the bell, and a butler gets out to greet him ""Good morning sir, how can I help you?"" Said the butler politely. ""I want to talk with your master in an important matter regarding this book"" and he showed him the book. ""Oh ... I'll go call him immediately ... please come in"" Said the butler, with a terrified face on him. When he entered and sat in a sofa in the hall, the chief came, with a troubled face. ""So you found the book"" the chief asked. ""Yes, but the last page is torn out, and I came here to know what is written on it"". Said our man. ""Ah, I see, so the geezer did it after all ..."" Replied the chief sadly. ""Don't worry, i'll give you the address of this old man, he has the page, he is in his nineties, but he has a good health. He was the one who tore the page, he kept on saying that it is essential to find people who ..."" Then the chief stopped talking as if he realized that he shouldn't say anymore. ""Who ...?"" Asked the man. ""Ah, nevermind, you will know. For now, go to this place and you will surely know everything there."" Replied the chief, seemed troubled. ""You are kidding right? This is an isolated island, there is no way I can get there anytime soon!"" replied the man when he saw the location. ""Well, you can just not go if you want, but if you want to know what was on the last page, you have to go. You must go."" And the chief asked the butler to guide the man outside when he said those last words. Troubled, the man looked at the paper, but he realized that this will be the last time he goes around , so he will finally know what is in the last page of the book. Determined, he sets sails to go to the island. When he got there, he found that it was a small island, and searching in it won't be that hard. Then, he found a very small house with an old man setting outside of it. ""Hey, old man"" shouted our guy ""I came here for ""The Puzzle of Everything"". When the old man heard that, he turned around as fast as a rat and went to the man. ""I see, I see, so you found the book too ... I was afraid that I would die before seeing another person who would find it, ah, waiting here in this island is worth it after all."" creeped out, the man exclaimed ""What is your deal, old man, get me the last torn page"". The old man happily replied: ""This book is to tell you that you can do anything, find anything, and you did, you went out of your way, learned patience, and learned how to find me, but ..."" answers the old man ""There's one thing that you can't find."" a sad expression appears on the old man's face. ""And this is why I came here, I want to know what I can not find"" Answers the man, determined.
""Go to that side of the island and go into the water, search for a closed wine bottle, it has the paper inside of it"" Said the old man as he points at the direction of the bottle. The man started running, and then he jumped in the water, searching for it. Few seconds ... 30 seconds ... 1 minute ... two minutes .. three minutes ... time passed by without him feeling it, as he was very excited, and then ,he found the bottle, holding his breath. When he realized that he is almost out of breath, he picks it up and tries to go up, but his leg got stuck between rocks. Out of breath, unable to move, he desperately think ""Well, if this is the end, i might as well read what is here."" The man opens the bottle, gets the paper out, and starts reading."" 
....
Few moments later, the man, dead, lies in the very depths of the water, and at the same time, a piece of paper floated in the top of the water. An old man swims to pick it up. ""Aah, you could've waited to listen to my warning"" Disappointed, said the old man, as he started reading what is on the paper:
""However, the only thing you could not find in the end, is the very essence of why you exist.
You could not find the punchline.""",There was a man who found out that he could do anything ....,3

His family has been gone for many years, and has lived most of his life without anyone. He has had no physical contact with people in such a long time, other than going to town every could of months. But he wanted this to change.

He thought to himself one day, “hey, I should get a pet. That way I won’t be lonely anymore!” 

He then goes into town the next day and goes to a local farm and breeding ranch. He goes up to the owner and asks for an animal

“Well, what would you like?”
“I’m not sure... what’s the weirdest animal you have?”
“Umm... we have a few camels out back, if you’d like to purchase one.”
“Sounds odd... I’ll take it!”

He gets the camel and all that he will need to take care of it. He also goes to department store and buys the materials for a stable for the camel. He then goes back home, builds the stable, closed the gate on it, and goes to sleep.

The next morning he wakes up and decides to go feed his new camel, only to find out that it’s dead and has its legs cut off! He looks in awe and disgust at the camel and buries it with grief. Hoping to cheer himself up, he decides to get another camel. 

He goes back to the store, gets another camel and this time builds a better stable. This has more reinforced walls, a full door, and locks. So he builds the stable, puts the camel in, locks it, and goes to sleep. He can only hope that everything will be alright in the end.

The next morning he goes to feed the camel, and he finds the door broken down, the locks gone, and the camel dead with no legs again! He just about breaks down in tears while he buries his camel again. He wasn’t over yet though! He was determined! Very depressed, but determined! 

So he goes back to the store and buys a THIRD camel, just barely hoping this one will survive the night. This time he goes back to the department store, gets better locks and security cameras so he can see what’s going on during the night, so he can file a police report.
So he gets home, and sets everything up, puts the camel in, and goes to sleep. All he can think about during the night is what he might do if this camel dies as well...

Morning came, and he checks the camel, and he sees the door broken down, the locks gone, the cameras stolen, with the tapes, and the camel dead with no legs. He is silent with depression and at this point he decides that if something like this keeps happening to him, that nothing ever good will happen, so he just walks in the woods in one direction, praying for death to take him away.

On this walk, he sees this vary large, hunted looking, over grown mansion with torches lite up on the outside. He knows the whole area very well, yet he’s never seen this before; a whole mansion practically in his backyard! He goes up to the door, knocks, and the door slowly opens with no one to greet him.

As he walks in, he notices how dark it is, and sees light down the corridor. He follows the light and sees two torches on the wall. And in between the torches he finds, what other than a large amount of camel legs, broken locks on a chain, and a set of cameras hanging by the wires. And an old man is sitting next to all this in a large leather chair.

He then asks the man, “Are those my camel legs, locks, and cameras?”

The old man replies with only, “Nope.”

The man looks at him and says “Okay, sorry to bother you, sir.” And leaves

The officer tells the woman to hide and stay quiet and disconnects the call. The women in fear for her life cant believe what she just heard. There is someone in her house and now she is alone. So the woman picks up the phone again and dials the police once more. The same dispatch officer picks up.  

WOMAN: ""I am the woman that just called regarding the person inside my home."" 

DO: ""Yes, man. Are you still safe?""

WOMAN: ""Yes, I was calling to actually tell you do not worry about sending an officer anymore, just an ambulance please. I shot and killed the man intruding in my home."" 

DO: ""Wait...""

5 minutes later she hears a knock at her door.

“Why is that, Adam”, God asks.

“Lord, I know you created this place for me, with all this lovely food and all of the beautiful animals, but I have no one special to share it with and I’m lonely”, Adam explained to God.

“Well Adam, in that case I have the perfect solution. I shall create a woman for you”, God told him.

Perplexed, Adam asked, “What’s a woman, Lord?”

God replies, “This woman will be the most intelligent, sensitive, caring, and beautiful creature I have ever created. She will be so intelligent that she can figure out what you want before you want it. She will be so sensitive and caring that she will know your every mood and how to make you happy. Her beauty will rival that of the heavens and earth.. She will cook and clean for you and do everything that you ask without ever complaining. She will provide every sexual need and fantasy you will ever think of and meet all of your sexual needs. She will bear your children and raise them without complaints. This woman will be the perfect companion for you.”

“Wow! That sounds great,” exclaimed Adam. “Where is she?”

“Not so fast,” said the Lord. “A woman this fantastic is going to cost you.”

“How much”, asked Adam.

“An arm and leg”, God replied.

post,86pxgw,2qh72,jokes,false,1521855411,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/86pxgw/the_fog_monster/,self.jokes,,"Long, long ago, there was a village which had its very existence constantly threatened by a terrible fog monster. For a while, none would trade with the village, for even outsiders feared this hostile aberration, which could attack without warning and slay an army without leaving a trace. Several generations of villagers had to live off of fortune alone, praying to their cruel gods that they might manage to gather some scraps for the night.

Eventually, an ancient, wise wizard heard of their peril, and sent his apprentice to investigate. The journey was long and arduous, and every alarm bell in the youthful apprentice’s head began dinging away when she was but a few days from the town. *I’ve already come this far,* she thought. *I have to prove my worth to my master.* She only grew more nervous when she found herself resting atop a hill, only a few hours from the dark forest which enveloped the village. The dreading did not stop her from continuing forth.

As her master had warned and as the legends had said, the forest was shrouded in incredibly thick fog. Water constantly dripped from the massive trees, and the apprentice’s boots were muddied and wet from puddles before even half an hour had passed. No sunlight could penetrate the canopy or the smoke-like fog, so the apprentice had to see by means of magic. Even the light she placed atop her staff seemed to dim in the fog.

The apprentice’s hair stood on end.

Someone was watching her.

No.

Some*thing* was watching her.

She whipped around, staff clutched tightly in her hands, adrenaline and magical energy coursing through her body. The apprentice put on a mask of confidence, but had to fight herself to keep from trembling. *I will not be slain like those who have come before me,* she thought. Her eyes darted from side to side for what felt like and hour but must have been a minute at most—and then she saw it: a swirling, humanoid mess of coalesced shadows. 

Its head turned towards the girl, and it began floating towards her, gaining speed with each passing second. The apprentice held her ground, even as her heart began to pound in her chest and her mouth became drier than the desert she hailed from. *Come on, just a little closer. Then you’re done for.* Her entire body tensed up and sweat began pouring from her pores as she brought the spell to memory. The spell she had worked on every day of her journey, for the sole purpose of eradicating this terribly evil being.

Finally! The fog creature entered her range!

The apprentice shouted the arcane words and moved her body in the familiar, practiced dance she had taught herself. A bright, concentrated ball of shadow-piercing light came into being between her strong hands, and she fired it with a warrior’s battle cry.

Sadly, though, she mist.

Then, one day as they were digging up their harvest, one of them noticed something completely foreign and amazing in the sky: A cloud. 

The human stared in awe at this massive spectacle floating through the barren Mars atmosphere. After a while, the cloud neared and began drizzling water all across their fields.

post,86n2qb,2qh72,jokes,false,1521830817,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/86n2qb/the_man_who_saved_reddit/,self.jokes,,"In the not too distant future, web censorship is pervasive; speech and freedom are strangers to one another; while pirates sail the seas with impunity, digital pirates are incarcerated by the busload.

Anyone who speaks out against this ban on open-dialogue or the free-sharing-of-ideas is ground down and hidden away, and the resistance is loosing its will.

A small group of contributors to reddit, huddled together in a bunker beneath barely-waving flags of Snoo, worked tirelessly to repost new ideas from around the internet, to release ideas from their chains, and make speech free ... again!

But it was not to be - a gang of the governments anti-piracy enforcers descended on this, the last bastion of humankind's will to share-freely. Arriving in an armored bus, ten shock-troopers breached the bunker and it looked like the day was lost.

Fortunately for us all, one brave redditor led the collective out a back entrance and they circled to the driveway. This leader told the other redditors to wait in the bushes while he overpowered the  one soldier left guarding the transport. There was a flash of movement, a crack from a fallen branch as it struck the guard, and then, stolen keys in hand, the hero revved the engine and told the redditors to pile in.

He had to will himself ignore the gas gauge as he floored the accelerator on the 25,000 pound ticket to freedom - there was only survival or defeat, and nothing in between. Sirens came alive behind him as he rushed for the border to the promised land, to the Free-North.

As the engine begins to cough, the titanic weight of the transport cleaves the barricades asunder and the pursuing vehichles have to hard-brake to avoid skidding beyond their corrupt jurisdiction. Both exhausted and elated, the redditors follow their hero to the freedom promised by their new surroundings ... but their peril is not yet passed.

Though most of the pirate-hunters glower from the south-side of the border, one special agent has crossed over and is speaking with the border guards. The tension is thick. A long-faced guard turns to the newcomers, clearly troubled by what he must do.

""Folks,"" he says, a pained look on his kindly face, ""I'm sorry, to do this, don't cha' know, but I got no choice, eh!""

Confused, the redditors look to one another, and tremble as they notice the agent's smug expression, greedy eyes fixed on the leader of the exodus.

""Look here, now, you are all welcome here, of course, and since speech is free here, we aren't gonna send you home over posting ideas on the interwebs, eh!""

Everyone's breath catches int heir throats at the unspoken ""but""

""But,"" continues the guard, after a painful pause, ""Stealing a vehichle is a crime, and I'm afraid I'm gonna have to trun whomever was driving this thing over to this agent here""

The redditors are stunned and shocked, but true to his heroic nature, and unable to let another suffer on his account, the man who led the escape prepares to confess ...

But then the rest of the redditors jump to their feet one at a time, and do what redditors do best:

""I am the bus driver""

""I am the bus driver""

""I am the bus driver""

""I am the bus driver""

""I am the bus driver""

""I am the bus driver""

""I am the bus driver""

""I am the bus driver""

""Yes of course my lord, it is truly magnificent, but Saint Peter was unable to answer my question and said I should come see you"" the zebra replies, timidly. 

""well of course I can, I know all! Ask away my son""

Appalled by what he heard, the young man went all crazy and started running down the streets, where he saw road crossing chickens, stupid blondes, fatherless black kids and an insane number of lawyers, engineers, priests, scientists, doctors and door-knockers walking about.

That's when he realized all his life he has been living in the world of Jokes, and there he is, yet another insignificant character in this very world.

Exasperated, he knelt down and started crying to himself.

""Must be hard realizing all this suddenly ya?"" a voice beckons from above his head.

The man looks up and sees a bearded man, about the age of 50, donning a pot belly and looking down at him.

""when I realized all these.."" he continued, ""I was about your age, I first noticed the repetitive nature of things happening around, how people seem to hang out in pairs or in trios, and how certain inanimate objects can actually talk... it was hard to accept it and I felt like a puppet, yet another entity being manipulated for the laughs of others...""

Hearing that, the young man felt consoled that he is not alone. But before he could speak, the chatty old man continued his sharing.

""Then one day I decided to risk it all, I quit my assigned job and found a new one, and though I have not been earning much, I have made quite a name for myself around here""

Feeling inspired and curious, the young man quickly asked about his new life.

""So what do you work as now sir?""

I was so lost in my thoughts that I failed to see the approach of an army officer and his henchmen. 

“Comrade!” He sneered. “Out a bit late, aren’t we?”

His cronies chuckled as I turned toward the military man, bleary eyed and panicked.

“Da, comrade. Just heading home to s-s-sleep, there’s a fearsome bite in the air, a-a-and I long for my bed.”

My stammered response was met with a grimace. I came to a halt and bowed my head before the military man, trying not to let my acrid breath catch his nose. His hand landed heavily on my shoulder.

“Comrade, comrade, comrade. You know the rules. What is your name?”

I let out a sob, and the cronies circled round, grinning.

“B-b-b-but..”

“B-b-b-but what, tramp?”

“B-b-b-but I-i-i-i thought that rule was cast out by our glorious leader?!”

I met his eyes and feared for the worst—talking back to an officer could spell the end of me. Just then, clip-clopping round the corner came a komandarm, a high ranking officer, replete with epaulets and a ceremonial scabbard. The officer’s gaze was drawn to his superior, and I could see his brow become tense and knitted.

“Sir?” He asked

“Comrade tramp is right.”

The cronies chuckled again, gleeful at their officer being chided for once.

“You, take off.” The komandarm said to them.  He turned his steed to the officer. “And you, sir: name checks out”.

She was admired for her sweetness and kindness to all.

One afternoon the pastor came to call on her and she showed him into her quaint sitting room.

She invited him to have a seat while she prepared tea.

As he sat facing her old Hammond organ, the young minister noticed a cut-glass bowl sitting on top of it.

The bowl was filled with water, and in the water floated, of all things, a condom!

When she returned with tea and scones, they began to chat.
The pastor tried to stifle his curiosity about the bowl of water and its
strange floater, but soon it got the better of him and  he could no longer resist
""Miss Beatrice"", he said, ""I wonder if you would tell me about this?"" pointing to the bowl.
""Oh, yes,"" she replied, ""Isn't it wonderful? I was walking through the Park
a few months ago and I found this little package on the ground.

90 was a little girl who grew up to be a great woman. She married at a young age and gave birth to two children, a daughter and a son. Unlike her own mother, she gave her offspring actual names. But their names don't matter.

One day, the daughter and the son came across a small puppy they found left alone in an alley near their house. They brought it back into their home and fed it, took care of it, and nursed it back to health. But they knew that their mother, 90, wouldn't dare let them keep a dog in their home, so they decided to hide it. In order to continue successfully keeping their dog a secret, they named the dog ""This."" During conversations about the dog which took place in front of their mother, the daughter and the son would refer to their puppy as ""This,"" so as to avoid any suspicion at all. It worked for a while, but unfortunately a few years later, their secret dog, name of This, died.

Somehow, the child was in relatively good health, so they brought him home and cared for him as they would any other child. 

Raising Head Boy presented with many challenges. He could not walk or run, only crawl along with his hand. He was constantly questioning why he was so different from the other children. His parents had no answer for that, but otherwise taught him well. 
Head Boy had a lot of trouble in school, as you could imagine. He got terrible grades, as he couldn’t properly write, and was constantly bullied for being only a head. He didn’t have any friends and couldn’t really take up any hobbies, so he just went through school in a constant state of misery. 

Nothing changed in Head Boy’s life until he turned 21. Head Boy’s father offered to take him out to a bar for his first drink (and it was actually his first, as he wasn’t invited to any parties growing up). 

“Sure,” said Head Boy. “It’s not like I have anything else to look forward to.”

So they went out to the bar and Head Boy’s father ordered two whiskeys, one for Head Boy and one for himself. Head Boy downed the drink and suddenly, an arm popped out from his neck! He had an arm!
“Oh my god, that’s it!” cried Head Boy. “Get me another drink!”

Head Boy drank the second drink, and out popped a second arm! He had shoulders now! He kept the drinks coming, and he got a torso! Then a leg! Then another leg! He became a whole person!
Head Boy was overcome with joy, and began dancing around the bar, naked, drunk, enjoying his body he had never known. He then ran out into the street and shouted “I am whole! I’m a whole person now!”

He was then run over by an SUV, killing him instantly. 

The moral of this story is: quit while you’re ahead.","A boy was once born without a body, only a head.",62

""If you ever come to China, call me and we can hang out!"" says the Chinese official.


""Really? Cool! Same to you. If you ever come to Nigeria, call me and we can hang out!"" says the Nigerian official.

6 months later, the Nigerian comes to China, remembering about his Chinese official and decides to call him. 

""Hey, I'm in China, want to hang out today?"" he asks.

""Sure! Just a question, where are you staying?"" the Chinese official asks.

""The Hilton."" the Nigerian replies.

""Pack your things and meet me at the front. You can live with me for your trip.""

""Sounds good.""

The Chinese official pulls up to the hotel with a BMW, the latest model. The Nigerian gets in and the Chinese official takes him on the freeway to his condo. On the freeway, the Nigerian admires the beautiful scenery. Once at the condominium, the Nigerian is impressed at how big the condo is: 5 rooms, 3 bathrooms, and much more that he was baffled about.

The Nigerian official goes to the master bedroom and asks 

""You are just a Chinese official, how do you have enough?""

The Chinese official tells him to come to the window and asks, ""What do you see outside?""

""Houses, apartments, and people.""

""You see that freeway? Yeah, I took 10%"".

Fast forward 3 months when the Chinese official comes to Nigeria.

""Hey, I just got to Nigeria, want to go grab food later?"" he asks.

""Sure! Where are you staying?"" the Nigerian official asks.

""The Hilton."" the Chinese official replies.

""Well, pack your things and meet me at the front because you are going to be living with me.""

""Great, I'll get ready.""

The Nigerian official pulls up to the hotel with a Lamborghini. The Chinese official gets in and the Nigerian takes him. The Chinese official is really excited, wanting to see the beautiful place Nigeria is. They drive and drive when suddenly the road turns into a muddy unpaved road, filled with mud. Huts and children running around. The Chinese official is shocked until they get to the Nigerian's place: a mansion. The mansion is gorgeous, 35 bedrooms, completed with a slide to the pool from the 2nd floor to the 1st.

The Chinese official goes to the master bedroom and checks the toilet, in disbelief. The toilet seat is pure gold.

He then ask,

""You are just a Nigerian official, how do you have enough?""

The Nigerian official tells him to come to the window and asks, ""What do you see outside?""

""Huts, poverty, and barren wasteland.""

""You see that dirt road? 100%.""

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""

",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,81

""But what could be so terrible you'd humiliate yourself by looking like a stupid American?"" asked the Swede. He spoke English without an accent, because I don't know what a Swedish accent sounds like.

The man didn't seem to want to talk about it, so they left him alone, but eventually, they had to know. They went back over, and he reluctantly told them his friend dared him to post original content on r/jokes.

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Everyone knows Dave,1247

Behind the bar he sees the bartender put the $50 bill in a large jar full of money and the man leaves. 

He asks the bartender about the jar of money and the bartender says ""oh that's the ol' pub challenge""

Intrigued he asks about the challenge.

The bartender said ""it's a 3 part challenge, if you complete all 3 challenges you get the jar of money, if not you have to pay $50"".

The bartender continued. ""Part one of the challenge is to knock out our undefeated bouncer Bruce"" 

The man looks towards the door and sees the largest man he had ever seen. 

The bartender continued. ""For part two you have to extract a rotten tooth from my extremely aggressive 180lb German shepherd out back""
 
The man looked outside to see a gigantic dog snarling and barking at anything that moved.

The bartender continued. ""Lastly my old aunt Bertha is upstairs and hasn't been with a man since her husband died 20 years ago. If you can satisfy her in bed you get the money.""

So the man said he would think about it and continued drinking. 

As the night went on and the man had a dozen drinks he accepted the challenge. 

He went up to the bouncer raised his fists and knocked him out with one punch.

He then walked out of the door towards the dog. Inside the bar you could hear loud howling, snarling barking and thrashing around. 

The man walked back in, clothes torn, bite marks and scratches up and down his arms and said ""Now where's the old lady with the scraggly tooth"".

The next morning he wakes up and feels something weird on his face. He goes to the bathroom and sees that a huge penis hangs out of the center of his forehead on to his nose. 

He starts panicking and runs(with the penis flailing about) to a doctor. The doctor runs tests, gives him some pills but the penis won't disappear. He goes back home and tries to cut the penis with a saw but nothing works.

Realizing he won't find a way to cure himself, he goes back to the forest to try to find the shaman.
When he finally finds him, he starts begging the shaman to somehow reverse the curse. The shaman nods and says that unfortunately there is no way to reverse the curse.

He got along well with her family but he could not deny that her younger sister was drop-dead gorgeous and he felt a strong attraction to her.  A week before the wedding, he gets a mysterious phone call from the sister asking him to come over to her house and to hurry.  
So he drives over, knocks on the front door wondering what on earth could be happening?  She greets him at the door and invites him in.  She is wearing a stunning Victoria's Secret negligee, the house is dark and there is soft music playing.

""I know you're marrying my sister in a week,"" she said.  ""Before that happens, I just wanted to have you come over, take me upstairs and make passionate love to me. I promise you my sister will never find out.""  With that she turned her back and walked slowly up the stairs.

The guy turns, charges out the front door and races to his car.  He stops in amazement when he sees his fiancee and her entire family gathered on the sidewalk applauding.  In a moment her sister comes outdoors in a robe and joins in the applause.

""What's going on?"" he asked.

His fiancee stepped forward, her family beaming approval behind her.  ""This was just a test of your faithfulness.   I wanted to make sure that you were 100% devoted to me and would never try to be with someone else.  Darling, I'm so happy!""  

She embraced him as her family cheered.

The old man composes himself, wipes the tears from his eyes and says to Jesus, ""I'm sorry"".  Jesus thinks that maybe he's been a bit too harsh and asks the man ""Why are you so sad?""

The man explains, ""Many years ago, before I got here, I was a poor carpenter, we didn't have much.  My son wasn't even born in a proper hospital!  I had hoped my son would follow me into the carpentry trade but...""

Naturally, this strikes a chord with Jesus.  ""Well what happened to your son?"" he asks.

""Well, one day my son had to go on a big adventure!  He was gone, and I never saw him again.  The reason I'm crying is that I had hoped to reunite with him here!""

Now it is Jesus who is crying.  Tears streaming down his face, he can't quite believe who he's talking to.  He holds up his hands and ventures ""And did your son have holes in his hands like these?""

A driver is pulled over by a policeman. The policeman approaches the drivers door.

""Is there a problem, Officer?""

The policeman says, ""Sir, you were speeding. Can I see your license please?""

The driver responds, ""I'd give it to you but I don't have one.""

""You don't have one?""

The man responds, ""I lost it four times for drink driving.""

The policeman is shocked. ""I see. Can I see your vehicle registration papers please?""

""I'm sorry, I can't do that.""

The policeman says, ""Why not?""

""I stole this car.""

The officer says, ""Stole it?""

The man says, ""Yes, and I killed the owner.""

At this point the officer is getting irate. ""You what?""

""She's in the boot if you want to see.""

The Officer looks at the man and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes, five police cars show up, surrounding the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half-drawn gun.

The senior officer says, ""Sir, could you step out of your vehicle please!""

The man steps out of his vehicle. ""Is there a problem, sir?""

""One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner.""

""Murdered the owner?""

The officer responds, ""Yes, could you please open the boot of your car please?""

The man opens the boot, revealing nothing but an empty boot.

The officer says, ""Is this your car sir?""

The man says, ""Yes"" and hands over the registration papers.

The officer, understandably, is quite stunned. ""One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving licence.""

The man digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled. ""Thank you, sir. One of my officers told me you didn't have a licence, stole this car, and murdered the owner.""

The doctor says, “Madam, I’m terribly sorry you were exposed to this. This patient has a terrible health condition. If he doesn’t masturbate at least five times a day, his testicles fill up with semen, they could rupture, and he could die.”

The woman says, “Oh, in that case, well I guess I understand.”

He finally goes to his doctor who tries a few things; but nothing seems to work. So the doctor refers him to an American Indian medicine man.

The medicine man says, ""I can cure this."" With that said, he throws a white powder in a flame, and there is a flash with billowing blue smoke. Then he says, ""This is powerful healing but you can only use it once a year. All you have to do is say '123,' and it shall rise for as long as you wish!""

The guy then asks, ""What happens when it's over, and I don't want to continue?"" The medicine man replies, ""All you or your partner has to say is 1234, and it will go down. But be warned, it will not work again for another year.""

The old gent rushes home, anxious to try out his new powers and prowess. That night he is ready to surprise his wife. He showers, shaves, and puts on his most exotic shaving lotion and cologne. After he gets into bed and is lying next to her, he says, ""123.""

Suddenly he has the most gigantic stiffie he has ever had, just as the medicine man had promised. His wife, who had been facing away from him,
turns over and asks, ""What did you say 123 for?",An elderly man finds he is unable to perform sexually.,34

Understandably, she was quite devastated by the news, and to make matters worse he demanded she move out of their home before the end of the month. He offered her half of what the property was worth.

Thinking she had no other option, she accepted his offer, but on the condition that she could have one last party with her friends before she moved out. He agreed, but announced that he would be going away for the weekend. As long as she cleaned up the whole house before leaving, he was fine with her last request.

The following Saturday night she invited a few friends over for garlic roasted king prawns and white wine. As the last guest left, she tidied up and cleaned the house. The very last thing she did before leaving was to stuff the leftover prawns into all the curtain poles in every room.

After the weekend, her ex came back bringing his new girlfriend to live with him. They soon started to notice an unpleasant stench, mild at first, then more and more pungent as the days passed. His new girlfriend was not happy and demanded he solve the problem, or else she'd leave. He desperately searched for the source, thinking it might be a dead rat or something, but he couldn't pinpoint it. The strange smell of rotting seafood seemed to come from everywhere. He cleaned every inch of the house except the curtain poles. Unable to rid the house of the nasty stench he finally gave up and advertised the house for sale. Of course nobody wanted to buy it.

A rumour spread in the neighbourhood about the ""stink house"". After some time he finally received an offer, way below the property value. It turned out his ex-wife had missed her old home and wanted to repurchase it. She even offered to help him move out. ""If she's that stupid, I might as well sell it to her"", he thought. As she carried out the curtain poles to his moving van, the last thing she said to him was ""I really hope you'll be happy in your new apartment"".

Arcelor-Mittal Steel, feeling it was time for a shake-up, hired a new CEO. The new boss was determined to rid the company of all slackers.

On a tour of the facilities, the CEO noticed a guy leaning against a wall. The room was full of workers and he wanted to let them know that he meant business. He asked the guy, ""How much money do you make a week?""

A little surprised, the young man looked at him and said, ""I make $400 a week. Why?""

The CEO said, ""Wait right here.""

He walked back to his office, came back in two minutes, and handed the guy $1,600 in cash and said, ""Here's four weeks' pay. Now GET OUT and don't come back.""

Feeling pretty good about himself the CEO looked around the room and asked, ""Does anyone want to tell me what that goof-ball did here?""

From across the room a voice said, ""Pizza delivery guy from Domino's.""

Everyone in the bank laid down quietly. This is called ""Mind Changing Concept” Changing the conventional way of thinking.

When a lady lay on the table provocatively, the robber shouted at her: ""Please be civilized! This is a robbery and not a rape!""

This is called ""Being Professional” Focus only on what you are trained to do! 

When the bank robbers returned home, the younger robber (MBA-trained) told the older robber (who has only completed Year 6 in primary school): ""Big brother, let's count how much we got.""

The older robber rebutted &amp; said: ""You are very stupid. There is so much money it will take us a long time to count. Tonight, TV news will tell us how much we robbed from the bank!"" 

This is called ""Experience.” Nowadays, experience is more important than paper qualifications!

After the robbers had left, the bank manager told the bank supervisor to call the police quickly. But the supervisor said to him: ""Wait! Let us take out $10 million from the bank for ourselves and add it to the $70 million that we have previously embezzled from the bank”.

This is called ""Swim with the tide.” Converting an unfavorable situation to your advantage! 

The supervisor says: ""It will be good if there is a robbery every month.""  

This is called ""Killing Boredom.” Personal Happiness is more important than your job.

The next day, the TV news reported that $100 million was taken from the bank. The robbers counted and counted and counted, but they could only count $20 million. The robbers were very angry and complained:

""We risked our lives and only took $20 million. The bank manager took $80 million with a snap of his fingers. It looks like it is better to be educated than to be a thief!""

This is called ""Knowledge is worth as much as gold!""

The bank manager was smiling and happy because his losses in the share market are now covered by this robbery. 

This is called ""Seizing the opportunity.” Daring to take risks! 

So who are the real robbers here?

She tells him where to go and they start off. It is a long drive and the driver keeps looking at the nun through the rear view mirror of his cab. 

Now, the nun is getting very upset by this and says, ""Um...can I help you??!!""

The taxi driver looks very embarrassed and says, ""I'm sorry, it's very embarrassing, I cannot say.""

And the nun looks at him and says, ""Now, my son, I have been in this business far too long to be disturbed by anything you have to say, so go ahead.""

The driver thinks for a minute and says, ""Ok, well, for as long as I can remember, I have had the biggest fantasy about kissing a nun.""

She looks amused at first then replies, ""Well, I think I can help you with that, but first you must promise me two things, the first is that you are a Catholic, the second is that you are single. If you can promise this, I shall give you what you ask for.""

And the driver says, ""Great!! Sure I'm a single Catholic!!""

So they pull into an alley and the nun crawls into the front seat of the cab and gives the driver an amazing kiss. The type of kiss where time feels like it stops almost. And they finish up and get back on the road. 

Soon the taxi driver starts looking nervous and peering at the nun in the rear view mirror again. Just staring at her, and when the nun asks him why he is staring and he says, ""Well, I'm afraid I haven't been completely honest with you. You see, I'm not a catholic, and I'm also married.""

The nun smiles and says, ""Well, I haven't been honest with you either...My name is Kevin, and I'm going to a Halloween party.""",A cab driver picks up a Nun in New York...,30
