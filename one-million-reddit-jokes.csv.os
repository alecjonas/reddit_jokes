Mr. Bear immediately wished that all the other bears in the forest were females. The frog granted his wish. Mr. Rabbit, after thinking for a while, wished for a crash helmet. One appeared immediately, and he placed it on his head. Mr. Bear was amazed at Mr. Rabbit's wish, but carried on with his second wish.

Mr. Rabbit then wished for a motorcycle. It appeared before him, and he climbed on board and started revving the engine.

Shaking his head, Mr. Bear made his final wish, that all the other bears in the world were females as well, leaving him as the only male bear in the world.

The frog replied that it had been done, and they both turned to Mr. Rabbit for his last wish. Mr. Rabbit revved the engine, thought for a second, then said, ""I wish that Mr. Bear was gay!"" and rode off as fast as he could!",Mr. Bear and Mr. Rabbit,20

""Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968.""

The teacher, amazed, said: ""Class, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Susuki here, who came from another culture, knows more about your native country!""

Then one kid said, ""Ugh, the hell with the Japanese!""

The teacher said, ""WHO SAID THAT?""

Susuki says, ""General MacArthur, 1942, and Lee Lacocca, 1982.""

Then a student says ""God damn it, I want to throw up.""

The teacher starts saying, ""Alright, cut it out. Now, who said that?""

Susuki then answers, ""George H. W. Bush to the Japanese prime minister, 1991."" 

A student then reaches out for a straw, grabs a chewed piece of paper, and spits it on Susuki. He then says, ""SUCK ON THAT!""

Susuki, jumping from his seat, says ""BILL! BILL CLINTON TO MONICA LEWINSKY, 1997!""",It was the first day of class...,3

The fourth kind is Hallway Sex. This is where you pass each other in the hallway and say, ""Screw you!""

John was ecstatic, he loved the circus. He liked the lions, the tigers and the trapeze and especially the clowns. John loved the clowns.

John walked straight to ticket office, where the circus was setting up, and bought front row seats for each of the three nights the circus was in town. The first show night was the next day, and everyone John met he told how excited he was. He enthusiasm for the lions, the tigers and the trapeze was obvious, but when he spoke about the clowns and their antics it was obvious that John loved the clowns.

John managed not to explode with excitement and eventually took up his front row seat at the opening night.

The lions were fantastic, the tigers roared and thrilled and the trapeze artists seemed to fly through the air.

The clowns arrived and John was in tears because he laughed so much at their antics, the silly costumes with big feet, the car that fell apart and the mess and pies in the face. As the clown's act was coming to a close a new clown entered the ring, one with a huge red nose. Spotlights played over the crowd and slowly, one by one they stopped on John. As the last one stopped a murmur went round the crown, and as the clown with the big red nose approached the audience became silent.

""Are you the front end of an ass?"" The clown asked John.
""No!"" came the reply.
""Are you the rear end of an ass?"" The clown probed further.
""No?"" Said John.
""Then, ladies and gentlemen,"" said the clown turning to the audience, ""you must be no end of and ass"".

The audience thought this was hilarious. John was very upset and left the circus in tears.

As he was walking home Dave, his friend, spotted him crying. Dave asked what was wrong.

John explained about the circus and how much he liked it, especially the clowns. He said that tonight's performance had been great, until the end. He told Dave about the lions, the tigers, the trapeze artists and, John's favorite, the clowns.

John then told Dave about the incident with the clown with the big red nose, about how he had asked if John was the front end of and ass, the back end of an ass and had tricked him. He told about the soul shattering moment when everyone had laughed at John for being no end of an ass.

""You should see Ono Balono, The Master of Wit and Repartee,"" said Dave.
""Oh, he's a very important and busy man, I wouldn't want to trouble him, “replied John.

Besides, John thought, tomorrow would be someone else's turn and he cheered up as he began looking forward to the next day’s performance.

The next day, John took his seat. The lions were fantastic, the tigers roared and thrilled and the trapeze artists seemed to fly through the air.

The clowns arrived and John laughed their antics, the silly costumes with big feet, the car that fell apart and the mess and pies in the face. Once again, as the clown's act was coming to a close a new clown entered the ring, the one with the huge red nose. Spotlights played over the crowd and slowly, to John's horror, one by one they stopped on him. As the last one stopped a murmur went round the crowd, the big red nosed clown approached.

""Are you the front end of an ass?"" The clown asked John.
""No,"" trembled John.
""Are you the rear end of an ass?"" The clown probed further.
""No,"" he sobbed, as his mind froze.
""Then, ladies and gentlemen,"" said the clown turning to the audience, ""you must be no end of and ass"".

On his way home, again in tears, Dave spotted him and asked if the same had happened again. John sobbed out the story and Dave took him to see Ono Balono, The Master of Wit and Repartee.

Dave knocked at the door, and with reverence John entered the home of Ono Balono, The Master of Wit and Repartee. John explained his problem and after several moments Ono Balono spoke.

""I will come with you to the final performance"" he announced.

On the last night, John took his seat, reassured that next to him was Ono Balono, The Master of Wit and Repartee. The lions were fantastic, the tigers roared and thrilled and the trapeze artists seemed to fly through the air.

The clowns arrived and John laughed their antics. Again, as the clown's act was coming to a close a the clown with the big red nose entered the ring. Spotlights played over the crowd and slowly, one by one they stopped on John.

The clown with the big red nose approached with an evil grin on his face.

""Are you the front end of an ass?"" The clown asked John.

John looked at Ono Balono and he nodded for John to continue

""No.""

""Are you the rear end of an ass?"" The clown sneered.

Again John looked to Ono Balono and again he was encouraged to continue

""No.""

Before the clown could reply Ono Balono, The Master of Wit and Repartee, stood. The crowd strained to hear the wisdom of The Master, everyone knew of his magnificent wit and repartee.

Ono Balono very slowly extended a finger to point at the clown and slowly, carefully and quietly spoke the words;

""Fuck off big nose!""

He grabbed his broom, pointed it at the bad guy and said ""Bangity Bang Bang, Bang Bang Bangity Bang Bang, Bang Bang"" and he fell down dead.
""Wow this really works"" thought the private. 
He started going through the underbrush when another enemy jumped out and try to gut him - he threw his string at him and said, 'Stabbity Stab Stab, Stab Stab!'. The enemy fell down, dead.
Pretty soon, he saw another guy rampaging through the woods. He pointed his broomstick at him and yelled, 'Bangity Bang Bang, Bang Bang!' Nothing, so he did it again, 'Bangity Bang Bang, Bang Bang!' The guy was running at him now. He threw the string, Stabbit Stab Stab Stab Stab!' The enemy kept running at him and plowed him over, mortally wounding him.
Then he heard the big guy mumbling as he went past him ""Tankity Tank Tank Tank Tank Tankity Tank Tank Tank Tank.""

 Forrest responds, ""It shore is good to be here St.Peter. I was looking forward to this. Nobody ever done told me about any entrance exam. Sure hope the test ain't too hard; life was a big enough test as it were."" 

St. Peter goes on, ""Yea, I know Forrest, but the test I have for thee art only these three questions:

1.   What days of the week begin with the letter T?

2.   How many seconds art there in a year? 

3.   What is God's first name?

So, how answereth thee?""

Forrest slowly screwed up his face in a way that Peter could only concieve to be anticipation, and replied, ""Well, the first one - how many days of the week begin with the letter ""T""? Shucks, that one's easy. That'd be Today and Tomorrow.""

""That was the easiest one of all,"" Forrest replied. ""I learned it from the song..... ""Andy walks with me, Andy talks with me, Andy tells me I'm his'own!""

There were two brothers, about 8 and 10, and bad. Really bad. Anything that went missing from a yard or a convenience store, any cat hit with a Bebe gun, any stolen lunch money could be traced back to these two kids. 

The parents tried EVERYTHING. Punishment, grounding, counseling, even military school, but nothing worked. Finally, on their last legs they decide to send him to the church. They explain the situation to the very large, very angry, fire and brimstone priest, who tells them to send the boys over one at a time, staring with the youngest...at 6:30am.

The boy sleepily lumbers into the office of the priest and plops unceremoniously into the chair. The priest eyes him up and then sneers ""where is God?"" 

The boy stares blankly, but a trace of confusion inches across his face. 

Louder, the priest says accusingly *""Where is God?""*

The boy is now genuinely confused. 

The priest slams his fists on the desk in front of the boy and bellows ***""WHERE IS GOD?!""***

The boy leaps out of his seat, and races out the door. He doesn't stop running until he gets into his house, races up to his room and shakes his still sleeping brother awake. The roused boy angrily asks what's wrong. 

Gasping for breath, his brother stammers ""God's missing and they think we done it!""",Where is God?,38

After years of being teased by the Tribe he had enough and wanted out. He went to the Chief and told him he no longer wanted to be part of the Tribe. Puzzled, the great old Chief said that no one but Death had ever left the tribe. And that he would have to console with him overnight for advice. The next day the Chief said to the Brave that you must successfully perform three feats before you can get out of the Tribe. First, cross the crazy creek that is full of alligators. Second you must climb the mountain and pull out an abscessed tooth out of the Great Bear. Third you must go to the red tepee, and sexually satisfy the squaw who's never been satisfied. The young brave thought it over and a look of determination ran across his face. Off he went with the tribe cheering him on. Screaming and running he crossed the crazy creek with gators chomping and hissing all around him. Stopping only briefly to catch his breath he looked up at that big mountain and fiercely ran towards it. Several days pass by and the tribe begins to worry for their young brave. Then one day on the horizon a shadow appears. The young brave has returned! But he is beaten and bloody. Almost falling down he begs for a buffalo water bag and takes a big gulp of cold water. After a few seconds, he yells proudly at the tribe a question. Now, where's this squaw with an abscessed tooth?!",Young Indian Brave.,8

The certificate was for consultation with an Indian medicine man living on a nearby reservation who was rumored to have a simple cure for erectile dysfunction. The husband went to the reservation and saw the medicine man.
The old Indian gave him a potion and, with a grip on his shoulder, warned ‘This is a powerful medicine. You take only a teaspoonful, and then say: ‘1-2-3.' When you do, you will become more manly than you have ever been in your life, and you can perform for as long as you want.”

The man thanked the old Indian, and as he walked away, he turned and asked: “How do I stop the medicine from working?"" 

""Your partner must say ‘1-2-3-4,' he responded, ""but when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon.”

He was very eager to see if it worked so he went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine, and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom.

When she came in, he took off his clothes and said: ""1-2-3!” Immediately, he was the manliest of men. His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes, and asked: ""What was the 1-2-3 for?”

He was driving along near a campground when he heard a frantic commotion just at the edge of the woods.

He found a helpless Democrat wearing shorts, sandals, a 'Vote for Hillary' hat and a 'Save the Trees' shirt. The man was screaming and struggling frantically, thrashing all about trying to free himself from the grasp of a 10-foot grizzly bear.

As the Pope watched in horror, a group of Republican loggers wearing ‘Make America Great Again’ shirts came racing up. One quickly fired a .44 magnum slug right into the bear's chest. The two other men pulled the semiconscious Democrat from the bear's grasp. Then using baseball bats, the three loggers finished off the bear.

Two of the men dragged the dead grizzly onto the bed of their pickup truck while the other tenderly placed the injured Democrat in the back seat.

As they began to leave, the Pope summoned all of them over to him. ""I give you my blessing for your brave actions!"" he proudly proclaimed. I have heard there was bitter hatred between Republican loggers and Democratic environmental activists, but now I've seen with my own eyes that this is not true.

As the Pope drove off, one logger asked, ""Who was that guy?
""Dude, that was the Pope. He's in direct contact with Heaven and has access to all wisdom.”

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single 
banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.
On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped into the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

Well, here it is:
There was this loving grandfather who always made a special effort to spend time with his son's family on weekends. Every Saturday morning he would take his 5-year-old granddaughter out for a drive in the car for some quality time -- pancakes, ice cream, candy -- just him and his granddaughter.
One particular Saturday, however, he had a terrible cold and could not get out of bed. He knew his granddaughter always looked forward to their drives and would be very disappointed.
Luckily, his wife came to the rescue and said that she would take their granddaughter for her weekly drive and breakfast. When they returned, the little girl anxiously ran upstairs to see her grandfather who was still in bed.
""Well, did you enjoy your ride with grandma?"" he asked.
""Not really, PaPa, it was boring. We didn't see a single asshole, queer, piece of shit, horse's ass, tree hugger, socialist left wing prick, blind bastard, dipshit, Muslim camel humper or son of a bitch anywhere we went! We just drove around and Grandma smiled at everyone she saw. I really didn't have any fun.""

Handing him the mop handle, ""What you have to do is point this at the jerrys and shout ""Bang-ity! Bang-ity!"" They'll drop like flies.""

Suddenly, the machine gun went quite. He pointed it at the few last Germans and yelled ""Bang-ity! Bang-ity!"" And they screamed and fell. It was working! He kept it up as both sides died. ""Bang-ity! Bang-ity!!""
After an hour of this, there were only two men left on the field, himself and one big German walking toward him. ""Bang-ity! Bang-ity!"" Nothing. Snafu tried again. ""Bang-ity! Bang-ity!"" But still nothing. Standing and screaming, Snafu charged the krout. ""Stab-ity! Stab-ity!"" he jabbed away. Still, nothing. Slowly, the fellow stepped on his foot, walked up and across him and crushed the air out of him. Nearly killing him, the German walked on and left him in the mud, bleeding and struggling for air.

He starts learning his favorite songs, and it gets to the point that his friends encourage him to start playing live. So he starts playing guitar at various clubs, performing covers of The Strokes and Radiohead. His favorite song to cover was Beck's ""Loser"". Eventually, he got bored of playing alone. He felt limited by his instrument. He recruited his friends to form a band; a chicken that played bass, a pig that played drums, and a cow that sang. Now they had a full band, and they called themselves ""The Animals"". They began practicing in the horse's garage, and they began writing their own songs. After a couple years playing gigs in the local bars, they meet the Lamb, who had some basic recording equipment. He helps them cut a few demos, and he sends them around to the minor labels. They get picked up by Barnyard Records, and they began recording an album. It gets released, and it becomes popular in the musical underground. However, the Horse began getting cocky. He started drinking, and he began verbally abusing members of the band when they messed up during rehearsals. Eventually, the rest of the band had enough and asked him to leave. Feeling betrayed by his own friends, yet guilty for having caused his own suffering, he heads to the bar to drink his problems away.

When the usher came by and noticed this, he whispered to the man, “Sorry, sir, but you’re only allowed one seat.”

The man groaned but didn’t budge. The usher became impatient.
“Sir, if you don’t get up from there I’m going to have to call the manager.”

Again, the man just groaned, which infuriated the usher, who turned and marched briskly back up the aisle in search of his manager.

In a few moments, both the usher and the manager returned and stood over the man. Together the two of them tried repeatedly to move him, but with no success.

Finally, they summoned the police. The cop surveyed the situation briefly then asked, “Alright buddy, what’s your name?”

“Sam,” the man moaned.

“Where ya from, Sam?”

With pain in his voice, Sam replied “… the balcony.”

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a beautiful sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.
Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""
The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""
The man sets about his task.

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.
""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""
The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""
The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.
Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

Long one so get ready..

A young guy goes to purchase an old motorcycle from an old timer. When he arrives he's floored at how clean and spotless the bike is. It's flawless. He asks the old gentleman how he has kept this 40 year old bike in such great condition. Just then it starts to drizzle a bit. The old man takes out a jar of Vaseline and wipes down the whole bike. He states it's his secret for keeping it spotless and asks the young man to keep his secret safe and to always wipe it down before a rain. The young man promises he will. Deal done and the old man even throws in his jar of Vaseline.

  Later that evening he takes his motorcycle over to meet his girlfriends parents for the first time. Walking up to the house his girlfriend warns "" We have a weird sort of tradition in our house, we don't speak a word during dinner otherwise you have to do all the dishes.""  Odd but just then a smoking hot girl answers the door and introduces herself as the younger sister, Dad seems nice and introduces Mom, who is also very good looking. 

 Some small talk and it's time for dinner. The young man walks into the kitchen to help serve dinner and is shocked. No one has done the dishes for what seems months! Dirty plates stacked to the ceiling. It's a mess. He brings the food to the table thinking "" I'm not going to say a word!""

 Dinner is actually good and he just smiles along. His girlfriend starts to play footsie with him, then starts feeling his inner thigh. He's getting excited but realizes this maybe just a ploy to get him to speak. He's not falling for it! She then goes under the table and starts to give him a blow job right at Dinner!! He's so confused but also so turned on. The family notices but says nothing, they just keep eating. Mom is visibly getting turned on and the younger sister is too! 

  The girlfriend comes back up from under the table and takes off her pants, they start banging right on the table! ""This is insane"" he thinks but is so turned on he can't stop. He bangs the girlfriend, then the mom, and even the sister all while nothing is being said!!  The dad just keeps eating the whole time! 
 Just then the young guy looks out the dining room window and notices it's starting to drizzle, so he whips out the Vaseline.  ""Fine! Fuck it I'll do the dishes!""  yells the dad.",The Dishes,128

He who wants to be transformed and likened to the appearance of their idol shall ride this boat and shout the name of that person and jump off the boat just before the river ends."" The three, wanting to look more handsome than they are at the moment, took this opportunity to look like their favorite celebrities.

John, being the bravest of the group, was the first one to try the river's magic. ""Well, here goes nothing."", he says to group before going off. Everything goes well and as he came closer to the end of the river, he jumped and shouted, ""BRAD PITT!"".

Having seen that the river actually works, Ben took off immediately and did the same thing like his friend. As Ben came closer to the end of the river, he jumped and shouted, ""Tom Cruise!""

The biker jumps off his bike, runs to the cage and hits the lion square on the nose with a powerful punch. Whimpering from the pain the lion jumps back, letting go of the girl, and the biker brings her to her terrified parents, who thank him endlessly.

A New York Times reporter has watched the whole event. The reporter says, “Sir, this was the most gallant and brave thing I saw a man do in my whole life.” The biker replies, “Why, it was nothing, really, the lion was behind bars. I just saw this little kid in danger, and acted as I felt right.”

The reporter says, “Well, I’m a journalist from the New York Times, and tomorrow’s paper will have this story on the front page… so, what do you do for a living and what political affiliation do you have?”

The biker replies, “I’m a U.S. Marine and a Republican.”

The following morning the biker buys The New York Times to see if it indeed brings news of his actions, and reads, on the front page:

“U.S. MARINE ASSAULTS AFRICAN IMMIGRANT AND STEALS HIS LUNCH.”",A biker is passing the zoo when he sees a little girl leaning into the lion’s cage.,2892

They were sitting on beach chairs, enjoying a drink, the sunshine and the scenery when a drop dead gorgeous blonde in a bikini came walking straight towards them. 
They couldn't help but stare. As the blonde passed them she smiled and said 'Good Morning, Father, Good Morning, Father,' 
nodding and addressing each of them individually, then she passed on by. 
  
They were both stunned. 
How in the world did she know they were priests?   
So the next day, they went back to the store and bought even more outrageous outfits. These were so loud you could hear them before you even saw them! 
Once again, in their new attire, they settled down in their chairs to enjoy the sunshine.   
After a little while, the same gorgeous blonde, wearing a different colored bikini, taking her sweet time, came walking toward them.   
Again she nodded at each of them, said 'Good morning, Father, Good morning, Father,' and started to walk away.

The guards take all three man straight to the king to meet their fate. 

Extremely angry the king decides to punish the men by ordering them each 20 lashes to the back. 

They are hauled to the punishment chamber to receive their 20 lashes.

Christian man happens to be first in line and naturally scared he pisses his pants. The punisher sees this and cant help but have a little sympathy.

The punisher tells the Christian man its okay and that even though he is the punisher he in fact really hates his job. 

Trying to calm the Christian man the punisher offers him anything he needs in order to make the 20 lashes easier on him.

The Christian man happily asks to have a pillow strapped to his back. His wish is granted.

The punisher lets loose with his whip and on the 15 strike the pillow rips open and flys off. The Christian man receives 5 straight lashes to his back and moves aside. 

The Jew is next and is offered the same deal. Being a smart Jew he immediately responds and asks for 2 pillows. His wish also is granted.

18 lashes to his back and both pillows rip open and fly off. He gets 2 strikes on his back and collapses in pain before he is hauled aside.

The muslim man being next starts crying right away. When asked by the punisher why he is crying? The muslim answers saying how he regrets his crime because of the severity of his sin to rob someone. And he feels worthless because he thinks 20 lashes are not enough for his crime and asks for a increase to a 100 lashes so he can learn his lesson. 

The punisher being extremely surprised at the muslim mans honesty and sense of remorse says 100 lashes it is you honest muslim. Now what can I do to help make such monumental punishment easier on you as I did to the Christian and Jew before you. 

The Muslim man politely asks to have the Jew tied to his back. ","A Jew, muslim and Christian come up with a plot to rob the kings treasury.",1865
