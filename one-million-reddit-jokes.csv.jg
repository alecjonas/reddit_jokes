He joined late. Skip forward to the first fight. He’s in the trench. Tommy as we’ll call him goes up to his captain, and says, er, captain, i’m reporting for duty. I want to fight for my country! 
The captain replies, you’re a brave kid, but we’ve got no guns left! Take this stick. Point it at the jerrys, and say bang bang!
Now tommy’s a bit nervous. But the captain blows the whistle and they go over the top. Tommy is very nervous. He hears gunshots going off, bombs exploding in the mud all around him. He sees a lone jerry. Meekly, he points the stick at the jerry, and says bang bang. The jerry falls to the ground. Dead.
Now tommy has made it through the first wave! Hurah!
Tommy goes up to the captain and says wow! How does that work? The captain just says, trust me tommy, trust me.
Before the second wave, the captain gives his regiment a briefing, that this second wave would be harder and that there would be close combat. He turns to tommy, who is still clutching his stick and says, tommy, when you get close, just say stab stab.
Tommy, who is a bit more confident now, goes over the top. He starts dropping jerrys left and right. He has killed about eleven now, before one of them gets close.  Tommy nervously points his stick and says stab stab! Again the jerry clutches his stomach and falls to the floor dead. 
Now tommy has survived the 2nd wave. Again he speaks to the captain! Wow he says, i’m amazed! Again, the captain says trust me tommy, just trust me.
Now the third wave approaches, the whistle goes and tommy and his regiment go over the top. Almost all of the jerrys are now dead. It seems like they’ve won this battle. When the fog starts to clear a lone jerry is walking towards them. Tommy, who is now super confident, tells his regiment to stand down and that he has got this. He points his stick. “BANG BANG”. Nothing happens. Again, more nervous this time. “Bang bang!”. Nothing happens. Now tommy can see that this jerry is mumbling something. He is almost on top of tommy now. Now tommy says, “Stab Stab!” Nothing happens. The jerry is now so close that tommy can hear what he is saying.
“Tank, tank, tank, tank, tank”",Tommy,6

An out of work pianist with Tourettes Syndrome is strolling around the streets and bars of Soho one unemployed afternoon. Walking down Dean Street he sees a lounge bar with a sign in the window 'Pianist wanted for evening performances'.
'Fucking get in there you cunt!' he says to himself and goes to the bar. 'Get the fucking manager of this pigs shit middle class wankhole please you cunt', he says to a somewhat startled barman. The barman however obliges and his manager comes upstairs. 'Can I help you sir?' he says
'Yes you can you fat piece of shit, I saw your poxy advert in the cunting window and I'm here to audition.....wanker.'
The manager is naturally put off by the man's abrasive manner but his dire need for a top class pianist forces him to agree to an audition. The first tune the Pianist plays is an uplifting jazzy number, not too involving, yet utterly melodic. At the end the thrilled barman cries, 'Wonderful, wonderful. What was that called?' 'That song, you big nosed twat, was called ""Excuse me prime minister but I just jizzed in your daughter's eye, and now the cunts blind...'
'Oh' says the manager 'err, can you play me another. Something a little less ""lively"".
'Wanker..' interjects the pianist before launching into a powerful ballad which leaves the manager in tears. The manager through his salty teardrops asks him the title. 'That little number was called ""Sometimes when you do a bird up the shitbox you get crap on your bell end.'
'I see' says the manager, 'Have you got any songs with less offensive titles?' 'Well there's my jazz number ""Do you want me to split your ringpiece"", or there's the epic ""I don't care if you're older my dear, you've still got nice jugs"".
'Look' says the manager interrupting, 'I think you're a superb pianist but the title of your songs are a little ""racy"". I will hire you on the condition that you do not introduce your songs or speak to the audience.'
'Fuck it' says the pianist 'Why not'.
On his first night everything is going superbly the crowd are lapping up his repertoire and his silence is being perceived as modesty. The only thing putting off the pianist is that in the front row there is a gorgeous blonde in a black evening dress with a split up the side revealing the tops of her stockings, and a plunging neckline which boasts a proud and inviting cleavage. During the interval the pianist has got such a stonking hard on that he decides to go to the bog and knock one out. Just as he has shot his muck he hears himself being re-introduced over the tannoy, so he rushes back to the stage and finishes his act. After the show he is at the bar relaxing when the blonde approaches him. 'Hi' she says. 'Hello' he winces, struggling to hold in the expletives. She leans over and whispers in his ear, 'Do you know your cock is hanging out of your trousers, and spunk is dribbling onto your shoes?'
'Know it?' says the pianist putting his beer on the bar confidently, 'I fucking wrote it!!!'",The tourettes pianist,17

post,8myueb,2qh72,jokes,false,1527598321,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8myueb/the_tale_of_yuri_preemptive_apologies/,self.jokes,,"Yuri had lived in Russia all of his life, in a small town near Moscow. The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.

Every day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, ""SWIMMING LESSONS"" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.

Yuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, ""If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough..."" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.

Every day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri's.

A few months had passed, and Yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.

Later that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words ""DIVING PRACTICES"" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles.  Yuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.

The practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.

Many people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. ""It is only something I am fond of, a hobby"" Yuri would say. ""I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy."" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.

For yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. ""TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!"" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.

Yuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.

Finally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. ""It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life..."" Yuri would always respond to his fans.

One day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. ""Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!"" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, ""And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!"" Yuri replied, ""Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.""

Yuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.

Unfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. ""Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!"" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.

""It is OK, everybody"" Yuri yelled back. ""I have endured many hardships in my life.""",The tale of Yuri. (Preemptive apologies).,3219

As I sat at my desk waiting for my first-ever customer, an old man walked in with a Labrador Retriever by his side. The man sauntered up to my desk, and in a thick British accent said to me, ""I've got two loans currently taken, both of which I'd like to repay. You can find me under Wyman, Bill.

Before I could look him up, he rustled in his coat pocket and removed a pack orange-flavored Tic-Tac breath mints. Without missing a beat, he took one, said, ""You should find this sufficient to cover the first balance,"" and kneeled down to set it on my foot.

""And _this_,"" he held up another, ""should cover the second."" Again, he kneeled down and set it on my foot. At this point I had no idea how to react to this guy, but it was at that moment things entered a whole dimension of weird.

The dog placed its paws on my desk and this guy says, ""Oh yes, and the dog needs to take out a loan for $100,000. I understand this is an exceptional request, so I shall present you with this..."" Once more he began fishing through his pockets, this time revealing a small trinket of no discernable value. ""Present this to your boss, he'll know what it means.""

So I made my way to the back and knocked on the door of the branch manager's suite. After he invited me in, I recounted to him all of the events that had taken place up to this point. I showed him the strange object and said, ""He wanted you to see this. Said you'd know what it means. What even is this thing?""

He took it from me and examined it inquisitively. His brow furrowed, ""This old man, he payed two?"" 

""He placed Tic-Tacs on my shoe,"" I corrected. And with that, his eyes grew enormous as he exclaimed, ""It's a knick-knack, Patty Mack! Give the dog a loan; this old man's a Rolling Stone!",It was my very first day...,10

Because i didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, i explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away. 

""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her arse with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked!

The soldier had been granted rest and relaxation and was on a train that was bound for London.

The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train in hopes of finding an empty seat.

The only empty seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged English lady and was being used by her little dog.

The weary soldier asked, ""Please ma'am, may I sit in that seat?""

The English woman looked down her nose at the solider and sniffed then said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see that my little pooch is using that seat?""

The soldier walked away, looking if there were any other unoccupied seats to use, but after another trip down to the end of the train, he found himself facing the woman with the dog again.

Again, the soldier asked, ""Please lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired.""

The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted out loud, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also extremely arrogant!""

The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog and tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.

The Woman, at a loss for words; shrieked, railed and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

An English gentlemen sitting across the aisle spoke up and said, ""You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand, you drive your autos on the wrong side of the road and now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window!.""","An American soldier, serving in World War II had just returned from several weeks of battle on the German front lines.",315

""My glorious country is an age-old kingdom that spans the entire globe,"" he says. ""We are a superior people, therefore I must live. God bless the Queen!""

Later, Dave went to the kitchen to get some refreshments. Frank's wife followed and asked, 'Did you see anything that you like under there?' Surprised by her boldness, Dave admitted that, well indeed he did.

She said, 'Well, you can have it but it will cost you $500. 'After taking a minute or two to assess the financial and moral costs of this offer, Dave confirms that he is interested.

Sue told him that since her husband Frank worked Friday afternoons and Dave didn't, Dave should be at her house around 2 p.m. Friday afternoon.

When Friday rolled around, Dave showed up at Frank's house at 2 p.m. sharp - and after paying Sue the agreed sum of $500 - they went to the bedroom and closed their transaction, as agreed.

Dave quickly dressed and left. As usual, Frank came home from work at 6 p.m. And upon arriving, asked his wife: 'Did Dave come by the house this afternoon?'

With a lump in her throat Sue answered 'Why yes, he did stop by for a few minutes this afternoon.'

Her heart nearly skipped a beat when her husband curtly asked, 'And did he give you $500?'

Sue, using her best poker face, replied, 'Well, yes, in fact he did give me $500.'

The Highways Agency found over 200 dead crows on the tunnel approach last night.

There was concerns that they may have died from Avian Flu. A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. 

However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with lorrys, while only 2% were killed by cars.

The Agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. 

They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""Lorry""",Tunnel closure,6

The young man replies, ""A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!""  
""Wheeewee... that's a lot of money,"" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. ""Why does it cost so much?""  
""Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!"" states the banker proudly.

""No problem,"" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, ""That's a pretty nice car, all right... but I'll stick with my moped!""  
Just then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph!

""What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?"" the young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh!  
He's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!  
The Ferrari red lines and there's nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end.

Then I told him about the natural phenomenon that were measured on logarithmic scales like earthquakes and sensory perception.

I explained how before calculators were common, you had logarithm tables in the back of your math book so that it would be easy to do calculations.  

Then I told him about Noah who told the animals to go forth and multiply.  When two small snakes began to cry, refusing to leave the arc, Noah knew just what to do.  He cut down a tree and fashioned four little legs for it.  Even adders can multiply with a log table.

My son still talks to me, so that's nice.

post,8mlrzv,2qh72,jokes,false,1527464850,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8mlrzv/numbers_and_your_family/,self.jokes,,"I've always been interested in both words AND numbers. So when these clicker games started calling large order numbers by their real names, I started drooling at the possibility of seeing the sequence of numbers in action.  We've all heard of a googol (1 followed by 100 zeros) as a number... and likewise, a googolplex. A googolplex is a 1 with a googol zeros after it.  This is an unfathomably large number.  I'm just going to be demonstrating what a googol is with respect to these numbers.  Googol, not to be confused with the search engine Google, and googolplex are just about the only named numbers that there are for now.

First off, we tend to separate the numbers with a comma, space, or other marking every 3rd digit (i.e. 1,000,000 or 1 000 000 etc.) Most of us are aware that after a thousand is a million, at least in English-style languages. As an aside, in French thousand is mille, which is part of the title of a wonderful card game, Mille Bourne. I digress.

After a million, things get a little interesting.  In modern English, it goes right to a billion (a thousand millions).  But, in many other languages, there's an intermediate step, a milliard, which is THEN followed by a billion. So, whereas in English the progression would be thousand, million, billion, trillion, etc., in some other languages it is thousand, million, millard, billion.  For those other languages, their pattern follows with the -illion, -illiard, -illion, -illiard sequence.  So now that we know how to end the words, what about the start?

Few have a use for anything beyond a trillion.  I don't even think I've heard a scientist or mathematician use anything beyond a trillion in a lecture or discussion.  So what comes next?  We'll have to dip into Latin to find out.  Just as a trillion means three 'illions' and a tricycle is something with three wheels, and a four-legged creature is a quadruped, you would expect some sort of quad- prefix for the next -illion.  And you'd be right.  It is quadrillion.  And it doesn't stop there.  We have the whole rest of the chain here, including quint-, sext-, sept-, oct-, non-, and then dec-.  You might even recognize SEPTember, OCTober, NOvember, and DECember from the original naming of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth moons(months) respectively.

But what happens after the decillion?  Is there and elevenillion? A twelvillion, or a thirteenillion?  Traditionally, the eleven and twelve are not in the sequence, but the thirteen, with a little fiddling around, IS in there.  Let's look at what thirteen is.  It describes three-ten, but it MEANS a ten with a three, or 13.  Otherwise if we heard someone say thirteen we'd hear ""thir-"" and write ""3"" then hear ""-teen"" and write ""1"" or ""10"" if we were too new to it.  But we just know that hearing thirteen means ""13"" in the spoken form. So how is this treated in the numbers above decillion?  Well using the ""thirteen"" method, it would be one-teen, two-teen, three-teen, and so on.  But we're going to lean more towards Latin. So, with the Latin twist (and no that's not a dance), it would be undecillion, duodecillion, and tredecillion.  The ""tre-"" is in the place of the ""thir-"", and the ""-dec-"" is in the place of the ""-teen.""

Easy!  The numbers are just named backwards, but we're already sort of used to it with the teens. If we have a decillion, we know it is ten sets of ""000"" AFTER one thousand, so that means it is eleven sets of ""000"" after a one. I'll first write it with a letter to mark thousand, trillion, octillion, etc.

1,t000,m000,b000,T000,q000,Q000,s000,S000,o000,n000,d000
and without the markers:
1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 1 decillion!

It's a lot of zeros, but it is only about a third of the way to a googol.  Remember a googol is 1 followed by 100 zeros. A decillion is 1 followed by 33 zeros. How can we rapidly find what a googol is without writing the whole thing out and counting? Well, it has 100 zeros in it, and since we are clumping everything into sets of three zeros, why not divide by three?  100 divided by three is 33 and a remainder of 1.  So, let's add that remainder to a one for now and make it a ten.  We also have to remember that the first set of ""000"" is called thousand, so let's set that aside, too.  We're not removing it, we just already have a name for 1000.
What about the rest? We have 32 sets of ""000"" to work with.  We know that ten -illions is called decillion.  But this is thirty of them! Not to fret, there are still plenty of words.  It so happens that 20 -illions is called a vigintillion.  What then follows is a trigintillion.
Now we're getting somwhere. If we remember the method from before with the thirteen, the last number is named first.  So we're in the home stretch.  We have duotrigintillion, or 2-and-30-illions.  We don't need to pull that thousand back in, for the same reason a million is not a millithousand or something.  But, we did set aside a remainder with the initial ""1"" from when we divided.  What does that leave?

Ten duotrigintillion, or if the ""-illiard"" sequence holds this far in, ten sexdecilliard (I hope). And that's just how many zeros are in a googolPLEX.  That is basically nothing compared to infinity or other ultra-large numbers.

So what does this have to do with your family?

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""",A horse is watching MTV,23

After these words panic spread amongst the animals. For the lion was known for his enourmous tally whacker. And so the animals ran away in desperate search for food, they could offer their king. The day of the big feast arrived and the animals cued in line to present the king their offerings. First in line was the cheetah, which brought a leg of gazelle. The next one was the cougar, which brought a rack of lamb. Both got a pad on the back and joined the feast. Then the bunny approached the lion with a basket of berries. The lion looked at the bunny disappointed and said: ""I only asked for meat. So why you bring my berries?!""

""I am just a little bunny and not fit for the hunt."" The little bunny replied.

""I See."" Said the lion furiosly ""Now you shall feel my wrath!""

The lion rose up and enrolled his humongeous meat snake. He than started pounding the little bunny with his pink helmed love warrior. The bunny cried in agony but than his screams turned into a manic laughter.

Both the men he’s with pull out their sandwiches to be disappointed by jam sandwiches and plain ham sandwiches. The same sandwiches they have every day. They all agree that if they have the same the next day they will all jump off.

The next day the men are sat having their lunch and all nervously pull out their sandwiches. Sure enough all three have the same sandwiches and one by one all jump off to their deaths.

Word quickly spreads about the reason behind their jumping and they all have a joint funeral.

The first mans wife says to the other wives “I don’t understand it if he had asked for something else I would have made it.” The second wife agrees. The third wife says “I don’t get it he made his own fucking sandwiches!”",Three men building a skyscraper,6

The husband would wake up every morning and thrust out a loooonnnnnng fart. 
She told him for years, ""Some day, you're going to shit your guts out if you keep on"" but that never stopped him from his morning routine.  Finally, after decades, she had enough. 
After cleaning out a turkey she took the insides and carefully snuck them into his pajamas while he was sleeping. 
When he woke up she hears the normal RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP followed by horrific screams. 
After several minutes there is quietness and the husband shuffles into the kitchen.

He frowns, puzzled, but continues on to his appointment ( I don't know...maybe at a tractor supply. Whatever.)

Returning by the same route several hours later, he again sees the man, holding up the large object, but next to a different apple tree. He decides to see what the hell is going on. He parks and makes his way through the orchard, and as he gets nearer, he sees that it's a father in overalls and a straw hat, and the farmer is holding up a huge pig, which is gobbling apples off the tree.

The salesman says, ""What the hell have you been doing here all afternoon?""

""Waal"", says the farmer, "" I reckon I'm just fattening up this ol' pig.""

The man and the farmer walk to the garage, where a dog is lying on a dog bed. It sees them and walks over to them. 

F: Go on, ask him anything.

The man says;

M: Alright dog, tell me about yourself.

To the mans surprise, the dog begins to speak, clearly and with proper words, not the typical ""arooo you"" that you usually hear on the internet.

D: Well, when I was a young pup, I always wanted to serve my country. So, as soon as I could, I enlisted with the airport security as a sniffer dog. I was real good at my job too, got a few promotions and turned some heads. Eventually, the US army picked me up as a bomb-sniffer dog, and I helped prevent tragedies all across the country and oversees. After a while I retired, found myself a nice girl, had a few pups, and finally came to this farm to live out my golden years.

The man is stunned. He says to the farmer:

M: Holy cow, you were right! Why are you only asking $5 for this dog!?

So he goes to the doctor himself to ask if anything can be done about it.

Man: Doc, I think my wife may be losing her hearing. Is there anything I can do for her? 

Doctor: Well, treatments usually depend on how severe the hearing loss is. Sometimes the patient can just continue living a normal life.

Man: I am not sure how bad it has gotten, how can I test how bad it is without letting my wife know what I'm doing?

Doctor: That should be easy. Just stand somewhere in the house, maybe like 3 rooms away from your wife, and ask her a question. Anytime you don't here a response move one room closer and ask it again until she responds to you. If she still can't hear you when you're in the same room, then you should definitely bring her in to be examined. 

The man is content with this idea, and goes back home to put it to work. When he gets home he greets his wife and walks through his house until he is 3 rooms away from his wife. He clears his throat, and tries to yell through the rooms to ask a question

Mam: HEY HONEY, WHAT IS FOR DINNER TONIGHT? 

There is no response. The man thinks to himself, well the rooms are kind of big in this house and maybe I didn't raise my voice enough. So he moves on and is now standing 2 rooms over from his wife and tries again. 

Man: HEY BABE, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WILL MAKE FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

Still no response. The man thinks to himself, well I suspected she was losing her hearing so this is no shocker that she didn't hear me here either. So he moves on and is now standing 1 room over from his wife and tries again.

Man: SWEETIE, WHAT WILL DINNER BE TONIGHT?

Again, no response. The man thinks to himself, my poor wife will certainly need some kind of hearing aid if she wasn't able to hear that! But maybe it's not all bad, maybe she'll hear me if I stand in the kitchen with her. So he walks into the kitchen, clears his throat, and asks loudly.

“We went behind the behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and I made love to you”.

“Yes”, she says..”I remember it well”.

“OK, how about taking a stroll around there and we can do it for old time’s sake?”

“Oh Jim, you Old Devil, that sounds like a crazy, yet marvellous idea”.

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation, and having a chuckle to himself, he thinks, “ I’ve got to see these two old-timers going at it. I’ll just keep an eye on them so there’s no trouble”.

So be follows them.

The elderly couple walk haltingly along, leaning against each other for support, aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and lean up against the fence. Then suddenly, they erupt into the most Furious love-making the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about 10 minutes while both are making loud noises and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about old age and life that he didn’t know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman is still watching and thinks to himself : 

“This is truly amazing. I’ve got to ask them what their secret is”.

So as the couple passes, he says to them, “Excuse me, But that was something else. You must’ve had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?”

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply...

“Fifty years ago, there wasn’t an electric fence!”","Jim leans over and asks his wife, “Do you remember the first time we had sex together over 50 years ago?”",39

So the magistrate kept listening, ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""

Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate.

He stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about.

Three explorers (an Englishman, a Japanese, and an American) were captured by cannibals deep in the jungles of the Philippines.

Knowing that he doesn't stand a chance against the entire tribe of cannibals, the Englishman asks for his pistol.  ""God save the queen!"" he shouts and shoots himself in the head.  It was a very honorable death.


The Japanese man is similarly convinced of his impending doom and asks for his sword. ""Banzai!"" he screams and he commits seppuku right there, spilling his entrails all over the ground.  An extremely honorable death. 


The American man asks for his fork.


""A fork?!"" asks the cannibal?
