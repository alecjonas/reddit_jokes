&gt;  
&gt;""Funny one!"" answers the man, ""I'm going to tell it to my wife!""  
&gt;  
&gt;So Jim goes home and tells his wife: ""Honey, how many eggs can you eat on an empty stomach?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I don't know"", answers his wife, ""I'd say 3 or 4"".  
&gt;  
&gt;""Too bad"" says Jim, ""If you had answered «a dozen», I would have had a funny joke for you"".

&amp;#x200B;

Here, we can see that Jim's understanding of the joke was too literal. Again, even though his friend's joke is well known, the fact that Jim didn't see he could still tell it to his wife is unexpected. Your brain knows it (unless you're like Jim) and *you* get the joke on a second level. Meta-joke… **BOOM!**

# Meta-meta-joke

Obviously, a meta-meta-joke (yes, we're finally here) is a joke about a meta-joke.

This time, before I tell you that joke, I must tell you three meta-jokes that you may know of. They all look similar, so I'll only add a new punchline to each subsequent meta-joke.

&gt;In a family, they tell so many jokes that they ended up numbering them. It is often heard, at a family dinner, that the grampa says ""Hey, guys, listen to that one: 78!"" and every one starts laughing.  
&gt;  
&gt;But one day, little Bobby, who doesn't really understand what's going on, wonders what's that funny. He finally builds up some courage and shouts to everyone: ""43!""  
&gt;  
&gt;His mother's hand falls on his cheek with a big smack and she tells him: ""Bobby, where did you learn those kind of words?""

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the second joke:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In the same family, there is a guest the next day. Just as Bobby, he's completely oblivious of the meaning of those numbers. As an adult, he politely asks his hosts what was going on and they explain to him.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Can I try?"" he asks.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Why of course, dear"" says the granny.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Ok, let's go… 31"".  
&gt;  
&gt;No one laughs. The guest asks ""why isn't anyone laughing?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Well"", answers the father, ""apparently you don't know how to tell a joke"".

&amp;#x200B;

And the last one:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A month later, the same guest is invited again to dinner. This time, just before the dinner starts, he tells everyone: ""OK, people, I practiced and I'm ready to tell you a joke.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Everyone is intrigued and listens to him. Taking a deep breath, the man shouts: ""112"".  
&gt;  
&gt;After a few seconds of silence, every other person starts laughing frantically, one of those never ending laughters that almost makes you uncomfortable.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Why are you laughing so hard?"" he asks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trying to speak as she could, the mother answers: ""That's a joke we never heard before!""

&amp;#x200B;

You know have three nice looking (and quite similar) meta-jokes. Now here is a meta-meta-joke:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Kyle asks a friend: ""do you know the joke about the family who knows so many of them?""  
&gt;  
&gt;His friend answers: ""Which one do you mean? Number one, number two or number three?""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry, but I lied to you… this (I mean all this) is actually a meta-meta-meta-joke! That should at least make you giggle.",Meta-meta-joke,20

""OI!"" he calls out to the Koala, ""What are you doin' up there?""

The koala looks down at the lizard, ""Oh hey bro, I was just about to smoke a spliff. You can join me if you want.""

""Hells yeah!"" replies the lizard, making his way up the tree.

After smoking the spliff, the lizard says to the koala ""I need water bro, I'm so ripped. I'm just gonna go grab a drink.""

""No worries,"" replies the koala, ""you go get a drink.""

The lizard - stoned out of his gourd - makes his way down the tree and stumbles over to a nearby river, but as he's trying to get a drink he accidentally falls in. Immediately panicking that he's going to drown, he starts scrambling, frantically trying to get out of the water and back onto the safety of the bank.

A nearby crocodile who had been watching him came over and helped the lizard out of the river. ""Dude,"" said the crocodile, ""I was just watching you trying to get a drink and you fell in like an idiot. What the hell is wrong with you?""

""Dude, I'm so stoned,"" replied the lizard, ""I've been sitting in a tree with a koala smoking a joint.""

""A koala in a tree smoking a joint?"" laughed the crocodile, ""This I have to see.""

One day at the end of class, little Johnny's teacher asks the class to go home and think of a story to be concluded with the moral of that story. 
The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story.

Little Suzy raises her hand. ""My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. 
Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.""
When the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, ""Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.""

Little Lucy went next. ""My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.""
Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.
Lucy replied, ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch.""

Next up was little Johnny. 
""My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. 

On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. 
He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! 
So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. 
Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""

The teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.

""Well,"" Johnny replied, ""Don't f**k with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.""

At school one day, the teacher was trying to approach the topic of sex education and asked her students if they'd ever seen anything that was related to sex education on TV.

Mary raised her hand and said she had seen a movie about women having babies. 

“Great,” said the teacher, “that's very important. ”
Then Judy raised her hand and told the teacher she had seen a TV show about people getting married. 

“Well, that has to do with it too,” said the teacher.

Then Johnny raised his hand and said he had seen a western where some Indians came riding over the hill and John Wayne shot them all. 

The teacher said, “Well, Johnny, that really doesn't have anything to do with sex education.”

“Yes it does,” said Johnny,

About 15 students raise their hand.

""Has anyone here ever touched a ghost?""

Three students raise their hands.

""That's fantastic. Now let me ask you one question further...Have any of you ever made love to a ghost?""

Way in the back, Hamid raises his hand.

The professor takes off his glasses and says, ""Son, all the years I've been giving this lecture, no one has ever claimed to have made love to a ghost You've got to come up here and tell us about your experience.""

The Middle Eastern student replied with a nod and a grin, and began to make his way up to the podium. When he reached the front of the room, the professor asks, ""So, Hamad, tell us what it's like to have sex with a ghost?""

He always looks for an opportunity to disrupt class and shock the teacher, and today is no different.

Ms. Dolores starts off with the letter ""A"". ""OK, class, who knows a word that begins with 'A'?""

Johnny raises his hand before anyone else, and she calls on him. ""ASS!"" shouts Johnny, and the class erupts with laughter.

""Johnny, that's enough! You know that kind of language is not appropriate. Now, who knows a word that begins with 'B'?""

Once again, Johnny's hand is up first, so Ms. Dolores reluctantly picks him, hoping that he'll settle down a bit. ""BITCH!"" is his immediate response. Once again, the class descends into chaos. It takes her a few minutes to calm everyone down.

""OK, Johnny, you're done for the day. I've had enough of your attitude. You don't get to answer any more questions.""

She moves on to the letter ""C"". Of course, Johnny goes wild with anticipation, throwing his hand into the air. Ms. Dolores knows better than to give him this chance.

She moves through the alphabet, letting anyone but Johnny give a word, and noting that he is especially eager to answer for certain letters, like ""D"", ""F"", and ""P"". But she's not having any of it.

Finally, they get to ""R"". ""Anyone have a word that begins with 'R'?"", Ms. Dolores asks the class. Johnny immediately perks up, shooting his hand towards the ceiling, begging her to pick him. She just stands there for a few seconds, racking her brain to try and think of any bad word that might begin with ""R"".

Finally, she admits defeat. If there's a bad word here that Johnny knows, she just can't imagine what it is. Maybe the kid has gotten it out of his system and wants to actually participate in class for once. She decides to give him just one more chance.

""OK, Johnny, let's hear it. What's your word for 'R'?""

""RATS!"", says Johnny.

Ms. Dolores is shocked. She can't believe Johnny actually gave a correct and appropriate answer to the question. Maybe the kid is actually making some progress, she thinks. After taking a second to recover, she says, ""Very good, Johnny. I'm proud of-""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m \*dying\* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.” The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. 

He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?” The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. So, the monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

The dad, wanting to make his son happy, asks his son what that is.

His son replies, “I want a single ping pong ball.”

Confused, his dad agrees, and on his fifteenth birthday, the son opens his present to find a single pig pong ball inside.

“Dad! Thank you so much! I am the happiest kid on this planet!”

The next day, the father goes into his son’s room but doesn’t find the ping pong ball anywhere.

Next year rolls around, and the father asks his son what he wants for his birthday, probably a car, or a new video game.

His son says, “Dad, I have everything I could ever want. But there is one thing that would make me the happiest person alive.”

The father, only wanting to please his son, asks what that one thing is.

His son says to him, “I want a ten pack of ping pong balls.”

The father was a little weirded out, but he did as his son wished, and on his sixteenth birthday, the son opened his present to find a pack of ping pong balls.

“Dad thank you so much! I love them!”

The next day, he goes up to his son’s room, and doesn’t find one ping pong ball anywhere.

Twelve months pass, and it’s time for the son to turn seventeen.

The father, ready for whatever outrageous gift his son might want, asks him what he would like for his birthday.

His son says, “Dad, I have everything I could ever want. But there is one thing that would make me the happiest person alive.”

The dad, thinking he’s about to spend a shitload of money on a new car, asks his son what that thing is.

“I want a jug of ping pong balls.”

The dad, who was just taken aback by the whole situation, bought his son a jug of ping pong balls to open on his seventeenth birthday.

“Oh my god! Dad thank you so much!”

On the next day, the dad goes into his son’s room, but doesn’t find a single ping pong ball anywhere.

Four seasons pass, and his son is becoming an adult. The father, who is about to send his only son to college, prepares himself for the amount of money he is about to spend on his favorite kid to send him to his alma mater, and asks him what he wants for his birthday.

His son says, “Dad, I have everything I could ever want. But there is one thing that would make me the happiest person alive.”

The father asks him what that one thing just might be.

“Well dad, I want a warehouse full of ping pong balls.”

The dad is like, holy shit? “What is up with my son and his ping pong balls?” But he does as his son wishes, and the next day, he drives his son to the an old abandoned warehouse. They open the door, and ping pong balls just roll out. Everywhere.

“Dad. Thank you so much. I love you!”

Around 24 hours later, the dad drives down to the warehouse, opens the door, but there’s not a single ping pong ball inside.

8,772 hours later, the son is turning nineteen. But a few days before his birthday, he is in an awful wreck. He’s hospitalized. Hooked up to thirty different machines.

The father is devastated. He goes into his son’s hospital room, and asks him what he wants for his birthday. “Son, I’m going to make this your best birthday yet. I will buy you anything. Anything you want.”

His son says, “Dad, I have everything I could ever want. But there is one thing that would make me the happiest person alive.”

The dad, who is already up to protocol, is like, “alright. How many ping pong balls do you want this time?”

“I want a boatload. As many as you can buy.”

The father, just trying to make his son’s days in the hospital enjoyable, buys a boatload of ping pong balls. He buys out every warehouse of ping pong balls. Uses his life savings to buy every single ping pong ball in America.

He walks into his son’s hospital room to tell him the news.

“Dad I can’t believe you bought me all of these ping pong balls. How can I ever repay you?”

The dad, who wants to know what the fuck is up with his son and these ping pong balls, asks, “well there is one way son.”

“What is it Dad?”

“What do you do with all of these fucking ping pong balls?”

The son was happy to tell his dad what he did with the ping pong balls. “Well dad,” he started, but never finished. The son died.",A father asks his son what he wants for his 15th birthday,4

But he is not the only person in the class subject to the class' tormentors. There also happens to be a young girl in the class who is frequently made fun of for having a very large nose. She is equally picked on, and as a result, equally an outcast.

The day finally comes for the much anticipated school dance which the shy boy reluctantly goes to. He sees the other normal kids dancing together, then sees the shy girl sitting alone in a corner. While thinking about the risk of asking her to dance and possibly giving the class bullies a chance to harass him, he works up the courage to ask her to dance thinking that maybe she would appreciate it. He gets up, nervously walks over and asks, Would you like to dance?

The young girl is amazed. No one has ever been so kind and thoughtful to her. She is so happy that immediately she exclaims, 
Would I? Would I?

Big Nose, Big Nose! The boy says as he runs away.

The carpenter seems to know the solution to the problem: ""Leave it to me, I will support it on the wall and then it will not fall, ever!"" After he supports the wardrobe and finishes the job, the train passes and the wardrobe falls back down. The carpenter loses his mind: ""I do not understand what is going on, but this time I will pin the wardrobe on the wall with steel nails so as not to fall ever again!"" After pinning it, he says, ""Let's see now when the train will pass, will it fall again?"" The train passes through and the wardrobe falls once more. 

The carpenter is shocked: ""If I don't go crazy today, I'll never will!"" ""And what shall we do now? It's not possible to leave the situation this way"", says the woman. ""I will make a final effort"", says the carpenter, ""I will go inside the wardrobe to see what goes wrong and the reason of the falling.""

He enters inside the closet, closes the doors and moments later the woman's husband comes in, who has returned from a trip. He watches the carpenter's stuff and starts shouting: ""Honest to God, I'll kill you! Where have you hidden your lover? In the closet?"".

Before she can respond, he's headed towards the closet, opens it and sees the carpenter ... ""You punk!"" he shouts, ""what are you doing inside here?""

then suddenly a fairy comes out of the well.  
she says, ""I'll revive your cow but I have a condition"".  
""what condition?"" the farmer asks.  
""you would have to fuck me 25 times"".

Harry answered, “I'm too smart for the 1st grade.  My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she!  I think I should be in the 3rd grade, too!”
Ms. Brooks finally had enough; she took Harry to the principal's office.  While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the situation to the principal.  The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test.  If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave.  She agreed.
Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he happily agreed to take the test.
Principal:  “What is 3 x 3?”
Harry:  “9.”
Principal:  “What is 6 x 6?”
Harry:  “36.”
And so it went with every question the principal thought a bright 3rd grader should know.
The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, “Y’know, I reckon Harry can go to the 3rd grade.”
But Ms. Brooks is still skeptical of the little bugger and says to the principal, “Not so fast, let me ask him a few questions.”
The principal and Harry both agree. 
Ms. Brooks asks, “What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?”
Harry, after a moment:  “Legs.”
Ms. Brooks:  “What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?”

Harry replied:  “Pockets.” to the Principal’s great relief. 
Ms. Brooks:  “What does a dog do that a man steps into?”
Harry:  “Pants.”
By now, the principal is sitting forward with his mouth hanging open.
Ms. Brooks:  “What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?”
Now the principal's eyes open really wide and before he could intervene, Harry replied, “Bubble gum.”
Ms. Brooks:  “What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?”
Harry:  “Shake hands.”
The principal is now trembling with apprehension as Ms. Brooks asks the last question.
Ms. Brooks:  “What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' and indicates a great deal of heat and excitement?”
Harry: “Firetruck.”
The principal breaths a huge sigh of relief and tells the teacher, “Put the little bastard in 5th Grade; I got the last seven questions wrong myself.”

So he called his best friend and entrusted the key to him. He told him: ""We have been best friends since we were little children &amp; i trust you with my whole life, i have put a chastity belt on my wife so that no one can have intercourse with her and i am entrusting the key to you.

But as he’s walking out the door, he passes a group of wealthy looking business man, and, overhearing their conversation, realizes that one of the men is the CEO of some company called Epic. The priest stops in his tracks, trying to recall why he knows that name. Then it hits him.

They are the company that makes the oh so popular Fortnite! Excitedly, he turns right back around and follows the group into the bar, sure that he can convince the man to by him, a humble man of God, a beer. 

He walks up to the group, who all stop talking, and nervously explains his predicament. The five men all look at one another, and then finally, the CEO smiles and says

“Sure. Why not?”

The priest thanks him, and they walk up to the bar together, the priest feeling smug, sure the bartender won’t deny him a beer once he finds out who he’s with. 

They wave to the bartender, who politely comes over and asks what he can do for them. The business man explains who he is and that he would like a beer for himself and his new friend. The bartender looks at them for a moment before replying.

“Sorry,” he says, “we don’t serve either of your kind here.”

Completely flabbergasted, the two men both watch as the bartender begins walking away, but before he can take two steps, the CEO asks him

“Why the hell not?!”

They look at each other and then go in, thinking this is too good to be true.
The old bartender says in a voice that carries across the room,  ""Come on in and let me pour one for you! What'll it be, gentlemen? “There’s a fully stocked bar, so each of the men orders a martini.
In no time the bartender serves up four iced martinis shaken, not stirred, and says, ""That's 10 cents each, please.""
The four guys stare at the bartender for a moment, then at each other. They can't believe their good luck. They pay the 40 cents, finish their martinis, and order another round. Again, four excellent martinis are produced, with the bartender again saying, ""That's 40 cents, please.“
They pay 40 cents, but their curiosity gets the better of them. They've each had two martinis and haven't even spent a dollar yet.
Finally, one of them says, ""How can you afford to serve martinis as good as these for a dime apiece?""
""I'm a retired tailor from Phoenix,"" the bartender says, ""and I always wanted to own a bar. Last year I hit the Lottery Jackpot for $125 million and decided to open this place. Every drink costs a dime. Wine, Liquor, beer it's all the same.""
""Wow! That's some story!"" one of the men says. As the four of them sip their martinis, they can't help noticing seven other people at the end of the bar who don't have any drinks in front of them and haven’t ordered anything the whole time they've been there.
Nodding at the seven at the end of the bar, one of the men asks the Bartender, ""What's with them?""
The bartender says, ""They're retired people from Florida. They’re waiting for Happy Hour when drinks are half-price.”

post,as4hq4,2qh72,jokes,false,1550538165,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/as4hq4/human_resources/,self.jokes,," An HR manager was knocked down (tragically) by a bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her. “Before you get settled in” he said, “We have a little problem…you see, we’ve never had a HR manager make it this far before and we’re not really sure what to do with you.”

“Oh, I see,” said the woman, “can’t you just let me in?”

“Well, I’d like to,” said St Peter, “But I have higher orders. We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.”

“Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven”, said the woman. “Sorry, we have rules…” at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.

As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.

They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.

Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. “Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven,” he said.

So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. “So,” he said, “You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven”. “You must choose between the two.”

The woman thought for a second and replied: “Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.”

Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.

“I don’t understand,” stuttered the HR manager, “The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.”

The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, “Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.”",Human Resources,85

post,as3dr2,2qh72,jokes,false,1550531347,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/as3dr2/a_man_wakes_up/,self.jokes,,"A man wakes Up in a dingy Slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

&amp;#x200B;

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

&amp;#x200B;

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

&amp;#x200B;

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

&amp;#x200B;

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

&amp;#x200B;

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

&amp;#x200B;

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

&amp;#x200B;

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

&amp;#x200B;

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

&amp;#x200B;

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

&amp;#x200B;

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

&amp;#x200B;

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

&amp;#x200B;

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",A man Wakes Up,56

When I got home, my husband seemed excited to see me and exclaimed delightedly, ""Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight."" He then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, ""Happy Birthday!""",Husbands Suprise!,10

God stepped up to the tee and took a big swing at his golf ball.  But his club barely topped the ball, and it went rolling about 10 yards down the fairway.

Just then, a rabbit popped out of his hole, raced across the fairway, and scooped the ball into its mouth.

As the rabbit ran away, a hawk came swooping down and grabbed the rabbit in its talons.  As the hawk flapped its wings to gain altitude, a hunter shot at the bird, hitting it right in the chest.  The hawk let go of the rabbit, and the rabbit plummeted to earth, landing on the green with a smack.

The golf ball popped out of the rabbit's mouth, took a short hop, and rolled into the cup.

Barely covered by a tiny mini skirt and a flimsy cotton top. I could see she was not wearing a bra and her incredibly firm breasts were on show.
      
After watching her walk in I turned back to my beer. No sooner had I taken a sip when I turn to see her pulling another bar stool up close to me and sat down. She said 'Hi', and I said 'Hi' in return. She asked how I was and took my hand and placed it on her perfect inner thigh, rubbing it up and down.
      
'So, does that make you feel good ?' she asked. ..
'I'll bet you feel good,' she continued. 'In fact, I'll bet you've never felt this good before.'

'Well, I have,' I corrected her. 'You see, when I was 17, I was picked to play for the school 1st. XV in the National School Finals in front of a crowd of about 3000 and I felt really good.'

I immediately felt a bit pathetic saying that and I thought she would get up and go. But she took my hand off her thigh and put it up the front of her top. Her nipple pushed into my palm as she massaged my hand into her pert, perfect breast.

'How do you feel now,' she purred.
'OK' I replied.
Again, she said, 'I'll bet you do. In fact, I'll bet you've never felt THIS good before!'

Unbelievably I heard myself saying 'Well, actually I have. In that game, we were down by six points with about 20 seconds left in the match.
The Opposition kicked the ball deep into our half of the field, where I caught it. I ran up field, side-stepping past the first few defenders, handed off a couple of would-be tacklers, burst through a few forwards, chipped over their fullback, regathered and scored a try right under the posts with about 2 or 3 seconds 'til full time. We were still behind by one point, but I had a simple kick at goal to win the match.”
      
""Ahhh...."" she growled between clenched teeth, more than a bit miffed, pulled my hand from under her top and thrust it down the front of her skirt.
My fingers immediately met what felt like a wisp of soft cotton , and she was wet !

She whispered, 'Well tell me this, Mr. Rugby Man: Have you ever felt such a perfect c*nt?'

'I certainly have,' I answered,

'I missed the kick.'",The story of my rugby career,70

""I am the stupidest"" another says, ""for I do not know how to tie my own shoelaces and must get my wife to do it for me"" 

""No, I am the stupidest"" says the first, ""I am so stupid I do not know how to eat. All my food is liquidised and is fed to me via a tube"" which he smugly shows to the second philosopher. 

Then the two philosophers turn to the third, who is the oldest and most knowledgeable of the three. During this debate he has been sitting still with his head bowed. 
""What about you sir"" the first says to him, ""You are the most learned of us, your stupidity must eclipse the both of ours"". 
The younger philosopher nudges his elder colleague to rouse his attention. The elderly thinker falls off his chair and slumps to the floor.

The younger philosopher looks over the old man and turns back to his associate exclaiming, ""remarkable, he truly is the wisest of us all"" 

""How do you know?""

""He doesn't know how to breathe""

One day while the wife was cleaning and putting clothes away she found 3 golf balls in the mans underwear drawer and with $540 in 20 dollar bills.  She was a little puzzled because her husband never golfed a day in his life. 

Later that evening while eating dinner the wife asked “Robert, while cleaning the house I saw three golf balls in your underwear drawer, why do you have those?”

Robert paused and said “Martha, I cannot lie to you. We have been married for so long, and there have times when I have been unfaithful. I have cheated on you in the past and each time I did I would buy a golf ball so as I would get dressed I would have to look at them every morning.”

Martha became upset and walked out of the room.

After some time, Martha said she was not happy with him, but seeing that it only happened three times over thirty years, she’d forgive him.

She walked backed to Robert and said, “Robert, I am saddened by what happened however I will forgive you.” Then she kissed him. 

She then asked, “By the way, I saw the $540, how did you get that money, and why were you hiding it from me?”

Robert replied, “Well every time I got enough golf balls, I would put them into a basket and sell them.”",An Old Couple and some Golf Balls,10

Yesterday, she asked me to visit her house in Westlands and said, ""My husband is on a business trip, and I'm alone at home."" I was very cautious and asked, ""Will your husband suddenly come back? 

She said, ""No, but just in case he does, you just say that you are from Safi cleaning service and that your company sent you to clean the house. And then, clean the glass or something, My husband won't suspect a thing."" 

Fast forward, I was at her house and what a big coincidence; not even minutes in the house, her husband came back! And I hadn't even touched her hand yet! I had to be quiet and pretend to do the cleaning, wiping windows, cleaning the kitchen and the floor. And also tidy the bedrooms and wash the bathrooms. All the while, her husband and she were next to me giving all kinds of ridiculous instructions. When I had finished and was about to leave, her husband asked, 'How much?"" Even before I could utter a word, she said, ""I have already paid the company:'

He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.

“Well, I don’t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except a...” said the old man, and then he stopped.

“Except what?” asked the businessman.

“Nothing, nothing,” said the old man.

“C’mon, tell me! I need something!” protested the businessman.“Well, sir, I don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘voodoo dildo,’” the old man said.

“The voodoo dildo?” the businessman asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, “Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!”

The old man said, “But you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.”

He pointed to a door and said “Voodoo dildo, the door.”

The voodoo dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, “Voodoo dildo, box!”

The voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.

The businessman said, “I’ll take it!”

The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, “Voodoo dildo, my pussy.”

He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.

After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said “Voodoo dildo, my pussy!” The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before.

After three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn’t been drinking, but that a voodoo dildo was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn’t stop screwing her.

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, “Yeah, right. Voodoo dildo, my ass!""","A businessman is getting ready to go on a long business trip.

This may come as a surprise to those of you not living in Las Vegas , but there are more Catholic churches than casinos. 
Not surprisingly, some worshipers at Sunday services will give casino chips rather than cash when the basket is passed. 
Since they get chips from many different casinos, the churches have devised a method to collect the offerings. 
The churches send all their collected chips to a nearby Franciscan monastery for sorting and then the chips are taken to the casinos of origin and cashed in. 
This is done by the chip monks.

Eventually they take out their pack lunches and continue the conversation. The goy asks:

The jew thinks about it for a while and responds:

« Must be our diet. »

The goy looks over at the jew’s lunch and sees a bunch of sardines. The goy comments:

« Ah yes, I’ve heard eating fish is good for the brains. But you jews aren’t the only ones who eat fish. Couldn’t account for why you people are especially clever. »

The jew looks at the goy for a while, then he seems to make up his mind.

« Ok, I like you so I’ll let you in on a little secret. It’s eating the heads that make us so smart. But not just any fish heads, they have to be prepared in a special way. »

The goy takes that in and then asks: 

« Um, could I try one of yours? »

« Oh my friend, these are very special fish prepared with my mothers secret recipe. I can’t just give them out like candy. »

The goy, determined, offered the jew what he thought he wanted:

« I’ll pay for it! »

The jew seems affronted but then considers it.

« Well, I wouldn’t let them go for less than $100 a head. »

The goy is startled but stays determined and pays him for one. He starts chewing the head and bits get stuck in his teeth and his gums start bleeding but he powers through. He sits there, thinking and recovering, finally declaring : 

« I don’t feel any smarter. »

« Well, you have to eat a few more before feeling smarter. »

« Fine! Give me more!! »

Finally, after having spent $300 more, the goy’s gums in tatters, even his tongue is bleeding, he sits there red-faced and breathing heavily.
After 10 minutes, he turns angrily to the jew and says:

« I don’t feel any smarter at all! I think this was a scam!!! »

The jew smiles:

« Aha, you see! It works! You’re smarter already! »

Every noon they eat their respective lunches at the top of the unfinished tower. The German guy opens up his lunchbox and sighs: ""Bratwurst und Kartofflen, I hate Bratwurst und Kartofflen, if I get Bratwurst und Kartofflen tomorrow I will throw myself of this tower"". The Dutch guy opens up his lunchbox, sees to his dismay bread with cheese, and says: ""I hate bread with cheese, if I see it tomorrow in my lunch box I will jump after you!"". Finally, the Belgian guy opens up his lunchbox and not one to let his co-workers outdo him says: ""Amai, sandwiches with jelly! I always have sandwiches with jelly, if I get them tomorrow I will jump off the building with you guys.""

The next day around noon, the three construction workers sit nervously on the top of the building. The German is the first to open his lunchbox, sees a Bratwurst, stands up and says: ""Scheisse, Bratwurst!"" and jumps of the building. Both the Dutch and the Belgian guy turn a little pale. But the Dutch guy opens his lunchbox and reveals the sandwiches with cheese on them. He too jumps off the roof. The Belgian guy, at last, opens up his lunchbox, sees the sandwiches with jelly, swears, and follows his two co-workers towards his death.

At their mutual funeral their wifes meet and complain about their husbands, the German wife says: ""Ach gutte, Had my Hans said he didn't like Bratwurst, I would have given him anything else for his lunch"" and the Dutch wife answers: ""Indeed, if Kees would have liked something else I would have made him something else"", to which the Belgian wife says: ""I Don't understand, if Thomas didn't like jelly, why didn't he put something else on his sandwiches?""",Dutch joke about Belgians,24

He would always watch out for the weather to check if there were any days for golfing.

Now, it so happened that one of the days was the coming Sunday. So, the pastor called in sick instead of preaching and had a junior pastor substitute for him.

The local golf course had a nasty 18th hole, most golfers had a 2 handicap on it, even professionals would balk at this hole, a hole in one was never heard of ever.

So our pastor is happily teeing off and scribbling his scores and having a jolly good time instead of preaching. The angel Gabriel sees him and gets angry and goes to God.

Gabriel: My Lord this fool has forsaken his flock to pursue his foolish entertainment. You should punish him.

God: Hmmmm, all in time.

Meanwhile our pastor has completed the 17th hole and is doing better than usual and is beside himself as he readies to tee off for the 18th.

Gab: This is the last hole Lord, please show your fury. Blast this ignorant man with lightning.

God: Hmmmmmm

Our pastor tees off and the stroke is brilliant, the ball sails like it has wings and the wind is under it and like a miracle drops on the green and rolls right into the hole. A hole in one, the impossible.

Our pastor jumps in joy, has tears in his eyes and is literally going crazy.

Gab: Lord, what was that, I know you did that. You should punish him. 

God: This was punishment.

Gab: This was no less than the greatest reward in his life.

One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires.

The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.

Then the Pope walks into the room and begins working his way down the line. He gives the first man his blessing, then the second and third. 

John noticed the fourth man in line appeared to be homeless. He had a filthy, well-worn jacket and dirty, unkempt hair. John also noticed that instead of giving this man his blessing, the Pope gave him a hug. Then the Pope moved on to give the fifth man his blessing and so on. 

Well, John didn’t just want a blessing from the Pope when he could get a hug! So he flags down the homeless man and offers him $200 for his jacket. The homeless man agrees and John quickly changes into the raggedy garb and does his best to quickly undo the work he had put into his hair that morning. Before you knew it, John appeared to be homeless as well. 

The Pope, now having worked his way down the line, is now looking directly at John. The Pope then leans in as if to give John a hug. John, very excited, leans in to hug the Pope.

Another 5 minutes pass and someone stands up and yells “144!” The prison is almost hysterical with laughter, even the guards are starting to laugh.

Understandably, this confuses Robert so he asks Walt “what’s going on? Why is everyone laughing over numbers?” Walt replies “you see, most of us are here for life. At this point, we’ve heard every joke in the book a million times. So, to save time, we have decided to number every joke. When someone stands up and yells a number, we know which joke they’re referring to, and it makes us laugh.”

Robert sees this as his opportunity to fit in, so he says “you know what? I’m going to give it a shot.” So Robert stand up and confidently yells “74!” The whole place is silent. Robert is taken aback, but he tries again “35!” Again there’s silence. Everyone is just staring at Robert. He uncomfortably clears his throat and tries one more time “154?” Still nothing.

Defeated, Robert sits back down. Robert looks at Walt and says “I don’t understand what happened.” Walt replies “sorry man, some people just can’t tell a joke.”","Robert Johnson, a CEO for a large corporation, is arrested and sentenced to 25 years in prison for white collar crimes.",9

 ""One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me,"" said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.
Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, ""One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me ....""

He just knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend, he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along.

""Come here quick,"" said the boy, ""you won't believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!""

The man said, ""Beat it, kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk."" When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery.

Standing by the fence they heard, ""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.""

The old man whispered, ""Boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord...?"" Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.

At last, they heard, ""One for you, one for me. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence and we'll be done....""

They say the old man had the lead for a good half-mile before the kid on the bike passed him.","On the outskirts of a small town, there was a big, old pecan tree just inside the cemetery fence.

One day in the local tavern, he heard a ruckus outside. He looked up from his glass toward the door and saw a man in fanciful clothes and a magnificent hat walk in. 

&amp;#x200B;

'I would some of your finest ale!' the fancily clad man called out.

&amp;#x200B;

The man with the 50cm penis asked the bartender who this man was, and he was told that he is the most famous magician in the world, and can grant any wish desired. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Magician sat down, and the man, interested in his abilities to grant wishes inquired:

&amp;#x200B;

The Man: I hear you can grant any wish asked of you  


Magician: Most wishes I can grant, yes.  


The Man: Can you grant one for me?  


Magician: It depends on what it is, but I can grant most wishes.

&amp;#x200B;

The Man: I have a 50cm penis, and no woman will sleep with me because it's too big. Can you make it smaller?  


Magician: I can grant most wishes, but I cannot grant this one.  


The man, feeling his hopes dashed began to break down and cry. The Magician, feeling sympathy for his plight offered a solution  


Magician: I cannot grant this wish, but I know what you can do. Go outside, to the end of the road, turn right into the woods, turn left at the big rock, and right down the trail. You will see a frog on a lily pad, ask it to marry you.

&amp;#x200B;

The man was stunned, perplexed by this response he went home feeling insulted, and cried himself to sleep. The next morning he woke up, ate his cereal and went to work as normal. During the work day he had a lot of time to think about his situation. Realizing that he had nothing to lose, he vowed to go see if this frog existed after work.  


He went down the road from the tavern....

&amp;#x200B;

turned right at the end into the woods....

&amp;#x200B;

left at the big rock...

&amp;#x200B;

right down the trail to find....

&amp;#x200B;

A frog sitting on a lily pad, it was just as the magician had foretold! As per instructions he walked up to the frog and said with a stammer 'e-excuse me frog?'

&amp;#x200B;

'Yes?' The frog replied. 

&amp;#x200B;

The man in awe that the frog could reply in English almost forgot the words to come

&amp;#x200B;

'Will you marry me?' he nervously asked the frog

&amp;#x200B;

'No' the frog replied without hesitance.

&amp;#x200B;

.....

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing seemed to happen, the man inspected his equipment quickly and found that nothing had changed. He questioned what was meant to happen here. Was the frog meant to say yes? Was he meant to marry the frog? Will the frog turn human like in fairy tales and be okay with his size? 

&amp;#x200B;

Disappointed he left, upset that in addition to human women he had also been rejected by a sentient frog. He stopped by the local tavern to see if the magician was there to ask what the meaning of that  journey was but the magician had left for another town. He went home, he didn't eat anything that night, and cried himself to sleep again.

&amp;#x200B;

.....

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning he woke up, went to the bathroom and as he reached into his pants to use the toilet he noticed something was different. His penis was... smaller?! He quickly did his business and got out a measuring tape. Sure enough his penis had shrunk and measured out to 40cm. It had gone down by 10cm! He was happy, however he lamented that it was still too big. It didn't matter though, it was the weekend and he knew exactly what he was going to do with his day. He went down the road from the tavern, right at the end into the woods, left at the big rock, right down the trail, and saw the frog sitting there again.

&amp;#x200B;

'Will you marry me?' He asked the frog.   


'No' the frog replied, her response completely unchanging from the day before.  


He was quick to get the day over with so he went to bed early that day. 

&amp;#x200B;

He woke up the next morning, grabbing the measuring tape off his bed side table, and eagerly scurried into the bathroom. Sure enough, his penis had shrunk again. It had come down by another 10cm, down to 30cm. It was better, but still a bit too big. He decided he'd do it one more time as 20cm would be slightly above average, but not too big.   


Eager to see the frog to solve his plight he went down the road from the tavern, turned right at the end into the woods, left at the big rock, right down the trail and found the frog sitting there as she always was.

&amp;#x200B;

'Will you marry me?' he asked the frog with confidence and excitement

&amp;#x200B;

The frog sighed and eventually replied

&amp;#x200B;

'For the last time, No, no, no!'

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All of a sudden a genie pops out..

“Thank you for freeing me from my lamp, as a symbol of my gratitude I will grant you 3 wishes”

The man was over the moon but before he could get his first wish, the genie interrupts.

“But on one condition, whatever you wish for.. Your wife will get double”

The man thinks about his wishes carefully and says,

“Okay, I would like my first wish.. I wish for 10 million pounds”

The genie replies

“Your wish has been granted, but your wife will receive 20 million”

“My second wish is to be happy forever” says the man

The genie replies

“That wish has been granted, although your wife would be twice as happy as you will ever be”

“Something smells delicious hunny! What are ya cooking!?”

The wife says. “Dam Fish.”

The pastor freaks out and says. “I cannot believe I’m hearing profanity out of a pastors wife! How dare you!”

The pastors wife calms her husband down and says. “No, no honey! The man at the market told me this is a new breed of fish found at the local roller dam. So they call it Dam fish.”
