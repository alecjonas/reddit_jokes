""I bet you $100 and a shot of whiskey I can show you something you ain't never seen before."" siad the drunk to the barmaid.   


""I've seen it all. Show me what you got."" And she put $100 and a shot of whiskey on the bar.   


The conman pulled his glass eye out and bit on it.   


""I admit I've never seen that before."" The barmaid was not happy now as he took her money, but a bet was a bet.   


""Double or nothing I can bite my other eye."" said the old drunk conman.   


This made the barmaid think. ""I saw you walk in here, no way both your eyes are glass or you'd have tripped and stumbled, I'll take that bet.""   


And so the conman pulled his dentures out and bit his other eye with them.   


She put another $100 on the bar and another shot of whiskey for the game. ""You got me old man. Enjoy your cash.""   


""Double or nothing I can piss in the garbage can by the front door from here on this stool."" The barmaid looked at the garbage can across the bar, it was 30 feet away. ""There is no way you can do this. I'll take the bet.""   


And so the conman stood on the bar and proceeded to piss on the bar, the barmaid, himself, the floor and the other patrons nearby. The barmaid laughed. ""You missed fool! Enjoy your drinks!""   


She picked up the $200 from the bar and a man in a business suit stood up and shouted ""FUCK!!"" knocking his chair to the floor and spilling his drink.   


""What's the problem?"" asked the barmaid, wiping off the money.   


""A half hour ago that old drunk bet me $1000 he could piss on your bar and you'd laugh!"" ","The old, drunk conman was broke again.",4

Two months ago, my husband, Phil, was in a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed. The pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him.""

A muffled gasp arose from the men in the congregation as the thought of the pain poor Phil must have experienced sank in.

""Phil was hurt so badly that he couldn't even hold me or the kids,"" Suzie continued. ""Every movement caused terrible pain. We prayed when his doctors performed the delicate operation required to repair the extensive damage. Luckily they were able to piece the crushed and broken remnants of Phil's scrotum together and wrap it in wire to hold everything in place.""

Again, the male half of the congregation squirmed uncomfortably, cringing at the thought of what Phil went through.

""Today,"" Suzie announced in a quivering voice, ""Thanks to the Lord, Phil is out of the hospital. His doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely.""

A great sigh of relief arose from the pews. The shaken pastor stood and tentatively asked if anyone else had anything to say.

A man stood up and walked slowly to the podium. He looked around the congregation and said, ""I'm Phil."" The entire assembly held its collective breath.

There was a businessman who was sure that his wife was cheating on him, so he put her under surveillance. One day at work, he got a call that told him to rush home quickly and he would be able to catch her in the act. So he rushed home to his 20th floor hi-rise apartment and burst into the room. His wife was there, but he didn’t see anyone else.

“Where is he?” he shouted.

“Where is who?” demanded his wife.

“Don’t play coy with me sugar.” he said, and began to search the apartment.

He looked in the bedroom; no one.

He looked under the bed; no one.

He looked in every closet; no one.

Finally he heard a noise out on the balcony. He looked and saw a man hanging by his fingers from the balcony! Enraged, the man started stomping on his fingers. The man screamed, but stubbornly held on. Even more enraged, the business man went into the apartment and brought out a hammer. He then began hitting the man’s fingers and watched triumphantly as the man fell 20 stories. But to his dismay the man fell into a bush. Although badly injured, he wasn’t dead. The business man was livid! He went into his kitchen and rolled his refrigerator out to the balcony. He heaved it over the edge and watched with glee as the refrigerator landed on the injured man; killing him. The business man started to laugh, but mid-laugh grabbed his chest and died from a massive heart attack……..

The business man found himself in line before the Pearly Gates. St. Peter was there and it was clear that there was a delay. St. Peter said,

“I’m sorry, but heaven is full today, we’re only letting in folks who have died in a very stressful way.”

“Well I died today full of stress,” said the business man.

“Really,” said St. Peter, “Do tell.”

So the business man related the above story. St. Peter was swayed.

“OK,” he said, “You can go in.”

The next guy in line stepped up. St. Peter told him the same thing.

“Did you die in a stressful way?”

“Did I? And how!!” replied the man. And he related the following story to St. Peter.

I was doing my Jazzercise tape in my living room on the 21st floor of my hi-rise apartment when I kinda lost track of where I was. I accidentally fell off my balcony, and was plummeting to my sure death, when miraculously I was able to grab onto the balcony below mine. I was hanging on but just barely, when a man came out. Thank God I thought, I’m saved. But to my horror, he started stomping on my fingers. It hurt terribly, but I was able to hang on. Just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore; he stopped and went back inside. Thank God I thought. But just then, he comes back out with a hammer and starts to hammer my fingers! Well I had to let go and I fell into a bush. Although badly injured, I was still alive, and I was just about to yell for help when I looked up just in time to see a refrigerator heading right for me…….And the next thing I know….I’m here.

St. Peter’s mouth was hanging open. All he could do was gesture the man inside.

“Go in, go on in,” was all he could whisper.

After a few moments to collect himself, St. Peter said, “Next!”

The next guy steps up, and after being told the condition for entry, St. Peter asks,

“Did you die stressfully?’’

“Yes I did, and here’s my story……I was hiding in this refrigerator and………..",Businessman,3

He walked up to a whore house and knocked on the door. When the Madam answered, she saw the little boy and asked what he wanted. 

He said, ""I want to have sex with one of the women inside. I have the money and I'm not leaving until I do."" 

The Madam figured, why not, so she told him to come in. Once in, she told him to pick any of the girls he liked. He asked, ""Do any of the girls have any diseases?"" Of course, the Madam said no. 

He said,""I heard all the men talking about having to get shots after making it with Amber. THAT'S the girl I want!"" Since the little boy was so adamant and had the money to pay for it, the Madam told him to go to the first room on the right. He headed down the hall dragging the squashed frog behind him. 

Ten minutes later he came back, still dragging the frog, paid the Madam, and headed out the door. The Madam stopped him and asked, ""Why did you pick the only girl in the place with a disease, instead of one of the others?"" He said, ""Well, if you must know, tonight when I get home, my parents are going out to a restaurant to eat, leaving me at home with my baby-sitter. 

After they leave, my baby-sitter will have sex with me because she just happens to be very fond of little boys. She will get the disease that I just caught. When Mom and Dad get back, Dad will take the baby-sitter home. On the way, he'll jump the baby-sitter's bones, and he'll catch the disease. Then when Dad gets home from the baby-sitters, he and Mom will go to bed and have sex, and Mom will catch it. In the morning when Dad goes to work, the Milkman will deliver the milk, have a quickie with Mom and catch the disease, because that damn mailman is the son-of-a-bi\*ch who ran over my FROG!""

For the whole next day he is at the table, losing pile after pile of chips, thousands and thousands of dollars at a time. 

Soon, a small crowd is gathered round him, watching, as this intense game goes on and on. One observer taps the man on the shoulder and he turns irritably.

""How long are you going to do this?"" The observer asks.

""As long as it takes to win back this leg."" The man responds shortly.

Pausing only to relieve himself in a bucket provided by the casino, the man continues to play for the leg through the night and into the next day. Money seems to be no issue for him, he never sleeps and he never seems to tire either.

Now a huge crowd is gathered around him as he reaches the end of his first week trying to win back the leg. No-one can believe how much this man wants to make up for his transgression. People begin to praise the man on social media. The casino manager makes his way through the crowd on the floor to approach the man, who does not take lightly to being interrupted in his so far frivolous pursuit.

""How long are you going to do this?"" The manager asks.

""As long as it takes to win back this leg."" The man responds, barely looking away from the table.

A month passes and still sadly unsuccessful, the man does not waiver in his efforts to win back the leg. Now the casino is the biggest attraction in Las Vegas. People pay just to watch the man relentlessly and seemingly without fatigue play over and over again, despite the overwhelming bad-luck he is experiencing. The man's mother is cleared to approach the man.

""How long are you going to do this?"" His mother asks.

""As long as it takes to win back this leg!"" The man responds, barely looking away from the table. 

Six months pass and the man is STILL at the table, he is being fed through a tube and has a catheter installed along with an adult diaper, so now even his ablutions do not hamper his attempts to win back the leg.

A TV crew finally breaks through the crowd which by now stretches out the edges of the Las Vegas strip. The reporter excitedly gets a microphone into the man's face.

""How long are you going to do this?"" The reporter asks.

""Look I've told you!"" The man roars. ""I'm going to do this for the rest of my wife!""",A drunk man borrows and loses his partner's prosthetic leg in a game of roulette in Las Vegas while she's asleep in their room.

We have sophisticated technology that could allow any horse to learn how to play the guitar!""

So the horse starts learning how to play, and he is getting really good. One day while practicing in the barn, a cow walks by and hears the horse play. The cow says to the horse, ""Wow, you are really good! I would love to learn to play the drums so I could play with you.” The horse responds, ""Call up the music teacher, I'm sure she'll teach you how to play the drums!"" So the cow calls up the music teacher and says, ""I would love to learn how to play the drums, but there's one problem, I'm a cow.” The music teacher replies, “That's not a problem! We have sophisticated technology that could allow any cow to learn to play the drums!"" 

So the cow starts learning how to play the drums, and he is getting really good at them. One day while the cow and horse are practicing together in the barn, a chicken walks by and hears the horse and the cow playing. He is astonished how good they are and says, “Wow, you guys are great! I would love to learn how to play the bass so I could play with you!"" The horse responds, ""Call up the music teacher, I'm sure she'd be able to teach you how to play the bass!""

So pretty soon the cow, chicken, and the horse start practicing together, and they are getting really good. One day during one of their practice sessions in the barn, a talent agent walks by and hears them play, he is astounded how good they are, so he says, ""Wow, you guys sound amazing! If you sign me on as your agent, I could have you going across the world, seeing different countries, partying with lots of women, and making tons of money with your band!""

One day while wanting for a flight for their next concert the horse gets a phone call, his mother was put in the hospital. So the horse tells the band, ""You guys go to the next concert, I'll catch up later."" The horse gets to the hospital with his mother and everything is fine, she had a minor fall but would get over it quickly. Unfortunately on the hospital room's TV there was a news report, the plane the cow and chicken were in crashed, and there were no survivors. The horse had just lost his fellow band members and his best friends. The band was over and he's probably have to go back to living on the farm again. So the horse goes into the closest bar. The bartender can see in the horse's eyes that he is really sad, so he walks up to the horse and says, ""Why the long face?""",The Horse and his Band,3

She is on a flight from Frankfurt to London. She's tired, she's had a long day. She gets on the plane, goes to her seat in economy class, window seat. She makes herself comfortable and tries to get some sleep. 

Another woman comes and sits next to her. The other woman looks a bit odd, too much makeup, too much jewelry, too much cosmetic surgeries, you know, too much Botox, too much lip fillers. Anyway. Mrs. Parker and the lady exchange greetings and the flight takes off. 

As Mrs. Parker is just about to doze off, the other lady elbows her a little bit. 

""Excuse me"" the woman says, ""I didn't even introduce myself. My name is Baroness Von Hildebrand."" 

Mrs. Parker looks at her and says, ""Uh, my name is Mrs. Parker, it's very nice meeting you Miss, Mrs... uh"" 

""Baroness."" 

""Oh, sorry, Baroness"" And Mrs. Parker tries to sleep again. 

A minute goes by and she's elbowed again. 

The baroness says, ""You know it's the first time I'm actually sitting in economy class. First time in my life. I've always been a first-class passenger. But today, somehow, First class is full and I really needed to be on this plane. So, here I am in economy class. To be honest, it's not too bad. I mean, I'm sitting here with the masses, with the little people, and, you know, it's nice.""

Mrs. Parker looks at her and says, ""Well that's very nice, very nice."" and she tries to sleep again. 

Not a full minute goes by and she's elbowed again.

""By the way, you know, I'm only in this lack of luxury for this short flight to London. As soon as we arrive, my chauffeur will be waiting for me in my limousine. And I will be back in the luxuries of life that I've always known. I can't wait for that to happen.""

Mrs. Parker looks on and says, ""Well that's very nice. Very nice. But, I really need to get some sleep."" and she tries to sleep again

Another minute goes by and she's elbowed again.

""Do you know why I'm able to afford all these luxuries of life? It's because of my husband. My husband is the CEO of one of the top 100 companies in the world. He makes no less than a hundred million dollars a year on any given year, and so we live a wonderful, fantastic, luxurious life, every single day of our lives.""

Mrs. Parker looks at her and says ""uh, well... very nice, very nice."" And tries to sleep again

Some few seconds later.

""And by the way, do you have children? Mrs...? I forgot your name.""

""Mrs. Parker. Yes, I've got one son. He works in a grocery store right now. He's trying to--""

""Yeah, well, you know, I've got two sons. My two sons are the most wonderful sons, the most wonderful kids any parent could dream of having. They're handsome. They're healthy. They're smart. They're both in their early 20s, and they're already making so much money. I love them so much, the best children in the world.""

Mrs. Parker looks at her and says: ""Oh, very nice, very nice."" and tries to get some sleep again.

""By the way, I'm on vacation. This holiday started in Thailand. I went to Thailand, spent two wonderful weeks there. Then went to Bali for another two beautiful weeks, then went to the Caribbean for another two weeks, and finally went to Austria and Germany where I attended the opera and saw the most wonderful pieces of music, ballet, and opera.""

""Oh, well, that's very nice, very nice. But, I really should get some sleep now."" says Mrs. Parker.

""This whole trip that I've done, this whole vacation, this whole holiday, was paid for by my husband. It was a gift for my birthday. Every year he tries to get me a better gift. What did your husband buy you for your last birthday?""

So, Mrs. Parker looks at her and says, ""Well, we are of limited means, but for my last birthday, my husband paid for me to take some English classes.""

""English classes?! That's ridiculous! How cheap! Why would he buy you English classes? You're English, you speak English! It doesn't make any sense. Did you even learn anything from those classes?""

Mrs. Parker says ""Well, actually I did. Those classes have been quite beneficial to me. It's improved the way I speak quite a lot. For instance, before going to those english classes, I used to say 'go fuck yourself' quite a lot...""


""...but now I say 'very nice'.""",Mrs. Parker and Baroness Von Hildebrand,68

He calls animal control and they say they'll send their best man out.

Animal control truck pulls up half hour later, and a big guy jumps out, introduces himself as Joe. 
Joe hands the manager a gun, and starts pulling items off his truck, first, he opens the back, and reveals two large cages, one holding a ferocious looking rottweiler, and the other empty, presumably for the gorilla. Joe grabs a huge net out from the cab, and a sharp pointed stick, then takes a large ladder from the top of the truck.

""Heres the plan,"" says Joe, ""I'm going to climb up on the ladder and poke the gorilla with the stick until he falls. My specially trained attack dog will bite the gorilla on the testicles, freezing him in pain, I'll come down, throw the net on the gorilla and we can then put him in the cage.""

""That seems like a great plan,"" the manager admits, but is curious ""Why'd you give me this gun?""

""Well, if that gorilla knocks me off my ladder, I want you to shoot my dog!""",Haven't seen the gorilla on a building joke. It's my favorite.,6

His parents tell him they mean “lady” and “gentleman”.

The next day Jimmy is playing once again and hears his parents arguing again. They call each other “dick” and “vagina” (because who the fuck knows they’re bad at insults, let me just tell the joke). He goes inside to ask what they mean and is informed of the reliable information that they in fact mean “hats” and “coats”.

The next day is Thanksgiving and Jimmy wakes up and uses the bathroom. His father is in there shaving his face and knicks it a little bit with the razor. He exclaims “shit!” and Jimmy asks what that means. Jimmy’s father tells him it’s just the name of his shaving cream. Jimmy uses the bathroom and goes downstairs to see his mom cutting the turkey. She cuts herself by accident and exclaims “fuck!” and Jimmy being the curious protagonist of this masterfully written joke asks what that means. His mom tells him it means “cutting”. The doorbell then rings and Jimmy’s mom tells Jimmy, “Hey Jimmy that must be our guests, why don’t you go welcome them.” So Jimmy proceeds to go downstairs and deliver the punchl— introductory speech.

After being asked some questions by the head mistress she tells him to go upstairs and she would send her best employee up to join him.

The woman she chooses is her best, most professional employee. The woman heads upstairs and immediately comes back down laughing hysterically. The head mistress asks “what is so funny” 

The hooker says : “Well I went up there and when it came time for us to get naked I noticed he had a little tiny penis with a tattoo that said ‘Stumpy’ on it.” The mistress is not happy. 

She explains this man has a lot of money and she should be professional. Overhearing the conversation is a second employee. She immediately goes up to the mistress who is now frantically looking for an employee who isn’t laughing at the tattoo. “Let me go, I can keep it together”

Again she comes down after about a minute laughing. “He does have a tattoo on his little tiny penis that says stumpy” The mistress is red in the face with anger! “This is a paying customer with more money in his pocket than most customers combined! I guess I will have to take care of him myself!”

Being a former working girl the mistress adjust her outfit in the mirror before heading up stairs. All the hookers wait downstairs for her to come down laughing but there is silence. After about 3 minutes the chandelier begins to shake and there’s very very loud aggressive sexual noises coming from upstairs. The other hookers are confused.

After around an hour the mistress comes downstairs to a large group of waiting employees who had been hearing the commotion and gathered in confusion and curiosity. The mistress’ hair is a mess, her dress is haphazardly put back on and her make up is destroyed. All the hookers seem confused. So the first girl who went up to the midget asks her boss “did you see it? Did you see the tattoo that said stumpy”

Ben and Jerry were friends in college. Two stoners with big ideas about peace, love and understanding. Mostly, of course, they’d just get high in their dorm room on some pills that Jerry would concoct and eat snacks that Ben would whip together.
Then college ended and the two drifted apart. Moved to different towns and lost contact. Just how it goes sometimes.

It is a couple of years onward and Ben is walking down the street. Life isn’t going too well. He is out of a job and out of purpose. He pulls his jacket tighter in the cold autumn wind. All of a sudden this big ass limousine is honking its horn behind him. ”Wtf!” exclaims Ben, as the car pulls up to him and the back door opens. ”What kind of douchebag drives around in a limousine honking the horn like that”.
”Ben!” shouts a familiar voice from the back seat. Wouldn’t you know, it’s Jerry!
”Come inside old friend! Long time no see!” 
Jerry is sitting in the limousine with a big entourage. The champagne is flowing and it’s clear who the sugar daddy of the party is: Jerry. 
Jerry the slacking hippie from college. Ben cannot believe his eyes. So after a couple friendly glasses of catching up he asks his former bff: ”Jerry I’ve gotta ask, what happened? In college you were mostly into smoking pot and eating ice cream and now….this!?” 
”Well” responds Jerry. ”You know it wasn’t long ago I was working a dead end job and feeling really miserable. But then one day I decided to do something with my life. Tap into the great american entrepreneurial spirit and start a company.” ”Ok, that sounds cool I guess” answers Ben. ”But so what did you do to become this successful?”
”Well, you know how I’ve always had a knack for mixing with pills? Yeah so I invented a pill that when eaten by a chick, makes her pussy tastes of ice cream!”
”You’re kidding!” Shouts Ben. You’re THAT guy!? I read about that!

And so the night goes on and the two former friends party like they’re back in college. They get high, they have a few laughs and come morning they say their goodbyes and wow to hook up again in the future. At least they try, but you know how it goes. Time passes and friendships fade.

A couple of years onward a man is walking down the street. He pulls his jacket tighter in the cold autumn wind. It’s Jerry. Gone are his fortunes and his good mood. Turns out pills that makes chicks pussy taste ice cream was just a fad. Pair that with some stupid investments and an unsustainable lifestyle and Jerry is now as broke as when he started. Out of money and out of purpose.
”Honk! Honk!” Jerry turns around. The biggest, fanciest limousine that has ever been seen is driving down the street. ”Wtf!” exclaims Jerry ”What kind of douchebag….” ”Jerry my friend, long time no see, come inside!”. Wouldn’t you know it, it’s Ben!
Ben is sitting with a huge entourage inside a jacuzzi inside the limo. Jerry cannot believe his eyes. The most expensive champagne is flowing and everybody is having a good time on Bens dime. 
So Jerry hops in the jacuzzi and shares a drink with his old friend. ”But Ben, I’ve gotta ask” says Jerry. ”Last time I saw you things weren’t that great, you were poor as a pine cone, what happened?”
”Well funny you should ask” replies Ben. ”You see, after I saw you in your limo all those years ago, I said to myself: If Jerry can make something of himself, so can I! And so remember how I always had a knack for whipping up the best desserts?” ”Sure” replies Jerry ”You where the best back in college.” ”Yeah, well so I thought long and hard what product I could make that would make me rich” says Ben. ”And then one day I got it: so I invented ice cream that tastes pussy!”

All they owned was a truck, a few cows, and an old bull. They didn't have much, but they were happy. 

One day, the farmer woke up and found that the bull had died. He went to his wife and said, ""I take our money into the town and buy us a new bull. I know you need the truck here to keep the farm running, so when I get us a bull, I'll send you a telegraph so you know when to pick us up.""

His wife went and got the money and then said goodbye.

The farmer arrived in town late that day and had to get a hotel room. The next morning he only had 401 dollars left. He went to the market and was able to buy a strong, young bull with the 400 dollars. It had been a long time since he had been to town, but as long as the telegraph prices hadn't gone up, he should be able to send a full sentence to his wife with his dollar.

When he arrived at the post office, he said to the telegraph operator: ""I need to send a message to my wife so she can pick up my bull and I. How much is a word?""

""Prices went up a few years ago,"" replied the operator. ""A word is 1 dollar.""

""Oh no,"" said the farmer ""I can only send one word!"" 

He thought for a little while and then said, ""Ok, send my wife the word 'comfortable.'""

""Comfortable? Are you sure?"" asked the operator.

""My wife has a 4th grade education,"" the farmer replied. ""When she reads she has to sound each word out syllable by syllable. So when she sees the word comfortable, she'll read it as 'come-for-ta-bull.'""",The farmer and his wife needed a new bull...,308

He'd been given mere days to live and was sure to die in the night if not sooner. Still, he woke up that morning feeling light as a feather and smelling a delicious and familiar nostalgic smell in the air. ""Oh!"" he cried, ""My loving wife of 78 years Lorraine has baked my favorite treat on this, my last day of life, most likely; chocolate chip cookies!"" And with that, Joe Balogey rolled off his bed and hit the floor, cracking three ribs and displacing both hips. Unable to stand, he clawed himself down the stairs inches at a time in agony as his frail body dragged across the cold wood floor. Still, the pain was worth every second as he reached the kitchen to see hundreds of chocolate chip cookies cooling upon the counters and table of their family home of so many years which Joe Balogey had built himself for his loving wife Lorraine 64 years before. ""Oh, my loving, dear, sweet, ever supporting wife, she's made such wonderful treats for me."" And as Joe reached up to grab a cookie off the table a wooden spoon smacked his hand sharply.

As he sat down at one end of the bar the bartender walks over to him and asks what he would like to drink.

""Beer"" says the traveling cowboy.

""Right away"" says the bartender as he makes his way to the tap.

As the cowboy watched the bartender fill a clean mug with a crisp lager he noticed a strange shape out of the corner of his eye. He turned his gaze towards it and his eyes widened in surprise as he realized what he was looking at. At the far end of the bar seated in stool sat a full sized horse whose eyes were filled with tears. A large jar filled with an assortment of coins and Bill's sat on the bar next to the horse. Though he was a traveling man and had seen many things over many years this was without a doubt the strangest sight the traveling cowboy had ever seen.

The bartender shortly returned with our cowboy's drink and as he sat it on the bench in front of him  the cowboy spoke and asked,

""Why is there a full grown horse sitting on that there stool? And why is he crying?""

""Well sir"" says the Bartender ""about one year ago this horse walked into this saloon with tears in his eyes, sat down in that very spot and ordered himself a drink. Hasn't moved or done nothin' else since. No one knows why he came in here or where he came from but one thing is for certain. Whatever horrors he witnessed to put him in such a state I would not like to know myself, nor would any man I reckon.""

""Well I'll be"" says the Cowboy. ""What's that there jar for?""

""A few months after he came some of my regular customers started making bets. Who ever can make that horse to do anything other than sit there and mourn takes the jar and all the money in it.""

Upon hearing this the Cowboy shook his head, drained his mug in one gulp, wiped his lips, stood up and walked over to the horse. The bartender watched in surprise as the cowboy sat down next to the horse and whispered in the horses ear. The tears in the horses eyes remained but no longer were they tears of sorrow. The horse erupted in a violent fit of laughter so loud in could be heard from the street outside the saloon. 

The cowboy, satisfied with his work stood up, grabbed the jar of money, tipped his hat to the bartender (who at this point was in a state of utter disbelief) and walked out the door.


A year later the same traveling cowboy walked into the same saloon and sat down in the same spot he had the year prior. As he sat down he turned his gaze to the far side of the bar and quite to his surprise the horse was still there. Another jar had replaced the one he had taken, and the horse was still possessed by a state of violent laughter. 

""YOU!"" Yelled the bartender who had just turned and recognized the face of the traveling cowboy. ""You think you can come back into my saloon after what you've done? That horse has not stopped laughing since the day you came in here and made him do so! It's been so disruptive I can't get anyone to come in here besides my regulars, and all they do is bet on that damned horse. Who ever can get him to do anything other than THAT takes the jar and all of its contents.""

""Well I'll be."" Says the cowboy as he stood up and slowly walked over to the horse.

The bartender watched as the cowboy made his way to the far side of the bar. He watched the cowboy stand in front of the horse with his back facing the bartender. The bartender watched in an almost euphoric state of shock as the horse's laughter stopped. As the cowboy stood there, the horses countenance fell to the same state it was one year prior. Tears welled up in his eyes and he began to weep once again.

Satisfied with his work the cowboy grabbed the new jar and again tipped his hat to the bartender as he made his way to the door.

""Wait just a goddamn minute!"" The bartender screamed.

""I beg your pardon?"" The cowboy replied as he turned and began walking back toward the bar.

""Well hell. You come in here one year ago and you say somthing to that horse, which mind you, had not done nothin' but cry and mourn for one year prior to your arrival. Something so goddamn funny that he then cannot do anything but laugh and be disruptive for the next year, driving away all my customers. Then you come in here now and just stand there and he stops!? You put me through all that and you're just gonna walk out of this saloon without so much as a goodbye? Well that don't sit right with me. So I demand that you tell me what you did to that horse to make his laugh and then cry like that.""

""I guess I do owe you that bartender."" Says the travelling Cowboy. ""Well a year ago when I came In here and that horse was crying I went up to him and I told him as that my dick was bigger than his."" 

""What in the hell are you talking about?"" Says the bartender in a very sarcastic tone. "" You expect me to believe that? Well mr. Big dick cowboy, what did you tell him today to get him to stop?""

""I didn't tell him nothin'"" says the cowboy as a grin as big as Texas spread across his face. ""Today I showed him.""

The barman looks at him and says,

""Hang on! You're a duck.""

""I see your eyes are working,"" replies the duck.

""And you can talk!""
Exclaims the barman.

""I see your ears are working, too,"" 
Says the duck.

""Now if you don't mind, can I have my beer and my sandwich please?""

""Certainly, sorry about that,""

Says the barman as he pulls the duck's pint.

""It's just we don't get many ducks in this pub. What are you doing around this way?""

""I'm working on the building site across the road,"" Explains the duck.

""I'm a plasterer.""

The flabbergasted barman cannot believe the duck and wants to learn more, but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it.

So, the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his sandwich, bids the barman good day and leaves.

The same thing happens for two weeks.

Then one day the circus comes to town.

The ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the barman says to him

""You're with the circus, aren't you? Well, I know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. He talks, drinks beer, eats sandwiches, reads the newspaper and everything!""

""Sounds marvellous,"" says the ringmaster, handing over his business card.

""Get him to give me a call.""

So the next day when the duck comes into the pub the barman says,

""Hey Mr Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money.""

""I'm always looking for the next job,""

Says the duck.

""Where is it?""

""At the circus,""

Says the barman.

""The circus?""

Repeats the duck.

""That's right,""

Replies the barman.

""The circus?""

The duck asks again.

with the big tent?""

""Yeah,"" the barman replies.

""With all the animals who live in cages, and performers who live in caravans?"" says the duck.

""Of course,"" the barman replies.

""And the tent has canvas sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?"" persists the duck.

""That's right!"" says the barman.

The duck shakes his head in amazement, and says .. . ...... 

""Why the fuck would they want with a plasterer??!""",Why do they need one ?,161

The man looked at her with disdain and replied, 'That's what you can do when you're young and bright.'

This annoyed Elsie even more, so she got back in her car, backed it up and then she stamped on the accelerator and rammed straight into his BMW.

When she arrived on shore she was surprised to find anyone there, as this is a very remote island. 

She walks up to the Irishman and asks him how he got there. He says “I haven’t seen another soul in over 20 years since I was shipwrecked and stranded here.”

She says 20 years you say? Well, that’s a long time to go without a drink, she pulls down her wetsuit zipper a bit, reaches in and pulls out a bottle of Irish whiskey. How would you like a drink?

He obliges and takes a couple of swallows. “Bless your heart, that’s the best tasting whiskey I’ve had in me whole life.”

She says It’s been a long time since you’ve had a smoke, would you like a cigarette?

He happily obliges and she pulls the wetsuit zipper down even farther and pulls out a pack of cigarettes and some matches. 

He lights the cigarette, has a few drags and says “Bless your heart, that’s the best cigarette I’ve had in me whole life.”

She then says So you’ve been stranded here for over 20 years, how’d you like to play around? She pulls the wetsuit zipper down the rest of the way, exposing her naked body.

Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.

\-Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though.

One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.

\-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.

\-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.

\-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.

\-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.

The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.

\-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?

\-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.

\-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?

\-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.

\-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?

\-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.",Three men meet Buddha after their deaths,3

Never getting a drivers license, to their first drink at 21, or even having sex.

So they all decided they would go to their priest and ask if they can have 1 day off from being a nun. As this is a weird request the priest says “Yes, only if each one of you do something bad.”

They all agree and off their separate ways. 

When the first nun comes back the priest asks her about her day. And she tells him all about how amazing it was driving around in a Ferrari. Stumped upon how she was driving a Ferrari he asks the nun how she was able to drive a Ferrari. She responds “You told me to do something bad. So I robbed a bank and bought a Ferrari.”

In shock the priest told her to go drink some holy water to cleanse herself. And just as he starting to catch his breathe the second nun comes back. And she instantly starts telling him how great her day at the beach was wearing a bikini. And the priest feeling responsible now asks how she got the bikini. She responds ”I had to drown a lady to get it.”

The priest baffled by what he just heard again tells her to drink the holy water to cleanse herself of the horrific crime she committed. The last nun walks in and tells the priest she had a great day just walking around the park. And he knew he had to ask. “Did you do anything bad?” She responds calmly “No, not really, I just peed in the holy water before I left.”

The biggest, burliest man speaks up after a few men had spoken and says, ""That's nothing. I can cut down trees twice the size of that in just 6 chops.""

From the other side of the fire, someone says, ""That's impressive alright. But, I can cut down trees of that size with just 2 swings of my axe.""

The lumberjacks pause for a second, and take a look at the man who said that: a tall and scrawny older man who didn't even look like he could swing an axe. They burst into laughter.

The older man let them calm down before he began again. He said, ""Alright, if you don't believe me, lets put it to the test then. You pick the strongest man from your group and find 2 evenly sized trees. I guarantee I'll knock it down in less swings than him.""

The other lumberjacks, holding back their laughter now, look up and pick the biggest and strongest guy in their group. They find 2 large and evenly sized trees. 

The strongest man steps up to his tree and takes a swing. Then he takes 5 more well placed swings and the tree falls. He looks over at the old man and says, ""Ok, your turn.""

The old man steps up to his tree and, sure enough, in two swings of his axe, the tree falls.

The other lumberjacks look at him with awe as they gather around the fire again. Finally, one of them breaks the silence with a gentle question. ""How'd you do it? You don't even look like you can swing an axe and yet you took down the biggest tree we could find with just 2 swings!""

The old man paused and looked around the group. ""Have you ever heard of the Sahara Forest?"" he asked.

""You mean the Sahara Desert?"" asked one of the other lumberjacks.

After years of making it big in the stock market, years of wild parties, and years of living the city life, he packs up and moves to rural Montana. He's sick of the busy city, so he picks a very remote house in a very secluded rural area. His closest neighbor is 3 miles away, and his mail/groceries are delivered once a week. He never has to see anyone again.

He spends his time reading books, enjoying the nature, and in general enjoying his time alone. 

One day his doorbell rings, and he opens his door to a large, rough looking man. The man let's him know that his name is Lars, and he's his neighbor from about 5-6 miles up the road. He's having a party on Saturday, and the man is invited. 

""This sounds great!"" the man thinks to himself. ""I've been here alone these past few months, and I'm starting to get a little lonely. Meeting the rest of the neighbors sounds like a pretty good time.""

He says yes, and Lars is very happy to hear so. Before he goes, Lars gives him a warning: ""Just so you know, there's probably going to be some poker or other card games. I don't know how you feel about gambling, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it."" 

The man, having gone to a weekly guys poker night in his life in NYC, says he's totally fine with it. 

Lars speaks up again: ""Also, there's probably going to be some drinking. Lots of drinking. I don't know how you feel about alcohol, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it."" 

The man hasn't been drunk much since he left NYC, thinks it'll be a great change of pace, and says that sounds good!

Lars speaks up one last time: ""There's a good chance there's going to be a lot of sex. These parties can get a little out of hand. I don't know how you feel about orgies, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it."" 

After his wild life in NYC, the man is no stranger to wild sexual experiences, and after several months of no sex, he agrees.

Lars seems pleased, and turns to leave.

The man stops him and asks: ""Wait, you forgot to tell me what time on Saturday.""

Lars replies: ""You can swing by anytime you want. It's just going to be the two of us.""",A sucessful business man retires,19

If their answer satisfies you, you let them in to Heaven. If not, they get sent to Hell.” Jesus thinks this sounds simple enough, and he agrees.

Before too long, a man approaches the gates. Following St. Peter’s instructions, he asks the man about what he’s accomplished in life.

“Well,” said the man, “I suppose my greatest accomplishment would be raising my son. I am so, so proud of my son. Nearly everyone on earth has heard of him—to say he’s a household name would be a huge understatement. Children grow up learning about him in school and at home. Countless books have been written about him, and his story has inspired people for hundreds of years. He’s not my biological son, but I was the one to raise him, and for that I am infinitely proud and honored.”

Jesus can’t believe what he’s hearing. “Father?” he stammers. “I-is that you?”

The man gasps. “Pinocchio?!”","St. Peter decides he wants a day off from the Pearly Gates, so he asks Jesus to fill in for him.",66

The tribe leader was ecstatic that someone of Asian descent was at his tribe. They quickly exchanged names and the tribe leader offered to give a quick tour of the rain-forest nearby.

Sato was amazed at the wildlife diversity and learnt many new things about African flora and fauna. The tribe leader was happy that his guest was enjoying his time.

About ten more minutes of walking, they encountered a cave; it was pitch black. Sato tried to make out any figures or objects in the cave but light only shone in about a few meters.

""Toot toot toot,"" the tribe leader called out in a deep and nonchalant voice.

The tribe leader edged towards the cave and cup his hand around his ear, awaiting a response.

""Toot toot toot,"" a slightly higher pitched voice called back.

The tribe leader quickly took off all his clothes and dashed into the cave, leaving Sato shocked and confused.

About five minutes later, the tribe leader strolled out, sweating all over and panting in exhaustion.

""What in the world just happened?!"" Sato asked frantically.

The tribe leader laughed as he slowly put on his clothes.

""We have a interesting culture here in this area; when you see a cave, you must call out like me and wait for a reply. If you hear reply, it mean that there are a beautiful woman inside wanting to have the sex and you must run in swiftly!""

Sato was taken aback; he has never heard anything like it!

The next day, he trekked alone into the mountain side and came across a smaller rain-forest where wet leaves littered the ground from a storm that morning.

The tribe leader's words echoed in his mind and his curiosity was at an all time high; would the same thing happened?

The damp atmosphere was relaxing as he briskly explored the rain-forest, capturing the beautiful African nature around him.

Lo and behold, right next to the mountains was an extremely huge cave that stood about two to three times his height.

He was exhilarated! A cave this huge must mean many women who could be bustier or more sexually active. He put down his belongings and called out as loud as he could,

""Toot toot toot!""

He paused and listened.

But there was no reply.

""Toot toot toot!!""

He called even louder.

Again, silence.

Sato was furious, he refused to be robbed of this golden opportunity. He took a gulp of water and braced for the loudest call of his life.

""TOOT TOOT TOOT!""

Almost immediately, the cave shrieked back in an extremely solemn voice that was twice as loud.

**""TOOT TOOT TOOT!""**

Sato was on cloud nine, he tore through his clothes with utmost joy and sprinted into the cave.

Saturday morning Bob and Fred meet at their usual dock, lower their boat in, and set out. The dog is asleep in the boat, snoring loudly.

They head out and eventually see a flock of ducks go over. Bob and Fred both shoot several ducks. The ducks fall and splash into the water. Suddenly, the dog leaps up, instantly alert. He hops out of the boat, and runs across the top of the water to the ducks. He grabs them all in his mouth, runs back across the top of the water, and leaps back into the boat. He lays down again, asleep almost immediately.

Bob grins at Fred: I told you this dog is awesome.

This cycle continues all day. Bob and Fred shoot down ducks. The dog jumps out of the boat, and runs across the top of the water collecting them. Not a drop of water ever gets disturbed by the dog’s running.

At the end of the day Bob and Fred are packing up. 

“Well, Fred,” says Bob, “is he, or is he not, the greatest duck hunting dog you’ve ever seen?”

Fred is quiet a moment. “He’s a great dog. A really great dog. But....”

Bob interrupts: But? But what!? This dog is incredible!

“I’m not saying he isn’t,” replies Fred. “But you didn’t teach him how to swim, did you?”

The second guy says, ""It sure does. Let's throw a few pebbles in there and see how deep it is. We'll be able to tell the depth by how long it is before we hear the noise of the pebbles landing.""

So they pick up a few pebbles and throw them in and wait. Nothing. There's no noise.

The first guy says, ""Jeeez. That is really deep. I know, let's throw one of these great big rocks down there. Those should make a noise.""

So they pick up a couple football-sized rocks and toss them into the hole and wait... and wait... Again, nothing.

They look at each other in amazement. Then the first guy  gets a determined look on his face and says, ""Hey, over here in the weeds, there's a railroad tie. Help me carry it over. When we toss that sucker in, it's gotta make some noise.""

So the two of them drag the heavy tie over to the hole and heave it in. Once again, not a sound comes from the hole.

Suddenly, out of the nearby woods, a goat appears, running like the wind. It rushes toward the two men, then right past them, running as fast as it's legs will carry it. Suddenly it leaps in the air and into the hole.

The two men are astonished with what they've just seen and look at each other in amazement.

Then, out of the woods comes a farmer who spots the men and ambles over. He asks them, ""Hey, you two guys seen my goat out here?""

The first guy says, ""You bet we did! Craziest thing I ever saw. It came running like crazy and just jumped into this hole and disappeared!""

""Nah"", says the farmer, ""That couldn't have been my goat. My goat was chained to a railroad tie.""

",Two guys are walking through the woods one day when they stumble across a big deep hole.,1670
