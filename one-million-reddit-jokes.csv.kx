They were given a word, then allowed two minutes to study the word and come up with a poem that contained the word. The word they were given was ""Timbuktu"".

First to recite his poem was the Yale graduate. He stepped to the microphone and said:

Slowly across the desert sand 
Trekked a lonely caravan. 
Men on camels, two by two 
Destination---Timbuktu.

The crowd went crazy! No way could the redneck top that, they thought. The redneck calmly made his way to the microphone and recited:

Me and Tim a-huntin went, 
Met three whores in a pop up tent. 
They was three, and we was two, 
So I bucked one, and Timbuktu.

A Mom went to visit her son, Jack, for dinner and found that he had a girl by the name of Tammy for a roomate ... 
  
During the course of dinner, Jack's mother couldn't help but notice how pretty Jack's housemate was and the mother was suspicious of a possible relationship between the two ... 
  
Over the course of the evening while watching Jack and Tammy interacted, the mother started to wonder if there was more between Jack and his housemate than met the eyes and this made the mother even more curious ... 
  
Reading his mother's thoughts, Jack volunteered, ""I know what you must be thinking but I assure you, Tammy and I are just roomates"". 
  
About a week later, Tammy came to Jack saying, ""Ever since your mother came to dinner that night, I've been unable to find my mum's silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?"" 
  
Jack said ,""Well, I doubt it but I'll email her just to be sure"". 
  
So he sat down and wrote to his mother : 
  
Dear Mother, 
  
I'm not saying that you did take the silver plate from my house ... 
I'm not saying that you did not take the silver plate ... 
But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner ... 
  
Love, 
Jack
  
  
Several days later, Jack received an email from his Mother which read : 
  
Dear Son, 
  
I'm not saying that you do sleep with Tammy and
I'm not saying that you do not sleep with Tammy.
But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found her silver plate by now under the pillow ... 
  
Love, 
Mom

Then, he saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow. It was addressed, 'Dad'. With the worst premonition, he opened the envelope and read the letter, with trembling hands.

Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy. She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight Motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it!

Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

Love, your son, Joshua.

P.S . Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jason's house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table. Call when it is safe for me to come home! ",Old but Gold,47

A week after arriving back home in the States, he wakes one morning to find his penis covered with bright green and purple spots. 

Horrified, he immediately goes to see a doctor. The doctor, never having seen anything like this before, orders some tests and tells the man to return in two days for the results. 

The man returns a couple of days later and the doctor says, “I’ve got bad news for you, you’ve contracted Mongolian VD. It’s very rare and almost unheard of here in the US , we know very little about it.” 

The man looks a little perplexed and says, “Well, give me a shot or something and fix me up, Doc.” 

The doctor answers, “I’m sorry, there's no known cure. We’re going to have to amputate your penis.” 

The man screams in horror, “Absolutely not! I want a second opinion!!!” 

The doctor replies, “Well, it’s your choice. Go ahead, if you want, but surgery is your only option.” 

The next day, the man seeks out a Chinese doctor, figuring that he’ll know more about the disease. 

The Chinese doctor examines his penis and proclaims, “Ah, yes, Mongolian VD.  Vewy ware disease.” 

The guy says to the doctor, “Yeah, yeah, I already know that, but what can we do? My American doctor wants to cut off my penis!” 

The Chinese doctor shakes his head and laughs. “Stupid American docttah, always want opawate. Make more money dat way. No need amputate!”

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

I would even go as far as to study about some Western and Northern European countries, maybe even Japan and coastal China, but why are you suggesting us to sit here and learn about these sh*thole countries?!

I knew a guy like that once.  We called him Hap.  Don't know where the nickname come from. That's just what we called him. Obviously we made ""What's Hap'nin"" jokes all the time, and he would beat us up every time.  Rightly so cuz that's pretty lame.  Anyway, Hap was never an attractive guy, but he was hilarious. He always had girls talking to him at these parties, but he never went to bed with any of them.  We assumed that maybe it was just his looks, because he was really ugly.  Think People of Wal-Mart meets 4 generations of inbreeding.  He also never had a girlfriend, but once again, ugly.  One night, Hap got really drunk.  I mean so drunk that the guy's piss could have been used as lighter fuel.  He finally admitted that he was gay, and had never said anything because he was worried we might not want him around.  We reassured him over and over that he is still our friend.  This doesn't change anything, and he's the same guy he's always been.  Just, now some things make sense.

Now, where we lived was a pretty conservative area.  Most people didn't like gay people.  You didn't really even hear about many of them living there.  Although, I'm sure there was, but due to stigma, maybe they stayed hidden.  I'm not sure.  This meant Hap couldn't really find a local guy to get with.  He was getting restless. He decided that he was going to travel overseas to somewhere he could pay a guy to have sex with him.  Hap had money.  Hap had LOTS of money.  So he did it.  Shortly after having the idea Hap left.  We didn't hear from him for a while.  It took months, but when he finally came back, we threw him a party.  We wanted to hear all about his trip, and if it worked.  He refused.  He said things didn't go well, and he just wasn't up for a party.  I finally talked to him one day and asked him what was up. Hap told me that he couldn't find anyone to sleep with him. No matter the price.

I'm telling my girl what I want done, and she refuses.  So I said to Schneider 'She won't give me a blowjob!' and Schneider says 'Yeah?  Well, mines a boy!' which got me laughing.

post,7s78mx,2qh72,jokes,false,1516641334,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7s78mx/the_wong_brothers/,self.jokes,,"In ancient China lived the Wong brothers, three wise men who studied the arts of magic. Wong Wan could create beautiful tapestries with the tiniest bit of thread, and Wong Tsu could miraculously make crops grow in barren soil. Wong Lee, however, was much more sinister than his brothers. His magic could bring the dead back to life, but he did so to make them his eternal servants.

One day, Wong Lee was reading one of the ancient scrolls in his tower. He discovered a spell that allowed him to create a stronger, better type of servant, better than the ghouls, ghasts and spectres that he had made in the past. The spell required only three ingredients to cast, but they were very difficult to obtain.

Wong Lee went out to look for the first ingredient: a single scale from a red dragon. He and his servant went to the great hills and valleys in search of the dragon, but found none. Then they went to the wide open desert, but still found none. They climbed the highest mountains in China in search of the dragon, but found none.

It was only when they began to climb down from the summit of the mountain that a red dragon came to visit them. ""It would appear that you two are looking for one of my scales,"" said the dragon in a deep, booming voice.

""Yes, great dragon, it is a reagent for my spell,"" said Wong Lee.

The dragon looked upon Wong Lee and his servant and slowly nodded its giant head. ""I will trade you a scale from my hide for the life of your brother Wan,"" said the dragon, and Wong Lee agreed, for he cared not about the life of his brother.

Now that Wong Lee had the first ingredient, it was time to find the second: a single pearl from a giant clam. Wong Lee and his servant searched the rivers long and far, but found no clam. They went through every grain of sand on every beach, but found no clam. They sailed the seas and dove into its depths, but found no clam.

It was only when they began to return to shore that a large clam came up from the sea in front of their ship. ""You are looking for my pearl, aren't you?"" said the clam.

""Yes, great clam, it is a reagant for my spell,"" said Wong Lee.

The clam looked upon Wong Lee and his servant, and slowly opened its huge shell. ""I will trade you my pearl for the life of your brother Tsu,"" said the clam, and Wong Lee agreed, for he cared not about the life of his brother.

When Wong Lee returned to his tower, he found that the bodies of his brothers had been placed there by the dragon and the clam. ""This is good for me,"" he said to himself, ""because the last ingredient is the bodies of two powerful magicians.""

Wong Lee drew a ritual circle in his tower, lighting candles and braziers that cast an eerie glow over the bodies of his brothers. He set them perfectly inside the circle, and placed the scale and pearl he had been given upon each body. With the spell ready to recite, Wong Lee began to chant, and a bright red light shone through the chamber for a moment. When it faded, nothing was left but Wong Lee and his servant. The scale, the pearl, and the two bodies had vanished entirely.

""I don't understand!"" Wong Lee shouted. ""Everything was in its proper place! The spell should have worked!""

""Excuse me, master,"" his servant interrupted, ""but everyone knows that two Wongs don't make a wight.""",The Wong Brothers,206

After a few hours the fishing friend shouted loudly and screamed for help.
His friend soon arrived to see what had happened.

He was already starting to look pale.

""Ok don't worry, I will get some help!"" His best friend said.

He swam as hard as he could to the nearest island, ran to a bar and asked for help.

""What kind of snake was it?"" The barman asked.

""It was a blue one."" The friend said.

""My gosh, you have to suck the venom out before sundown otherwise your friend will die!""

So he quickly ran and swam as hard as he could back to his friend.

His best friend looked terrible by now, and was gasping for air and looking faint.

""I'm back! I'm back!"" His friend said as he came running over. It was well before sundown so there was still time left.

His friend looked sickly to him while still lying onnthe beach and asked with a weak but hopeful voice: ""Well?""

He looked at his poisoned friend for a while, thought it over, and said,

He pushed and squeezed his way past the ocean of people and saw the Royal Family who were on their way to have lunch. As he takes out his phone to snap a photo, he saw from the corner of his eye a shady man pushing past the crowd. The comedian, having a gut feeling of a bad omen, walked towards the stranger who pushed past the security and ran straight to the Queen. With his quick reflexes, the comedian jumped and tackled the attacker, knocking him down and subduing him long enough for the guards to seize him. 

The Royal Family, grateful for the comedian's heroicism, thanked the comedian repeatedly as the crowd applauded. The Queen, not wanting his effort go to waste, offered anything in return. The comedian denied her gifts and rewards, but the Queen was persistent. In her last effort, she offered him a dinner at the very least in the royal palace itself. The comedian mulled it over, and as he had no plans for the night anyway, accepted her offer.

He was not able to wear anything half decent to the dinner, not a semblance of formality in his attire. The guards mistook him for a beggar at first before the prince came by to grant him entry. When they entered the main hall, he was mesmerised by the extravagant display. Rare antique paintings line the walls, while a huge glistering crystal chandelier hung above them. It reflected every colour of the spectrum, casting rainbows everywhere. The prince led him to the dining hall where the dinner will take place, breaking his stare at the shining chandelier.

Right as they enter the dining hall, a group of high-ranking officials paraded the comedian with applause, something he could never say about his comedy career. He was escorted by a butler towards his seat, right across the crown prince and heir to the throne. 

The Queen began the dinner with a greeting to all. She acknowledged the presence of their saviour from earlier, this simple comedian, for his act of courage which saved them all. Again, applause from the guests serenade his ears. She went on about the duties of a knight, likening them to the bravery of this comedian. 

As he was getting bored by the Queen's long message, his eyes wandered off to scan the dinner table. An elegant, skillfully woven piece of tapestry lay atop the expensive ebony table. The plates were of the highest quality, luxurious enough to make the lamest of meals look like a gourmet meal. The cutlery were shining, absolute fine silverware and crafted to perfection. His eyes met the prince's plate, which was peculiarly out of place. It was but a cheap paper plate, the ones that can be bought in bulk for spare change. He was using disposable utensils, made of plastic that looks like it would snap the moment the prince applied force on it. Likewise, the princess was using the same cheap dinnerware, and seemed to be perfectly fine with it while the rest of the esteemed guests used the most expensive ones.

The royal chefs enter the room carrying on their silver platters their meals for the night. The most exquisite steak the comedian has ever seen, smeared with sauce infused with herbs and spices from God knows where- this was their dinner. Behind the head chef was a line of assistants carry individual side dishes to the guests and royal family. Their glasses were filled with expensive wine, emitting a strong scent. 

Meanwhile, a pair of lower-ranking cooks assisted the prince and princess with their food. They were having basic, poorly made spaghetti. The cooks sloppily scoop the sauce on top of their noodles, making a mess while they did.

The Queen offered a toast to begin the dinner. The chattering of the guest died down as they began to enjoy their meals. The comedian is still bothered by the two heirs, who are eating such simple meals while no one bats an eye. While the others ate, he silently stared at the prince and princess eat their meals.

The comedian leaned over to the Queen and asked, ""So what's the deal with the heir line food?""",A comedian was on a vacation in London...,3

- The client: Is room 39 empty?
- The boss: Yes, sir.
- The client: Can I book it?
- The boss: Of course you can.
- The client: Thank you.

Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a 39 centimetre long white thread and a 73 gram orange. The boss agreed, though he was surprised at the weird things the client asked to have. The client went into his room and he didn't ask for food or anything else. Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39. 

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor. The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise. In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first. He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table. The client paid the bill, gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel with a smile. The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

After one year, the client showed up again and asked to see the boss. The boss was in a puzzle. The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, 39cm white thread and a 73g orange. This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started. This time they were louder and more indecipherable than the year before. Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face. The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask for room 39? Why the white thread? Why the black knife? In fact, the boss didn't come up with any convincing answer to any of these questions. The boss was now eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up. 

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. He wanted to book the same room and to have the same things as before. The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before. In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.

- ''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''
- ''I promise I will never let anyone know''.
- ''Swear?''
- ''I swear I won't reveal your secret''

So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss. 

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person, and to this day he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone, but don't worry. When he does, I will let you know.",A man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss.,8

After paying $500,000, he takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light. While waiting for the light to change, an frail looking old man on a yellow moped pulls up next to him. The old man looks over at the Ferrari and asks, ""What kind of car ya' got there, Sonny?""

The young man replies, ""A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!""

""Wheeewee... that's a lot of money,"" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. ""Why does it cost so much?""

""Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!"" states the banker proudly.

The moped driver asks, ""Mind if I take a look inside?""

""No problem,"" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, ""That's a pretty nice car, all right... but I'll stick with my moped!""

Just then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! Suddenly, he notices a yellow dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly... Whoooooosssshhhhh! Something blows by him, going much faster!

""What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?"" the young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh!

He's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!

The Ferrari red lines and there's nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end.

uhhhh, Do I get it? Do I see what is simply the rise of a new generation as the passing on the torch, and the sheer terror that I feel right now having a foot in each boat would seem to imply that my theory of a radical altering of human communication since the invention of the quiet, written communication sent to strangers in distant places via wires changed everything far more quickly than the invention of the printing press, but not as quickly as that of the smartphone. Does everyone really, really, not understand that humanity is about to become something very different, and that many who actually see these things have very, very different understandings of what's going on? Am I just forever watching the pot, mesmerized by counting the air bubbles as the composition of the water is chemically changed, trying to calculate the pattern to establish rate, to further estimate how long before it will boil next, when I should just let the water in the pot do its own thing?

Amongst the participants that crazy  night was a party loving groupie frog called Freya. 
A couple of months later, Freya noticed that one of her new little tadpoles was quite different to the others; he had big lips and he loved to sing. She named him Micky in honour of his father.
Micky grew into a fine frog and it wasn’t long until he needed to leave his mothers pond and find a nice lily pad of his own. So he sets off into town to try to find a mortgage. 
The first bank he comes across is a branch of the Bank of Ireland. He goes inside and is greeted by Paddywack the banks mortgage advisor.
Paddywack quickly explains that they do not deal with frogs, Micky tells him that he is not just a normal frog but he is in fact, the bastard love child of Mick Jagger. Whilst impressed, Paddywack says that even so, what could the frog possibly put up as collateral on the deal? 
Micky quickly reaches into his little bag and pulls out a small wooden carved elephant and offers it to Paddywack, he looks at it, confused and asks what it is. 
Micky can’t believe that he does not know what it is and angrily insists that it should suffice for the down payment. 
Paddywack says he will have to speak to his manager, Patrick, to seek advice, so he calls him over. He then proceeds to explain the situation,
‘So this frog comes in asking for a mortgage to buy a new lily pad, he says he is the bastard love child of Mick Jagger and he has offered me this as collateral and I don’t even know what it is’, says Paddywack as he hands the little carved elephant to his boss. 
Patrick looks at Micky, then at the little carved elephant and then stares hard at Paddywack and says........

“Hey honey can you please meet at my sisters place for dinner tonight”?

The man agreed and drove over to his girlfriends sisters house. Now this wasn’t out of the ordinary the sister had divorced several months earlier due to a cheating husband. So they had been spending time helping her settle in and keep her company. It was hard to imagine why the husband cheated on her in the first place causing the divorce.  She was in her mid twenty’s and incredibly stunning. She had beautiful blue eyes. Perfect teeth. She had a great job as a nurse. Honestly the man sometime caught himself fantasizing about his girlfriends extremely attractive sister. 

When he arrived he noticed his girlfriends car was not there but in the front window stood her sister. For a brief second he thought he saw a quick flash of her breasts but when he double took she was waving him in.

When he knocked she answered the door in red high heels a low cut shirt and a very very short skirt. 

“Come sit down in the kitchen” she instructed “do you want anything to drink”. 

The man nodded. 


When she went to grab a beer from the fridge she bent down her skirt lifting up revealing a very sexy red thong that matched her heels. Her butt was the nicest he ever saw. She glanced over and he quickly looked away. 

She walked up and beer in hand and said “listen I know you saw my ass and I know you want it. My sister called and said she won’t be here for another 40 minutes. I’m going to go upstairs. Finish this beer and come up there and fuck me hard”

After she left the man sat their and finished his beer quickly. He walked out to his car and got in. Not more than 15 seconds after he got in he received a phone call from his girlfriend 
“Oh my god honey I’m so proud of you! I am so so sorry I put My sister and you up to this. I had to make sure you weren’t going to be a cheating rotten Liar like my sisters ex husband so I had to divise this horrible test and you passed”!

After the phone call the man sat their shocked and began to chuckle. 

“Thank god I leave condoms in my wallet and thank God I left it in my truck”

Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.

When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.""

He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""

Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing.""","When Beethoven passed away, [Long]",32

So they climb all those stairs to the top of the tower. Bishop: ""Ok, show me your plan.""

The hunchback runs and jumps at the bell, striking it with his head. Sure enough, he rings the bell. The bishop asks him, ""How did you learn to ring the bell like this?"" The hunchback replies, ""Actually, I first learned on the guitar,"" and walks over to a guitar on the wall and starts banging his head on it, and Lo! Beautiful music comes out.

So despite his misgivings, the bishop hired the hunchback to ring the bell.

Every day the hunchback comes in and rings the bell. One day, the hunchback decides to try to ring the bell louder. He goes to the farthest corner of the tower, and runs as fast as he can toward the bell. When he jumps up and hits it with his head, the bell rings clear and loud. Unfortunately, the hunchback hit the bell so hard he's a little groggy. He staggers around a bit, and falls out a window to the street below.

A crowd gathers around the hunchback's mangled body lying in the street; the bishop goes out to investigate the commotion.

The policeman arrives and again asks: ""Who is this guy?"" The bishop replies: ""I don't know his name, but his face rings a bell.""",A bishop advertises a job to ring the bell in his tower.,34

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

The attorney thought this over, and quickly decided he could easily take the old codger, and agreed to the local custom. The old farmer walked slowly over to the lawyer.

Yes, she says, ""I remember it well.""

OK, he says, ""How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. 

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. 

The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

""Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.""",The husband leans over and asks his wife,52365

The bike looks better than a new one, although it is 10 years old. It's shiny and in mint condition.

He buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.

""Well, it's quite simple,"" says the seller, ""whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome. It protects it from the rain.""

And he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline. 

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. Naturally, they take the bike there.

Just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, ""I have to tell you something about my family. When we eat dinner, we don't talk. In fact, the FIRST person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.""

""No problem,"" he says. And in they go.

Joe is shocked. Right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.

In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks dirty dishes.

They sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.

As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.

He leans over and kisses Sandra.

No one says a word.

He reaches over and fondles her breasts. Nobody says a word.

So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table and screws her, right there in front of her parents.

His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. She's got a great body too.

Joe grabs mom, bends her over the table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way right there on the dinner table.

She has a big orgasm, and Joe sits down.

His girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, and mom is beaming from ear to ear. But still ... Total silence.

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.

Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.

Suddenly the father shouts: ""I'll do the fuckin’ dishes!!!""",Vaseline,782

    Once upon a time, there lived an Israeli Rabbi.  He was a kind old man who always meant well, and was well liked, even if he could be a little over zealous at times.  He heard one day that there was a spot being offered as a missionary to travel to a small village in Trinidad and teach the town's folk the way of the Lord.  The old man was elated!  This was an opportunity to travel, help a struggling community, and spread judaism.

  The man was accepted for the job, and travelled to the village as soon as he could.  His plan was to just get to know the villager, and help around before being too preachy.  However, after spending a few hours trying to talk to the  people of the Trinidad Village he came to a realization.  They were all terrified!  Otherwise, the village was prospering.

  The Rabbi could not figure out out what the problem was.  Not one of the people would tell him.  While he talked to a vendor in the street he heard, or rather felt, something. Suddenly, there was panic in the street.  Everyone rushed to their homes and locked their doors.  The only people left in the street were the Rabbi, and a very old man, left behind by his family.  Before the Rabbi could react, the sound came again, a deep, rumbling crash, like an elephant's footstep. It shook the ground. Then it came again. Then again, and again, picking up speed, coming closer.

 Then he... It appeared. The person was 9 feet tall humanoid and bald, wearing tattered clothing and no shoes. It was a monster of a man sprinting directly at the terrified man of religion.  
 
  Frozen, the Rabbi's life flashed before his eyes, but the giant flew passed him and kicked the old village man so hard he was thrown several feet.  The older man was then pulled inside by a family and the monstrosity was fading in the distance. The preacher was confused and horrified.  He checked into an inn, and hid away in his room.  For a few days he sat in thought and fear, and every day the same thing would occur, the giant, disgusting, ogre-like man would Sprint through the  square and swiftly kick a villager, then run off again.  

    The Rabbi decided, that wednesday, after an incident, that he had to stand up to the bully. The next day he sat in the street, keeping watch over the Trinidad Village square.  Finally, he heard the first rumble, he was terrified, but couldn't let these people live in fear any longer.  There was a small boy in the street, who had not moved in time.  
This time, however, the old Jewish priest stood in the path of the wicked troll-ish man, and yelled, ""STOP"".  To the surprise of the villagers now watching from windows, and himself, the monster stopped on a dime.  ""Stop torturing these people!"", ""Kick me instead"".  He then shut his eyes and prepared for the worst, but the horrid, gross, enormous man simply bellowed, ""HA HA HA HA, 

Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids!”
