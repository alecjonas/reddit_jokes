post,5rtvll,2qh72,jokes,false,1486128083,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5rtvll/one_big_happy_family/,self.jokes,,"My wife and I got married last summer, we were together since we were teens, she was the only person that wanted to be with me, and she was the only one I wanted to be with, other than my best friend ofcource , he’s the only other one I’d spend my time with, and it helped that my friend and my then girlfriend ( now wife ) got along very well, in fact she hung out with me because she thought my friend was cute initially ( that’s what she said ( no pun intended, or detected ( parenthesis inception ) ) )

Today, I came home early from a business trip, I did not tell my wife about it, I wanted it to be a secret, I did not tell anyone about it. I wanted to surprise her, I wanted her to know that I cared about her and that I will and will always be there for her … the thing is my wife had nightmares about me being unalive and that she’d be a widow and the only person by her side at my funeral was my friend. 

I decided go to my best friends house, which a stones throw away from mine first, because I had the strangest gut feeling that he would be with my wife that night… Don’t get me wrong I love them both and I love the fact that they get along, but I just couldn’t get the thought out of my head, and when I went over to his … empty house, I had a moment of clarity. I was not mad, I was not angry, I was not enraged, in fact, it was all a seiner blob of thought. All  those times when he’d as us to have dinner together and I’d be the only one who’d say “no”, all those time my wife said he was a cute… 

At this moment, I felt … happy . I was glad , I couldn’t believe myself. I was glad that my best friend cared this deeply about my wife, and I was glad that my wife loved my best friend this much, I was incredebally happy !!  I could now surprise them together in my own bed room !! As I unlocked my house doors, I was careful not to make a sound and wake them up, and as I walked closer to my bed room, I saw two plates in the dining area, and I opened my bed room door as slowly as I could.

I was correct … My best friend was sleeping in the warm embrace of my wife, and it was so … cute, but as I took another step, the floor board creaked and my friend who had a keen ear looked around and saw me. For a moment he did not know what to do, but the very next he jolted towards me; and in the process woke my wife up. When he got close enough, he put his hands on my chest and stared kissing my all over my face, and my wife looked sheepishly at us and fell onto the bed cheekily whilst opening her arms for a hug and said “ I missed you ... “. 

I kissed my friend and went over to my wife and said, “ You know, I knew that you’d be with him, and I love the both of you for that”, while hugging her. My best friend joined in on the hug and I decided at that moment that he’d move in with us and would have dinner with us every night. He was now **our** best friend and the good-est boy we have ever known. We were one big happy family...

tl;dr: The devil is in the detail.

The first wiseman goes a week and steps on a duck. The Angel appears and says ""Follow me"". So the Angel leads him down a long dark hallway to a room with the ugliest creature he'd ever laid eyes on, ""This is your spouse for eternity"" says the Angel, locking him in and leaving.

A month goes by and the second wiseman steps on a duck, the Angel appears and takes him down the long dark hallway to a room with the ugliest creature he's ever seen, tells him that's his spouse now, locks him in and leaves.

The last wiseman goes a whole year and doesn't step on a duck, but the Angel appears anyway and tells him to follow. They walk down a long dark hallway to a room with the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen. ""Is this my reward for not stepping on ducks?"" The Angel smiles, ""No, she stepped on a duck""

Jim, Tim and Maximilian found a place near a tree to settle down and lay out their stuff. They'd been through a hectic week and they deserved this break, particularly Tim, who had been through the most.

So they pulled out their drinks and lay it on the mat, and set up their radio to play some relaxing music. Jim got out the fruits he brought, and Maximilian carefully took out his lasagna while the three were engaging in small talk. ""Beautiful day, right Tim?"" said Jim, as Tim murmured a soft yes while frantically searching in his giant bag. Maximilian noticed something was wrong, and asked ""What's the matter, Tim?"" Tim said, ""I made six Cubanos this morning, I see only two."" Maximilian responded, ""Don't worry, we can manage with two and what we've got here."" Tim anxiously said, ""No you don't understand, I spent an awful lot of time learning how to make these and spent the whole night yesterday and morning today so I could get these right."" Jim: ""Tim, you've been through a lot this week, you should've taken some rest instead. Take a seat, no worries we'll share.""

""Shut the fuck up,"" came the blunt response from Tim as he almost dove into his bag desperately trying to find his remaining four Cubanos. A concerned Maximilian commented, ""This guy really needs to chill, he's taking this way too seriously."" Tim snapped, and he jumped on Maximilian and brutally beat him up, before stepping on his face until he was bleeding profusely and unable to move. A shocked Jim took two steps back before charging at Tim, who tackled him and immediately threw him to the ground and delivered some hard punches to Jim's stomach before smashing a glass bottle on his head, leaving him unconscious. Just as Maximilian recovered, Tim held him to the tree and stabbed him with the broken glass bottle. Maximilian slumped as Tim watched both of them, standing in his bloodied t-shirt and panting heavily.

A bystander nearby saw all of this and said to his friend: ""It looks like that guy was a few sandwiches short of a picnic.""",So these three friends went to a park to enjoy their Sunday.,0

St. Peter was standing at the Pearly Gates ready to enact Heaven's new rule when the first soul approached.

St. Peter said ""My son, tell me about your last day on Earth""

First Guy ""St. Peter you wouldn't believe my last day on Earth!  So I get home early from work and go to my 19th floor apartment. I open the door and there's a trail of men and women's clothes leading to my bedroom. There on the bed was my wife naked and sweaty. You bitch! You're cheating on me!? I screamed.  So I tore through the apartment looking for the guy. I looked under the bed and in the closet, no one was there. On my way to check the living room I see two hands hanging onto my balcony railing. I throw open the sliding door and start kicking the hands and yelling at the guy. He falls 19 floors and hits the ground, but he's still squirming. So I go to the kitchen and push my fridge over to the balcony and over the railing. It nails the guy. I turn around and go to yell at my wife when I die of a heart attack.""

SP ""You poor man! Go have an extra day""

Well now the second soul is approaching the  Gates, so St. Peter says ""My son, tell me about your last day on Earth""

Second Guy ""St. Peter my last day was AWFUL! So I'm gardening on the 20th floor of my apartment building when I lose my balance and fall. Thankfully I managed to catch the railing right below my balcony.  When out of nowhere this lunatic appears and starts kicking my hands and screaming something about sleeping with his wife. I fall from the balcony, and the last thing I remember seeing is a fridge falling towards me.""

SP *snickering* ""Go have your day!""

Her birthday was coming up and she thought this was a good time to tell her mother what she wanted. ""Mom, I want a bike for my birthday.""
Now, Little Carol was a bit of a troublemaker. She had gotten into trouble at school and at home. Carol's mother asked her if she thought she deserved to get a bike for her birthday. Little Carol, of course, thought she did. Carol's mother, been a Christian woman, wanted her to reflect on her behavior over the last year, and write a letter to God and tell him why she deserved a bike for her birthday. Little Carol stomped up the steps to her room and sat down to write God a letter.

Letter 1:

Dear God, 

I have been a very good girl this year and I would like a bike for my birthday. I want a red one.

Your friend, Carol


Carol knew this wasn't true. She had not been a very good girl this year, so she tore up the letter and started over.


Letter 2: 

Dear God, 

This is your friend Carol. I have been a pretty good girl this year, and I would like a red bike for my birthday.

Thank You, Carol


Carol knew this wasn't true either. So she tore up the letter and started again.


Letter 3:

Dear God, 

I know I haven't been a good girl this year. I am very sorry. I will be a good girl if you just send me a red bike for my birthday.

Thank you, Carol


Carol knew, even if it was true, this letter was not going to get her a bike. By now, she was very upset. She went downstairs and told her mother she wanted to go to church. Carol's mother thought her plan had worked because Carol looked very sad.
""Just be home in time for dinner,"" her mother said... Carol walked down the street to the church and up to the altar. She looked around to see if anyone was there. She picked up a statue of the Virgin Mary, slipped it under her jacket and ran out of the church, down the street, into her house, and up to her room. She shut the door and sat down and wrote her letter to God...

Letter 4:


I GOT YOUR MAMA.
IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN, SEND THE BIKE.

I managed to pull myself together and go downstairs for breakfast, hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday."" I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember. 

My kids came trampling down the stairs to breakfast, ate their breakfast, and didn't say a word to me. So when I made it out of the house and started for work, I felt pretty dumpy and despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary Joanne said, ""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" It felt a bit better knowing that at least someone remembered. I worked in a zombie like fashion until about one o'clock, when Joanne knocked on my door and said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your Birthday, why don't we go out for lunch, just you and me."" I said, ""Thanks, Joanne, that's the best thing I've heard all day. Let's go!"" 

We went to lunch but not where we'd normally go. Instead she took me to a quiet bistro with a private table. We had a couple of mixed drinks and I enjoyed the meal tremendously. On the way back to the office, Joanne said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't have to go right back to the office, do we?"" I replied with ""I suppose not. What do you have in mind?"" She said, ""Let's go to my apartment, it's just around the corner."" 

After arriving at her apartment, Joanne turned to me and said, ""Boss if you don't mind, I'm goinna to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back."" ""Ok."" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake... 

Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends, and co-workers, all singing ""Happy Birthday"". 

And I just sat there...

As they were explaining what had happened, the Rabbi had a pained look on his face, and when they were done he responded, ""Well that's strange, my son went on the same trip as a Jew, and he too came back a Converted Christian!""

One day, a shipmate finds him making a small X on the deck with tape, and asks what he's doing. John stands up. ""I'll bet you fifty bucks, in exactly an hour a seagull will fly over, and shit exactly on this spot."" The other man laughs, says ""You're on!"", and they shake on it.

They both come back to the deck close to an hour later. After a few minutes, sure enough, they hear the calls of a gull, followed by a faint splat. The salior looks down in disbelief at the pile of bird shit on the center of the tape. He pays up.

A couple of days pass. It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in the sky. Back on the deck, another salior finds John walking around in his rain coat, and asks why he's wearing such odd attire on such a pretty day. ""I'll bet you 100 dollars that you're gonna regret not wearing yours too in just a minute."" The second man looks at him, and takes the bet. He begins to walk away, but before he can take a dozen steps, a single dark cloud forms in the sky and begins to soak the entire ship. 

These strange bets continue, and before long, news reaches the captain of the ship. He wants this madman off his boat. He calls some friends in high places, and gets John transfered to another vessel. A few days later, he receives a phone call from the commander of the destroyer John was placed on.

""You know,"" says the commander, ""I don't see why you wanted him gone so bad. I've already won five thousand from him. He's not as good as you said.""

""What? How'd you pull that off?""

The commander laughs. ""The idiot bet me that I had hemorrhoids! I've never had them in my life, easy money! It was a little awkward proving it, but worth it.""

""How'd you prove it?""

""Simple. I pulled down my pants, and showed him my asshole. He still didn't believe me, so he grabbed a broom and poked at me, and finally was convinced. Easiest five grand I've ever made.""

There was a silence, and the captain finally said, ""Throw that son of a bitch overboard right now.""

""What? Why?"" asked the commander.

""Because on his last day before the transfer, he bet me twenty thousand that he'd willingly have a broomstick up your ass by the end of the first week.""","The story of John, the betting salior.",1427

The officer in charge soon noticed that Ole was getting a 99% sign-up rate for the more expensive supplemental form of GI insurance.
 
This was remarkable, because it cost these low-income recruits $30 per month for the higher coverage, compared to what the government was already providing at no charge. The officer decided he'd sit in the back of the room at the next briefing and observe Ole's sales pitch.
 
Ole stood up before the latest group of inductees and said…""If you haf da normal GI insurans an' yoo go to Afghanistan an' get yourself killed, da governmen' pays yer beneficiary $20,000.

The car is parked on the street in front of the bank; she has the title, and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, ""Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?""

""Listen, you don't have to spend that kind of money,"" Mike replies. ""There's a diagnostic computer at the drugstore at the corner. Just give it a urine sample and the computer'll tell you what's wrong and what to do about it. It takes ten seconds and costs ten dollars...a hell of a lot cheaper than a doctor."" 

So Jack deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to the drugstore. He deposits ten dollars, and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample. He pours the sample into the slot and waits. 

Ten seconds later, the computer ejects a printout: You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water and avoid heavy activity. It will improve in two weeks. 

That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Jack began wondering if the computer could be fooled. He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter, and masturbated into the mixture for good measure. 

Jack hurries back to the drugstore, eager to check the results. He deposits ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results. 

The computer prints the following:
 
1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. 
2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. 
3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab. 
4. Your wife is pregnant...twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. 
5. If you don't stop playing with yourself, your elbow will never get better.

He turned around and kicked the lamp out of anger. A few seconds later, a genie popped out of the lamp.

Reluctantly, the genie said, ""Even though you kicked me, I still have to give you three wishes. However, because of what you did, I will also give twice what you wish for to the person you hate the most: your boss.""

So the man agreed and made his first wish. ""I want lots of money"", he said. Instantly 22 million dollars appeared in the man's bank account and 44 million appeared in his boss' account.

For his second wish, the man wished for a couple of sports cars. Instantly a Lambergini, Ferrari and Porsche appeared. At the same time two of each car appeared outside of his boss' house.

Finally the genie said, ""This is your last wish, you should choose carefully,"" and to this the man replied, ""I've always wanted to donate a kidney...""

The day after he goes and puts 1kg of weight on his dick - after work he checks the length, and its now much longer then the old mans at the shower, basically dragging at the floor.

So then he decides that its time to test it out and surprise his wife with his size - but, to his and hers dismay, he can't get it up, no matter how hard he tries.

The next day the guy comes to the shower to ask the old man how does he manages to use it. He comes to the guy and says:

After 15 or 20 seconds she says, ""Eighteen!""

Obviously everyone is a little disappointed. Then 80,000 blondes start cheering, ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""

So he asks, ""What is 5 plus 5?""

After nearly 30 seconds she eventually says, ""Ninety?""

The leader is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh -- everyone is disheartened - the blonde starts crying and the 80,000 girls begin to yell and wave their hands shouting, ""GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE! GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE!""

The leader, unsure whether or not he is doing more harm than damage, eventually says, ""Ok! Ok! Just one more chance -- What is 2 plus 2?""

The girl closes her eyes, and after a whole minute eventually says, ""Four?""

The first applicant, scratches his head and says ""that's easy, that's when the Christmas Bunny visits all the good little children around the world and brings them gifts"".

A bit taken aback by the applicant's answer, she decides to press on. 

The 2nd applicant states flatly that is when Father Xmas hides eggs throughout the land to good little children to find. 

Now the hiring manager is really confused, what was supposed to be an easy way to find the better applicant has turned sideways. 

However, she decides to stay the course and ask the last applicant the same question.

The final applicant starts off ""this is the day when Christians world wide celebrate the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ...""

The manager finally has a clear answer!

The applicant continues ... Jesus was dead and buried, placed in the tomb and on the third day rose from the dead, rolled the stone back and stepped out into the sunshine, and at that point saw his shadow and said ""shit, six more weeks of winter!""",A woman has three applicants for one job ...,12

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.

The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.
The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.

And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.","Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms",11

When he arrives, the first thing he sees is a giant glass jar in the far corner of the room, 7 feet by 6 feet, packed to the brim with $10 bills. 

He sits down and asks his buddies, ""What's with the jar?"" 
""No idea"" responds his friend, so the man asks the bartender.
In his thick Irish accent, ""Ah, ye warnt a know bout the haus game does yer? That'll be $10.""

Annoyed but intrigued, the man pulls out a $10 and lays it on the bar, and the old man begins, ""To win all the money in that there jar, I have a gallon jug of tequila ya hafta take all down at one go and not flinch or make a face,"" then he points to the back door, ""I have a pit bull chained out back with an aching tooth ya gotta pull, but watch out, she's mean as a blarney so be careful, and at last, I gots a 90 year old lass upstairs, who's never had an orgasm in her life. You gotta go up there and make things right for her."" 

The man stands, shakes his head as he returns the table. ""I understand!"" yells the bartender, ""But yer $10 stays in the jar.""

So the guy get into a bit of a drinking session with his buddies, but can't stop thinking about the jar. If he could suck it up, just for one night, he could change his life. 

Finally, with enough liquid courage, he stumbles up the the bar and slams down a $10 bill. ""Gimme the tequila."" The bartender hands him the jug and he throws it back as hard as he can, throats burning, tears rolling down his face, he finishes every drop and slams it down, without making a face.

She insisted that she must speak with the president of the bank to open a savings account because, ""It's a lot of money!"" After much hemming and hawing, the bank staff finally ushered her into the president's office.

The bank president then asked her how much she would like to deposit. She replied, ""$165,000!"" and dumped the cash out of her bag onto his desk. The president was of course curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asked her, ""Madam, I'm surprised you're carrying so much cash around. Where did you get this money?"" The old lady replied, ""I make bets."" The president then asked, ""Bets? What kind of bets?"" The old woman said, ""Well, for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square."" The president laughs, ""That's a stupid bet. You can never win that kind of bet!"" The old lady challenged, ""So, would you like to take my bet?"" The president agrees, ""Sure, I'll bet $25,000 that my balls aren't square!"" The little old lady then said, ""Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10am as a witness?""
""Sure!"" replied the confident president.

That night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again. He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure that there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet. The next morning, at precisely 10am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president's office.

She introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet ""$25,000 says the president's balls are square!"" The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. The president complied. The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them. ""Well, Okay,"" said the president, ""$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.""

Just then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall. The president asked the old lady, ""What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?"" She replied, ""Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that at 10am today I'd have The Bank of Canada's president's balls in my hand.""",Banker's balls (nsfw),713

Republicans expressed confidence that there will be no more defections. They can’t afford any, as no Democrats are set to back DeVos.



“I expect her to be confirmed,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told our reporter who caught up with him on the street. “You can take that to the bank.”

* When asked which bank he meant he replied a terse ""What?""

* When asked again which bank the reporter could take the words to, the Republican senator replied ""Are you serious?""

* When asked why he was avoiding the question, and why these mysterious wordbanks weren't public knowledge, the Senator left.

After a brief apology the Senator agreed to take more questions central to the house vote.

* When asked if he felt his vote could still change in the senate approval vote, the Senator mentioned it as an unlikely possibility.

* When asked whether all unbanked words would be considered invalid going forward, and, if so, whether the worlds leading up to this point and to the end of the conversation could also be taken to the bank, the senator gave a long, uncomfortable look to the reporter lasting over 45 seconds, and then said that ""yes, those words could also be taken to the bank"", but that it required the usual wordbank processing fee paid to the interviewee.

* When asked the amount of the wordbank processing fee for that interview, the Senator replied ""Idunno, what ya got?""

* When presented with $143 in loose cash and change collected from the news crew, the Senator said ""Ya, it's exactly that,"" and took the money.

There was a massive bear that paraded the shores on both sides and this made fishing difficult for both villages that lie on opposite sides of the river. 

Earlier there used to be a small pack of wolves that paraded the shores and now they were forced in the villages because of the bear. This posed a problem as they started attacking the livestock. The village elders decided to meet on the high bridge that connected them together to see who can help with this situation. 

When the elders met on the bridge, with all the other villagers in tow, they argued for an hour and didn't reach any conclusion. Then when all hope was about to be lost, Peter jumped from the bridge in the river. Having witnessed this the bear rushed to kill him. The villagers looked at this in awe from above. 

Peter somehow swims on the shore and smacks the head of the prancing bear with a large stone. The bear drops dead. Having witnessed that the bear is out of the way, the wolves run down and start attacking Peter. But one by one, Peter takes them all out. 

Having seen all this, the villagers start to celebrate as Peter comes to meet the elders. Everyone is congratulating him on his bravery but Peter looked unfazed by all this. 

One of the elders comes to him and says, ""Peter, for this bravery, all of us have decided that we'll offer you something big, what do you want? A house? A really pretty wife? A field? You say it and we'll give it to you!!"" 

To this Peter replies, ""I only want one thing, I wanna know which motherf**er pushed me off the bridge!!"" ",The two villages were troubled.,15

The donkey came in 3rd. The next Day the daily racing form carried the headline:

**“Preachers Ass Shows”**

The Preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the race again. This time he won. The form read:

**“Preachers Ass Out in Front”**

 The Bishop was upset with this kind of publicity and he ordered the preacher not to enter his donkey in another race. The newspaper headline read:

**“Bishop Scratches Preachers Ass”**

This was too much for the bishop and he ordered the preacher to get rid of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a nearby convent. The newspaper headline read:

**“Nun Has Best Ass in Town”**

The Bishop fainted; He informed the nun that she would have to dispose of the donkey. She finally found a farmer who was willing to buy the donkey for $10. The next day the newspaper headline read:

**“Nun Peddles Ass for Ten Bucks”**

They buried the Bishop the next day. The final headline read:

The head zookeeper was keeping things together, but it was a struggle. Instead of a pride of lions, they had one lone lion. Instead of a band of gorillas, just two. The rest of the zoo animals were just as sparse.

One day during a thunder and lightning storm, a single bolt of lightning struck the two remaining gorillas and killed them both instantly. Thankfully due to the storm, there were no people visiting the zoo and so the general public wasnt aware of the tragedy. The head zookeeper pulled a staff member aside and said ""Hey, I've got a gorilla suit in the back. Why dont you put it on every day, get in the habitat and act like a gorilla and I'll see that you get paid an extra $50 a day.""

The staff member agreed, and everything seemed to be working out fine. The public thought it was an authentic gorilla, the staff member made an extra $50 a day and the zoo didnt have to go through the trouble of finding a new gorilla plus deal with the financial hassle of maintaining a real animal.

The staff member realized one day that he could swing on the artificial vines on the tree in the habitat. He got quite good at it, and would at times swing out so far that he would leave the gorilla enclosure. The head zookeeper didnt care because he knew the gorilla was really a man in a gorilla suit, so he let it continue. The public loved it, thinking that a real gorilla was actually getting out of the enclosure, it heightened their sense of enjoyment.

One fateful day, when the staff member gave a particularly vigorous swing, his momentum carried him quite far out of the range of the gorilla enclosure. In fact, he realized he was directly over the lion habitat. At that moment, the artifical vine snapped, and he tumbled down through the air. He landed flat on his back, knocking the wind out of him.

The lone lion saw the gorilla fall, and sprang over with a roar. The man in the gorilla suit was terrified, and as his breath returned to him, he began to yell for help. ""SAVE ME!!! I'M NOT A REAL GORILLA!!!"" he yelled. At that moment, the lion moved his jaws towards the monkey head, opened his mouth and said...

""Shut up you idiot, or we will both lose our jobs!""",A gorilla that swung too far,25

The professor, Febuina Pell, was young for her profession and had never married, but was well respected and had written the very textbook to be used in the class. One of the students, a muggle-born child, gazed in awe at the chalk dancing across the board as it spelled out the professor's name. As they began the lesson, the muggle-born student struggled with one of the spells. He was reading it straight from his second-hand book, but his wand just wasn't responding as it should. It would spew yellow flames in all directions, repeatedly striking the bells in the tall clock in the corner or even landing in the ink wells on the desks, sizzling as the flames sputtered out. After searing his eyebrows for the 3rd time, he raised his hand for the professor to come over and help him. She looks over his shoulder, sees the writing in his book, and immediately recognizes the issue. The previous owner had spilled some tea on the pages and had attempted to re-write some of the words where the ink had faded. The result? Miss Pell's spell was misspelled, causing a mis-spell from hell for the bells and the wells.",First day of class at Hogwarts,2

Only, one day, her period didn't come as expected. She thought it was probably nothing, but she was suspicious nonetheless. She went to the store and bought a pregnancy test, and, lo and behold, she was indeed pregnant. Well, shit. Due to her active sex life and having slept with all those pro players and prison boys, she didn't really know, which one of them had gotten her pregnant. She thought about what she was to do. Should she keep the baby? How could she find the father? And then it hit her.

Needing only one person, they held multiple tests, and interviews, until they finally narrowed it down to these last three men, an Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotsman.

The Chief of MI6 had one final test. A test that would surely be able to leave them with one man at the most.

He invites the Englishman to a room, this room had two doors, one where they entered and another directly behind the chief. In the middle, between the doors was a desk, where the Chief sat.

""Morning lad"", Said the director, ""What exactly are you prepared to do for your country?""

""Anything you tell me to do"", he said proudly.

""Good."", the chief responded. He slid a handgun across the desk, toward the recruit.

""Your wife is in the next room. I want you to go in there and kill her.""

The young man took the gun and slowly walked in the room. Minutes pass, and he eventually walks out and gives the weapon back.

""I'm sorry, I can't do it. I've just married her and I can't let her go.""

""That's fine,"" the Director answered. ""You're excused.""

The Irishman comes in next, an older chap. The same scenario plays out, gun is handed to him, he is told his wife is in the next room, he enters and shuts the door behind himself and after a few minutes pass he eventually comes out.

""I can't do it"", says the older recruit, ""I've been married for two years, she's my wife and the mother of my children.""

The director excuses him, and in comes the Scotsman.

""We have one last test"", Said the director.

""Yeah, what is it, then?"", he said.

He slides the gun across the desk. ""Your wife is in the next room. Go kill her.""

""The misses?"" He asked.

The director nodded. The * went in the room, closed the door, and barely time has passed before shots are heard.

BANG... BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG

A few more seconds pass.

CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH

The Scott stumbles out, exhausted. The Chief stands up.

They draw straws, and the Catholic priest is the first to try.

He heads into the woods, and comes back three hours later with a few claw swipes across his face and hands, and tells the other two, ""I read from the Catechism, and the bear seemed to enjoy that, but when I sprinkled him with holy water, he tried to maul me, and I ran!""

The Protestant minister is the second to go, and he's gone all evening, meeting his friends the next afternoon, with a bandage around his head and a broken leg. He says to them, ""I found the bear by the river, and I preached to him from God's holy word, and he was as gentle as a lamb, until I tried to baptize him in the river; he nearly bit my head off and I had to bolt for my life!""

Lastly went the Jewish Rabbi, off into the woods. His friends hear nothing from him for two days, until they receive the word that he's in hospital. They rush over to find him in the ICU, a cast covering most of his body, and vicious wounds all over the rest of him. They frantically ask him what happened, and between laboured breaths through the ventilator, he mutters, ""You know, thinking about it, I probably shouldn't've opened with the circumcision..""","A priest, a minister, and a rabbi hear about a bear causing trouble in the woods nearby.",173

post,5rfiij,2qh72,jokes,false,1485956493,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5rfiij/a_monster_in_london/,self.jokes,,"By the 15th century, the Templar Knights had disappeared, but deep in the bowels of the British Museum in a case well sealed and protected lies a strange memorial to their impact on the city of London.

London of the early 12th century was on its way to becoming an impressive city, but its life and its blood was the Thames River. Without the river commerce would grind to a halt as the people of London discovered to their horror in 1216.

The first ships seemed simply to have disappeared, but the monster wasted little time in this caution. Soon, many Londoners had seen the gaping maw licked by flames dragging a hapless crew to its death. It was a fire salamander, and in the Autumn of 1216 it was estimated to be 40 feet long with jaws that gaped 10 feet wide.

By the spring of 1217, the monster was no longer a nuisance, it was a deadly plague. No boat could navigate the Thames… no raft was small enough, no ship was large enough to resist the demon of the Thames. Worse, the beast was growing! The latest reports called it 70 feet long with jaws opening 15 feet. Our instinct is to discount this absurd growth, and yet few could impeach its source.

He, our source, enters the story in August of 1217. London had begged, prayed, blasphemed, and killed in desperate attempts to exorcise or appease their curse; to no avail. On June 14, four men painted themselves with the Devil’s Cross and proclaimed themselves the Dark Priests of the Beast. They built a ship and doused it in oil; then, they sailed it down the river. Dark Priests they may have been, but they died screaming like any man. On July 28, London sent three virgins (the youngest not yet 13) down the Thames to the monster. It was thought that this would appease the evil god: the monster’s hunger exceeded even this atrocity.

On August 23, our source received his summons. His given name is lost in his chosen name: Honorus. He was a Templar Knight and possibly a saint. That morning, he was commanded to destroy the beast.

London in fear and desperation had turned to their most jealous weapon, the Templars… warrior monks who fought with the fierce, perhaps fanatic, frenzy of the devout. The city had exhausted all other options; the monks were its last hope, and Honorus was the greatest of the Knights.

The battle was truly a footnote to his preparation… Honorus ventured into the woods upstream from London. He forsook shelter, clothing, food, and sleep for four days, meditating on the coming struggle. When the four days ended, he stalked and killed a stag without weapon or aid. With the skin of the stag he made clothing; from its flesh he regained his strength; and with its guts, he lashed five logs into a raft fit for his purpose.

Honorus set the raft in motion. He had outfitted himself with the only item he would use in this fight which had not come out of the forest with him. A sword of Spanish steel, blue with the sky, lay in his lap. Soon, he felt the swell of the water disturb his raft: the monster was coming, yet he sat unmoving.

The beast broke the surface.

No human is perfect; a splinter of the collapsing raft clipped Honorus’ left foot as he leapt into the water. He had timed his jump slightly too late, but no matter, the injury will not be important until after the battle.

The monster was above the water only momentarily; time enough for Honorus to drive his sword between two of its scales. The monster thrashed in pain, turning its exposed flesh from the steaming water. Honorus was lifted from the water as the beast rolled. He gauged his stroke and leapt, striking the monster’s eye.

Angered and half blinded, the beast threw Honorus into the river and grasped him in its immense jaws. Honorus swam quickly past the teeth into the monster’s mouth. Inside, the questing tongue scalded his feet as he searched for purchase again, and we shall ignore this injury for now.

Once he had braced himself inside the beast’s mouth, pushing with all his strength against the slowly rising tongue, he took aim. Honorus had time to make only one thrust.

When his journal recalls these events, it attributes Honorus’ “luck” in this battle to aid from the Divine. We do not wish to detract from the glory of God, but surely He will not envy His servant. Is it coincidence that Honorus’ blade struck true to the brain? Honorus had already studied carefully the anatomy of the salamander a week before he was summoned to fight the beast. Did Honorus not know that the water’s rush against the beast’s exposed flank would cause it such pain? In his journal, “August 24: And once I am atop the beast and it has rolled from the water, where then to strike?”

Two weeks after Honorus was told to lift the curse of London, the beast was dead. The next day London celebrated Honorus; the town would live because of him. Three days later, gratitude had disappeared.

The body of the beast had lodged itself firmly in the mire less than half a mile downstream of London. Although it was yet intact (perhaps due to its incredible armor), it would surely soon rot. While not so great a terror, the rotting beast would be almost as dangerous as the live beast, attracting disease and scavengers. No ship could move the carcass. The people of London called upon Honorus.

Honorus’ solution was difficult but practical, and he began as soon as he had retrieved his sword. He fasted for two days; then, he ate the cooked meat of the huge salamander and fasted for a third day. When he suffered no ill effects, Honorus began dissecting the beast. With the help of London, Honorus soon had all the usable meat and intestines of the dead beast transformed into sausage.

A bizarre solution it was, but a good one. The sausage was soon discovered to be excellent and to keep easily for very long periods of time. Even more important, the sausage fast became incredibly popular throughout England and much of Europe. It began to reestablish the fame of London’s trade after the Hiatus of the Beast.

Still, Honorus has one final contribution to this history… It became vital that everyone knew from whence the incredible sausage of London came, and thus we return to Honorus’ injuries.

After the battle with the live beast and the crisis of the dead beast, Honorus took time to recover. Six weeks after he was first summoned, he was dressing the injuries on his feet. The problems of London were known to him. As he dipped a strip of paper like gauze into a healing salve, he had a thought.

One week later, each sausage shipped from London carried a fascinating new development: a label. Just as the gauze dried and closed on Honorus’ foot, the parchment around these sausages was attached; and all would know the fame of London from each link she sold.

In the end, despite all his other feats, it was this idea, the product label, that survived Honorus. In tribute to this advance, the British Museum houses the only known surviving label from Honorus’ sausages. And although even the tough gut of the Beast has long since faded to dust, the label may still be read. If our reader could go to the Museum and enter the Medieval wing’s most treasured collection, she could still read, in faint letters, the Label of Honor:… It Was The Beast Of Thames, It Was The Wurst Of Thames…",A monster in london,20

So a man is on a business trip through Romania. He had missed the train and so had to take his car instead. His car was around 20 years old and was not really up to the trip, but needing to close a deal for his company, he was determined to make it there on time.

So he started to drive down the highway. He spent an hour or so on the freeway and things were going well but he saw ahead there was a large backup in traffic. Not knowing how long this jam would take he uses his phone's gps to find an alternate route.

He exits the freeway and starts down a long two lane road that began to wind through the mountains. After many miles he begins to question weather this was really the best road he could have taken, but the gps said that in another 30 miles he would re-join the highway, so he continued on.

As he was driving he encountered a very steep climb up through a mountain pass. As he reached the top he heard a loud bang and the vehicle shook violently. He coasted just enough to make it over the pass and start downhill. He stopped at the peak of the climb and opened up the hood and being not very mechanically inclined, he had no idea what was wrong.

He got back in the car and tried to start the car but it just would not start. So he decided to try and coast down the hill and see how far he could get, or possibly come across a petrol station.

He coasted down the hill for almost a full mile and as it flattened out, slowly the car rolled to a halt. Having seen nothing within the Last ten miles he decides to try and call a towing company to get his car, but his phone has no signal and is almost dead.

So having seen nothing in the last 20 miles, he decides to lock his car and continue on foot to see if he can find someone with a phone.

He continues on foot for several miles till he sees a small driveway which shows no signs of recent use. He decides it's worth a shot to go check this out. He walks down this driveway for at least half a mile before he finds a massive iron gate connected to a large stone wall on each side. As he approaches the gate, the gate creaks and squeaks and slowly opens inward.

A bit startled, he cautiously walks through the gate and continues down the path. He hears a noise behind him and he turns to see the gate slowly swing shut and close with a loud bang. The man jumps at the sound and decides this wasn't the best idea, so he runs quickly back to the gate, but it is shut and refuses to open.

He decides to continue on and go find the house on this property. He walks for another 5 minutes before seeing a massive mansion looming in front of him. The front doors must have been 20 feet tall, and there were hundreds of windows and it was 8 stories tall with a tower on the far right side of the house.

The man slowly walks up the massive stone steps and through the huge pillars and right up to the large wooden doors. He finds the courage to grab the massive lions head knocker and knock on the door. Supprisingly quickly a short man in a butlers uniform opens the door.

""can I help you?"" asks the butler

""yes I was looking for a telephone. My car broke down and I don't have cell signal and...""

""follow me."" said the butler, sternly cutting him off.

He follows the small butler into the largest foyer he has ever seen with rich thick red carpets on the floor and gigantic iron chandeliers hanging from a ceiling so high it reminded him of a Gothic cathedral he had seen many years ago in Italy.

The butler shows him the telephone and telephone book and leaves him to call the towing company. The towing company is quite busy and because of the distance to his car from any major town, they are not able to send a truck till the next morning.

""what did they say?"" asked the butler.

""they can't send a truck till tomorrow. Is there a chance I could mayb...""

""Right this way, we have many guest bedrooms."" says the butler cutting him off again.

He follows the butler down a long hallway lined with suits of armour and shields with different coats of arms.

""geez,"" says the man, chuckling to himself, ""do you have talking teacups and a monster for a Master?""

The butler responded with silence as he continued to lead him through the mansion. Finally, after what seemed like ages, they reached a lavishly decorated bedroom with a large four post bedroom and a Supprisingly large and modern bathroom.

""we have a full buffet just down at the end of the hall to your right, but before anything else, I need to show you something.""

The butler then takes him back to the main foyer. He walks up to a giant Fireplace. He pushes on a big stone on the corner of the hearth and the back wall of the fireplace slides away to reveal a passage. He walks down this passage turns a corner goes down a set of stairs around another corner, back up some stairs and through a large door with a big brass knob.

In the middle of the room was a big cage with a pink gorilla sitting in one corner.

""you must never touch the pink gorilla!"" said the butler as he quickly turned and ushered the man back through the doorway, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs, around the corner, down the hallway and out the fireplace.

The butler then quickly walked away and disappeared through a door that then locked.

Not sure what to think, the man goes back to his room and takes a long shower. After his shower, he goes to bed and tries to sleep, but he can't stop thinking about the pink gorilla. Why would that butler even show him the gorilla? It's not like he would have found the cage by accident.

He eventually decides he wants to go take another look. not to touch, but just to look. He had been going over the image of that gorilla in his mind and he couldn't decide if what he saw was real or not.

So he crept out of his room and down to the foyer. The fireplace was closed and he knew he would have to push the secret rock, but he didn't want to alert the butler or anyone else in the house. He tries to carefully push the button, making as little noise as possi...

SHHHOOOK BAM!

He froze and looked around to see if the loud noise woke anyone. Luckily it seems that no one heard or cared and so he slowly entered through the fireplace and walked slowly down the hallway. He went around the corner at the end of the hallway, down the stairs, around the other corner, up the stairs and then slowly turned the big brass doorknob.

The door opened with a loud creak and revealed the large cage with the pink gorilla now sitting in a different corner. He slowly walked around the cage untill he was at a point where the gorilla was a mere arms length from the cage bars. The pink gorilla was sitting there snoring, sleeping like a baby. By this time, the man had decided he had to find out what would happen if he touched the gorilla. So he slowly reached in the cage and softly poked the gorilla in the arm. He stood there waiting for the gorilla to react but nothing happened. So he reached out and poked the gorilla a bit harder. This time the gorilla moved to scratch the spot he had touched.

The gorilla then awoke. Sniffing his arm he uttered a low guttural growl. The man quickly withdrew his arm and headed for the door. The gorilla then released a long loud cry and started going crazy at the bars of the cage. He started actually bending the bars, getting it close to where he could actually get out. Then he ripped one of the bard off and howled again. At this point, the man, terrified, started sprinting out the door. He ran as fast as he could, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs. As he reached the top step he could hear the gorilla starting down the stairs behind him. He ran even faster down the hallway and out the fireplace.

He frantically started mashing the secret stone to get the fireplace to close. And as if in slow motion the back began to slide back in place. It moved so slowly that the man wasn't sure it would close in time. As bit was half closed he saw the gorilla round the last corner. In a mad hope to get it to close faster he started mashing the button again but to no avail.

Just as the massive stone was about to close the gorilla puts his hand in the small Crack left open. He slowly started pulling the large stone wall back open. Terrified, the man ran out the front door and sprinted back down the driveway. He came to the iron gate and again it wouldn't open for him. So he began to climb.

He got to the top and as he climbed over he heard the gorilla's cry and being so startled he fell down on the other side of the gate tearing his new clothes in the process. He stumbled down the driveway towards the main road and as he looked back he saw the gorilla climbing up the gate.

Running as hard as he could he ran back to the main road and then back towards his car, the gorilla not far behind. He finally reaches his car exhausted, he tries to start his car but it just won't start. The gorilla running up to the car as he tries again to start the car. The gorilla roars and the man reaches over and pushes down the lock by his shoulder and tries again in vain to start the car.

The gorilla then starts to push and rock the car, violently shaking the car. He eventually rips off the driver side door. The gorilla then leans down and roars right in the man's cowering head, spewing phlegm all over his face and shoulders. The gorilla then reaches his arm into the car and pokes the man in the shoulder and says,

""you're it.""",the pink gorilla,20

A mournful bartender polishes an immaculate glass and halfheartedly waves away a fat, clueless fly.

The cowboy sidled into a stool and fished a coin out of his pocket. He flicked it with his thumb, and it sang in the air before ringing out on the wooden bar.

""Say friend, you got a whiskey?""

The coin rattles to a stop, and the bartender looks up with a patient smile.

""That is,"" says the cowboy, ""if you're not too busy.""

""No sir,"" says the barman. ""Never too busy."" He pops the top off a dark bottle of rye and pours a generous glass.

The cowboy throws it back, licks his lips, and says, ""My, my, my. Doesn't do any good in the bottle, does it?""

""I suppose it doesn't,"" says the bartender.

The fly buzzes by.

""Well!"" says the cowboy, clearly itching for company. ""Where in the Sam Hell is everybody?""

""Oh,"" says the bartender, ""they're all at the hangin'.""

""Hangin'?

""Hangin'.""

The cowboy motions for another belt of brown, and the bartender obliges.

""Now who might they be hangin' today?""

The bartender puts his rag on his shoulder, looks the cowboy straight in the eye and says, ""Sir, today they're hangin' none other than 'Brown Paper Pete'.""

""Brown Paper Pete?""

""The very same.""

The cowboy points to the now empty glass and makes the international 'just one more' gesture.

""That's an interesting name, isn't it?""

""It does have an air about it, sir.""

""Now why do you suppose they call him that?""

""Well sir,"" says the bartender, ""they call him 'Brown Paper Pete' because he wears a brown paper hat.""

""Does he now?""

""He does.""

""And if it rains?""

""He wears it all the same.""

""My goodness.""

""That ain't the half of it, sir! See, he also wears himself a brown paper shirt.""

""A shirt?""

""And a brown paper tie. Both of which are firmly ensconced in a well-fitted brown paper frock coat. Do you want me to tell you about his pants?""

""I think I have a pretty fair idea,"" says the cowboy. ""Would it be presumptive of me to assume that they are made of brown paper as well?""

""They are indeed. And he has a nice pair of brown paper boots, and a fine set of brown paper socks.""

""It appears,"" says the cowboy, ""that this outlaw's sobriquet is well-earned!""

""Now I don't know what that specifically means, sir. But I'll wager I agree.""

The cowboy sips in silence.

The fly makes another round.

The bartender goes back to polishing the gleaming glass.

""So!"" says the cowboy. ""What are they hangin' him for?""

The bartender puts down the glass, wipes a smudge from the bar, looks up at the cowboy and says,

""Rustlin'.""",A cowboy walks into a deserted saloon...,19

He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant
