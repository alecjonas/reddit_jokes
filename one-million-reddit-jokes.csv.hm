The second criterion was a suit from the most prestigious clothes maker in the city. So John went to that shop and waited and waited and waited to be fitted.

Many passengers died and he faced serious criminal charges. After fair trial, he was sentenced to a public death by electric chair. 

He was asked by the executioner what his last meal would be. All the man wanted was one single banana. The man ate the banana quickly and the executioner pulled the lever. Sparks flew and the crowd had open mouths when they saw the man was completely unharmed. The Judge decided it was God's will and granted him freedom. 

Next year, the man managed to land the same kind of job, only for a cargo train. Once again, his first day on the job resulted in his train detailing. Millions of dollars of cargo were destroyed. The man had to face the same judge, and was sentenced to public death by electric chair again. 

This time the man wanted two bananas for his last meal. The crowd was confused as they watched him peel and eat his two bananas. The executioner pulled the lever. The man was unharmed. The judge ordered a second time. Once again, the man was unharmed. 

The judge finally threw his arms up and screamed, ""We're doing this again, tomorrow! Screw your bananas!""

The next day there was no crowd. Only the accused, the executioner, and the judge. The judge ordered the executioner to pull the lever. 

Again, no result.

I told him he should go to bed and he just stomped around trying to be intimidating.

  ""I'm here to apply for the bell job,"" he says.
  ""I don't mean to offend you, but how can you ring the bell with no arms?"" replied the priest.
  ""Just take me to the top of the bell tower. I can do it!""

A little hesitant, the priest agrees to let him try. Up, up, up the stairs they climb all the way to the very top of the bell tower. The man doesn't stumble or hesitate despite lacking arms to steady himself.

""Now, just watch,"" the armless man says.

Standing in front of the massive iron bell he pulls his head back and BONGGG...

Impressed, the priest says, ""I'm very sorry, sir, but as impressive as that was, I'm afraid it wasn't loud enough. The townspeople will never hear it.""

""Wait, wait! I can do better,"" the man insists.

He takes a few steps back and runs at the bell. BOONGGGG...

""I'm so sorry, but it's still not loud enough for the townspeople to hear. I might be able to find a job for you elsewhere,"" offers the priest. 

""No, no! Give me one more try!""

Backing up right to the edge of the tower, the man takes a run at the bell and with all his weight smashes his head into the bell. Unfortunately his momentum deflected him off the bell with such force that he tumbled out the window.

Hurrying to the bottom, the priest found the man with a police officer over him checking the body.
""Do you know this man?"" asks the officer.

""His face rings a bell.""",A priest is hiring...,21

Next morning an incredibly beautiful woman is standing at his door in nothing but a pair of running shoes and a sign about her neck that reads, ""If you can catch me, you can have me."" As soon as he sees her, she takes off running. He tries to catch her, but is unable. This continues for a week, at the end of which, the man has lost 10 pounds. 

After this he tries the next weight loss plan, 15 pounds in a week. The next morning an even more beautiful woman is standing at the door, in similar conditions.

post,9p9ac9,2qh72,jokes,false,1539869468,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9p9ac9/there_were_three_best_friends_jen_kay_and_liz/,self.jokes,," 

Jen was a single mom of her 9 year old son, Anthony. She worked two part-time jobs, one as a freelance graphic designer, and the other waiting tables in the evening. Between the two, she had just enough to provide for their little family with some extra so Anthony could stay involved in basketball.

Kay was married to a wealthy businessman who traveled often. She spent most of her days going from appointment to appointment, meeting her girlfriends for coffee, going to yoga, shopping... but she always made time for Jen and Liz.

Liz was a single woman who worked hard to build herself a career in engineering. However, despite her experience in the field, she was having trouble climbing the ladder in such a male-dominated industry.

The three friends had known each other since middle school, and though life had taken them different directions, they always stayed in touch and leaned on each other for emotional support.

One February day, Kay, wanting to give her friends a break from their hard work, but also hoping to get them out of the house a bit, suggested they take a vacation together. They'd gone on many road trips throughout their early twenties, but life had caught up with them and it'd been a while since they hung out just the three of them. With Anthony and work, it seemed impossible; but Kay, the eternal optimist with too much time on her hands, wanted to make it happen. Her friends desperately needed some girl-time.

She even offered to give Liz money so she could take unpaid leave from work. She set up Jen with her parents who could babysit for a week. They finally settled on booking a cruise to the Mediterranean. Kay booked three separate rooms, hoping her friends could actually meet some guys on their adventure.

They set the date for July 1st. Summer would be perfect for Anthony to have off school and Kay's husband would likely be traveling. Plus it gave them several months to plan their excursions.

But mere weeks after planning their vacation, tragedy struck. It started with a headache and a night up crying. After a visit to urgent care, doctors started running tests. Within a few days it was discovered that Anthony had stage 4 brain cancer.

Jen was devastated. Kay moved in with them to help take care of the house. Liz started a support group, began fundraising for medical expenses, and set up a schedule for meals to be made for Jen and Anthony. It brought the three best friends closer together than ever before. But the main concern was for little Anthony. Even after an early surgery, doctors proclaimed that there was little they could do for him. Jen was told he might not live through June.

Holding out hope for her little boy, Jen asked Anthony what he wanted more than anything. He replied that he wanted to just be around the people he cared for the most. Jen asked again, ""Is there something specific you'd like to do? If you could do anything, what would it be?""

Anthony pondered a while, then responded ""I think I'd like to live long enough to join you and your friends on that cruise."" But he wanted to go on July 1st, to give him a goal to aim for. The doctors may not believe he could make it, but he would will himself to survive to make it.

March ended, April passed, and May came and went. Anthony was upbeat and determined to make it to his goal. He took a wall calendar and circled July 1st on it in red marker. With each passing day he crossed out another success. He looked at that calendar as his hope for the future. It gave him strength to push through the worst days. He was going to go on that cruise with his family and friends, and it was going to be the happiest days of his life.

June was nearly over, and Anthony was riding with his mom to his next doctor's appointment. He loved joking with them that he was so close to proving them wrong. Jen was talking with him about a basketball game they watched together last night when she noticed she had been talking for quite some time. She peeked in the rearview mirror and saw Anthony slumped over in the back seat. She called his name to no response. She yelled louder for him to wake, but Anthony didn't move! With wide, frantic eyes, Jen pulled over immediately. She called an ambulance after failing to wake him up.

At 10:05am on June 25th, 9-year-old Anthony was pronounced dead at the hospital he was just minutes from when he lost consciousness in the car. A few days later, they held his funeral.

At the gravesite, Jen sat and stared at the casket. Heartbroken, she reached into her purse and pulled out the July page of Anthony's wall calendar. Stumbling over to the plot where her son would be buried, she laid the paper with the red circle on the 1 on the casket, buried her face in it, and wept bitterly.

Kay and Liz were quickly by her side. They consoled her for what seemed like hours. Time stood still as the three best friends embraced in tears and heartache.

Filled with gratitude for her two friends' sacrifices for her family, Jen lifted her head and spoke. ""I want you two to go on this cruise. I can't bring myself to it, but you should still go. It's in a few days, and it's what Anthony would have wanted.""

At first, they were adamant that they would never abandon her like that. She would need them around to comfort, to help her take care of herself, and to just be present. But Jen pointed down at the now tear-stained calendar before them. Someone had to fulfill Anthony's goal on his behalf. If they loved her, if they cared for her son, they would take this trip in his honor.

A long silence followed. Liz was the first to speak. She nodded in agreement, and told Kay they had to do this; they had to do it for him. Kay looked reluctant still. After all this hoping for an amazing trip with Jen and Anthony, she couldn't imagine going without them. What should have been a celebration turned into the last thing on earth she wanted to do.

But when she looked into Jen's eyes she saw a heartbroken woman who wanted nothing but her son's wishes fulfilled by someone. It was Kay's responsibility. She started this idea, and she was going to finish it. ""Ok. I'll go. Both of us will go, for him and for you.""

Jen looked at her friend with a look of utter thankfulness. She tried to act reassuring:

""It will be alright Kay, have an awesome time; people cry over calendars. Also sometimes people cry over the damage they've caused their sexual abuse victims, but that won't bring back Anthony.""","There were three best friends: Jen, Kay and Liz",0

As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.

Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg.

Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't!

So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt.

With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.

About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus.

Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, ""How dare you touch my body!! I don't even know who you are!""

At this, the Texan drawled, ""Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.""","In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus.

One day, after finishing work and getting on the bus, the man sees a very attractive nun in the seat where he usually sits on the ride home. He sits next to her, and tries to make a move on her, but she pushes him off and yells at him.

So, before he gets off the bus, the man asks the bus driver how he might win over the nun. The driver says, ""The nuns are normally very hard to get. But I happen to know that she goes to the cemetery every night at 10:00 to pray. If you dress up as God, you might be able to have sex with her.""

The man likes this idea, so he goes out and buys a God look-alike costume. At 9:50, he puts it on and walks over to the cemetery. Sure enough, the nun is there praying.

The man approaches her, and she turns around and nearly faints. The nun says, ""Is it really you, God."" The man replies, ""Yes, it is. And today, you can come with me to heaven, but only on one condition: you have sex with me first.""

The nun agrees, but says that she only does anal. The man is fine with that, and they have sex in the cemetery all night. 

Finally, when they're done, the man takes of his costume and says, ""Haha, I'm the the guy from the bus.""

The nun then takes off her costume and says, ""Joke's on you - I'm the bus driver.""","A Man, A Nun, and a Bus Driver",23

""What'll you have""? The bartender asks.

""Gin and tonic"". Replies the man, weary from long day at work.

The bartender obliges, and the man sits and enjoys his drink. As he unwinds and watches the football game on TV, he hears the bell of the door ring as it opens. He casually glances behind him to see who's walking in and does a double take as he sees a horse walk into the bar.

The horse glances at the bartender and then turns his attention to the opposite end of the bar.

The horse then walks across the floor, walks up the wall, across the ceiling, down the other wall, then steps back onto the floor. He gives another glance at the bartender and then excuses himself out the door.

The man at the bar, flabbergasted, turns to the bartender and exclaims ""What the hell was that""?!

It was full of water, swirling with white, silky strands. Seeing this, the farmer's face contorted with rage.

""What is it Pa?"" the boy asked anxiously. 

The farmer took a long sigh, then with a hard voice said, ""Boy, best fetch me my rifle, those damn poachers are back""

So the dwarf, the dwarfdwarf, the dwarfdwarfdwarf, the giant, the giantgiant and the giantgiantgiant were walking, and they met a tree. ""What are you doing here?"" The tree said to the giant, the giantgiant, the giantgiantgiant the dwarf, the dwarfdwarf and the dwarfdwarfdwarf.

""Not much, just walking"" said the tree, the treetree, the giant, the giantgiant, the giantgiantgiant, the dwarf, the dwarfdwarf and the dwarfdwarfdwarf to the treetree. ""Wanna join?""

So the tree, the treetree, the treetreetree, the dwarf, the dwarfdwarf, the dwarfdwarfdwarf, the giant, the giantgiant and the giantgiantgiant were walking, and they came across a cliff. They all really wanted to keep walking, so the treetreetree said ""I'm the biggest and strongest out of everyone, so I'll run and jump to the other side, and make a bridge out of myself for you all to walk over"". So the treetreetree ran, jumped and... didn't reach the other side and fell to his death.

So the treetree said ""I'm much smarter than my brother, so I'll jump, reach the other side, and make a bridge for you all to walk over"". So he ran, jumped, and... didn't reach the other side and fell to his death.

So the tree said ""I'm much more handsome than my brothers, so I'll jump, reach the other side, and make a bridge for you all to walk over"". So he ran, jumped, and... didn't reach the other side and fell to his death.

So the giantgiantgiant said ""I have the stongest magic out of everyone here, so I'll jump to the other side and use my magic to lift you all over"". So he ran, jumped, and... didn't reach the other side and fell to his death.

So the giantgiant said ""I'm much smarter than my brother, so I'll jump to the other side and use my magic to lift you all over"". So he ran, jumped, and... didn't reach the other side and fell to his death.

So the giant said ""I'm much more handsome than my brothers, so I'll jump to the other side and use my magic to lift you all over"". So he ran, jumped, and... didn't reach the other side and fell to his death.

So the dwarfdwarfdwarf said ""I have the best wits here, so I'll jump to the other side and use my mind to craft a bridge and get you all over"". So he ran, jumped, and... didn't reach the other side and fell to his death.

So the dwarfdwarf said ""I'm much smarter than my brother, so I'll jump to the other side and use my mind to craft a bridge and get over"". So he ran, jumped, and... didn't reach the other side and fell to his death.

So at last, the dwarf was alone, as he was at the start. He looked down into the abyss, and saw all his friends dead at the bottom. confronted with his own mortality and the impossibility of jumping over the ravine, he decided he didn't want to live anymore. So he ran, jumped, and... landed safely on the other side.

Why did he make it to the other side?

A Milwaukee man and his wife recently received a call from an old friend whom they had not seen for years. Just before the three sat down to a little supper in the German style, the wife, seizing a favorable opportunity, whispered to her husband:

""We have only three bottles of beer in the house—just enough to go around. Don't ask him to have more.""

""Very well,"" answered the husband, who chanced to be thinking of something else at the time.

Half an hour later the host, to his wife's consternation, asked the guest to take more beer. The invitation was politely declined, but still the host did not desist. A dozen times the caller was urged to drink; a dozen times he firmly refused.

When he had departed the wife took her husband to task. ""What on earth made you persist so? Didn't I tell you there were only three bottles? Why did you insist upon his having more beer, more beer, more beer?"" ""Mercy!"" exclaimed the husband. ""I forgot entirely."" ""But,"" continued the wife, ""why did you suppose I was kicking you under the table?""

""My dear,"" blandly replied the husband, ""you didn't kick me!""",An old joke from about 100 years ago that's actually somewhat amusing,12

He doesn't have much breakthrough, until one day, he comes across a Harley with a 'For Sale' sign on it.

The bike looks better than a new one, although it is 10 years old. 
It's shiny and in mint condition.

He buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.
'Well, it's quite simple,' says the seller, 'whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome.It protects it from the rain, and he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. 
Naturally, they took the bike there.

Just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, 
'I have to tell you something about my family.
'When we eat dinner, we don't talk.
In fact, the FIRST person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.'

'No problem,' he says.. 
And in they go.

Joe is shocked.

Right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.
In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. 
Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks dirty dishes.
They sat down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.

As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.

He leans over and kisses Sandra.
No one says a word.
He reaches over and fondles her breasts. Nobody says a word.
So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table 
and screws her, right there in front of her parents.

His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. 
She's got a great body too.
Joe grabs mom, bends her over the table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way right there on the dinner table.
She has a big orgasm, and Joe sits down.

His girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, and Mom is beaming from ear to ear. 

But still ....
Total silence....

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.

Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.

Suddenly the father shouts....

*""I'll do the fuckin’ dishes.!""*","Joe, Harley &amp; Vaseline",40

The auditor said, ""Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, Which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I'm not sure the IRS finds that believable.""

""I'm a great gambler, and I can prove it,"" says Grandpa. ""How about a demonstration?""

The auditor thinks for a moment and said, ""Okay. Go ahead.""

Grandpa says, ""I'll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.""

The auditor thinks a moment and says, ""It's a bet.""

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor's jaw drops.

Grandpa says, ""Now, I'll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.""

Now the auditor can tell Grandpa isn't blind, so he takes the bet. Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye.

The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa's attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

""Want to go double or nothing?"" Grandpa asks. ""I'll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.""

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he ends up urinating all over the auditor's desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa's own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

""Are you okay?"" the auditor asks.

""Not really,"" says the attorney. ""This morning, when Grandpa told me he'd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you'd be happy about it!""

The Desk Sergeant says ""Yeah, ok, so what happened there?""  

The Economist replies ""Well, one car ran a red light and T-boned another car.  They blocked the whole intersection and backed up traffic for blocks in all directions.""

So the Desk Sergeant gets on the radio  and says ""All units, accident at 5th and Main. Two vehicles, traffic blocked, possible injuries.  Please respond.""

After a few minutes, the radio crackles and a Patrolman responds and says ""Hey, Sarge, did you say 5th and Main?""  The Sergeant looks at the Economist, who nods. The Sergeant says ""That's right, 5th and Main""

The patrolman replies ""Sarge, there's no accident here."" 

Surprised, the Sergeant says ""What do you mean? Are you sure?""

The patrolman radios back and says ""I'm sure Sarge.  I'm standing on the corner of 5th and Main right now.  Traffic's flowing like normal; no stopped cars, no glass, nothing.  Everything's fine.""

The Desk Sergeant turns to the Economist and says ""Alright, Mac, what are you trying to pull?  I got a man on the scene, and he says there's no wreck at 5th and Main at all!  He's there right now, and the traffic's flowing smoothly.""

The Economist looks puzzled and replies ""Well . . . of course it's fine now; the accident happened 5 years ago.""",An Economist walks into the Police Station,1

""Jesus is watching you."" Freaked out, he shone his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot. ""Did you say that?"", he hissed at the parrot.

""Yep,"" the parrot confessed, then squawked, ""I'm just trying to warn you.""

The burglar relaxed. ""Warn me, huh? Who in the world are you?""

 A group of young guys were out drinking one night when it was discovered that one of them, young Billy ,  was a virgin. Well, they decided this wasn’t right, and pooled their  money to remedy the situation. They talked him into going outto visit a brothel. So off they go.  


Upon entering, the ring leader went to the madam,  explained the situation and gave her $200.  She assured him she would fix Billy up right; so they all left him there to enjoy himself.  


Being naive Billy asks the madame what’s going on. She explains to him that he is about to become a man, courtesy of his friends.  
""All you have to do is choose one of my girls and she will take care of you.""  
Well Billy looks around at the group of women before him and, after several minutes of pondering, picks a likely looking girl to take upstairs.  


Once they are in their room, the girl says to Billy, "" I hear you’re a virgin boy. So what’s your pleasure? You want missionary, doggy style, ""round the world, 69 or what?"" 

Billy says, "" Gosh lady, just give me what you think I oughta have.""  
""No Boy, I’m a professional. You need to tell me what you want.""  
Billy decides 69 sounds pretty good, so they settle into the proper position. After several minutes of missing the target, Billy finally gets it right and is starting to enjoy. Sadly she'd had beans for tea and lets loose a little fart in his face.  
Billy shakes his head, thinking it’s part of the fun, and continues licking away.  
A little while later, she passes wind again.  
Billy still thinks it’s part of the fun and dives back in with a vengeance, licking like there’s no tomorrow.  
A few minutes later, she really lets rip with a fart that curls Billy’s eyebrows.  


He  pushes her off of his face and says, ""Lady, I don’t want you to think  I’m not enjoyin' myself or anything but I’ll be damned if I can take  another 66 of those.""

The amazed commentator asked her why she had  married men with such diverse careers.

Shocked, she asked: 'What in the world are you doing?'

The daughter replied: 'Mom, I'm thirty-five years old, unmarried, and this thing is about as close as I'll ever get to a husband.  So, please, go away and leave me alone.”

The next day, the girl's father heard the same buzz coming from the other side of the closed bedroom door.  Upon entering the room, he observed his daughter making passionate love to her vibrator.

To his query as to what she was doing, the daughter said: “Dad I'm thirty-five, unmarried, and this thing is about as close as I'll ever get to a husband. So, please, go away and leave me alone.”

A few days later, the wife came home from a shopping trip, placed the groceries on the kitchen counter, and heard that buzzing noise coming from, of all places, the living room.

 

She entered that area and observed her husband sitting on the couch, downing a cold beer and staring at the TV. The vibrator was next to him on the couch, buzzing like crazy.

The wife asked, “What the f... are you doing?”

The husband replied, 'I'm watching football with my son-in-law.”

when sailing ships ruled the waves, a captain and his crew were in danger of being boarded by a pirate ship. 

As the crew became frantic, the captain bellowed to his First Mate: 'Bring me my red shirt!'

The First Mate quickly retrieved the captain's red shirt, which the captain put on and led the crew to battle the pirate boarding party. Although some casualties occurred among the crew, the pirates were repelled. 

Later that day, the lookout screamed that there were two pirate vessels sending boarding parties. The crew cowered in fear, but the captain, calm as ever bellowed: 'Bring me my red shirt!'

And once again the battle was on. However, the Captain and his crew repelled both boarding parties, though this time more casualties occurred. Weary from the battles, the men sat around on deck that night recounting the day's occurrences when an ensign looked to the Captain and asked: 'Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before the battle?'

The Captain, giving the ensign a look that only a captain can give, exhorted: 'If I am wounded in battle, the red shirt does not show the wound and thus, you men will continue to fight unafraid.' 

The men sat in silence marveling at the courage of such a man. As dawn came the next morning, the lookout screamed that there were pirate ships, 10 of them, all with boarding parties on their way. The men became silent and looked to the Captain, their leader, for his usual command. 

The Captain, calm as ever, bellowed: 'Bring me my brown pants!'

A man walks into a bar, and while passing through the door he loudly clears his throat and spits in the corner, followed by a mumbled ""Fucking Audi four wheel drive!"".

He sits down, orders a beer, and after getting it, he gulps it down in one, keeping the last bit in the mouth. He gargles with the beer, and spits it on the floor in front of the bar. ""Fuck those Audi four wheel drives"" he curses.

The bartender of course is not amused. ""Hey fella, would ya stop that disgusting spitting?!"" he shouts. And what's that shit about Audi four wheel drives? I'm driving one myself!

""Well, fuck those. You know, I'm a lorry driver. Was driving my semi up from Ted's mill, and over at Springville, you know, that nasty corner down the hill - fucking Audi four wheel drives - I lost traction, and slipped from the road. There I was, stuck in this freaking snow storm, and you know how little traffic there is in this area. Nobody coming around for an hour, no cellphone network, nothing. Was freezing my ass off I was. - Fucking Audi four wheel drives - *spitting* 
And then I see some lights. A fella in an Audi comes down the road. He stops right by my truck, and gets out.

""Having some problems, do ya? Well you know, my Audi and me were enjoying the weather, you know, no traffic these days, and my Audi has all wheel drive, so that weather ain't no problem for us, no no. So me and my little Betsy here where going to see my Missus down at Riverfall, for a blowie. I know what you might think - Why would you go out in that weather and drive more than 200 miles for a blowie, but as I said, my Betsy got all wheel drive, so we don't fear no snow - Well, but I see you're in trouble here, so me and my Betsy, we can stop for a couple of minutes to pull ya back on the road, the blowie will be even better, it will feel like a reward, don't ya think? So I'll just get my tow from the trunk and we'll have you back on the road in no time.""

Looking at my truck and his Audi, I started laughing: ""Haha, good joke. If you pull off that one, you might save yourself a 200 miles trip, I'll give you a blowjob myself""

Say, you can go to a store and buy a case of eggs. You could make an omelette, but you could also try and put the eggs in a nest, get a hatching light, and hatch the chicken. Then you'll feed them, breed them, watch em grow up, get some roosters in the mix. Soon, you'll have more eggs, another few nests, you'll be on your way of becoming a chicken farmer.

You'll build a coop or a few, hire a helper, start properly sourcing feedstocks, plan breeding cycles, all that goodness.

Then, a hurricane might come and destroy everything that you have built, it'll flood the farm, the coop will go half under water and the chicken will all drown.

He and Arthur meet, and the husband gives Arthur his wife's picture, and tells him, ""She goes to the grocery store once a week, in the morning, starting in the produce section. What do you charge for the hit?""

Arthur tells him, ""50 grand is my normal fee.""

""That's expensive!"" The husband says, ""Can I give you one dollar now and the rest after the deed is done?""

Arthur replies, ""Normally I wouldn't, but you seem desperate, so I'll make an exception.""

One week later, Arthur finds the wife in the produce section of Wal-Mart, shopping for groceries just as the husband said, and strangles her to death right there.

An employee witnesses the act and Arthur catches him and strangles him to death as well, but not before the employee calls the police.

Arthur couldn't escape fast enough, and gets arrested, news media surrounding him.
