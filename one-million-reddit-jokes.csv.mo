One day the father wakes up and sees the cow is dead, so he kills himself. The mother wakes up later and sees that the cows dead and the dads dead, so she offs herself as well. The eldest son then wakes up and sees that the cows dead, the dads dead, and the moms dead and he decides to take a reflective walk along a river where he runs into a beautiful female leprechaun. She asks him what's wrong and he explains, she makes a deal- if you can make love to me 10 times in a row, I'll bring back everyone including the milk cow, if you can't I will kill you. He tries and dies. 
The second brother wakes up and sees that everyone is dead and walks the same path as his brother did. He runs into the same leprechaun, is offered the same deal and fails. 
The third brother, a strapping 18 year old lad wakes up to the horrific scene and decides to take a walk. He runs into the leprechaun who offeres the same deal, but he asks the question- what if I make love to you fifteen times in a row? She says that if he can do that she'll bring everyone back including the cow, and give them enough wealth so the family will never struggle for generations to come. He asks again, what if I make love to you twenty times in a row? The leprechaun laughs, well I'll bring back everyone including the milk cow, give you all limitless wealth, and I'll give you a mansion to go with it. The brother asks one last question, if I make love to you twenty times in a row, what's to stop ya from dying like that milk cow did??

The first man quickly grabs the jug of water explaining to the other two that if he gets hot he'll just drink some water and keep walking until he finds help and starts to go on his way.
The second man grabs the bread and explains to his friend that if he gets hungry on his journey that he'll just eat some bread and keep walking until he finds help and leaves going a different direction.
The third man is left alone and realizes he has nothing to help him survive the desert so he unbolts the car door and starts walking into the desert in a different direction from the first two.
A hour or so later a desert soldier who was on patrol noticed the first man and asked him if he was ok. The first man explained his situation and assured the soldier that he was ok because if he got hot he could just drink his water. The soldier pointed in a direction and told him to head to his headquarters for help while he searched for the mans friends and headed out again.
A couple of hours later he found the second man still searching for help. The soldier asked him if he was ok and the second man told him he was because he had his bread to eat whenever he got hungry.

On his first day, after the manager teaches him how to use the register, he tells the newcomer that he is going to be in the back to restock, and if the Indian guy needed any help, he should go to the back and ask him.

A customer walks into the store, pays for his gas, but on his way out he notices a chocolate bar. ""How much is this""? He asks. The Indian man doesn't know, so he runs to the back and asks the manager, who tells him it's 25 cents. The man tells the customer: ""25 cents"". The customer replies: ""Is it fresh?"". Again, the man doesn't know what to say, so he runs to the back and asks the manager, who tells him to say ""yes, very fresh"". The man tells the customer: ""Yes, bery fresh"", to which the customer replies ""should I buy it?"". The Indian man is tired at this point, but goes to the back and asks his manager what to say. He tells him to say ""If you don't, someone else will"". The man tells this to the customer, who finally just buys the chocolate bar and leaves.

Later that night, the manager is out, and only the newcomer is in the store. A burglar walks in and points a gun at the clerk, and shouts: ""How much is in the register!"" The Indian man replied: ""25 cents"". 

""Are you getting fresh with me?""

""Yes, bery fresh.""

""Should I kill you?""

Why have I stopped dreaming since the teeth came around? I try not to sleep nowadays, because, when I try, I have to stare at those teeth. The upper and lower rows of teeth stay closed, and I dread to know what will happen when they finally open, if they ever open. Some days I want them to get it over with, I want those teeth to open up, but other days I wonder if it would be better to just keep having to see them. I mean, it shouldn't be so bad to just have to see them, should it? Just seeing them shouldn't be so bad, but I guess that emotions don't follow reason. I wish that I could be free from feeling, free from shame, free from fear, but, in the end, I just want to be free from those teeth, I want to dream again, I want to dream again.

As they were making love though, the guy noticed something strange.

The girl's toes would curl up during every lovemaking session.

 

When they were done, they lay back on the bed and relaxed against the pillows.

Finally our fellow, being impressed with himself said,

He waits for a while but no one comes to greet him.  Beyond the gates, he hears a band performing a concert between deafening cheers of the crowd and other indications of general merriment.  He looks around but cannot find anyone or any way around the gates.

He notices a sign that reads: ""This way to Hell - Warning! One Way Only!"" and chuckles to himself.  Hours turn into days, days into weeks, weeks into months and years.  Eventually, he gives up and walks toward the sign.  He starts descending down a flight of stairs when suddenly they give way and he falls straight down to Hell.

He dusts himself off, shivering due to the ice cold temperature.  He looks up from where he fell and immediately realizes that there is no way to climb back up.  He is trapped here now for eternity.  He shouts out as loudly as he can if anyone is there and can hear him.  A large, looming blue figure comes out of the icy abyss and greets him.

""Oh my God, it is Lucifer!""  Joel shouts.

""Okay Joel, first of all, God isn't going to do anything for you right now so you can just stop.  Secondly, I am not Lucifer, I am Satan.  If you actually read your Bible you would know the difference.""

""Why the hell are you so blue?!  Where is the fire and brimstone?""

""Don't you think I have tried to start a fire up in this bitch?  It is cold here because we are far away from God's love.  I take it you aren't a Duke fan?""

""What the hell does that have to do with anything?  Where is everyone else?""

""They are all in Heaven.""

""What? Everyone?  Even Hitler?  Stalin?  Ghengis Khan?""

""Yes, everyone.  Why are you so surprised?  Do you actually think God would give me, the Lord of the Underworld, access to human souls and rule over them?""

""Well, how come I couldn't get into Heaven then?  The gates were closed and no one came to let me in!""

""Well Joel, the gates of Heaven have never been sealed.  You just never asked them to open it.  But hey, I spoke to them on your behalf and they are open now for you.""",Joel Osteen dies and goes to Heaven.,11

Then a helicopter came by and the pilot shouted down, ""Grab this rope and I will lift you to safety.""

To this the stranded man again replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me. I have faith.""

So the helicopter reluctantly flew away.

Soon the water rose above the rooftop and the man drowned. He went to Heaven. He finally got his chance to discuss the whole situation with God, at which point he exclaimed, ""I had faith in you but you didn't save me, you let me drown. I don't understand why!""

The priest said, “That was a long,long time ago and doing what you did, placed the two of you in great danger.Two people under those circumstances can easily succumb to the weakness of the flesh, however, if you are truly sorry for your actions, you are indeed forgiven.”

“Thank you, Father. That’s a great load off my mind. It's good to know that I haven't done anything unforgivable, I do have one more question though”

Though this was hard for Wei because her language transition didn't go over so well. She could speak clearly, but she'd always find herself stuttering on the last word.
Since she was a qualified as a transfer student, she enrolled in a community college just to find the love of her life. His name was Yoa, a Hawaiian boy who thought that Wei was just blushing whenever she stuttered. They got married six years later, both had achieved their bachelors degrees and were ready to start a family.

They had two twins planned, but since it was hard to tell whether they were boys or girls at the time, they didn't decide on names just yet. They were excited to start the family they had always dreamed of, they just wanted it to happen sooner.

Unfortunately though, Yoa passed away 4 months before the twins births. He commit suicide, he hung himself. Wei sat there crying at his funeral with her cursed stutter sobbing, ""No-no!"" over and over, he was gone.
Wei decided to name the twins Mei and Kai. Time moved on and the kids learned not to talk about their father, their mother would always say ""he would've loved you-you"".

Time moved on, now the kids were in High school, and Wei was recently contacted by the school administration. It had come to their attention that Mei, the daughter, was recently showing odd signs of depression. The school had good reason to believe that Mei might be getting bullied, and that evidence could be found at how she was caught cutting herself in the gym. Mei wasn't the talkative type, nor the popular type, compared to her brother. Kai was basically a gym athlete with the brains for Harvard, he had everyone's respect.
The school administration recommended that Mei and Kai should spend more time together, walk to school together, to classes together, and leave the campus together. Just a way to figure out if the bullying is real, whether it's cyber or real life.

Wei told Kai about Mei's possible predicament and was absolutely shocked. He wasn't aware that his sister could be clinging on to some severe depression.

He loved them dearly, but they always had an embarrassing and somewhat explosive effect on him.

One day he met a girl and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry, he thought to himself, “she’ll never go through with the marriage with me carrying on like this,” so he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. Shortly afterward, they were married.

A few months later, on the way home from work, his car broke down. Since they lived in the country, he called his wife and told her that he would be late because he had to walk home. On his way, he passed a small cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him. Since he still had several miles to walk he figured he could walk off any ill effects before he got home.

So he went in, ordered, and had 3 extra large helpings of delicious baked beans. He farted all the way home. By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe.

His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited. She exclaimed, “Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!” She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the table and made him promise not to peek.

At this point he was beginning to feel another one coming on. Just as his wife was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She again made him promise not to peek until she returned, and away she went to answer the phone.

While she was gone, he seized the opportunity. He shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was not only loud, but also ripe as a rotten egg. He had a hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about him.

He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on. He raised his leg and RRIIIPPPP!!! It sounded like a diesel engine revving, and smelled worse. To keep from gagging, he tried fanning his arms a while, hoping the smell would dissipate. Then he got another urge. This was a real blue ribbon winner, the windows shook, the dishes on the table rattled and a minute later the flowers on the table fell over. While keeping an ear tuned in on the conversation in the hallway, and keeping his promise of staying blindfolded, he carried on like this for the next ten minutes, farting and fanning each time with his napkin. When he heard the phone farewells he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it.

Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of innocence when his wife walked in. Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner table. After assuring her he had not peeked, she removed the blindfold and yelled, “SURPRISE!!!”

There, seated around the table to his great alarm, were twelve dinner guests for his surprise birthday party!",Too Much Loved for Baked Beans!,3

post,6ymvcw,2qh72,jokes,false,1504787150,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6ymvcw/bee_joke_long/,self.jokes,,"So there once was this wasp that lived in a jungle. This was not your ordinary wasp though-he was smart, philosophical even. One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colours. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean’s list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him.

He goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it.

Of course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp’s departure, but they all know it’s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn’t been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there’s an extremely long line. He decides it’s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he’s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it’s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there’s no punch line.",Bee Joke ( Long ),6

The panicking man yells ""THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH! TELL ME WHERE TO GET POTATOES.""

The butcher, who has just lit up what is his seventh blunt of the day responds ""If it's that bad, try asking the meat. It's all delivered from the market so I'm sure you can get some directions. I talk to the pork and the steaks all the time.""

Frustrated and defeated, the man sighs, and with a defeated tear in his eye asks the pork loins and the steaks where to get potatoes.

Though this was hard for Wei because her language transition didn't go over so well. She could speak clearly, but she'd always find herself stuttering on the last word.

Since she was a qualified as a transfer student, she enrolled in a community college just to find the love of her life. His name was Yoa, a Hawaiian boy who thought that Wei was just blushing whenever she stuttered. They got married six years later, both had achieved their bachelors degrees and were ready to start a family.

They had two twins planned, but since it was hard to tell whether they were boys or girls at the time, they didn't decide on names just yet. They were excited to start the family they had always dreamed of, they just wanted it to happen sooner.

Unfortunately though, Yoa passed away 4 months before the twins births. He commit suicide, he hung himself. Wei sat there crying at his funeral with her cursed stutter sobbing, ""No-no!"" over and over, he was gone.

Wei decided to name the twins Mei and Kai. Time moved on and the kids learned not to talk about their father, their mother would always say ""he would've loved you-you"". 

Time moved on, now the kids were in High school, and Wei was recently contacted by the school administration. It had come to their attention that Mei, the daughter, was recently showing odd signs of depression. The school had good reason to believe that Mei might be getting bullied, and that evidence could be found at how she was caught cutting herself in the gym. Mei wasn't the talkative type, nor the popular type, compared to her brother. Kai was basically a gym athlete with the brains for Harvard, he had everyone's respect. 

The school administration recommended that Mei and Kai should spend more time together, walk to school together, to classes together, and leave the campus together. Just a way to figure out if the bullying is real, whether it's cyber or real life. 

Wei told Kai about Mei's possible predicament and was absolutely shocked. He wasn't aware that his sister could be clinging on to some severe depression. So he decided that he would force Mei to wake up an hour early follow him an hour early so she could hang with him during his morning practice at the school gym.

The next morning Wei was about to leave to work, and as Kai was getting ready for school she said, Wake Mei up before you go-go, Don't leave Mei hanging like Yoa-yoa!",A Chinese mother with a terrible stutter,5

Every now and then she would find an injured animal in her backyard, and she would waste no time bringing it into their home and taking care of it until it recovers. The man doesn't mind the animals, just as long as they don't bother him. 

However, during the winter, the wife brings in more and more animals into the house. One day it was a deer that was freezing and hungry. Another day a squirrel that got buried in the snow. The pattern continues for much of the season. The woman had gotten so busy that the man, who was being neglected by his wife, was starting to lose his patience. Yet he doesn't point it out since he figured that it would start calming down when spring comes around.

One cold morning, the wife finds a bird shivering in the birdbath. She immediately takes it inside, but with all the other animals taking up space she had to put it on her husband's chair that was placed near the fireplace. 

When the man sees the bird on his favorite relaxation spot, his patience finally reaches its limit.

""Excuse us Mr. President, but we were looking over some of the documents about your background and noticed that your physical health and performance records are outdated. We ask that you come with us to perform some tests.""

The president agrees, gets up out of his chair and follows the group of agents to a private and secluded athletics field. 

""This won't take long Mr. President, simple tests. First off, we need you to do as many push-ups as you can without stopping."" and so the president gets down, takes a deep breath and does a strong 62 push-ups. 

""Good job sir, next we need you to hold these weights out in front of you and do as many squats as you can without stopping""

The president gets in his best stance and begins squatting. He does a burly 45 squats before giving out.

""Impressive sir, just one more test. We need you to run a mile around this track as fast as you can.""

The president tightens the laces on his shoes, adjusts his headband and takes a quick drink of water, then gets on the starting line. The agents count him off and he takes off running. Several minutes later he passes through the finish line sweating and breathing hard. 

""Very good sir, that's one of the most impressive mile lap times I've ever seen.""

The president says ""Am I the best?'

The agent takes a second to flip through some papers on his clipboard before going ""Ehh.. not quite. You're second best overall with a time of 10 minutes and 32 seconds.""

The president says ""What? Who did better than me?""

""Well, Bush did 9:11.""

After a few days, as the husband returns home from work, his wife says to him, “Honey, one of the pipes in the bathroom is leaking, could you fix it?”
“What do I look like, a plumber?” asks the husband, and goes to sleep.
A few days later, the wife once again turns to her husband and says, “Honey, my car doesn’t start. I think it may need a new battery. Could you change it for me?”
“What do I look like, a mechanic?” asks the husband with a frown.
A week goes by, and the wife once again turns to her husband and says, “Dear, the roof is leaking, could you do something about it?”
“What do I look like, a roofer?” asks the husband. “Take care of these things yourself!”
He then leaves home for a week on a business trip. “When I come back,” he says to his wife, “I’d like all these things taken care of.”
He comes back a week later and is astonished to discover the roof is fixed, the car is running and the pipes are brand new.
“Great! How much is that going to cost me?” he snarls at his wife.
“Nothing at all.” said the wife. “The neighbor popped in and turns out he’s a handyman. He said he’d fix the whole thing if I’d just bake him a cake or sleep with him.”
“Wow,” said the husband. “What kind of cake did you make him?”

Steve I know who you are, and where you live. My name must remain anonymous, so as of now you may refer to me as ""Somebody"". Steve I contact you because my independent studies have discovered a massive earthquake heading your way. You, your research center, your city, and half of your State are in for the mother of all earthquakes. My advanced Richter scale is reading an earthquake with a magnitude of 13! That's an extremely dangerous magnitude as you should know, your state will literally vibrate, do the wave, roll itself out, in other words you will die if you don't act now. You have exactly 25 hours to evacuate everyone and take any important instruments or research devices that cannot be lost or replaced, to safety. By my calculations you'll pick up the oncoming earthquake in 4 hours, but if every city and town doesn't start evacuating in 8 hours, it may be too late to save everyone.

Steve panicked, he had spent eight years working at his quite establishment, collecting weather patterns for the news, but had never received such an ominous task. Steve decided immediately, that he didn't want to risk anything so he packed all of his important instruments first into a news van, so if it was real he'd be able to leave as soon as possible. Next he pulled out his laptop, needed to make sure that this was a confirmed earthquake and not some hoax. So he did, he waited the four hours and sure enough it was real. He quickly speed dialed the mayor, who had always been a good friend of his.

""Steve, you caught me at a rough time what do you need?""

""Mayor you need to evacuate half of the state, we're all in danger!""

""Woah! Woah! Steve, are you okay? What's going on?""

Every Saturday morning he would take his 5-year-old granddaughter out for a drive in the car for some quality time -- pancakes, ice cream, candy -- just him and his granddaughter. One particular Saturday, however, he had a terrible cold and could not get out of bed. He knew his granddaughter always looked forward to their drives and would be very disappointed. 

Luckily, his wife came to the rescue and said that she would take their granddaughter for her weekly drive and breakfast. When they returned, the little girl anxiously ran upstairs to see her grandfather who was still in bed. 

""Well, did you enjoy your ride with grandma?"" he asked. 

""Not really, PaPa, it was boring. We didn't see a single asshole, queer, piece of shit, horse's ass, tree hugger, socialist left wing prick, blind bastard, dipshit, Muslim camel humper or son of a bitch anywhere we went! We just drove around and Grandma smiled at everyone she saw. I really didn't have any fun.""",Difference in Grandparents,30

princess touched would melt.
 
No matter what:

Metal

Wood

Stone

Anything she touched would melt.
 
Because of this, men were afraid of her. 
 
Nobody would dare marry her.
 
The King despaired. What could he do to 
help his daughter?
 
He consulted his wizards and magicians. 
One wizard told the King, 

'If your  daughter touches one thing that 
does not melt in her hands, she will be 
cured.'
 
The King was overjoyed and came up with
a plan.
 
The next day, he held a competition. Any 
man that could bring his daughter an 
object that would not melt would marry 
her and inherit the King's wealth.
 
THREE YOUNG PRINCES TOOK UP THE 
CHALLENGE.
 
The first brought a sword of the finest 
steel.
 
But alas, when the Princess touched it, it 
melted.
The prince went away sadly 
The second prince brought diamonds.

He thought diamonds are the hardest 
substance in the world and would not 
melt. 

But alas, once the Princess touched them, 
they melted.
 
He too was sent away disappointed.
 
The third prince approached. He told the 
Princess, 'Put your hand in my pocket and 
feel what is in there.'
 
The Princess did as she was told, though she turned red.
 
She felt something very hard. She held it 
in her hand.
And it did not melt!!!   
 
The King was overjoyed. Everybody in the
kingdom was overjoyed.
 
And the Prince married the Princess and 
they both lived happily ever after.
 
Question: What was in the Prince's pants????

M&amp;M's of course!  They melt in your mouth, 
not in your hand.

Do you think I could stay the night?""The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man sa,ys, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery...,22

3 men, an Irishman, an Italian, and a polish man, work together on a fishing boat. It's a small company, they fish every day and their families dress the fish they catch. 

On one particularly slow day about 5 years in, they're settling into lunch.

The Irishman opens his lunch box and with an angry grunt pulls out a shepards pie.

""Shepherds pie! Again! 5 years, every god damn day she makes me shepherds pie! I swear if I get shepherds pie tomorrow, I'm jumping overboard.""

The Italian, moved by his friends speech, pulls out of his bag a container of lasagna.

""Madonna mia! Lasagna again!"" He says. ""My friend, if I have lasagna again tomorrow, I will join you!""

The polish man reaches in and pulls out his lunch. 

""Ah! Pierogis again! I'm so sick of pierogis! I will join you both tomorrow if I have pierogis!""

The next day, the Irishman reaches in and pulls out a shepherds pie. He writes his wife that the same lunch everyday has driven him mad, and jumps overboard and disappears. 

The Italian reaches in, pulls out lasagna, and signs his name with the Irishman, then he too jumps overboard. 

The polish man pulls out pierogis, signs the form, and jumps overboard. 

A week later, the three widows are at the funeral, all crying. 

The irish widow laments ""if he had only told me, I would have made him something different!""

The Italian widow cries out ""I would have made his risotto, anything else!""

The polish woman is crying, but she says ""there's nothing I could have done! He made his own lunch!!""

A Japanese businessman was waiting on an important call from a new associate in America. He was quite nervous, as he had never dealt with an American before, and honestly didn't know much about the country and it's culture. The phone started to ring and the businessman quickly answered it, being pleased to find out that his new American partner was at least semi-fluent in Japanese. 


His anxiety dissipating, the businessman started to exchange pleasantries with the American, eventually asking him what part of the country he was from. 

As the American answered, the Japanese businessman began to frown, confused. It had sounded as if the American had just started the conversation over again by replying with a greeting. ""Yes, hello,"" he responded in Japanese, ""but where are you from?""

The American answered him again in the same way, and the Japanese businessman became more frustrated. His anxiety starting to flare up again, he tried once more, his voice shaking, ""Yes, hello, but where are you from?""

The final response was the same as the previous two, and the Japanese businessman slammed the phone down, his anxiety at the possibility of further miscommunication overwhelming him. He quickly paged his secretary to set up an email correspondence with the American instead.

An American lawyer thinks this is a great opportunity to earn $100 and goes to the clinic.

Lawyer: ""I have lost my sense of taste.""

Doctor: ""Nurse, bring medicine from box No.666 and put 3 drops in patient's mouth.""

Lawyer: ""Ugh. this is kerosene.""

Doctor: ""Congrats, your sense of taste is restored. Give me $50.""

Lawyer: ""I have lost my memory. I cannot remember anything.""

Doctor: ""Nurse, bring medicine from box no.666 and put 3 drops in his mouth.""

Lawyer (annoyed): ""This is kerosene. You gave this to me last time for restoring my taste.""

Doctor: ""Congrats. You got your memory back. Give me $50.""

The fuming lawyer pays him, and then comes back a week later determined to get back $100.

Lawyer: ""My eyesight has become very weak I can't see at all.""

Doctor: ""Well, I don't have any medicine for that, so take this $100.""

The Communist then turns to another friend.

""Petya, remember being sentenced in 1937 to 25 years in the gulag? Well, it was me who went to the NKVD. Please forgive me.""

""No hard feelings, my friend. You are forgiven"" says Petya.

""Misha, I must confess to you that I had you sent to the penal battalion in 1942. I am terribly sorry about that day.""

""Please my friend, we all forgive you. You may go in peace"" says Misha.

""Thank you so much guys for being with me throughout all these years"" says the old communist with a tear streaming down his face. ""I don't know where I'd be if it wasn't for you. I never knew you loved me that much despite me being a stool pigeon.""

His friends are visibly touched by his words. Finally, gathers his last strength and says.

""And in honor of our deep friendship I want you to fulfill my last wish. See that cactus plant on the windowsill? As soon as I die, I want you to take it and shove it up my ass.""

Just as his friends were about to say something, the old communist took his last breath and died.

So Petya rushes to the window, takes the cactus plant off and together they shove it up their dead friend's butt. Suddenly, the friends hear a loud banging on the door followed by a gruff voice shouting:

The man was overjoyed that the surgery had made him look young and walked off happily.

The man smiled happily. The worker asked if the answer was correct.

The man replied, ""I'm actually 34 years-old"".

The worker was amazed as he did not look a day over 21. The man went to a bus stop afterwards to board the bus and go home. He saw an old lady waiting for the bus. He decided to test it out on her. He asked her to guess what age he was. 

The old lady said, ""I know an old technique to guess people's age. If you let me caresse your balls for 5 minutes I will be able to guess your age"".

The man was confused but seeing as there was no one else at the bus stop he let her do it.

After 5 minutes the old lady pulls her hand out of the man's trousers and says, ""You are 34 years-old"".

Amazed the man asked how did she know.

An Irishman applied for a job on a construction site, but the foreman wouldn't hire him until he passed a simple maths test.
Here is your first question, the foreman said. ""Without using numbers, represent the number 9.""
""Without numbers?"" The Irishman says, ""Dat is easy,"" and proceeded to draw three trees.

""What's this?"" the boss asked.


""Ave you got no brain? Tree and tree and tree make nine,"" said the Irishman.
""Fair enough,"" said the boss. ""Here's your second question. Use the same rules, but this time the number is 99.""
The Irishman stared into space for a while, then picked up the picture that he has just drawn and made a smudge on each tree. ""Ere you go.""

The boss scratched his head and said, ""How on earth do you get that to represent 99?""


""Each of da trees is dirty now. So, it's dirty tree, and dirty tree, and dirty tree. Dat is 99.""
The boss was getting worried that he's going to actually have to hire this Irishman, so he said, ""All right, last question. Same rules again, but represent the number 100.""
The Irishman stared into space some more, then he picked up the picture again and made a little mark at the base of each tree and says, ""Ere you go. One hundred.""


The boss looked at the attempt. ""You must be nuts if you think that represents a hundred!""


The Irishman leaned forward and pointed to the marks at the base of each tree and said, ""A little dog came along and crapped by each tree. So now you got dirty tree and a turd, dirty tree and a turd, and dirty tree and a turd, which makes one hundred.""

They belonged to the clan of Long Anconvo, a Chinese clan of thieves known for their dexterousness and efficiency. One day, the head of the clan sent the two thieves to Punsar, a land known for its wealth in gold and jewelry.   
The thieves arrived at the border of the land, only to be met with guards sent by the nation. After being captured and tried in a court, the two men were sentenced to 50 years in prison. The king's wise adviser recommended that they were moved to a maximum security prison.  
However, being masterful thieves of the Long Anconvo lineage, they quickly figured out a way to navigate the underground tunnels in the prison to the emperor's treasury.  
Quickly gathering whatever they could fit in their pants, they bolted from the treasure room and headed back to their headquarters.   
After realizing that he had been robbed, the emperor of Punsar summoned his adviser and ordered the adviser executed for having recommended a terrible idea.

Now this tribe was known all throughout the island as a tribe who loved to make the local brew, however they weren't known at all for making GOOD homebrew. Or 'kava' as it's known locally. 

Of course a Fijian tribe known for making terrible homebrew would be disliked by many other tribes, and many assumed the buks were as terrible a people as they were brewers...

One day a young boy from the tribe found himself sitting in his hut wondering why his people were so hated? So he resolved in his heart to prove this assumption wrong. 

At first he thought maybe he should try to improve the Buks brewing methods, but after much trial and error he discovered it just wasn't to be!
The Buk tribe was just destined to be terrible at it!

And so he devised a new plan. Instead the young man decided to just be as friendly and kind a person as he could possibly be, and that news of his kind acts would spread across Fiji and clear his tribes name, and restore it's honor!

And he did! In fact it was working so well that soon all his fellow tribe members were following suit!

And so eventually, although their brew still tasted awful, The buk tribe became known for being the kindest tribe on the island!

And that ladies and gentleman...


Is why You dont Judge a buk....

After that, the three of them continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but there was no more cuddling.

A few weeks passed by, and lo and behold, there was another shipwreck. The only survivor was a beautiful young woman, the most beautiful woman the Welshman had ever seen. She was in a pretty bad way when they rescued her, and they slowly nursed her back to health.

When the young maiden was well enough, they introduced her to their evening beach ritual. It was another beautiful evening: red sky, cirrus clouds, a warm and gentle breeze; perfect for a night of romance. Pretty soon, the Welshman started to get ""those feelings"" again.
