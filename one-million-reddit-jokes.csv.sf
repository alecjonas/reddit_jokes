Whenever I finish the tale they're always pale as Lyndon B's corrupt lyin' ass.  I can't blame 'em.  This story kept me up throughout my whole deployment in those damn jungles.  Worse still, I was the ""protagonist"" of this story, if you can call me that.

It was October, 1972.  We were stationed along the Ho Chi Minh trail to intercept supplies going through a triage of enemy villages 112 kilometers north of the capital.  My platoon had set up an encampment on the southside hill in relation to these villages when gunfire began raining down on us.

We did what we were trained to do, although I could tell the rest of the boys were scared out of their minds.  I can't blame 'em.  But when the gunfire became sweeping towards our position from farther south was when we all realized we were in some deep shit.  We were rats snapped snug into a trap.

We called for reinforcements, but the higher ups all had their hands tied up in other ambushes throughout the valley.  Air support was limited, although we relished the brief pauses in the bloodshed it would give us when they dropped the bombs on the hostiles.

During one of the enemy waves I lost four of my fingers to enemy grenade shrapnel.  A Norwegian recruit, Sven Alfoldssen, saved my ass during that same encounter.  The men began calling me ""Six"", and Alfoldssen ""Seven"".

We became pretty good friends.  We shared a few drinks together, spoke about our women, reminisced about times before we were drafted into this whole shit show.  But we were proud to serve, and would die for our respective countries willingly if it meant stopping the Commies from encroaching on our freedoms.

But that all changed after a few weeks of no reinforcements and dwindling supplies.  Some men began eating flour mixed with dirt to sate their unrelenting appetites.  There were some scuffles for the last few MREs that got pretty violent.  Before we had some hope help would arrive to push the commies off the hill to get us some goddamn food.  Now, it was no secret we were in some dire fucking straits.

Three weeks passed since the last MRE was eaten.  If the Viet Cong made a significant offensive on our position during then, we would've certainly kissed all our lives goodbye.  The men found it hard just to stand up in the morning.  Our rip-cages were all showing, and we just started isolating ourselves from one another.  There's no point in making small talk if all you can think about is the next bite to eat.

This is where I'm struggling to recollect my thoughts.  It's not that I *can't* remember, mind you.  I don't *want* to remember.  Who on this fucking marble called planet Earth *wouldn't* want to forget this?

Seven began talking to me for the first time in three days.  I didn't want to reciprocate, because I had to patrol the perimeter that day and he was obviously compromising my position with his banter.  He was saying some shit about one of our foreign recruits hailing from Germany.  Saying things like ""we should take him by surprise"" and ""he'd make for some nice company during dinner.""  I mostly ignored what he said, but the little I retained sent chills up my spine.

That night, I went to see how the german was doing.  This was the worst mistake of my life, and what I saw would never leave my memories till the day I die.  I opened up the tent and saw Seven with a bloody fistful of the german over his mouth.  I saw the poor man moaning his dying breaths as Seven bit on his intestines.  I'll never forget what the german said.  *Nein ... Nein ...*.

In absolute rage, I grabbed a nearby rope and strangled the cannibal Seven to death.  I strangled to death a man who was once my friend.  When the deed was done, the german had already passed.  I cried, holding his bloodied head in my arms.  

I couldn't find a dogtag on the german's body.  Seven must've thrown it away somewhere in some inane attempt to cover-up his crime.  The rest of my comrades, upon hearing about what happened, began calling the poor soul ""Nein"".

Reinforcements and supplies arrived a couple days afterwards.  After a few weeks in the hospital, we were sent back into the thick of it all.  War is like that.  It never forgets, but also never cares.

I've told this story to so many naive greens during my time in these jungles.  This story kept me up through it all, and not in a good way.  I'll never forget what I saw that night.  When I saw how Sven ate Nein.

(TL;DR: Because Seven Eight Nine)

I asked them, 'What the Hell are you doing here?!"", but he wouldn't reply. I immediately knew that my wife was cheating with him on me. So while my wife was sleeping, I walked up to the man and started punching his hands, in order to make him fall off.

But he wouldn't let go.

So I went and grabbed a knife from the kitchen and started cutting off his fingers. He let go of the railing and fell down about twenty five storeys before hitting the ground.

He was still alive.

Still angry, I went to the kitchen once more and dragged a refrigerator towards the balcony. I then threw the refrigerator over the railing, but my hand must have been caught in the handle of the refrigerator, and so I fell as well. And that's how I died.""

God frowned and said, ""Well, I guess that's a pretty terrible way to die. I'll let you in."". He opened the gates and let the man in, before closing them off once more.
Soon afterwards, he was greeted by a second man.

""How did you die?"", God asked. He then realised that the man was deaf, and started moving his hands, communicating in sign language.

The man replied by moving his hands as well, , ""Well, I was doing exercises out on the balcony of my apartment, when suddenly, I slipped and fell. I was lucky enough to grab onto the railing on the floor below mine, and hung on. Suddenly, a man appeared in front of me. He yelled something at me, but I couldn't understand him because I am deaf. Without warning, he quickly began hitting my hands, but I still managed to hang on. He then quickly left and came back again, and then began cutting my fingers off! I couldn't hold on anymore, and let go. I miraculously managed to survive the fall, but I could not move, as I was now paralyzed. A minute later, the man threw a refrigerator and himself off the building, killing me in the process.""

God cringed as he finished listening and moved his hands around, saying ""Jesus Christ, just go through the gate!""

""Thank you."" The gate opened once more, and closed as the deaf man walked through.

Half an hour later, a third man appeared at the gate, and once more, God asked, ""How did you die?""

The man replied, ""Well you see, I was hiding naked inside a refrigerator and . . .""","Due to severe overpopulation, God now only allows people who have died terrible deaths to enter Heaven.",16

Above them are the honey nut cheerios, more of the middle-management level cheerios.

After them are the fruity cheerios, you know, the real artsy, middle-class types.

At the top are the frosted cheerios, the truly rich and famous.

So one day plain ol' regular ol' Cheerio Joe was walking down the sidewalk, and he saw an incredibly beautiful frosted Cheerio girl.  He said to himself, ""I'm gonna work real hard, and one day I'll become a frosted cheerio, and then I'm gonna find that girl and I'm gonna marry her.""

So he goes and gets a job at the local Burger Flipper joint.  He works really hard, and learns how to flip burgers really well.  He flips burgers so well that soon people start coming from all over town to this Burger Flipper joint to try Cheerio Joe's amazing burgers.

One day, his store manager came to him and said, ""Cheerio Joe, you've made me so rich I've decided to retire and give you my job.""  And poof! Cheerio Joe became a honey nut Cheerio.

As the manager of this Burger Flippers joint, Cheerio Joe teaches all the burger flippers there how to flip burgers really well.  They flip burgers so well that soon people start coming from all over the region to try Cheerio Joe's famous burgers.  

One day, the regional manager came to him and said, ""Cheerio Joe, you've made me so rich I've decided to retire and give you my job.""  And poof! Cheerio Joe became a fruity Cheerio.

So now as the regional manager Cheerio Joe travels to all of the Burger Flipper joints in the region and teaches all of the burger flippers how to flip burgers really well.  They all flip burgers so well that soon people start traveling from all over Cheerio Land to try Cheerio Joe's famous burgers.

One day, the owner of Burger Flippers Inc. came to him and said, ""Cheerio Joe, you've made me so rich I've decided to retire and give you my job.""  And poof!  Cheerio Joe became a Frosted Cheerio!

So he said, ""Now that I'm a Frosted Cheerio, I'm gonna go out and find that Frosted Cheerio girl and I'm gonna marry her!""

So he goes out and he finds her and he marries her.  

Ok, so now we're at the wedding reception.  The Frosted Cheerio girl says to Cheerio Joe, ""I'm thirsty, can you get me some water or something?"" 

So Cheerio Joe goes to find some water, but he comes back and says to the Frosted Cheerio girl, ""There's a really long line for water, would some milk be ok instead?""

She's says that will be fine, so Cheerio Joe goes to find some milk.  But, he comes back and says to the Frosted Cheerio girl, ""There's a really long line for milk, too.""

The Frosted Cheerio girl replies, ""This is a wedding reception, shouldn't there be some punch?""  So Cheerio Joe looks around and he realizes there is no punch line.",So in Cheerio Land there are 4 levels to the social hierarchy.,8

All the other body parts laughed at the rectum and insulted him. So in a huff, he shut down tight.
Within a few days, the brain had a terrible headache, the stomach was bloated, the legs got wobbly, the eyes got watery and the blood was toxic. So they all decided that the rectum should be the boss.

But anyways, as a teacher, let me tell you a little story...

I had a female student (I'm a male), who was rather attractive. Not gonna lie. But I would never pursue a student sexually or romantically. Apparently, that feeling was not mutual. At first, things were like they usually were with stupid young girl crushing: double entendres, very subtle comments, etc. But there's a line, and she crossed it.

She wrote her number on an essay with a smiley face. This was not okay by any means. I immediately contacted an administrator so I wouldn't get in any trouble. These sorts of things are taken very seriously at pretty much any grade level these days, and I'm not interested in losing my job over some girl's hormones getting the best of her.

So a couple of days later, this administrator called a meeting with the parents. We were all in the office and the administrator was doing his spiel to the girl and her parents about appropriate behavior at school and appropriate age differences and the like (apparently this is a common enough issue that he had some training on how to have this kind of talk). She looked fairly ashamed, staring at the floor the whole time. He finished his rehearsed rant and then asked the parents if they had anything they wanted to say to the daughter. 

The father was silent, but the mother spoke up. She said something about how the girl should know better and how they taught her better than this, etc. The usual parent reprimand stuff. But teenage girls can often find ways to surprise you. The mom asked her daughter, ""And what did you even expect would come of something like this?"" My student was quiet for a moment, looking down at the floor still, but then she turned to me, and I will never forget the way she looked at me when she said it: ""About tree fiddy."" It was about this time I noticed that my student was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. I said, ""Damn it, monsta, get out of this office! I ain't givin' you no damn tree fiddy!""

TL;DR Teenage girls are crazy",Some advice,27

Her name was Erica. She lived a typical grandmother life, knitting, spoiling her grandchildren and puttering around.

But despite having lived a full life before retiring, she wanted something more. So she decided to take her love of gin and turn it into a hobby. Erica painstakingly researched different recipes for gin, mixed them with her cooking expertise, and experimented for months with different ratios, strainers and ingredients.

After many months of working on her various gins, one of her friends, Stacy, came over to her house one night and happened to try one of the drinks. Stacy found it so delicious that she suggested that Erica should try selling some of her various flavors of gin. Erica did just that, starting at the local farmer's market, and when her popularity increased, she began mass producing her most-loved flavors of gin.

Erica's gin quickly became hailed as one of the best-grade gins in the world, earning awards and feature articles in popular publications.

It wouldn't last though. Erica's life was tragically cut short by a heart attack, and with her death came the death of her secret recipes. Many people would try to recreate Erica's gin for years to come, yet no one could find the proper mixtures of ingredients.

But Stacy, the one who pushed her to start her business, never gave up. She searched and searched, looking through purchase logs and transactions for the suppliers of Erica's juniper berries, malt, and other ingredients. Stacy worked nights and weekends for months on end, ardently refining her product, until, amazingly, she came across the perfect recipe. Erica's original gin recipe. It tasted exactly like the first gin Erica had made that fateful night years before. Stacy brought the original Erica brand of gin back to the world, and gin-lovers the world over rejoiced at her work.

The moral of this story is thus: With hard work and perseverance, you too can Make An erica Grade-A gin.",An inspiring true story about my friend's grandmother.,32

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. 

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

Suddenly, Satan appeared at the front of the church. Everyone started screaming and running for the front entrance, trampling each other in a frantic effort to get away from evil incarnate.
Soon everyone had exited the church except for one elderly gentleman who sat calmly in his pew without moving, seeming oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy was in his presence.
So Satan walked up to the old man and said, ""Don't you know who I am?"" The man replied, ""Yep, sure do.""
""Aren't you afraid of me?"" Satan asked.
""Nope, sure ain't,"" said the man.
""Don't you realize I can kill you with a word?"" asked Satan.
""Don't doubt it for a minute,"" returned the old man, in an even tone.
""Did you know that I could cause you profound, horrifying, physical AGONY... for all eternity?"" persisted Satan.
""Yep,"" was the calm reply.
""And you're still not afraid?"" asked Satan.
""Nope.""
More than a little Perturbed, Satan asked, ""Well, why aren't you afraid of me?""
The man calmly replied, ""Been married to your sister for the last 48 years!!..",Satan appeared at the front of the Church.....,111

My friend, Hugh, is a very religious man, who is also involved in our community. 2 weeks ago, our local church burned down and Hugh believed it was his Christian duty to help them get back on their feet. Hugh allowed the friars of the church to set up a cart in his mall to sell their flowers. Every day, the friars came in at 7:00 in the morning with a bushel of beautiful flowers and began to work diligently to arrange them into bouquets. All was going well, the mall was generating more revenue and the church was making more money than they were by selling the flowers in front of the church on Sunday. Everyone was happy; until that first weekend.

Our town is kinda tourist-y, so we get some out-of-towners on the weekends. A gay couple came to the mall the first weekend that the friars had taken up shop (Typically, our town is pretty progressive, but the friars tended to be uber-conservative). The couple came over to the cart and admired the flowers; they tried to purchase a bouquet, but the friars refused to sell to them. The couple was outraged and went to see Hugh directly. They complained to him that the friars were being discriminatory, so Hugh promised to have a talk with the friars. When Hugh confronted the friars, they refused to sell to the couple on the grounds that “they were committing an atrocity in the eyes of the lord.” The couple stormed off and promised to boycott the cart.

This past weekend, the couple came back with a large group and a letter from the mayor, saying that the friars had to sell to them, regardless of sexual preference. The friars stood firm and refused to sell to them, so the group started a protest. They brought in signs and started chanting around the cart. The friars continued to sell their flowers and Hugh allowed them to remain, so eventually the protest began to boycott the mall, rather than just the cart.
By today, the mall had lost 50% of its normal weekend revenue. The group sent a letter to Hugh saying that they could forgive him if he shut down the flower cart within the week. Hugh was pretty broken up, but he had no choice. To maintain his livelihood, he would have to kick the friars out of his store. He talked with the friars this morning and revoked their previous agreement. The friars had their cart packed and left by 7:30, to huge cheers from the community. The mall has been pretty normal today, and it seems like all has returned to normal, but Hugh has taken the day off to think about what he did. He was the only person who could have settled the disagreement between the community and the church, but he wished it didn’t have to come to this.

Only Hugh can prevent florist friars.",My friend owns a mall (long) (x-post from /r/puns),1

Walking along the seafront, he noticed something strange going on in the sea a few hundred metres from the beach. A Pakistani man who looked badly hurt seemed to be drowning in the water. The pope asked his aid if he could borrow some binoculars so that he could see what was happening more clearly. Looking through them, he then realised that the Pakistani man was in fact being attacked by a shark.
30 seconds later, a speedboat came into view with three men on board, all wearing England football shirts. The first man harpooned the shark, while the second guy saved the Pakistani by pulling him onto the boat. The third guy and the first guy then struggled with the shark, eventually killing it before pulling it's dead body onto the boat before speeding off to the harbor where they hung the shark up on public display, to cheers from the large crowd that had formed nearby.

The Pope, still in a state of disbelief, insisted on meeting the three men, and headed to the harbour. On arrival, he called them over to him and said: ""What I have just witnessed was truely amazing. I'd heard there was a lot of racial tension in England, but your actions and bravery have showed me that this is indeed not the case. You all risked your life to save this man and I hope that news of this will travel around the world and set an example to others. May you all live in peace and harmony forever, and may God bless you for the rest of your lives.""
He then returned to his car and was driven off back into the town.

The first English guy turned around to the second guy and asked ""Who the hell was that?""

""That was his Holiness the Pope."" Replied the second guy.

""Well he knows FUCK ALL about shark fishing!"" added the third guy. ""How's the bait doing or do we need to find another one?""",Pakis!,8

It was night when he finally arrived at Baghdad, so he decided to rest at a convenient hostel before entering the city in the morning.  The Innkeeper was talkative and friendly, so Abdul was delighted to ply him of news and all that had occurred during his absence.  They were both laughing over court scandals when Abdul asked, ""When did this happen?""  The Innkeeper paused in thought, then scratched his head.

The mortician asks the deceased's wife how she would like the body dressed, pointing out that the man does look good in the black suit he is already wearing.

The widow, however, says that she always thought her husband looked his best in blue, and that she wants him in a blue suit. She gives the mortician a blank check and says, 'I don't care what it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing.'

The woman returns the next day and to her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly.

She says to the mortician, 'Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied.. You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?'

To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check, 'There's no charge.'

'No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit,' she says.

'Honestly, ma'am,' the mortician says, 'it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit. I asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice.'

After a little bit, the man became more relaxed with the thought of doing a $5 hooker so he puts it in her and it’s the worst feeling he’s ever had on his dick — like sandpaper and teeth. He pulls out and tells her. “Um. something’s wrong, can you do something about that?” Betsy crinkles her face, then says, “Why of course! But it will run you another five bucks.” He hands her the last of his money and she pockets the fiver and goes to the bathroom and is back in no time.

The guy puts it back in her and now, it’s the complete opposite: it’s the best feeling he’s ever had, and he finishes in a flash. Panting, he asks her, “oh my god… that felt amazing… what did you do??” Betsy smiles, and says, “for the extra five bucks, I pick the scabs.”",A man walks into a whorehouse.,13

She had long been suspicious of a relationship between the two, and this had only made her more curious.

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and his roommate than met the eye.

Reading his mom's thoughts, the son volunteered, “I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, we are just roommates.""

About a week later, his roommate came to him saying, “Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?""

He said ,""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure.""

He sat down and wrote :

Dear Mother:

I'm not saying that you ‘did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you ‘did not' take the silver plate .. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.

Love,

your son

Several days later, he received an email from his Mother which read:

Dear Son:

I'm not saying that you ‘do' sleep with your roommate, and I'm not saying that you ‘do not' sleep with her. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver plate by now, under the pillow…

The Jamaican replied, 'Just try dem on, Mon.'

As soon as he slipped them onto his feet, he got this wild

Not seeing much success, he didn't know what to do.
It didn't help when he soon was being sued by a major insurance company for copyright issues.
Being an inexperienced lawyer, he didn't want to handle the case himself.
So, he put an ad in the local paper.
Guy was soon contacted by one of the nations top lawyers, Geo Loodwin.
Geo said he wanted to help out a lawyer who was just starting out, and this was the perfect way to do it.
On the day of the court case, Geo jumped in to action.
He was such a good lawyer, that Guy Company won the case in only 15 minutes.
Geo, being a nice person, only charged Guy 85% of his normal prices because he was just starting out.
Guy Company became an instant success after that.
People wanted to know how a small law firm could defeat a major insurance company.
Guy became a better lawyer by the day, and soon he was the best lawyer in his state.
But, Guy wanted to honor Geo Loodman for helping him out.
So, Guy Company's new policy was that if the case was won in 15 minutes of less, they would only have to pay 85%.
He became rich, and Guy started to put advertisements wherever he could.
His company grew and grew until they could afford to buy out the Times Square billboard.
