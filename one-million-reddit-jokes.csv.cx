For financial reasons, the farmer wanted to increase the egg production from his chickens and go into business. And so, the farmer set out to buy a rooster. He drove across the county to another farm that had many chickens and roosters.

The first farmer asks, ""I'd like to buy a rooster.""

The second farmer says, ""No problem. What's he for?""

The first farmer says, ""I want a rooster so that my chickens can have more chickens and lay more eggs.""

The second farmer points to a rooster, ""Okay. Take Brewster over there... he'll do all your chickens for you."" The rooster he pointed out was lying on his back and breathing heavily.

The first farmer exclaims, ""What? You've got to be kidding. That rooster is practically dead! He's breathing like there's no tomorrow.""

The second farmer says, ""Don't worry, he'll do fine. I guarantee he'll do all your chickens and you'll end up with more eggs than you could ever imagine.""

Well, the first farmer thinks about it, and finally agrees, ""Okay. A guarantee is a guarantee. Sold."" He scoops up Brewster and lays him in the back of his truck.

As soon as the farmer pulls into his yard, Brewster leaps out of the truck and grabs a chicken. After he's done with one, he does another, and another...

The farmer says, ""Take it easy Brewster! You're going to hurt yourself!""

Brewster just waves, grabs another chicken, and nails that one too. He proceeds to do all the chickens just as the other farmer had promised. When he finishes the chickens, he runs after the dog, and does him too.

The farmer is starting to get a little worried.

Brewster then does the cat, the horse, and all the other farm animals too. He then starts chasing after the farmer's wife!

Some time passes and the farmer can't find Brewster anywhere. He looks everywhere and eventually finds the poor rooster on his back, motionless, with a flock of vultures circling overhead.

The farmer cries out to himself, ""Oh no! I told him to be careful! Now look what's happened.""

Brewster opens one eye and whispers, ""Shhh! They're about to land.""",Brewster the Rooster,4

Principal: „What is 3 x 3?“


Johnny: „9“


Principal: „6 x 6“


Johnny „36“

Johnny: “Gum“


Teacher: “Where do most women have curly hair?“

He sits at the bar and orders a whiskey, and strikes up a conversation with an old man at the bar. The men talk for a couple of hours and before long the two men have almost drained the whiskey bottle. All the while, the storm has grown worse outside. The talk turns to the terrible weather.

“Look at the rain!” The man says, “it’s almost falling sideways because of the wind!”.

“Look at the wind whipping up the side of the cliff!” The old man replies “the rain is falling upwards! I bet if you were to jump off the cliff and catch the wind in your coat, you would come soaring back up to the bar”

The man laughs. 

“I’m serious, I’m trying it!” Said the old man “put your coat on! Let’s leave the stuff in our pockets here though so we don’t get weighed down. ”

So the two men go outside and peer over the cliff. It’s a long way down and the bottom of the cliff is littered with jagged rocks. 
“Are you sure you want to try this?” Said the man. 

“What have I got to lose?” The old man replied, and without another word he leaped from the cliff, and began hurtling towards his certain death below. 

The man looked away in horror, but when he opened his eyes, the old man was back at the top of the cliff. “That was crazy!”, the old man said “I’ve never felt so alive”

The man explained that he had closed his eyes and the old man agreed to go again. He leaped from the cliff in a beautiful swan dive, and sure enough, about half way down, he opened his coat, caught the wind, and drifted back to the top of the cliff. 

The man was amazed. He stepped forward towards the edge of the cliff and took another moment to collect his thoughts. 

“It’s easy” the old man said “the best feeling you’ve ever had”. 

The man summoned the rest of his Dutch courage, unzipped his coat, and leaped from the top of the cliff. He hurtled towards the ground, opened his coat and... turned into mush as he hit the jagged rocks at terminal velocity.

The old man turned back into the bar, reached over and pulled a five pound note out of the other man’s wallet, and flagged the bartender for another whiskey. 

The bartender poured his drink, placed it in front of him and said “you know, you’ve been a right prick since you retired superman!”",The bar on the cliff,53

So a man and his wife have a baby boy but the wife doesn’t survive the birth. The man is completely devastated and makes a promise to his late wife to raise their son to the best of his ability and give him everything he could ask for.  

The man has a good job and is able to provide a wonderful life for his son. 

Before the son’s 4th birthday, the man asked him what he wanted. The son spent a few minutes in thought and finally made a decision. The son wanted green ping pong balls... the man was confused but it also being the anniversary of his wife’s death he decided not to question it. The man searched every store in town and neighboring towns but is unable to find the green ping pong balls. Heartbroken, he decides to get his son the most expensive toy he could find. 

On the son’s birthday, he gives him the expensive toy but apologized as he couldn’t find the green ping pong balls. The son said, “it’s okay dad, I love the present you gave me”. 

The man and son continue to have a great life together and have a very strong bond but every year for the son’s birthday he asks for green ping pong balls but every year it’s the same story. No green ping pong balls but every year, the son is very appreciative of whatever he gets. 

When the son graduates high school with the highest GPA, the man couldn’t be more proud. He tells his son, “I’m so proud of you I’m gonna buy you whatever you want! Don’t worry about a price tag.” The son again pauses and thinks for a few minutes and then replies “I really want some green ping pong balls”. The man is confused again but decides to search even further out for the green ping pong balls but again finds nothing. He decides to buy his son a new car instead and the son loves it. 

The son eventually graduates from college and becomes a doctor and again the man couldn’t be more proud. The man offers to buy his son anything he wanted without regard to the price but again the son asks for the green ping pong balls. The man searches everywhere but can’t find a single green ping pong ball. Feeling devastated again, he decides to buy his son a mansion, which the son absolutely loves.

One day, while the man is at work, he receives that dreaded phone call. “Your son was in a car accident, you need to get here now!” 

The man rushes to his son’s death bed, where son thanks his dad for everything he did for him and tells him not to be sad, as he gave him a wonderful life. The man, in tears, says “I have to know something son... all these years, why the green ping pong balls?”

post,cu7mt1,2qh72,jokes,false,1566527436,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cu7mt1/at_sumbitch_can_drive/,self.jokes,,"  

A woman is driving down the highway alone in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night. As she’s driving down the highway she sees a man walking down the side of the road. She thinks to herself what a terrible idea it is to stop for hitch-hikers but given how desolate the area is she decides she cannot simply leave this man out here, in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night.

She slows down and pulls alongside him. She rolls down the passenger side window and asks if he needs a ride.

He turns toward her revealing that he is holding a cup in his right hand. He looks down, spits in the cup, looks back at her dead in the eyes and says “at sumbitch can driiiiive.”

Well this does not sit well with the woman but she simply cannot stand the thought of leaving the man out here on the side of the highway, in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night. So she reaches across her car, throws open the passenger door and tells the man to get in. Which he does.

So they get to driving down the highway. She starts asking him questions. “Who are you?” “Where you from?” “What are you doing walking down the side of the highway in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night?” 

Every time she asks a question he just looks down at his cup, spits into it, looks back at her dead in the eyes and says “at sumbitch can driiiiive.”

Well finally she is freaked out and within a couple miles sees a sign indicating there is a highway patrol station at the next exit. She exits the highway, turns right and pulls into the highway patrol parking lot.

The woman runs inside and tells the officer on duty everything that happened. She explains that she knows that she isn’t supposed to pick up hitchhikers but that she just could not stand the thought of leaving this man walking down the side of the highway, in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night.

The officer walks outside, opens the passenger door of the woman’s car and begins asking all the same questions: “Who are you?” “Where are you from?” and “What are you doing walking down the side of the highway, in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night?”

Every time the officer asks a question the man looks down, spits in his cup, looks back up at the officer and answers “at sumbitch can driiiiive.”

Finally the officer has had enough. He pulls the gun out of its holster, cocks the slide chambering a round, flips off the safety, points it directly at the man’s head and says “Look Buddy if you don’t start answering some of my questions I’m going to blow your head all over the interior of this car!”

And like that, BOOM that man just snaps out of it! He throws his hands up over his head, looks the officer right in the eyes and pleads for his life “Yes Sir! Anything you want to know I’ll be glad to tell ya! Just please don’t shoot me!”

So the officer says to him “Well you can start by telling me what you’re doing walking down the side of the highway, in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night?!?!?!”

The man says “Yessir! Absolutely! No Problem! It’s like this: Two days ago I was driving down the highway, minding my own business when my car broke down. So I walked a little ways with my thumb out and after about 30 minutes a trucker stops and told me to hop on in.

“Well we get to cruising down the highway 70, maybe 80 miles an hour and we come up over the crest of this hill and BAM! Right there in front of us is a 20 car pile-up! There is a 50 foot cliff wall to our right and a 100 foot shear dropoff to our left! I looked over at that truck driver and I told that man ‘Mister, if you can get us out of this one, I’ll suck your dick!’” 

The man looked down, spit in his cup, looked back up at the officer and said “at sumbitch can driiiiive.”

Not an edit. Just some reference: In 1999, when I was 19 years old, I signed up for a 5 year enlistment (airwing) in the United States Marine Corps. While in boot camp after lights out one night the guy in the rack next to mine told this joke. His (last) name was Coffelt and everyone within 2-3 racks, top and bottom listened intently. It was all we could do to keep from laughing hard enough to wake our Drill Instructor and have him fuck our lives up immeasurably in the sand pit. This joke being told that night is my fondest memory from my enlistment.",at Sumbitch Can Drive,2

People always reached their target weight within a month. But this required absolute obedience to the rules, and commitment to Martin Love's regime. To make sure people knew exactly what they were getting into, you had to memorize all the rules before you were even allowed to sign the contract.

Daniel and Jane had always been good friends of Martin, and so they thought they might get a bit of a discount, or that he wouldn't be quite as strict. But Martin still made all the same requirements and wouldn't give them the option to sign the commitment form until they had memorized the rules. This made them reconsider but they knew they wouldn't be able to get the same level of coaching from anyone else. 

As they were finally about to sign they had a last-minute debate on whether or not to go through with it. Daniel turned to his wife and said:

We're no strangers to Love

The bartender himself is confused, for not only is helium invisible to the naked eye in the absence of another object to contain it, should quickly dissipate. Furthermore, a cloud of helium, lacking any sort of motor system, is at the mercy of atmospheric currents and cannot enter a bar under its own power. It should not have been capable of opening the door to the bar. Even if it could, hypothetically, propel itself in such a manner, the lack of any semblance of a nervous system would make meaningful coordination difficult, if not impossible. And, if the cloud of helium has no nervous system, how can it think to enter a bar? How can it be self-conscious enough to know that it desires a drink? To question it is to question the nature of the self itself. What is the self? Is the self the physical body? But when the body is wounded, and, say, a limb is lost, the removed tissue is no longer considered part of the self. Is the self the consciousness? Yet nobody denies that an individual is no longer himself when he sleeps. Is the self a spiritual force, invisible and nebulous like the helium which provokes these questions? No scientific, empirical evidence of such exists; it is the domain of scholars, priests, and mortals who chase the shadows of the unknown. Who could say? It is a question that mankind has struggled to solve since the dawn of time without success.

The bartender is facing an existential crisis when he recalls the bar's policy towards noble gases and his psyche is once again put at ease. ""You're going to have to leave, we don't serve your kind here,"" he says, grunting at the mass of atoms.

She walks up and I take her order and she orders a Mocha Cream Frappuccino, her name is Sarah (Cerah is what I write on the cup) as I am feeling bold about it. As I am making her drink I just cant stop thinking about her and how hot she is so as I am off in my own little world of thought I am paying no attention the Mocha Cream Frappuccino I am making.

I hand her the drink and I glance into her eyes and I turn beet red, the cup is covered in syrup a total mess, the whipped cream is all over the rim, I am pretty sure I used 2% instead of skim...the list goes on and it is, easily, the worst drink that I have ever created since I started, but I did not care as I handed her drink over and our hands briefly touched.

Every morning, the bellringer walked up the tower and rang each of the towers 3 ascending bells, signaling the beginning of a new day. The town was known across the land for the beauty of the bells, and although many tried their hand at ringing the bells, no one was able to truly recreate the sound that the weathered bellringer created every morning.

One day, the bellringer passed away. The town was distraught; he had been ringing the bells every morning for decades, who would call in the day now? The head priest, after mourning, decided to put out an open invitation for anyone who wanted to be the new bellringer, with the only condition being that the priest approves of the sound that they created. People came from far and wide, all of them confident in their ability, but none succeeding. Day after day, the priest watched dozens of participants, and none of them were able to satisfy him.

2 weeks into the trial, the town was greeted with heavy rain. In turn, there were no participants walking into the church. As the priest was beginning to question if a replacement would ever be found, the doors of the church creaked open, and a single man walked in. But the priest couldn't help but stare oddly, as the man in front of him had no arms.

The man walked up to the priest. ""Father, I have traveled from a far away land, and I would be honored to take the test to become the new bellringer."" 

The priest was skeptical, but as a non-judgmental man, spoke to the man,""God accepts all participants my son. What is your name?""""My name is not important father, what does matter is my skill."" the man said confidently. Skeptical, the priest took the armless man up the stairs to the first bell. The man, with a look of confidence in his eye, walked up to the bell, took a deep breath, leaned back.... and swung forward, sending his forehead crashing into the bell.

The priest's concern for the man was immediately overtaken by awe, as the pristine sound of the bell rang through the air, just as it had for so many years. Stunned, the father looked at the armless man, who stared back with a grin on his face.

The priest was pleasantly surprised, but still skeptical. He guided the man to a second set of stairs that led up to the second bell. Because of the way the building was structured, the bell was at the end of a platform in the middle of the room. The armless man walked to the end of the platform, took a deep breath, leaned back.... and once again swung his forehead into the bell, and once again the priests ears were met with a heavenly ring. The sound has caught the attention of the townsfolk, who have begun to gather around the church. As if a sign from God himself, the rain had ceased, and the sky began to clear.

The priest is ecstatic. Finally, he had found  the man he had been looking for! However, the trial was not yet finished, and so he took the armless man up the third set of stairs to the third bell. The third bell, being the smallest of the three, was placed slightly higher off the end of the platform. Still, the armless man was determined. He walked to the end of the platform, took a deep breath, leaned back.... and completely missed the bell. Losing his balance, the man fell from the platform and tumbled down all 3 floors to the bottom of the tower. The priest, stunned, began to sprint down the stairs, praying for the mans safety.

By the time the priest had reached the bottom of the tower, the townspeople had gathered around the armless man, who lay motionless in the mud. The town doctor, who had been inspecting him, stood up slowly, shaking his head. Spotting the priest, the doctor walks up to him. ""It is unfortunate, but the man has passed on. Father, do you know who this man is?""

The priest, wiping the tears from his eyes, looked at the doctor. ""No doctor, I had just now met this man. However, his face does ring a bell""","Long ago, there was a small town.",2

He lost the shirt off his back, and had nothing left but a quarter and the second half of his round trip ticket. All he needed to do was somehow get to the airport, and then he'd be home-free.  
So he went out to the front of the casino where there was a cab waiting. He got in and explained his situation to the cabbie. He promised to send the driver money from home. He offered him his credit card numbers, his drivers license number, his address, etc...  
The cabbie said, ''If you don't have fifteen dollars, get the hell out of my cab!''  
So the businessman was forced to hitchhike to the airport and was barely in time to catch his flight.  
One year later the businessman, having worked long and hard to regain his financial success, returned to Laughlin and this time he won big. Feeling pretty good about himself, he went out to the front of the casino to get a cab ride back to the airport. Well who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs, but his old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck.  
The businessman thought for a moment about how he could make the guy pay for his lack of charity, and he hit on a plan.  
The businessman got in the first cab in the line, ''How much for a ride to the airport,'' he asked?  
''Fifteen bucks,'' came the reply.  
''And how much for you to give me a blowjob on the way?''  
''What?! Get the hell out of my cab.''  
The businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same questions, with the same result.

However the king's closest advisor insisted that the king divulge the secret behind this extremely rare specimen.

The advisor thought the king a fool to waste his wish and determined to find this magic hermit and demand riches. So with this in mind the advisor set into the woods and eventually found the old man in a state of zen under a 100 year old tree. The advisor dropped to his knees and begged the hermit to grant him a biggest bag of gold coins. The hermit considered for a moment, waved his staff and ordered the man to return to his home to find what he seeks. Needless to say, the advisor ran back to his house at top speed. 

Inside, he found a large sack full of the most worn out cheap metal coins one could find with total worth being less than what the advisor earned in a week. Feeling cheated he went to the king and told him the entire story ending with the large bag of old coins. The king gave a hearty laugh and said:

    **Complete each of the bar's** 
    **four IMPOSSIBLE challenges to win** 
    **a round of 10 drinks each!**
    
    Complete ALL four challenges at once and win...
    

    DRINKS FOR LIFE!!!

    Inquire within for details.

The drunk straightened up his nonexistent tie, licked his palm to slick back his hair, and walked right through the door, past the plethora of patrons, and straight up to the bar.

The bartender, who was busy cleaning glasses, took one look at the bum, and asked, ""So I take it you're here about the challenge?""

The bum nodded, hiccuped, and slurred out, ""Yesshuree, I shure am!""

The bartender rolled his eyes, then explained, ""Alright, each of the challenges nets you ten drinks. If you manage to do all four challenges before we close up for the night, you'll be swimming in more alcohol then you'll know what to do with. For the first challenge, you'll need to nail this railroad spike,"" as he picked up a 12-incher from behind the bar and placed it on the counter, ""into the sticking post in the men's room with any of the eggs from the pickle jar. Afterwards, you'll need to climb up to the rooftop of this building. From there, you'll have to piss into one of our shotglasses left on ground level and fill it up to the brim. Then, there's Rocky, the rottweiler in the yard out back. You'll need to pull the thorn out of his paw, and he doesn't much like strangers. Finally, you'll be going upstairs where you'll find my grandmother, this town's most insatiable, randy woman in the past sixty years. If you can give her the best fucking of her life, you'll win your prize.""

By this point, the entire bar establishment had gathered to see if the old coot will follow through with the challenges. With a smirk on his face, he immediately snatched up the railroad spike, reached barehanded into the pickle jar to yank out an egg, and marched straight into the lavatory, where he was followed by a few male patrons to witness the act. The restroom erupted with cheers, hollers, and hoots interspersed with the old man's ""goddammit""s, ""shiiiit""s, and ""ah fucking hell""s. Eventually a unified cheer erupted within the small area of the bar and the old man walked out with one egg-covered, bloody stump of a hand and a wide smile.

He marched back over to the bar, tapped the bartop, and said, ""My drinkssh, pleeash...""

The bartender poured out ten shots of the cheapest swill he carried and the drunk downed 'em as quickly as they were poured without crossing his eyes. He kept the final shotglass in hand as he made his way out the front door. A vast majority of the bar followed him out, starting up a rhythmic chant to keep him going. You could tell from within the bar that it must have been going well, since the rhythm of the chant picked up more and more after awhile and ended with another unified cheer.

The old drunk stumbled back in and, wordlessly, pointed his finger on top of the bar again. The bartender set up another ten shots and the drunk gulped down all ten. The entire bar was erupting with cheers at this point. The drunk then took a deep breath and barely kept himself upright as he veritably flopped out the back door, naturally followed by almost the entire bar at this point. However, once in the yard, instead of the usual cheers that occurred, there was a smattering of ""oooh""s and ""uuuuhhhh""s, interjected by occasional ""what the fuck""s. There could be heard, between the reactions of the crowd, the growls and snarls of a wild beast, followed by loud yelps and extremely loud whimpering. Eventually, hushed silence followed and some of the patrons preceded the stumbling, old drunk into the bar as they dove straight for the restrooms, covering the vomit in their mouths.

The drunk, now covered in scrapes, scratches, and abrasions, pointed to the bar again as the bartender already began lining up glasses and pouring shots for him to down. Once the last shot had been drank, and everyone was certain the old man wouldn't keel over or pass out, he managed to half speak, half belch...

But one day Horse gets a call “hey your mums sick” he comes over and visits her and she is all fine and healthy but then horse gets another call “your band members and producer were all flying in a plane and then the plane crashed”

WM: ""I'd like 2 pillows strapped to my back.""

Judge: ""Makes sense.""

2 pillows are then tied to the man's back and he receives 15 lashing before both the pillows have broken. He let's out a blood curdling scream each of the last 5 lashings before being dragged out. The native man then goes before the judge.

Judge: ""Where are you from?""

NM: ""I'm from Canada. I'm Native.""

Judge: ""You know, I've heard a lot about the native culture and I've always been interested to know if it's true that native people are as brave as I've heard. In fact, as it's my first time ever meeting a native person, I'm going to give you 2 requests. So what's your first?""

NM: ""I want 100 lashings.""

Judge: ""Well that certainly is very brave of you. What's your second request?""

NM: ""I want that white guy strapped to my back.""

tl:dr Native man wants 100 lashing and the white guy strapped to his back.

What makes it extra special is that the boars don’t live in a forest or meadow: they live in a large freshwater lake.

I’d only been there once or twice when I was a child, but 3 months ago I bought myself a bicycle in an effort to get fit. This reduced the journey time to only 12 minutes and 30 seconds and I started visiting *regularly*.

Watching the herds of hairy pigs frolicking in the crystal clear water I felt a spiritual connection, a deep bond between the fauna and their environment. I started to wonder if I could develop such a symbiosis in my own life.

I traveled to the lake every evening in my free time, staring at the scene for hours at a time. I was becoming obsessed. In order to understand the link between the boars and their lake home I was eating only boiled bacon for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If I ate them, perhaps I could become them, I thought. When my evening cycles to the waterfront no longer satisfied my lust for wet swine I simply stopped going to work, and would stand knee-deep in the water from dawn to dusk looking longingly at the animals and deeply inhaling the intoxicating smell of their shit beneath my feet.

Not long after this my girlfriend left me. She was already annoyed when I’d started calling her Miss Piggy in bed but the final straw came a few days later. She woke up at 4am and found me kneeling in the kitchen sink, overflowing with water, masturbating to the dramatic final act of Babe the Sheep-Pig, oinking wildly as I came.""

The woman quickly agrees, and throws her weight into the tree. She can't lift it much, as it's quite heavy, but she does manage to move it just barely enough for the frog to free himself. 

He dusts himself off. ""Thanks, lady! I really appreciate it!"" and he begins to hop away.

""Wait a minute!"" she shouts, ""What about my three wishes?""

""Ah, yes... well... you see..."" the frog hesitates, ""There's a small catch. You probably won't be interested anymore.""

""What is it?""

""Anything you wish for, your husband shall receive 10x or better. Sorry. I don't make the rules.""

The woman considers this, and then decides that this is acceptable.

""For my first wish, I want to be the most beautiful woman in the world!""

The frog looks at her. ""Listen,"" he says, ""I can make it happen, but your husband is going to be about ten times as handsome as you are beautiful. All of the women will swoon after him. He'll be bombarded with attention for the rest of his life, and that can lead to problems in your marriage.""

""It's fine,"" the woman says confidently, ""Because if I'm the most beautiful woman in the world, he will only have eyes for me.""

""Well... alright..."" and the frog snaps its little webby fingers and POOF! The woman runs to a nearby stream and looks at her reflection. She is a walking Aphrodite, absolutely gorgeous.

She turns back to the frog.

""For my second wish, I would like to be the richest woman in the world.""

The frog hesitates. ""Explain this one to me."" he says. ""Your husband will be ten times as rich as you are.""

""We are a team. A couple. What's mine is his and what's his is mine.""

The frog snaps his little froggy fingers and POOF. She pulls out her phone, opens her banking account, and watches as the money pours in.

But one last piece remained. He knew, as a scientist, that he needed to test his potentially dangerous contraption on humans. So he thought, '*This is what my wife is for, right? No matter what happens it's a win-win for me!'* He decided to test the machine on his son as well.  

He brought his apparatus with him and met with his wife and child downstairs. By putting the machine under the table prior to the meeting, he was sure they would remain unaware of his plans. He asked his son what he did that evening, fully aware of his son's lewd and yet so predictable nature. 

He proceeded to question.

""Son, can you tell me exactly what you did this evening?"" He needed not to observe his son's grotesque features, because he was confident that his contraption would serve him well.

""Well, Dad, I spent the evening reading in my room."" Surprisingly, the machine did nothing. Dr. Kupferberg was struck with surprise. Mostly due to the fact that his son might have took a day off from his heinous deeds. But then again, he thought, '*People do change.'* 

For the purpose of clarification, he decided he should ask one more question. 

""Son, what book did you read?""

""Uh, I read Sun Tzu's *The Art of War.*"" The son was quickly belted across the face. The father knew he had won. 

""Son, what did you really read?""

""Ok, ok, I read *Beauty Bombshells III:World War Asian!""*

He wasn't surprised, but he knew his son had to change. He decided this would be a good teaching moment.

""Son, how lewd of you! When I was your age when I saw someone else do this I would refer the child to a psychiatrist! I could only see this in movies and I would be sick to my stomach! I never did things like this!""

The machine slapped the father. While at a loss for words, he realized that he and his son were two peas in a pod. 

As he felt a sudden bout of love, his wife said happily, 

""He sure is your son!"" They laughed together.

The wife was soon slapped.",The Brilliant Scientist,6

""No worries, cap'n! It's all in good fun. You see, my twin brother works on your ship. His name is also Rex, as our parents only planned for one of us they said we had to share the name.

We are having a great time here at Camp Hazardous Hills. Grandpa is making me write to you in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away.  


Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Cousin Brian  when it happened. Oh yes, please call Brian's mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search &amp; rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.  


Scoutmaster got mad at Brian  for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Brian  said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas could blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did. Also, some of our clothes. cousin Dave is going to look weird until his hair grows back.  


We will be home on Saturday if Unclle Jim gets the car fixed. It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Uncle Jimsaid that a car that old you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think it's a neat car. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us.  


You were right, dad is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver. In fact, he is teaching stepmom cindy how to drive. But he only lets her drive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks.  


This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. grandpa wouldn't let me because I can't swim and Brian  was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so dad let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood. Grandpa isn't crabby like some geezers. He didn't even get mad about the life jackets.  


He has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble. Guess what? We have all passed our first aid merit badges. When David dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet works. Also aunt Liola and I threw up. Dad said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken.  


I have to go now. We are going into town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Don't worry about anything. We are fine.  


Love,  
Your son

Attn: IRS

Enclosed is my current tax return &amp; payment.

Please take note of the attached article from the USA Today  newspaper. In the article, you will see the Pentagon is paying $171.50  for hammers and NASA has paid $600.00 for a toilet seat.

Please find enclosed four toilet seats (value $2400) and six hammers (value $1029). This brings my total payment to $3429.00.

Please note the over-payment of $22.00 and apply it to the  ‘Presidential Election Fund,’ as noted on my return. Might I suggest  you the send the above mentioned fund a 1.5 inch screw.’ (See  attached article…HUD paid $22.00 for a 1.5 inch Phillips head screw.)

It has been a pleasure to pay my tax bill this year, and I look forward to paying it again next year.

Sincerely,

A satisfied taxpayer",Letter to the IRS,5

The first man still eating the apple replies, ""Order whatever you want, he'll hand you an apple that will taste like whatever you asked for"".


The man thinks for a moment and says, ""I'll have a rum and coke"". The bartender reaches under the counter, pulls out an apple, and replies, ""One rum and coke, enjoy"".


The guy takes a bite out of the apple, and like the first guy smiles, and says, ""that's the best rum I've ever had"". The bartender smiles and says, ""turn it around"". The man turns the apple around, and takes a bite and it tastes just like coke. He enjoys the rest of his apple, and orders a few more.


A little while later, a third guy walks in, sits down at the bar, looks at the two guys eating apples and says, ""What's with the apples"". The first guy tells him, ""Ask the bartender for anything you want, and he will hand you an apple that tastes exactly like what you asked for, I asked for a gin and tonic, this guy asked for a rum and coke"".


The guy thinks for a minute, smiles a devilish smile, and says, ""Do you have any pussy"". The bartender rolls his eyes and says, ""Really pussy"". The guy nods his head, and the bartender reaches under the bar and hands him an apple, the bartender goes back to cleaning some glasses. The man takes a bite out of his apple, and immediately spits the bite out saying, ""Ewww, gross, this apple tastes like shit"".

The Lab looks up and says, ""Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA. In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping.""

""I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running. But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.""

Finally, after weeks of searching, a promising cure was found - but it was not without its controversy. The highest of the clergy discussed at length about how to break the news to the ailing Pope.

They decided that the frank and honest truth would be the best way forward. Solemnly, they entered his bedchambers and approached the old man,

""Holy Father, we have found a cure for your affliction, but it comes at a great cost. We are afraid that the only way your life would be saved is for you to engage in sexual relations with a woman. Please believe us that if there was any other way to save you, it would have found it by now.""

The dying man closed his eyes, breathed a rasping sigh, and nodded.

""I understand my friends. Our lord truly does work in mysterious ways. He has provided this miracle - it is clear that He has plans for me yet and does not wish for me to enter His kingdom at this time."" After a long pause, he continued, ""if His will be done, and I am to lay with a woman then I have three requests.""

""Of course - anything you wish. You have only to ask,"" came the reply with a sigh of relief.

""First,"" said the Pope, ""the woman must be blind so that she may not see with whom she lays"".

""Yes, yes, discretion must be maintained"" the cardinals responded nodding.

""Second,"" said the Pope, ""the woman must also be deaf so that she may not hear and perhaps guess as to my identity"".

""Brilliant your Holiness,"" the cardinals agreed. ""And what, Father, is your third request?""

""Big tits""",The Pope was diagnosed with a mysterious terminal disease . . .,274

Still, the gentleman was too shy to speak to His Holiness.

Shortly after take-off, the Pope took a crossword puzzle out of his carry on bag and began penciling in the answers.

""This is fantastic!"" the gentleman mused. ""I'm really good at crosswords!""

It crossed his mind that if the Pope got stuck, he’d ask him for assistance.

The three Cardinals behind, in front of and beside him shrunk down in their seats, as far as possible, all looking for something on the floor.

The gentleman was in morbid shock.

He couldn’t breathe.

He went within himself, thought deeper, longer for a plausible answer and after almost a minute, the dark clouds of evil parted in his mind and the sun shone in.

Turning to the Pope, the gentleman said with reverence and politeness, ""I believe, Your Holiness, that you're looking for the word, 'aunt.'""

""Of course!"" the Pope mused, not taking his gaze off the crossword. ""You wouldn’t happen to have an eraser, would you?""","A guy was boarding a plane when he heard that the Pope was on the same flight. ""This is exciting!"" thought the gentleman.

She unzipped her top about six inches, revealing her beautiful skin, pulled out a flask of Jameson’s and asked, “ how long has it been since you tasted home?”
He cried out, “Oh tis the nectar of the Gods” and took a big swig.

She then unzipped her top further revealing her tanned, tight cleavage, pulled out a cigar and asked, ‘and how long has it been since you’ve had a good smoke?”
As she lit it, he took a long pull and sighed, ‘it reminds me of an evening overlooking the moor!’

At this point she noticed his tanned, hardened body-the time on the island had been *good* to this Irishman.
So she unzipped her top the rest of the way, revealing her nakedness and asked, “and when was the last time you played around?’

the priest didn't believe him and said I want the parrot anyways so he took the pair of home and once he got inside he sat down to watch some television.

Because it was summer and the priests did not have air conditioning it was sweltering inside the house and after a little bit of relaxation time if yours from his side, (Jesus it's hot.)

The priest thought he was hearing things but then he heard it again ( My balls are sweatim, Jesus it's hot)

The priest said Petey you can't say this, but the parrot kept going (Jesus it's hot. Motherfucker Im gonna die.)

Finally the priesthood had enough and he began swinging the parrot by his legs.

just pissed off for the priest even farther and so he placed his pet parrot in the freezer, after about 5 minutes he retrieved the parrot from the freezer and the parrot said.

One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve this perfect couple was driving along  a winding road when they noticed someone at the roadside in distress.  Being the perfect couple, they stopped to help.

There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to  disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple  loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle. Soon they were driving  along delivering the toys. Unfortunately, the driving conditions  deteriorated and the perfect couple and Santa Claus had an accident.

Question: Only one of them survived the accident. Who was the survivor?

Answer #1: A Woman’s Response: The perfect woman! She’s the only  one that really existed in the first place. Everyone knows there is no  Santa Claus and there is no such thing as a perfect man.

Answer #2: A Man’s Response: So, if there is no perfect man and no  Santa Claus, the perfect woman must have been driving. This explains why  there was a car accident in the first place.","The Perfect Man, the Perfect Woman, and Santa Claus",12
