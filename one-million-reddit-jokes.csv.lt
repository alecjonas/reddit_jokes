I’ve got a special game for you. I’ll do absolutely anything you want for £300 as long as you can say it in three words.’ The guy replies, ‘Hey, why not?’ He pulls his wallet out of his pocket and lays £300 on the bar, and says slowly. ‘Paint…my….house.’

China has a population of a billion people. One billion. That means even if you’re a one in a million kind of guy, there are still a thousand others exactly like you.

A guy dies and is sent to hell. Satan meets him, shows him doors to three rooms, and says he must choose one to spend eternity in. In the first room, people are standing in dirt up to their necks. The guy says, ‘No, let me see the next room.’ In the second room, people are standing in dirt up to their noses. Guy says no again. Finally Satan opens the third room. People are standing with dirt up to their knees, drinking coffee and eating pastries. The guy says, ‘I pick this room.’ Satan says Ok and starts to leave, and the guy wades in and starts pouring some coffee. On the way out Satan yells, ‘OK, coffee break’s over. Everyone back on your heads!’

Sid and Irv are business partners. They make a deal that whichever one dies first will contact the living one from the afterlife. So Irv dies. Sid doesn’t hear from him for about a year, figures there is no afterlife. Then one day he gets a call. It’s Irv. ‘So there is an afterlife! What’s it like?’ Sid asks. ‘Well, I sleep very late. I get up, have a big breakfast. Then I have sex, lots of sex. Then I go back to sleep, but I get up for lunch, have a big lunch. Have some more sex, take a nap. Huge dinner. More sex. Go to sleep and wake up the next day.’ ‘Oh, my God,’ says Sid. ‘So that’s what heaven is like?’ ‘Oh no,’ says Irv. ‘I’m not in heaven. I’m a bear in Yellowstone Park.’

A guy shows up late for work. The boss yells, ‘You should’ve been here at 8.30!’ He replies. ‘Why? What happened at 8.30?’

It’s the World Cup Final, and a man makes his way to his seat right next to the pitch. He sits down, noticing that the seat next to him is empty. He leans over and asks his neighbour if someone will be sitting there. ‘No,’ says the neighbour. ‘The seat is empty.’ ‘This is incredible,’ said the man. ‘Who in their right mind would have a seat like this for the Final and not use it?’ The neighbour says, ‘Well actually the seat belongs to me. I was supposed to come with my wife, but she passed away. This is the first World Cup Final we haven’t been to together since we got married.’ ‘Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that. That’s terrible….But couldn’t you find someone else, a friend, relative or even a neighbour to take her seat?’ The man shakes his head. ‘No,’ he says. ‘They’re all at the funeral.'

Three guys stranded on a desert island find a magic lantern containing a genie, who grants them each one wish. The first guy wishes he was off the island and back home. The second guy wishes the same. The third guy says: ‘I’m lonely. I wish my friends were back here.’",7 hilarious jokes,131

The first man instantly shouts “I wish I had a billion dollars!” The genie nods his head and when the man checks his account he sees his balance has increased by 1 billion. 
The second man thinks and says “I wish I was the richest man in the world” the genie nods and the mans bank account shows over tens of billions. 
The third man thinks even longer and asks “I wish my right arm would rotate clockwise” the genie nods and the mans arm starts to spin 

The first man again yells out “I wish I had a beautiful wife” and suddenly a gorgeous woman appears by his side. 
The second man thinks and says “I want to be charming, charismatic, irresistible to woman.” 
The genie nods and the first mans wife begins to flirt with the second man. 
The third man pauses, “i wish my left arm would rotate anti-clockwise” the genie nods and the mans arms now spin in opposite directions. 

The first man decides for his third wish “I want to be healthy forever” 
The second man “and I want to stay 29 and never age a day” 
The third man thinks for a long time and finally requests “I want my head to nod back and forth forever” 
The first two men start to look healthier. Acne and wrinkles clearing, aches and pains disappearing, while the third mans head starts to rock back and forth. 

Years after the encounter the three men meet up at a bar 

The first man says “I’ve invested my money, my family will never want for anything, my beautiful wife and I make love every day and I’ve not had so much as a cold since the last time we saw each other” 

The second man says “I’ve donated to hundreds of charities while staying one of the wealthiest men in the world. I’ve traveled and met many beautiful exotic women and still have the energy and looks of a young man”

Police received numerous calls in relation to a violent domestic, with reports of a woman screaming hysterically, a man yelling “I’m going to kill you, your dead! Die Die!!”, with the sounds of furniture being tossed around the unit. Numerous police cars responded to the address and began banging on the door. A man answered the door, out of breath and rather flushed with the following conversation:
Police: “Where’s your wife”
Male: “umm I don’t have one”
Police: “Where your girlfriend”
Male: “umm I don’t have one”
Police: “We had a report of a domestic and a women screaming, where is she?”
Male: “I don’t know what you’re talking about I live alone”
Police: “Come on mate people clearly heard you yelling you were going to kill her and furniture getting thrown around the unit”
At this point the male became very sheepish.
Police: “come on mate, what have you done to her.”
Male: “it was a spider”
Police “Sorry??”
Male: “It was a spider, a really big one!!
Police :”what about the women screaming?”
Male: “Yeah sorry that was me, I really really hate spiders”
As it turns out the male was chasing a rather large spider around the unit with a can or mortein. After a very long pause some laughter and a quick look in the unit to make sure there was no injured party (apart from the spider) we left.

Funny part is that this happened in real life",A man deals with a problem.,6

He grew up in a family of famous bakers and was extremely proficient in baking himself. As he grew, his baking skills improved exponentially until at one point he was famous throughout the region for his savoury breads and innovative cooking methods.

One day, Manchurian invaders attacked Wachu's quiet village and took control of it. The Manchurian warlord was tyrannical but also a drunkard and glutton. He had heard of Wachu's famous baking and gave him a challenge to complete in a week; he had to create a new type of bread that was mixed with alcohol for the warlord and his hungry soldiers or face execution. 

He tirelessly worked with his helper to create this new bread and on the day of the feast, he finally created the dough.

Immediately the overjoyed helper burst out of the kitchen shouting;

All of their lives they went around doing horrible things to people that ranged from Vandalism, Stealing, Battery, etc. One day one of the brothers dies and the other brother goes to the town preacher to arrange his funeral and asks him,

""For my brother's funeral can you do me one favor?""

""Sure, and what might that be?""

""I'll pay you $10,000 if you call my brother a saint."" 

The preacher agreed and word broke like wildfire in this small community that the preacher would be calling the worst person in the town's history a saint, so the day of the funeral came and people were lined out of the door to hear what the preacher was going to say. Once everyone had arrived the preacher started his speech

""Ladies and Gentlemen we are gathered here today to mourn upon the most wicked, the most hateful, and maybe the worst person i have ever met in my life, but compared to his brother that is sitting in front of me. He was a saint.""",My preacher started a sermon with this joke the other week that was actually pretty funny and i thought i would share it with you guys,371

However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.
a Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.
The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.
The scientific conclusion was that while all the lookout crows could say ""Cah"", none could say ""Lorry.""",WARNING TO ALL LORRY DRIVERS,8

“What’s this?” the boss asks.

“Have you no brain? Tree and tree plus tree makes 9” says Paddy.

“Fair enough,” says the boss. “Here’s your second question. Use the same rules, but this time the number is 99.”

Paddy stares into space for a while, then picks up the picture that he has just drawn and makes a smudge on each tree.. “Ere ye go.”

The boss scratches his head and says, “How on earth do you get that to represent 99?”

“Each of them trees is dirty now. So, it’s dirty tree, and dirty tree, plus dirty tree. Dat makes 99.”

The boss is getting worried that he’s going to actually have to hire Paddy, so he says, “All right, last question. Same rules again, but represent the number 100.”

Paddy stares into space some more, then he picks up the picture again and makes a little mark at the base of each tree and says, “Ere ye go. One hundred.”

The boss looks at the attempt. “You must be nuts if you think that represents a hundred!”
Paddy leans forward and points to the marks at the base of each tree and whispers,

Every year the old man inquired about the cost of ride. Every year $100 was the response from the operator.

Being a frugal old man he would look over at his aging wife and say ""I would take you up honey but you know - $100 is $100.""

This took place year after year after year. The operator got to know the frugal old couple and felt sorry for the little old lady. 

One year he finally said ""I tell ya what - I'll make you a deal. I'll take you up for free as long as you don't make a single sound. If you shriek or scream or even gasp then you pay me $100.""

They had a deal and the frugal old couple was sure they were about to get a free helicopter ride. 

Once in the operator pulled out all the stops. He dove and ducked and dodged the clouds. He pulled the craziest maneuvers known to helicopter enthusiasts. Rolls and loops and stops and gos. Not a sound from the back.  

Finally he gave up and landed the helicopter. He looked back at the little old lady and proclaimed ""I thought for sure I had you! I can't believe you didn't make a single sound!""

The little old lady, white as a ghost, looked up and said ""Well, to tell you the truth, I was going to say something when my husband fell out, but you know, $100 is $100.""",An old man and an old woman went on a vacation to Las Vegas every year...,54

is a simple informal test the husband could perform to give the doctor a better idea about her hearing loss.

Here's what you do,"" said the Doctor, ""stand about 40 feet away from her, and speak in a normal conversational speaking tone to see if she hears you.

If not, go to 30 feet, then 20 feet, and so on until you get a response.""

That evening, the wife is in the kitchen cooking dinner, and he was in the den. He says to himself, ""I'm about 40 feet away, let's see what happens.""

Then in a normal tone he asks, 'Honey, what's for dinner?""
No response..

So the husband moves closer to the kitchen, about 30 feet from his wife and repeats, ""Honey, what's for dinner?""
Still no response..

Next he moves into the dining room where he is about 20 feet from his wife and asks, ""Honey, what's for dinner?""
Again no response. So, he walks up to the kitchen door, about 10 feet away.. ""Honey, what's for

Again there is no response. So he walks right up behind her... ""Honey, what's for dinner?""

He knows his wife is always horny, so he decides to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn’t much like the idea of her screwing someone else.

So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.

“Well, I don’t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except a” said the old man, and then he stopped.

“Except what?” asked the businessman.

“Nothing, nothing,” said the old man.

“C’mon, tell me! I need something!” protested the businessman.“Well, sir, I don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘voodoo dildo,’” the old man said.

“The voodoo dildo?” the businessman asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, “Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!”

The old man said, “But you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.”

He pointed to a door and said “Voodoo dildo, the door.”

The voodoo dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, “Voodoo dildo, box!”

The voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.

The businessman said, “I’ll take it!”

The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, “Voodoo dildo, my pussy.”

He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.

After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said “Voodoo dildo, my pussy!” The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before.

After three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn’t been drinking, but that a voodoo dildo was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn’t stop screwing her.

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, “Yeah, right. Voodoo dildo, my ass!""

One day, as the driver was driving along, he saw a priest hitchhiking. He thought he would do a good turn and pulled the van over. He asked the Priest, ""Where are you going, Father?""

""I'm going to say mass at St. Joseph's church, about two miles down the road,"" replied the priest.

""No problem Father! I'll give you a lift. Climb in!""

The happy priest climbed into the passenger seat and the van continued down the road. Suddenly the driver saw a Manchester United fan walking down the road and instinctively swerved to hit him. But, just in time, he remembered the bloody priest, so at the last minute he swerved back to the road, narrowly missing the man.

However even though he was certain he missed the glory-hunting shite, he still heard a loud ""THUD."" Not understanding where the noise came from, he glanced in his mirrors and when he didn't see anything he turned to the priest and said

""I'm sorry Father, I almost hit that Manchester United fan,""

Wait, stop, she said, I’m Sleepy. 

Well high-ho, I thought; she’s doing a bit of role play. I thought I’d better get in character too. It wasn’t too much of a stretch for me to play some Happy. But she was playing a strong Sleepy character and kept rolling away. 

I started to give her a ‘medical examination’ like Doc, but she didn’t seem too into that. She was still playing Sleepy. My next idea was to to try getting all sneezy. I reached for the pepper. 

Well, being sneezed on got her moist, but in totally the wrong way. She kept up the Sleepy character and I switched to up to Bashful. 

Playing all coy really didn’t fit with her sleepy character because she didn’t react to it at all. She faked a few snores. 

I was getting tired and frustrated by the game at this point, because she hadn’t given me any clues on what ‘Sleepy’ really wanted. I used my genuine confusion to get into character as Dopey. My wife seemed to find the slapstick advances amusing, but she kept up the Sleepy act.

If he doesn't fuck all the hens, not only will I give you your $1000 back, I'll pay you $5000.""_

The farmer realizes that this is too good of a deal to pass up, so he decides to buy the rooster. When he brings it home, he sets it down in the barnyard and tells the rooster, _""Listen here. I have a lot of hens, but there is no hurry. My last rooster worked himself too hard and died. So just take it easy and do your thing.""_

The rooster is off like a bullet and he runs to the hen house and fucks every single hen. He dashes to the pond and fucks all the ducks. He's just a blur around the farmyard fucking every animal he can. The farmer is in awe at the rooster and says to himself, _""Wow, this really is the most amazing rooster ever!""_

The next morning, he wakes up and sees the rooster laying in the middle of the barnyard, stiff as a board, with buzzards circling over head. _""Oh no!""_ He yells and falls on his knees next to the rooster. _""Why did you overwork yourself so hard! I told you to take it easy!""_

The rooster opens one eye and points at the buzzards and whispers, _""Shhh, They're getting closer!""_

A disgusting old, wrinkly lady answers the door and asks them what they want.

“Our car broke down and we need to call a tow truck but we don’t have any reception. Can we please use your phone? the guys asks.”

Living by herself, the lady has been extremely horny and is really excited to see two young guys and decides to take advantage of the opportunity.

“I’ll let you use my phone but only if you stay the night and one of you agrees to have sex with me,” she says.

The guys gag at the thought given how old and disgusting she is but they don’t see any other option so they agree. After drawing staws, Steve loses. 

With a grin, the lady tells Steve he’ll be in bed with her and Jason can sleep out on the porch.

As the lights go out, Jason lays down on the porch feeling bad for Steve but knows it needs to be done to get home. After a little while he gets really hungry and starts looking around for some food. Just as he’s about to go pick some corn, he hears a thump as an ear of corn lands on the porch. It’s perfect temperature and loaded up with butter and a pinch of salt. Starving, he quickly devours it. Before he can finish, another piece lands on the porch like the one before it so he quickly eats that, too. This continues for a while until Jason is stuffed and passes out trying not to think about the suffering Steve must be enduring.

In the morning, Steve wakes Jason up and says, “come on, let’s get the hell out of here.” Jason is surprised to see Steve looking fine after what must have been a traumatic night in the old lady’s bed. Curious, he asks “how are you not more messed up? I’m not sure I could have made it through the night but you look completely fine.”

Steve says, “I was about to hurl when the lady started rubbing my body and talking dirty. I tried to think of something I could do to get out of it but knew that if I didn’t satisfy her we couldn’t get home. With one hand on her body, I frantically searched for something with the other and, thankfully, found a stack of corn near the bed. I grabbed one and pleasured her with it until it was hot and dripping wet then threw it out the window and grabbed another. I must have gone through 20 ears before she was finally satisfied!”",Steve and Jason have their car break down on a deserted country road. [NSFW],10

The Preacher quickly got a pen and paper and lovingly handed it to Marvin. But before he had a chance to read the note, Marvin died. The Preacher feeling that now wasn’t the right time to read it put the note in his jacket pocket. It was at the funeral while speaking that the Preacher suddenly remembered the note. Reaching deep into his pocket the Preacher said “and you know what, I suddenly remembered that right before Marvin died he handed me a note, and knowing Marvin I’m sure it was something inspiring that we can all gain from.

The rabbi listens to their story, strokes his beard, and makes the following suggestion: ""Hire a strapping young man. While the two of you are making love, have the young man wave a towel over you. That will help the wife fantasize and should bring on an orgasm."" They go home and follow the rabbi's advice. They hire a handsome young man and he waves a towel over them as they make love. But it doesn't help and she is still unsatisfied. Perplexed, they go back to the rabbi. ""Okay,"" says the rabbi, ""let's try it reversed-Have the young man make love to your wife and you wave the towel over them."" Once again, they follow the rabbi's advice. The young man gets into bed with the wife and the husband waves the towel. The young man gets to work with great enthusiasm and the wife soon has an enormous, room-shaking, screaming orgasm.

In order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to purchase a bull from the stockyard in a far town so that they can breed their own stock.

They only have $600 left. Upon leaving, the brunette tells her sister, 'When I get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home.'

The brunette arrives at the stockyard, inspects the bull, and decides she wants to buy it. The man tells her that he will sell it for $599, no less. After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news. She walks into the telegraph office and says, 'I want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pickup truck and drive out here so we can haul it home.'

The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then adds, 'It's just 99 cents a word.' Well, after paying for the bull, the brunette only has $1 left. She realizes that she'll only be able to send her sister one word.

After a few minutes of thinking, she nods and says, 'I want you to send her the word 'comfortable.' 

The operator shakes his head. 'How is she ever going to know that you want her to hitch the trailer to your pickup truck and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her just the word 'comfortable?' 

The brunette replies, “My sister’s blonde, she’s a slow reader.”
