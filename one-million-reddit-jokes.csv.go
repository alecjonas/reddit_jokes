""Our losses are precisely why we can't kill them all,"" said the second. ""The cost of this invasion was more than any of us could have predicted! We need to enslave them! Have them harvest their own planet for us so we can recoup our losses.""

Yet a third had another idea. ""We could transport them back home and sell them to the zoos! People would pay dearly to see these them"".

The first two vetoed the third. Shipping that number of people half way across the galaxy was too much, they must stay where they were, dead or alive.

This went on for several months with neither of the three able to convince the two. A compromise was finally reached - the humans would be enslaved, but public executions would take place first, to keep them in line. Some few would be taken home and sold to the zoos.

The alien leaders flew down to earth and arrived at the first of the compounds where the humans were being kept. They announced their plan to enslave the humans. As was expected, there was anger from the crowd. Several started shouting and making obscene gestures. Those were pointed out to the alien guards and brought to the front were they were executed in the most horrific way.

They flew to another camp and the process was repeated. Several humans raised their hands and haves them in obscene ways and those were executed, the rest enslaved.

They visited several camps and finally reached the last one, their task almost complete. They announced the plan one last time and again the humans raised their hands in anger. The alien leaders pointed them out one at a time.

""What's that one doing,"" said the first alien. ""He isn't shaking his fist list the others.""

""It almost looks like he's waving,"" said the second Alien.

""Let me see,"" said the third Alien. ""Wow! I don't believe it.""

""What?"" Asked the second Alien.

""It's Dave!""",Three aliens are discussing the fate of Earth.,14

He had a pretty hard day at work so he orders a double and something to eat. While he waits for his food, a handful of others come in looking as beleaguered as he feels. These new patrons sit down at nearby tables and place orders similar to that which the man made.

When the waitress returns from the bar she is followed by a man dressed in a gray military uniform with a swastika emblazoned on the arm. The nazi marches in step with the waitress as she delivers the drink orders to the man and the other patrons. They look at eachother quizzically while trying to avoid staring at the supposed nazi as he stand and salutes each time the waitress stops at a table and delivers a drink.

When the waitress and the nazi return to the kitchen, the man and the other patrons look at eachother, shrug, and hold their glasses up to eachother in recognition of their comradery in  the daily struggle that brought them all to this particular bar on this particular day.

After some time, the waitress returns with the food orders for the man and the other patrons. Once again, she is followed by the nazi, marching along behind her and saluting as she delivers the food and once again the men look at eachother, not sure how to react to this ridiculous sight. As the waitress delivers the man's food, he manages to shake his confusion long enough to order another drink.

Before digging in, the men briefly gesture to eachother indicating how odd it is to find a man in full nazi uniform following around a waitress. They then begin to eat in silence, each contemplating the drudgery they will face when they return to work tomorrow. 

Suddenly, the man, lost in thought, is surprised by the waitress delivering his drink and as was apparently usual, the nazi standing behind her saluting. As the waitress starts to leave the man says, ""Excuse me miss? Why does a nazi follow you around when you deliver food and drink to tables?"" The waitress turns, flashes him a sunny smile, and says, ""Oh, don't mind him, he's just following orders.""",A man walks into a bar ...,5

The three debate for months, with no real progression as such, until a post appears from a new user, claiming to be the purest, living descendant of Adam &amp; Eve. He further claims, that to those who truly believe, he will grant the secret to human evolution. 

All but the monk immediately dismiss the post as a hoax. But the monk, steadfast on his journey to the truth, replies. Over the course of a few week’s correspondence, the man is easily able to prove his claims with a completely unique DNA sample - not a single matchable geographical relative in existence!

Thereon, the world would learn that the Christian bible misinterpreted the ‘forbidden fruit’ story. Humans were allowed to eat as much of the fruit as they wanted... as long as it wasn’t fermented. Eve did however, still partake in the alcoholic beverage, and was poisoned with an inconceivable truth. 

However... the time had now indeed come, and for the right individual the fruit would not only unlock the ultimate truth, but also yield its power effortlessly. 

The forum post went viral and almost the whole world had camped out to try the fruit when the day finally came. Unfortunately, it came down to the monk to organise transport and accomodation etc. and in misreading the location, they had all instead, turned up in front of the local pub. 

The priest, the Rabbi and the monk walked into the bar, much to the bemusement of a grinning publican. “Is this some kind of joke?”. He asks.  “Well no” the Priest sincerely replies “we’re actually just here for the punch line”.

The Captain addressed the Company: “Men, reports are we’re out-numbered six to one. Do not get separated from the corps. It is imperative we succeed before dark.”

About four hours into the furious firefight, the Captain and his Company rounded into a ravine and came across the Australian lying in a shady spot, relaxing under his hat. 

“Soldier, *what* in hell do you think you are doing?”

The Aussie pushes back his hat, and says: “Well, Cap, it’s like this: I already got my six.”

Three Reasons I love this joke.

You can tell it in front a broad spectrum of ages, without being taken to task for telling a joke about beastiality.  

I like the euphemism “intimacy” but more to the point, I love the phrase “pillow talk” which in this case is kinda perfect.

He didn’t ask her out on the first week because that would be too soon. And he got sick on the second week. 
Week 3 he was about to ask her, but her friends joined the conversation and he ended up not asking. 

Finally, the week before prom he finally approached her, and asked her straight away if she’d like to go to the prom with him. Turns out she likes him! He couldn’t be happier! 

They make plans and he insists that he arranges everything. 
Now he needs to get three things for the  big day - flowers, limo, and a tux. 

He decides to start with the tux first as fitting could take a while. Calls the local tux rental place, turns out they have no more tuxes due to a recent  fire in their warehouse. The closest place that can rent him a tux is 60 miles away. 

He doesn’t drive yet and no one’s able to give him a ride, so decides to take a train. Gets to the station, there’s a huge line of high schoolers in front of the ticket machine. Waits about 15 minutes, finally gets his ticket JUST in time to get on the train as it was leaving!

Arrives at the station, needs to take a bus to the store, but there is again, a huge line of people queued for the bus he needs. After missing 2 busses he decides to get a cab. No issues there. As they’re driving up to the store, they see another huge line. He recognizes many of the people he saw on the train - they’re all here for the tuxes. He pays the cab driver and leaps out of the car to get in line as he sees the next bus arriving right behind them. 
After waiting in line for two hours, he finally gets the tux! It’s a perfect fit as well!

He gets home, the day is near the end so he decides to arrange the limo tomorrow.

First thing in the morning he starts calling limo serviced to realize most of them are already booked. He finally reached one where the agent said that they might have something, and asks him to hold, as there is a queue already. He stays on the phone for hours, the call gets dropped. He immediately calls back and the agent who picks up, apologizes, and says everyone’s gone to lunch. So he pleads with the agent and explains that he spent an entire day yesterday to just rent a tux. The agent decides to help him out, and books a limo for him, allowing him to skip some of the queue. Great!

2 days before prom, he decides to get the flowers early expecting lines, and right he was, as there were huge lines in front of all the flower shops. However, after waiting for again, hours, he gets the flowers! 

Everything is set!

Day of the prom, he meets his date, gives her the flowers, they get in the limo. Everything is going perfectly. 

They arrive at the ball room, to see a huge line due to the previous event running late. No worries! They’re enjoying each other’s company, talk about their favorite things, and after an hour or so get in. 

They’re about to get on the dance floor, his date asks him to get a refreshment as she’s quite thirsty from the wait.  He looks around to see what’s available, and sees a punch bowl on a table! And what’s more, there is no punch line.

On their way to get married, a young Catholic couple is involved in a fatal car accident. The couple find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. While waiting, they begin to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? When St. Peter showed up, they asked him.

St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.

The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.

'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'

'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'

St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.

'OH, COME ON!', St. Peter shouted, 'It took me three months to find a priest up here! Do you have any idea how long it'll take me to find a lawyer?

The situation looked hopeless to her-how could she possibly continue to feed her family now?  In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself. When the man awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head. Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself.  When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank. She said,”I’ve seen all and know the reason for your despair. But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, then I will restore your parents and the cow to you.” The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to get it up again.  So the mermaid drowned him in the river. Next the second oldest son woke up.  After discovering what had happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river. The mermaid said to him, “If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, then I will make everything right.” And while the son tried his best (seven times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him in the river. The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone.  He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in. And there he also met the mermaid. “I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row.” The young son replied, “Is that all? Why not twenty times in a row?” The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request. Then he said, “Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?” And even as she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said, “Why not THIRTY times in a row?” Finally, she said, “Enough!! Okay, if you will have sex with me thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to perfect health.” Then the young son asked, “Wait!

A field biologist excitedly rushes in to his general, and exclaims, “Sir, incredible news! We have discovered a strange, silicon-based form of life in the snow. At first we thought they were just ordinary stones scattered over the snow. But upon further study we have determined they are a very ancient form of life! Not only that, these stones are mobile, and can communicate! At first we thought they were all extinct, but some are still alive, and occasionally will go rolling over the snow, kind of like they are going on a tour! And every time they do this, they emit a high pitched singing noise. We have analyzed the sound, and it appears they are telling their buddies that they are not satisfied with their current patch of snow, and are going to look for some better snow!

The General exclaims, “That is absolutely amazing news! I will have to brief the President immediately! Now, as you know, our president likes his briefings very short and to the point. So how would you summarize your findings?”

The biologist thinks for a minute, then says, “Well, you could tell him that the rolling stones are still alive, and every time they go on a tour, they sing, I can’t get snow satisfaction!” ",Our new Space Force is exploring mars,4

Here's the joke I told:

Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.""

One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

Twas the night before Christmas and all through the web
The president was tweeting as the market went red
The government was closed because of a wall
In hopes that Mexico, would pay for it all

The people were nestled, their head in their hands
While visions of tan resignations dance cross the land
And Mama in Lululemons and I with my vape
Had just wrapped our brains around a tweet filled with hate

When out of the phone there arose such a clatter 
I sprang from the bed to read what was the matter
Away to the screen I flew like a flash
Tore open my pack, packed with, pot, pipes, and, hash

The Moonshine abreast to my lips with such grace
Gives me relief for the tweets I must face 
What! Where my horrified eyes now linger 
But a misspelled tweet typed with ten tiny fingers. 

With his little old finger, so tiny and thick
I knew from that moment that I would be sick
More vile than villain with lies he explains
And he whistled, and shouted and called them by name

It’s Clinton! It’s Feinstein!!! It’s Petraeus and Cohen!!!!!!
Blame Mueller!! Blame Schumer!!!Blame Obama!!!! Not Putin!!!!!!
All alone in his office all alone for the wall
“Mexico’s cash! Mexico’s cash!” Individual one said, “they’re going to pay for it all”

""The penthouse is free for tonight"", said the old man, reaching for the penthouse keys on the hook. ""But I must ask you to not touch the gorilla"", he adds quickly, handing the man the keys, ""You will be alright as long as you do NOT touch him"".


The man thinks this is odd, thanks the old man and heads towards the elevator before noticing the out of order sign on the door. The man sighs and heads for the door marked stairs.


He enters the door and climbs the first flight of stairs. When he gets to the first floor landing there is a massive pit of snakes in the floor. The man quickly runs back down the stairs to the ground floor and rings the bell on the reception desk. Once the old man appears he says, ""What the hell!? There's a snake pit in the stairwell!""


""Of course"", says the old man casually.


""Well how am I supposed to get to my room?""


""There is a plank that goes across the snake pit close to the wall that will help you get across safely.""


So the man heads back up the stairs and sure enough, like the old man had said, there was a sturdy looking plank across the pit which the man used and easily crossed the snake pit. He continued climbing and on the building's second floor landing, where there should have been floor was now a large pond with alligator heads floating on the surface.


The the man goes back down the second flight of stairs, across the plank over the snake pit, down the first flight of stairs and back to the reception where he rings the bell again. Again the old man appears and he confronts him again.


""There's a bunch of gators in my way on the second floor!"" He yells at the old man.


""You didn't see the stepping stones?""


""What stepping stones?"" Says the man, now very tired and stressed.


""There are red stepping stones in the pond that we have trained the alligators to go nowhere near allowing you to cross.""


So the man heads upstairs a third time, across the plank of wood, up the next flight of stairs and when he reaches the alligator pond, sure enough, large red stepping stones span the length of the pond. The man steps across cautiously and sure enough the alligators do not attack. The man climbs the third set of stairs.


ROAR!!!


On the 3rd floor landing is another pit filled with huge lions. The man looks left and right but does not see anywhere to step on to get across.


The man heads down the third flight of stairs, across the stepping stones to avoid the alligators, down the second flight of stairs, across the plank to avoid the snakes, down the first flight of stairs, runs to the reception desk and rings the bell. The old man comes out once more.


""The lions..."" Begins the man, panting from exhaustion.


The old man cuts him off and simply says ""Swing on the rope against the wall"" and walks off.


The man catches his breath, gets up his nerves and begins his ascent up the first set of stairs, across the plank, up the second set of stairs, across the stepping stones, up the third set of stairs, notices the rope and without hesitation swings across safely.


He climbs the forth and final set of stairs and opens the door. He finally reached his room. The room is beautiful; clean, brightly colored, well furnished. The man is admiring the room when he spies in the corner of the room an enormous and monstrous gorilla. The man freezes in terror. Soft, heavy breaths are coming from the gorilla and the man soon realises it is asleep. He carefully and quietly makes his way across the room to the bed to try to finally get some sleep but is too scared by the presence of the gorilla and stays up half of the night.


Eventually the man has had enough and his curiosity overwhelms him; he must touch the gorilla. Slowly he moves over to the gorilla. Once close enough he reaches out a finger and lightly taps the gorilla on its arm.


Immediately the gorillas eyes shoot open; blood red and angry. It's nostrils flair and it lets out a humongous roar. The man flees.


He runs down the forth set of stairs - the gorilla breaks open the door. He swings across the lion pit and heads down the third set of stairs - the gorilla swings across quickly, making the lions cower in the process. The man steps across the stepping stones and descends the second lot of stairs - the gorilla smashes across the stones, cracking them with each step. The man crosses the planks and heads down the first flight of stairs - the gorilla leaps over the snake pit in a single leap.


The man slams the stairway door shut and runs to the reception. No one answers when he rings the bell. He runs to the front door and begins to shake it but it won't budge. He drops to the floor as the gorilla bursts through the stairway door.


The gorilla comes bounding over, closer and closer. He gets close to the man, reaches out his arm, pokes him in the shoulder and says ""Tag, you're it.""","A man is walking around, late at night, in the rain looking for a hotel to stay at.",14

post,a9jq96,2qh72,jokes,false,1545783510,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/a9jq96/the_bricked_camel/,self.jokes,,"In the desert, a traveller approached a camel merchant. He wants to buy a camel with enough strength and endurance that would take him 15 days through the desert. The merchant only had three camels:

The first one was a pretty small camel, that, according to the merchant, could last 4 days without water, and had a decent price.

The second one was strong and big, and, according to the merchant, could last 10 days without water, but the price was three times as much as the first, a little expensive but affordable.

The third one was really strong, enormous, and was overall a pretty impressive camel, and you could see, by looking at its eyes, that it was made to endure long journeys in the blazing sun of the vast desert, and, according to the merchant, it lasted at least 25 days without water, but it wouldn't be surprising if it lasted more, but the price was three times as expensive as the second, quite expensive, and it would actually be painful for the wallet to buy it, no matter how spectacular the camel was.

As the traveller started to ponder if it was really a good idea to buy the third camel, since it seemed to be his only option, even though he knew he would never be on a 25 day journey through the desert, specially since he would be paying such a high price, the merchant continued with his deal:

-Sir, I can also brick the camels, but you'll have to pay extra, which is a third of the price added to the base price.

-Brick the camels?

-Yes, sir. They last longer that way.

-How long?

-Well, it depends. The first will last 2 extra days, which means it will last 6 days. The second will last 5 extra days, which means it will last 15 days. The third will last about 13 extra days, which means it may last about 38 days, but I'm sure you can push him further. In fact, the third one, when bricked, is the ideal camel for travellers, specially for travellers like you. 

The traveller didn't need to think much to accept, although reluctantly, the bricked second camel, attracted to the perfect 15 days endurance, hoping that he wasn't getting ripped off by the merchant.

-So how?

-You'll see soon, sir. You just need to pay up now. And I promise that, until you haven't left with the camel, you can demand your money back.

The traveller paid, still untrustful, and the merchant ""unparked"" the camel and led it to a large water bucket. The camel started drinking. Meanwhile, the merchant went to fetch two bricks. As the camel was having his last gulps, the merchant approached the animal from the back, and as soon as it began to lift its head, the merchant, with a brick in each hand like he was holding two cymbals, leaned a little closer, and SLAMMED the bricks when the target was between them. In reaction to the intense and sharp testicular pain, the camel sucked all the water that he couldn't drink otherwise.

And that's how the traveller's camel had enough water to last 15 days through the desert.",The bricked camel.,2

In letters, the Czech mentioned he always wanted to see Alaska, so they arrange for him to come for a visit over the Christmas break.

While he's there the Alaskan takes him for a hike through the woods. Suddenly, a huge angry bear pops out of nowhere. The hams run but the visitor is too slow and the bear catches him and eats him (as bears are so prone to do).

When the local guy gets to town, he goes to the Sheriff to report what happened and they decide they'll need to investigate it to avoid an international incident. He sends some deputies out with tranquilizer guns and they come back with two bears -- a male and a female.

The Sheriff asks him if he can tell which bear attacked them. The lawyer says, ""I'd know him anywhere! That's him!"" and points to the male.

The Sheriff shakes his head no and directs the vet to kill the female and gut her. When he does, they find the remains of the visiting man.

The vet was talking to the Sheriff later and said, ""How did you know he was wrong?""

The Sheriff said, ""You never trust a lawyer when he tells you the Czech is in the male.""",A Holiday Story,21
