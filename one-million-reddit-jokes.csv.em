After doing done calculations, he comes to find that he will need exactly 999 bricks. With his new information, he heads to the local hardware store to order a pallet of 999 bricks. Unfortunately, the manager said they only supply pallets of 1,000 bricks. After a bit of back and forth discussion, and a bit of reluctance, he agrees to buy the 1,000 brick pallet.

Two days later, the pallet of bricks arrive, and he sets the one extra brick on his desk.

After a few more days, the extension is built, and sure enough, he has that one brick left over. Out of pure frustration, he takes the brick outside and throws it into the air as hard as he can.





(Best to wait a few minutes or until the audience is distracted before starting 2nd part.)








A man and a woman are boarding a plane. The man has a cigar, and the woman has a cat. The man spots the woman on the other side of the terminal, and thinks ""I hope I don't have to sit next to her, I hate cats!"" Meanwhile, the woman spots the man, and thinks to herself ""I sure hope I don't have to sit next to him, I can't stand cigars!""

Surely enough, they are seated right next to each other. They begin arguing over what to do with the cigar and cat, both of them equally stubborn.

The flight attendant eventually comes over after hearing the commotion, and suggests throwing both the cigar and the cat out of the plane. They actually think this is a decent idea, so they agree and throw the cat and cigar out of the plane.

Now that the car and cigar were taken care of, the man and woman start really hitting it off. By the end of the flight, they are decent friends. As they are walking off the plane at the end of their flight, the woman notices something.

It's her cat! Her cat was stuck to the wing of the plane when they landed, and something was in its mouth.







The brick.","A joke my dad told me years ago, about a perfectionist.",4

So France gathered a band of soldiers and rode into a small town in Rhineland on trucks, hoping to find anything valuable as reparation. After inspecting the town for a brief moment, they took its tram tracks and street lamps back to France and smelt them for metal.

A week later, Germany failed her weekly payment again. So the French returned to the same town, planing to take its church bell this time. When they arrived in the town, they found that the street lamps they took away a week ago has magically reappeared. Not giving up free property, the French soldiers took the church bell as planned and the street lamps as a bonus.

Another week had passed, Germany still could't pay her reparations. So the French returned to the same place for the same job. Upon the arrival, and to their astonishment, the street lamps were standing there again. The French commander was determined to find out where the hell did the lamps came from, so he ordered his men to bring the street lamps back to France, while he stayed in the town and try to find out how the lamps managed to reappear after they took them every week.

After a long and boring wait, the French commander saw a truck carrying dozens of lamp posts on its cargo bed. The truck stopped, and an old man stepped out of it, operating the truck mounted crane. He skillfully lifted a lamp post with the crane, and planted it into a slot on the ground, where the lamp should be. 

The French commander approached the old man and asked: ""What is the meaning of this? Don't you know we will just take them away next week?

The old man answered: ""Yes officer, I know it perfectly well."" And after a brief pause, he continued.  ""You see, I'm actually a chemist, and I've helped with development of chlorine gas. The pain and suffering I've caused is too great, so I have to do something to atone it.""

""Ahh, I see."" Replied the French commander. ""But why just replace the lamp posts? Why not the tram tracks? Why not the church bell?

The old man then replied: ""Because reposting gains the most karma.""

Standing in line at the pearly gates, the 1st Nun takes her turn with St. Peter, who asks only one question before she is allowed through. 

**St.Peter** : "" My Child, since you are a woman of God,  I trust your faith and ask only a simply question - have you kept your vow of celibacy and/or ever had any sexual interactions with a man?""

1st Nun: "" Yes, my Lord - I have kept my vows - but do admit that this one time I did see a see a man's penis. Am I still okay to come to heaven? "" she asks..  

**St.Peter** : "" Well that's not too bad - just go over there and wash your eyes with some holy water - then step right through"" 

The 2nd Nun takes her turn and St. Peter asks the same question.

She replies "" Yes my lord - I have kept my vows - but one time in my 20s, I was persuaded to touch a man's penis. It was a dare. I was young and you know how those things go"" Am I still okay to come to heaven ?  

**St.Peter**: ""Well geesh .. that is a walking a tight line there Missy ... have we not taught you about temptation .... but fine .. just go over there and wash your hands in the holy water then step right through"".

While all this is going on he can not help but notice the remaining 2 nuns jostling for position in line, pulling each other's hair and arguing who should be going next.

**St.Peter** : "" Ladies, Ladies ... what is happening - This is the heaven - Its supposed to be peaceful and full of love... why are you arguing ? "" 

Finally, the 4th nun says "" Well if you think I am going to gargle after she washes her ass in that holy water "" .....",4 Nuns are on their way to a conference,11

A man was getting a haircut prior to a trip to Rome. 
He mentioned the trip to the barber who responded, ""Rome? Why would anyone want to go there? It's crowded and dirty. You're crazy to go to Rome. So, how are you getting there?""

""We're taking American Airlines,"" was the reply. ""We got a great rate!""

""American Airlines?"" exclaimed the barber. ""That's a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late. So, where are you staying in Rome?""

""We'll be at the downtown International Marriott.""

""That dump! That's the worst hotel in the city. The rooms are small, the service is poor and they're overpriced. So, whatcha doing when you get there?""

""We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope.""

""That's rich,"" laughed the barber. ""You and a million other people trying to see him. You'll be at the back of St Peter's Square and from that distance he'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it.""


A month later, the man again came in for his regular haircut. The barber asked him about his trip to Rome.

""It was wonderful,"" explained the man. ""Not only were we on time in one of American Airlines's brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful 28 year old stewardess who waited on me hand and foot.
 And the hotel was great! They'd just finished a $25 million remodeling job and now it's the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge!""

""Well,"" muttered the barber, ""I know you didn't get to see the Pope.""

""Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the pope would personally greet me. 
Sure enough, five minutes later the pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down as he spoke a few words to me.""

""Really?"" asked the Barber. ""What'd he say?""

He said, ""Son. I've visited lands far and wide and met many people of all creeds. I've waved to millions of people from my balcony. I've personally shook the hand of millions of people, but you must have the worst barber of them all.""",The Haircut,288

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephant's foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.

The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn't the same elephant.",Heartwarming story of a man and an elephant,9

Makes the front page of the local paper every year, since there's not much else going on.  That part tickles the farmer the most, and he clips out each article and hangs it on the wall in his living room.

&amp;#x200B;

The old farmer knows that the secret to growing giant pumpkins is really good fertilizer, so one year at the beginning of pumpkin season as he's bumping down an old dirt road he's excited to see a big pile of manure sitting by the side of the road.  Perfect pumpkin growing stuff.  He goes home and takes care of the chores and heads out the next day with his truck and a shovel to get some of that brown gold, but to his disappointment there is now a big NO TRESPASSING sign hung up right by the manure.  Well the farmer is no lawbreaker, so he goes home empty handed.

&amp;#x200B;

The next week the farmer happens to be driving down the road again, and lo and behold the big pile of manure is still there but the sign is gone.  He heads home intending to grab a shovel and get right back out there, but when he gets back to the farm the pigs are out and the cows need feeding and the next thing he knows it's dark.  At daybreak the next day he rushes back out with his shovel, only to find the big NO TRESPASSING sign right back up.

&amp;#x200B;

The following week the same thing happens again.  Perplexed and frustrated, the farmer stops into town for a cup of joe and starts up a conversation with the man at the counter next to him about the odd situation.  

&amp;#x200B;

""Heck,"" says the man.  ""That's my place.  I only hang up the NO TRESPASSING sign when I go out because sometimes the GPS routes out-of-towners down my road and I don't want them down there mucking around if I'm not there.  But you're welcome to the manure; I just haven't gotten around to finding anyone to haul it off.  I'll even help you get it on your truck.""

&amp;#x200B;

The farmer quickly paid his check and the two drove out there.  The farmer got of the truck and his face fell.  He poked the manure pile a few times with his shovel, but just as he feared, the weeks out in the warm sun had dried it up too much to be the type of fertilizer that would produce a champion pumpkin.

&amp;#x200B;

""What's the matter?""  Says the man.  ""I thought you wanted this manure.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Naw,"" says the farmer.  ""This shit's been reposted way too many times to land me on the front page.""",An old farmer is known across the state for his giant pumpkins.,8

But I'm giving all of you a second chance, prove me wrong and I will drag you back to Hell!"".  Just like that the sodomizer, alcoholic, businessman and drug addict are teleported back to Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

The thief nervously stutters, ""I don't want to go back there, maybe it's time we really changed the way we thought and lived our lives"". The Alcoholic however spots a Liquor store across the street and quips ""One last drink and I'll call it quits!"". The drug addict spots his usual supplier near the store and agrees, ""You're right mate, one last hit and I'm gonna be a clean man"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Before the thief could say another word, the alcoholic and the addict run across the street to get their fix on. In what seems like a simultaneous moment, as soon as the alcoholic takes a swig from his glass and the addict a puff from his spliff, they're incinerated and swallowed whole into the ground. The mere sight of this is a shock to nearby witnesses and sends a chill down the thief's spine. The surviving two carry on, vowing to be better versions of themselves and look for a place to get some food after their ordeal.

&amp;#x200B;

On the way towards a popular Deli, they realize they both do not have any cash on them and come across a Homeless man who's drunk and fast asleep. The thief contemplates relieving the guy of a couple of dollars, just enough to get them both a couple of Burgers, but is conflicted due to the horrific consequence that the other two faced. The sodomizer whispers pats the thief on his shoulder and reaffirms that they won't face the same judgement. ""We're only borrowing a couple of dollars, I'll put it back tomorrow after I've gone home"". The thief gives in, his hunger clouding his judgement, he bends down to pick up a 10 dollar bill from the homeless man's cup. In the next instant, both the thief and the sodomizer are incinerated and dragged to hell.","A sodomizer, an alcoholic, a thief and a drug addict await judgment in Hell...",4

The second guy asks for two pillows to be tied up on his back, which get torn up after 20 whips and so he has to suffer 30 whips

""And tie both these guys on my back"".

'I don't like it' and throws it out the window. The second friend has a watermelon. He takes a bite out of it and says, 

'I don't like it' and throws it out the window. The third friend has a grenade. He takes a bite and says, 

'NaNi what is this?? I don't like it' and throws it out the window. 

&amp;#x200B;

The plane lands and as the three friends get out, they see a girl crying.

'What's wrong?' they ask the girl.

The girl replies, 'An apple fell on my cat and it died.'

Then they see a boy crying.

'What's wrong?' they ask the boy.

The boy replies, 'A watermelon fell on my dog and it died.'

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, they see a girl laughing.

'What's so funny?' they ask her.

The girl says, ' A farted at a building and it blew up xD!'

The policy would go into effect at noon the next day.

So, the next day at 12:01 the first person came to the gates of Heaven.

The Angel at the gate, remembering the new policy, promptly asked the man, ""Before I let you in, I need you to tell me how your day was going when you died.""

""No Problem,"" the man said. ""I came home to my 25th-floor apartment on my lunch hour and caught my wife having an affair, but her lover was nowhere in sight. 

I immediately began searching for him.  Just as I was about to give up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips! The nerve of that guy!

I ran out onto the balcony and stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But wouldn't you know it, he landed in some trees and bushes that broke his fall and he didn't die.

 In a rage, the first thing I thought of was the refrigerator. I pushed it out onto the balcony and tipped it over the side. It plummeted 25 stories and crushed him! The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.""

The Angel sat back and thought a moment. Technically, the guy did have a bad day. It was a crime of passion. So, the Angel announced, ""OK, sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,"" and let him in.

A few seconds later the next guy came up. ""Hi there. Before I can let you in, I need to hear about what your day was like when you died.""

The guy sighs and says: ""No problem. But you're not going to believe this. I was on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises. I had been under a lot of pressure so I was really pushing hard to relieve my stress. I guess I got a little carried away, slipped, and accidentally fell over the side! Luckily, I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine. 

Then this crazy man comes running out of his apartment, starts cussing, and stomps on my fingers. Well, of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes at the bottom, which broke my fall, so I didn't die right away. As I'm lying there face up on the ground, unable to move and in excruciating pain, I see this guy push his refrigerator, of all things, off the balcony. It falls 25 floors and lands on top of me, killing me instantly.""

The Angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. ""I could get used to this new policy,"" he thinks to himself. ""very well,"" the Angel announces.  ""Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,"" and he lets him enter.

A few seconds later, a third guy comes up to the gate. Finally he says, ""And what was YOUR day like?""

The guy says, ""OK, picture this. I'm naked, inside a refrigerator...""","It was getting a little crowded in Heaven, so God decided to change the admittance policy.",603

Donald Trump meets with the Queen. He asks her, ""Your Majesty, how do you run such an efficient government? Are there any tips you can give to me?""

""Well,"" says the Queen, ""the most important thing is to surround yourself with intelligent people.""

Trump frowns. ""But how do I know the people around me are really intelligent?""

The Queen takes a sip of tea. ""Oh, that's easy. You just ask them to answer an intelligence riddle.""

The Queen pushes a button on her intercom. ""Please send Theresa May in here, would you?""

Theresa May walks into the room. ""Yes, your majesty?""

The Queen smiles. ""Answer me this, please, Theresa. Your mother and father have a child. It is not your brother and it is not your sister. Who is it?""

Without pausing for a moment, Theresa answers, ""That would be me.""

""Yes! Very good,"" says the Queen.

Back at the White House, Trump asks to speak with Vice President Mike Pence.

""Mike, answer this for me. Your mother and father have a child. It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is it?""

""I'm not sure,"" says the Vice President. ""Let me get back to you on that one.""

Mike Pence goes to his advisers and asks every one, but none can give him an answer. Finally, he ends up in the men's room and recognizes General McMasters' shoes in the next stall.

Mike shouts, ""General! Can you answer this for me? Your mother and your father have a child and it's not your brother or your sister. Who is it?

General McMaster yells back, ""That's easy. It's me!""

Mike Pence smiles. ""Thanks!"" and goes back to the Oval Office to speak with Trump.

""Say, I did some research and I have the answer to that riddle. It's General McMaster.""

Trump gets up, stomps over to Mike Pence, and angrily yells into his face, ""No, you idiot! It's Theresa May!""",A Donald Trump Joke,5

These crows recognized that when lights were green, cars could go and when they were red, cars would stop. Using this knowledge, the crows would put nuts on the crosswalk so that during a green light, they'd be run over by cars and their shells cracked for the crows, to be collected at a red light. Or so it seemed.

Unfortunately, despite showing signs of understanding the signals, a lot of crows were dying, being bludgeoned to death. Upon examination, they discovered that the crows were specifically only being hit by large vehicles. This fascinated our professors.

As a result, the professors setup cameras to monitor the actions of the crows. What they discovered was that the crows actually had a lookout crow who was signalling to the other crows when cars were coming and when they were not. 

After a lot of monitoring and research, the professors discovered that it was a lack of adequate crow-to-crow communication that was causing the crows to be killed by larger vehicles. As it turned out, the crows could only say ""Caw! Caw!"" and couldn't say ""Truck! Truck!""",Intelligent Crows,57

Ashley said, ""My father's a farmer and we have a lot of egg-laying hens. One time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of the car when we hit a big bump in the road and all the eggs went flying and broke and made a mess.""

""What's the moral of the story?"" asked the teacher.

""Don't put all your eggs in one basket!""

""Very good,"" said the teacher.

Next little Sarah raised her hand and said, ""Our family are farmers too. But we raise chickens for the meat market. We had a dozen eggs one time, but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks, and the moral to this story is, 'don't count your chickens before they're hatched.'""

She shot fifteen of them with the gun until she ran out of bullets, killed four more with the knife, 'til the blade broke and then she killed the last one with her bare hands.""

September 23rd. Just after lunch, central standard time.


Three Neanderthals- Ogg, Grunk, and Louie were hunting mammoths and discussing the new sport that was taking the caves by storm. Ogg was filling the other two in on the details of the game, as they did not have DVR at the time, and in those days, most folks didn't know how to set their VCRs to record at a specific time.


Ogg - ""...so Nuknuk snap the egg and pass to Krodd. Krodd make break for endzone, but great winged monster come down from sky and carry him away, and him drop it before he can score.""

Grunk - ""Mmm. What happen, then?""

Ogg - ""What mean? He fumble. It turnover.""


Louie, known to be sort of the tribe grump, was thoroughly unimpressed with the game Ogg described.


Louie - ""Hmm. Sound stupid. That never catch o- *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH^HHHHHHHHHHH^^HHHHHHHHHHHH^^^HHHHHHH^^^^HHHHHHHHH^^^^^HHHHHHHH..!*""

*[Thud]*


Ogg and Grunk turned around and realized that Louie had simply vanished into thin air.


Grunk - ""Hey, where he go?""


Ogg rolled his eyes.


Ogg - ""Typical. Him owe me five rocks. Now him nowhere to be found.""


Grunk peered down into the gorge next to where they had been walking.


Grunk - ""Nah. Me found him. Louie down there.""


He gestured towards the bottom of the ravine, where Louie's crumpled, mangled corpse lay, silent and motionless on the jagged rocks below.


Ogg - ""Oh. Him okay?""


Grunk threw a large stone down towards the body, which caved-in what was left of Louie's skull. He did not appear responsive.


Grunk - ""Hmm... Me not think so. Him having blood, like woman.""


Ogg grunted in dissaproval.


Ogg - ""That sexist, Grunk.""


Grunk rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly.


Grunk - ""Sorry, that my father talking. How hell Louie down there, when he just up here second ago?""


For several minutes, Ogg, deep in thought, stroked his beard- which had long ago coalesced into a single matted, casteroides tail-like dreadlock. There was an audible dial-up noise as he attempted to piece together the facts of this most perplexing mystery. 

Suddenly, he had an epiphany:


Ogg - ""Eureka! Me have theory.""


His curiosity piqued, Grunk inquired;


Grunk - ""What theory?""


Ogg continued;


Ogg - ""Bear with Ogg on this- Big rock under feet very big, right?""


Grunk considered this for a moment. The big rock they lived on was indeed quite large.


Grunk - ""Me suppose so. What point?""


Ogg did his best to articulate his new, ground-breaking notion:


Ogg - ""Okay: Suppose big rock have great mass. Much bigger than Louie. Since big rock have big mass, it somehow attract objects with small mass through sort of physical force, make objects go down, like when sky cries, and *voilà*- Now Louie down *there*.""


Grunk furrowed his monobrow, though it was obscured by his bulbous, super-Saiyan 3-like forehead.


Grunk - ""Hmm... That novel concept, but you not follow scientific method, so is not *really* theory, technically speaking.""


Ogg scoffed, indignant at this preposterous accusation. How dare Grunk, *a college drop-out*, call his flawless methodology into question? 


Ogg - ""What you *mean* me not follow scientific method?""


Grunk elaborated:


Grunk - ""Well... To have theory, must peform experiments. Take measurements. Record and analyze data to reach conclusion. *Then* it theory. What you have *hypothesis*.""


Ogg stared blankly at Grunk for several moments. His eyes narrowed. Then, without any warning at all, Ogg whacked Grunk in the back with his club, knocking him into the canyon to meet with his terrible doom.


Grunk - ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIEEEEEEEEEE! OGG YOU BUTTHOOOOOOOOO^OOOOOOOO^^OOOOO^^^OOOOOOOO^^^^OOOOOOOOO^^^^^OOOOOOOLE..! ""

*[Thud]*


Ogg peered downward into the chasm and grunted once more.


Ogg - ""Hmm. **Now** it theory... *Bitch.*""",The Stone-Age of Enlightenment,11

The men let out a cheer. This wouldn’t be so hard.

The first man steps up and observes his surroundings. Finally, he picks a sturdy looking boulder to place on his back. “Ready,” he says.

Satan raises his whip and yells, “ONE!”

The boulder immediately splits in half.

“Aw fuck this,” says the first man. “I’ll just stay.”

Satan smirks and asks, “Who’s next?”

The second man steps up and, without picking any protection, gets in position.

“Are you sure about that?” asks Satan, to which the man replies with

“I have trained my mind and body to ignore any unnecessary pain. I need no protection.”

“Whatever you say, pal.” Satan raises his arm and yells, “ONE!”

CRACK

The man slightly flinches, his pain evident, but he remains upright.

Annoyance flashes across Satan’s face. He raises his arm again and shouts, “TWO!”

CRACK

Again, the man remains upright, all the way up to the tenth whipping.

The man gets up, weary but happy. Satan looks furious and says, “Whatever, goodjob. You, third guy, you’re next. What are you picking?”

The third man takes in his surroundings, lays his eyes on his choice and says, “I’m gonna pick the second guy.”

She's sent back to Earth and pops into her miraculously repaired body. She gets up, dusts herself off, and with a huge smile on her face immediately heads to the plastic surgeon. She proceeds to get a face lift, a tummy tuck, hair implants and more. ""If I'm going to live to the old age of 108, I might as well look my best!"" she happily thought.

​

After all the surgeries and cosmetic procedures and makeovers, she looks STUNNING. Beautiful pouty lips and a tiny waist and long luscious hair. She walks out of the salon and BAM. She's hit by another car and dies instantly.

​

Once again, she is at the pearly gates and again, is greeted by God.

""What in the world was that?!"" she exclaims, ""You said I was supposed to live until 108!""

God looks at her with a stern expression and says ""But as soon as you returned, you reposted on /r/jokes and only changed a couple of words here and there!""",A woman steps infront of a car and dies instantly,0

The horse had always wanted to start a band, so he learnt to play the guitar, while he was learning, he started looking for others who would be interested in joining his band, and found a chicken who was really good at singing and playing the keyboard, so he invited him to join his band and the chicken accepted. The horse and the chicken sounded really good together but it still didn’t sound quite right, so the chicken called up an old friend who could play the drums quite well, and asked him if he wanted to join their band, and he accepted. After the cow joined the band, they started to sound really good, and started working on a few songs.


Fast forward a couple months and they have become good friends and their first tour is booked and they are at the airport getting ready to fly down to their first tour destination. Everything is going smoothly as they get past security and board their plane, and it takes off. But about 45 mins into the flight, the plane enters into extreme turbulence and the pilot didn’t see that a couple of birds had flown into one of the engines. The plane starts to go down and everyone starts panicking. Below them is a suburban neighbourhood, and there is no place to land safely nearby. The plane starts loosing altitude drastically and people are saying their good byes to their loved ones.  The pilot managed to slow the plane down enough as it got close to the ground to not cause to much trouble, but then a fire breaks out. The cabin crew start rushing to get everyone out of the plane and the band help them to evacuate the elderly and the infants first. When it was their time to exit the plane, the horse went first, and as he got out the plane exploded, killing the pilot and the cabin crew and the chicken and the cow. 


The horse is really devastated by this loss, and goes to a bar to try and ease the pain, when he goes up to the bartender to order, the bartender notices his expression and asks him, “why the long face my friend?”",This is a long joke but the build up is worth it,6

The City of Chicago has a massive problem with Pigeons. Pigeons are all over the place. They are shitting on everything and carrying garbage and disease and causing a huge health problem. 

The Mayor has a study done and finds it will cost $20 million to get rid of all these pigeons but the city cannot afford it.  It's in all the papers and on the news and the Mayor has a huge problem. 

One day this gay guy walks into the Mayor's office and says he can solve the problem in one afternoon and all it will cost is one million dollars.

The Mayor doesn't believe him and asks the gay guy what would happen if he gave him a Million bucks and it doesn't work. The gay guy tells him if it doesn't work the mayor doesn't have to pay him a dime and that he doesn't have to pay the million bucks until all the pigeons are dead. 

The Mayor figures he can't lose so he agrees. 

Then the Gay guy pulls a Neon pink pigeon out of his pocket, opens the window in the Mayor's office and lets the pigeon loose. 

The pigeon flies all over the city and all the other pigeons see the neon pink pigeon and fly after it. In a matter of minutes there is a huge swarm of pigeons following the pink pigeon. 

The pink pigeon then dives into Lake Michigan. All the other pigeons follow, they hit the water and drown. 

Then the pink pigeon flies out of the water, flies back through the window in the Mayor's office and lands on the gay guy's shoulder. 

The Mayor is astounded.  He says.

""You did it! You saved the city!"" and writes the gay guy a check for a million dollars. 

As he hands the gay guy the check he lowers his voice and says...

""You wouldn't happen to have any pink N!gg3rs would you?

Seeing that the northern vineyards are known for their white wines, and the southern ones for their reds, he plants 7 acres of Riesling and spends years tending the vines to maturity.

When he produces his first batch, some Frenchmen come by and taste the wine.

""My, this is the finest wine we've ever had in all our lives!"" one says. ""You must grow this vineyard twice as large, and we will spread the word of your exquisite brand.""

So George doubles his acreage several times over, and many years later he also produces a brand of sparkling Pinot Noir. The praise of his craft spreads north, and some Brits come to visit.

""This is sublime,"" says one of the Brits. ""For ten million pounds, I will secure all the rights to your wine in perpetuity. But under one condition--you must uproot your Riesling, grow only this Pinot Noir, and leave the tending of your vineyard in the hands of my associates.""

Having grown attached to his vineyard after all the work he put into it, George finds himself conflicted. That night, as he contemplates the deal, he takes a quiet walk among the trellises of his Riesling. All at once, he spots a shadowy figure standing in his path.

""What are you doing here?"" he asks.

The man stares back silently.

The Scotsman ran up to the Englishman and told him that the egg belonged to him because he owned the hen. The Englishman disagreed because the egg was laid on his property. 

""In my family,"" the Scotsman said, ""we normally solve disputes by the following actions: I kick you in the balls and time how long it takes you to get back up. Then you kick me in the balls and time how long it takes for me to get up. Whoever gets up quicker wins the egg.""

The Englishman agreed to this and so the Scotsman found his heaviest pair of boots kicked the Englishman as hard as he could in the balls.

The Englishman fell to the floor clutching his nuts and howled in agony for 30 minutes. Eventually the Englishman stood up and said, ""Now it's my turn to kick you.""

The next day the Americans shouted again, ""Hans?!"" ""Ja?!"" Shot dead. This process continued over the next couple of days. The Germans were losing large numbers, and were now finally catching on.

The Germans had an emergency meeting. They thought they could come back from the heavy losses using the same tactics as the Americans. Thus, a German asked, ""What is a popular American name?""

Their eyes meet, but the pope glances over him to the poor man jumping to catch his attention down in the square. The pope  proceeds to do a sign and the poor man had won the bet.

First, there is this supermodel hollywood star wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us, only God knows why. She is a four on a scale of 1 to 10. I suspect she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the frickin stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 60's, and to make things worse, he brings his big frickin dog to work. Every single heckin day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single goddamn day. I think it's because of all that pot.

I would commute from Dallas to ORD (O'Hare) and make a 2-4h drive during the harshest of winter weather. The snow in this area of the country is heavy and wet and clearing roads is very difficult for even the best of snow plow trucks.  I heard stories of a local Wisconsin cheese manufacturer that had an accidental spill one winter day and discovered that the leftover salt brine from cheese manufacturing, had such a high salt content that it prevented snow from accumulation in the area of the spill.  This company went to the local leaders with this discovery and proposed a test of using this leftover salt brine to treat the roads... and guess what, it worked!  It worked extremely well but had one side effect... the odor of the salt brine treated roads, completely engulfed nearby towns with the smell of... cheese!

&amp;#x200B;

I got to thinking, Wisconsin is known as ""America's Dairyland"" because it is one of the nation's leading dairy producers, particularly famous for its cheese.  So I wondered if they would ever consider incorporating the success of this wintertime accidental discovery as a tie in for the state slogan:  ""Welcome to Wisconsin, come smell our dairy air.""",NEW state slogan for Wisconsin?,2

Inside he meets the owner who takes him around the store and shows him all of the products. There were lots of different ones, candy shaped like a dog biscuit, the grass a cow would eat, the worms a bird would eat and even one that looked like a T-bone steak! 

The boy is awe-struck and can’t decide. The owner shows him a bowl full of crow shaped mints. They had wrapping paper with jokes and the boy wanted to find the best one. Most of them were them were the same, some were really long bad puns, but a few of them were funny.

The owner gives him a knowing smile and asks him to try one. The boy exclaims he didn’t have any money, and was just there to look, but the owner insists. So he opens one up, and sucks on it for a bit. Later he tasted some paper, like a fortune cookie. Inside was a much better joke than on the wrapper.

The owner then said with a smile:
“The real joke is always in the Caw-mints”",A little boy excitedly rushes into a candy store that sold some unusual goods...,6

The shaver is temporarily attached to one of the women while she is working and ensures that she is made presentable.""

""I'm surprised,"" says the job-seeker. ""I thought they'd just go to a salon and get a waxing or something.""

""Well, it's more common than you think,"" says the assistant. ""Sometimes they're on location where there aren't any salons, and many prefer to have a single shaver they know and trust. There are a few requirements, of course. For many of the women, it would be a huge advantage if you're male and straight.""

""Seriously?"" exclaims the job-seeker.

""Oh indeed. A lot of the women don't like the idea of another woman looking at them down there, and there's a common perception that gay men are actually repelled by women's genitals - which isn't good for the women's confidence and self-esteem.""

""Okay,"" says the job-seeker, ""I can promise you that there are no problems there!""

""Good,"" says the assistant. ""Now the applicant needs to have a current passport and be willing to travel to a number of exotic foreign locations - and it helps it he's willing to socialise with the client outside working hours. It's that rapport I was talking about. And you have to be willing to stay in the same hotel as the client, in case she feels the need of a little extra grooming before a key shoot.""

""That's just fine by me!"" says the job-seeker.

""All right,"" says the assistant. ""In that case, just fill out this card and get yourself to Edinburgh within the next 24 hours.""

""That's where the interview is?""

In the distance, they saw a mosque gleaming in the middle of no where.

John suggested to go and pay the mosque's Imam a visit and ask for some food and water. Jack agreed but suggested to change their names to islamic ones so that the Imam would agree to feed them.

John: That is pointless and deceiving. We should introduce ourselves with our real names.

Jack: No, or else they won't feed us. From now on call me Mohammed.

They made their way to the mosque and met the Imam and told him about their despair. 

The Imam told John: We have a room filled with food and water. As for you Mohammed, have a blessed Ramadan.
