-The boss: yes, sir.
-The client: can I book it?
-The boss: of course you can.
-The client: thank you.

Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.

The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.

The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.

Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.

In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.

He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.

The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.

The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.

The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.

This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.

Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.

The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.

The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up. 

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.

The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.

In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.

-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''
-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.
-''Swear''
-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''
So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss. 

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.

When he does, I will let you know... thank you for reading.","A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss. When the boss came, the story began.",0

""No, sorry,"" said the zookeeper. ""We're not hiring.""

""But please,"" said the man, ""I've always wanted to work for the zoo. Are you sure there's no openings? I'll literally do anything!""

The zookeeper thought for a moment. ""Anything?"" he said. 

""Anything,"" the man replied. 

""Well,"" the zookeeper said, scratching his chin, ""we do have one thing, but it's a little weird. Are you sure?"" 

""I'll do it,"" the man said. ""Just tell me what it is."" 

""Well you see,"" the zookeeper said, ""one of our most popular exhibits is our gorilla exhibit, and unfortunately, Jack, our gorilla, died last week. Our patrons are going to be really disappointed unless we find a new gorilla. I know it's weird, but would you mind dressing up like a gorilla and staying in the cage until we find a new one?""

The man thought it sounded strange, but he agreed anyway. ""Maybe it'll be a springboard to other opportunities,"" he thought.

So the next week, the man shows up to work dressed like a gorilla, and takes his place in the cage. Soon, people start flocking to the exhibit, and he discovers his newfound popularity. Embracing the role, the man decides to begin doing ""gorilla things,"" pounding on his chest, eating bananas, the whole nine yards. The crowds are eating it up, laughing and cheering. Soon, his exhibit is again the most popular in the zoo, with kids and parents pressing against the glass. 

""Hmm,"" the man thought. ""This is fun. If they want a show, I'll give them a show."" 

Looking next door, he notices the lion cage, where a male lion sleeps in the sun. Looking toward the fence, he notices a tree in the gorilla cage, and a branch overhanging the lion's exhibit. 

With a burst of bravado, the man in the gorilla suit climbs the tree and walks out onto the overhanging branch, to gasps and ""oooohs"" from the crowd. Tossing aside his better judgment, the man begins to toss twigs at the lion, who wakes from his slumber, annoyed, as the crowd continues to cheer. 

""They're really into this,"" the man thought. ""Let's kick it up a notch.""

To further antagonize the lion, the man begins to shake the branch violently, harder and harder. Twigs, leaves and sticks are falling in the lion's face, who is growing madder and madder, roaring in aggression, and the crowd gasps in shock. ... Suddenly, the branch breaks, and the man tumbles to the ground inside the lion's exhibit.

With bravado quickly turning to panic, the man looks up to see the lion, hunger in his eyes, begin to slowly approach. With each slow step, the crowd gasps in horror. 

Not knowing what else to do, the man in the gorilla suit gets up and starts to shout, ""Somebody help me! Help! Get me out of here!""

Suddenly, a quiet, raspy voice echoes from the lion: ""Shut up, pal, or you'll get us both fired!""",A man applies for a job at the zoo ...,6

I pull up to the flower store and guess what, there is an even longer line. This time it’s out of the door. “Ugh” I shrug it off and get in line, I have to get the corsage. 

I get the corsage and head to the next place, the limo rental. 

I pull up to the limo rental and you wouldn’t believe it. Like is out the door and down the street. “Jesus” I shrug it off and hope there’s still a limo. 

I finally get my limo and have all of my stuff ready for prom. 

It’s the day of prom and I go to my dates house in our limo. I pick her up, give her the corsage and take some pictures with the moms. Whatever, we head to prom. 

We’re dancing for a little bit and it’s getting hot from everybody moving around in a dance floor too small for us. 

Anyway, my date says she’s thirsty and asks me if I can get her some punch. “Sure” I’m a little thirsty myself so I head over to get some punch and you wouldn’t believe it.

After a few minutes of flirting, she placed her hand on his arm and said, ""Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming.""

He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely. Now totally nude, she purred at him, ""What would you say is my best feature?""

Flustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, ""It has to be your ears.""

Astounded, and a little hurt she asked, ""My ears? Look at these breasts; they are a full 38 inches and 100% natural. I work out 2 hours every day and my arse is firm and solid.

The crowd cheers and rushes in, grabs the man, tied him to a tree and one by one fuck him up the ass, once this is done they release the man and tell him to never come back.

Both of the remaining prisoners are shocked. 

The leader then goes and takes the second prisoner to the Center of the village and gives him the same options as the first; death or BOOMBAH

Once again the crowd starts chanting “boombah boombah boombah”

The man starts crying but after a few minutes splutters, “I have a wife and children that I have to go back to so I choose boombah”

And like the first he was taken, tied to a tree and fucked up the ass by every man in the tribe, he is then let go and runs off sobbing into the jungle.

Then comes the final man, like the first two he is taken into the centre of the village and is presented with the two options; Death or BOOMBAH

The crowd starts chanting again “boombah boombah boombah”

The man the shouts “FUCK ALL OF YOU I CHOOSE DEATH”

The crowd goes silent

""That man is incredible.  He was a Chief of his tribe and has come here to live out his last years. He has a memory you won't believe. He can tell you what was happening anytime of any day of his life.""

We find ourselves at a loss when someone says, ""You don't know Jack Schitt!"" Well, thanks to my genealogy efforts, you can now respond in an intellectual way.
Jack Schitt is the only son of Awe Schitt.

Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married Miss O. Needeep They had one son, Jack.

In turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt. The deeply religious couple produced six children: Holie Schitt, Giva Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins Deap Schitt and Dip Schitt.

Against her parents' objections, Deap Schitt married her cousin Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout. After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced.

Noe Schitt later married Ted Sherlock, and, because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name. She was then known as Noe Schitt Sherlock.

Meanwhile, Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt, and they produced a son with a rather nervous disposition named Chick N. Schitt.

Two of the other six children, Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt, were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony.

The wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens nuptials.

The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Hoarse. Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world. He recently returned from Italy with his new Italian bride, Pisa Schitt.

Now when someone says, ""You don't know Jack Schitt,"" you can correct them.

He expands all over the country and in just a few more years is the top-selling manufacturer in the world.

Unfortunately, America suffers from a string of some of the worst natural disasters in US history. Hurricanes and flooding along the entire eastern seaboard, tornadoes and more floods in the midwest, and record droughts in the west allow for devastating wild fires. The cost in human lives is staggering. At this point, the CIA arrests the Saudi Arabian prince on suspicion of being a terrorist, who does not deny his involvement. After all, nature abhors a vacuum.

Soon, the women were gone and there were two lines of men. The line of the men who were dominated by their wives was 100 miles long, and in the line of men who truly were heads of their household, there was only one man.

God said, ""You men should be ashamed of yourselves. I created you to be the head of your household! You have been disobedient and have not fulfilled your purpose! Of all of you, only one obeyed. Learn from him.""

God turned to the one man, ""How did you manage to be the only one in this line?""

The salesman notices the cross around the priest’s neck and asks, 
“Are you, by chance, a man of God, sir?”. 

The priest proudly says
 “Why yes I am!”. 

“Well then,” says the salesman “I think I’ve got just the car for you!” 

So the priest follows the salesman into the garage and sees a breathtaking, majestic, white car with a golden cross hood ornament. 

“Wow!” says the priest, “It’s beautiful!”  

“Yep, she’s a pretty one.” says the salesman, “And you won’t even need a key. She’s voice activated. To make her start, you say ‘Hallelujah’ and to make her stop, you say ‘Amen’.

In love with the car, the priest buys it and enjoys every second in his new ride. He takes every chance he gets to drive it. 

One night, driving home after a long week visiting his family, the priest begins to drift into sleep. Trying to stay awake on the dark, empty road, he takes a wrong turn but doesn’t notice.

Suddenly, he jolts awake! He’s speeding down a hill and at the end of it is a huge, gaping chasm in the middle of the road!

The priest slams the brakes, but they do nothing! Terrified, he prays to his God, pleading with everything he has for his protection. When he finishes his prayer, the car jolts to a stop, inches away from certain death.

Overjoyed that God had answered his prayers the priest exclaims “Hallelujah!”",A Holy Car,21

He was drinking away his problems in a bar that was popular among the local animals because they didn't card. You see, ever since he was a young colt, John used music to deal with his emotions. He started off with a vinyl record of The Beatles' *Revolver*. One day his mom came home with a record of Lou Reed's *Transformer* and from that point forward he became obsessed. He would listen to records for days at a time. He was mostly alone with the music because he didn't have a lot of friends. In his teenage years he migrated from vinyl to cassettes, and he began broadening his styles after Nirvana's *Nevermind* dropped in 1991. That album exposed him to underground music for the first time, and he began buying cassette tapes without even knowing who the artist was. Some of his favorite bands were Pavement, Weezer and The Fall. One day while looking for older records in a pawn shop, he found a beat up old acoustic guitar and decided to bring it home. He was entranced by the instrument's complexities, and his new fixation was learning to play like Woody Guthrie. He would play along with his favorite records, and eventually he was able to play through the entire songs without any of the strings buzzing. At this point in his life he was much less isolated, and had made a few friends who shared his love of music; a chicken named Rob and a pig named Steve. Rob played drums and Steve played bass, which lined up well with John's talented guitar playing and vocals. So they formed a band of their own and began playing gigs around town. Song writing felt natural to them, and the locals loved their music. They became very popular, and regularly played gigs at a local pizza place. However, it soon became clear that they had to stop. After graduation, Steve was leaving for college and Rob would be joining the military. They decided to play one last show before cutting off contact and parting ways. The show went well as always, but the reality finally began sinking into John halfway through. As he waved goodbye to his only friends, he finally realized that the life he had chosen caused him to lose focus on what really matters; friendship. So there he sat, wallowing in his misery, and the bartender looked up and asked ""why the long face?""",A manic depressive horse named John,3

He complains loudly about being poor and having nothing to drink but bad beer. He moans about how the view from his apartment window looks out on the grey slabs of the building next door. The girl asks her uncle, 

""Why are you so lazy? Perhaps if you worked a bit, and didn't sit around drinking all day, you wouldn't be so poor.""

""Non-sense!"" replied her uncle ""just look at your parents. They work like dogs from the crack of dawn, and they're still impoverished villagers. Work all you want in this country, you'll still be poor as a pauper.""

""But I see men in new shiny black cars drive through this village every day. Surely they have become rich somehow. If not through work, how did they do it?""

Her uncle looked grave and said to her ""I'll tell you the secret to getting rich in this country.""

Then he leaned over and whispered something in her ear.

A few weeks later, the girl's high school held a prom. Everyone was asked to bring a dish for the pre-prom lunch. There were big pots of soup, roast hams, casseroles, and cakes. Everyone brought a traditional Russian dish, except the girl. Who brought a giant pot of American southern baked beans. At first, her classmates looked at her askance, that she had brought such a non-traditional food to the feast, but when they tasted the sweat caramely sauce, they pile the beans onto their plates.

Later at the dance, everyone was either on the floor, swinging away, or sitting at one of the decorated tables sipping sparkling wine with their friends. Only the girl sat in the corner on board which had been fastened to the wall of the gymnasium to be used as a bench.

As the girl was very pretty, every now and then a boy would come up and ask her for a dance. She always refused, saying she was fine where she was. 

After a little while, as their digestive systems had started to kick in, people started passing gass. They were horribly embarrassed, not accustomed to the affects of souther baked beans. The girl also passed some gass, but sitting on the bench at the side of the hall, no one could hear her.

Then, at one moment, the girlfriend of the governor's son let out a long loud toot. She was flustered, embarrassed, hiding her face in her hands she ran from the hall.

The governor's son tried to stand straight and look dignified. He started to walk after her, but she let out another long loud toot that everyone could hear. He walked back to the refreshments table, and poored himself a glass of bourbon. Then, looked around for another girl he could dance with. But all were taken. Only one was left, sitting on a board at the edge of the hall.

She was pretty enough, and so he sauntered over to ask her to dance.

The girl realized that it would be rude to refuse a dance from the governors son, so she stepped up, and smiling shyly, blushing from the unexpected offer she began to dance with him. He felt her shy, anxious smile as a smile of glowing warmth and tenderness.

As they danced, he fell in love with her.

Two months later, they were married and they set off on their honeymoon throughout Russia. In Moscow, she directed him to drive to one of the many grey apartment complex at the edge of the city. He was shocked and startled that she would want to visit such a dreary place.

""I just have a task to do. It'll only take a moment."" she said.

Not wanting to disappoint his new bride, he consented and they drove up in their shiny black car.

""I'll be back in a moment."" she called. And ran up the stairs.

When she opened the door to her uncle's apartment he looked out at her with a bemused and surprised expression.

""Just over two months ago you were a poor girl living in a village, and now you come visit me in a black Mercedes? How much has changed!""

""Oh, and it's all thanks to you dear uncle!"" She shouted. ""You told me, that the only way to get rich in Russia is to sit on a board at gazprom! I did just that and now I'm married to the governor's son!""",A poor Russian village girl is visited by her Moscovian uncle,19

The koala answers ""Smoking a joint, come up and have some.""

The lizard climbs up and the two share the joint. After a while the lizard says his mouth is dry and excuses himself to a nearby river to have a drink.

The lizard, so stoned, leans over too far and falls in. A crocodile swims out to rescue him. When they get onto dry land, the croc asks, ""What's wrong with you, lizard?""

The lizard tells him that he was smoking a joint with a koala, and he got too stoned and fell in while taking a drink.

The croc has to see this for himself, so he asks the lizard to take him to the koala. When they get back to the tree, the croc looks up at the koala and says ""Hey, you.""

The man asks the barkeep for another 5 shots.  Just like before, as soon as they're poured, the man slams all five - Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam!

The man says, ""Barkeep - you know what to do!""

As the bartender was pouring the fancy booze - he asks, ""Hey buddy - why are you pounding all these drinks?""

The man replies - ""You would too if you had what I have.""

Bartender asks - ""What's that?""

As the man pounded the last shot he says, ""Four dollars and thirty five cents.""
