When he finished, the goat licked his crotch. The man was immediately arrested and taken to jail, where he was given his one phone call. The man called his longtime friend. The friend said, “Listen, I’ve never met a more disgusting human being in my life, but I’ll find you a lawyer.”

The friend gave the man three options. The first attorney was the best one money could buy, but incredibly expensive. The man chose not to hire him because of his cost. The second attorney was good, but still pricey. The man thought he was also too expensive. The friend then presented the third option, attorney Martin Goldstein of Goldstein, Goldstein &amp; Leibowitz, who wasn’t a good attorney, but was great at jury selection. Eager to save money, the man decided to hire Goldstein. The two met, and Goldstein assured the man that he would be tried by a jury of his peers.

A few months later, the man’s trial was underway. The zookeeper was testifying and being cross-examined by the prosecutor. “Do you recognize anyone who was at the zoo on the morning of April 17th?” asked the prosecutor. “Sure,” said the zookeeper.  “Can you point him out?” asked the prosecutor. The zookeeper pointed to the defendant.

“Was this man at the zoo on the morning of April 17th?” asked the prosecutor. “Of course,” said the zookeeper. “And did this man have sexual intercourse with a goat?” asked the prosecutor. “He did indeed,” said the zookeeper. “Can you describe what the man did?” asked the prosecutor. “Well,” began the zookeeper, “the man jumped the fence, pulled down his trousers, inserted his penis into the back of the goat, and finished.” “And then what happened?” asked the prosecutor. “Then the goat licked his genitals,” said the zookeeper.

In the jury box, one juror turned to another and whispered “Now THAT’s a sign of a good goat.”",A Jury of His Peers,2

I told my husband that I would be home by midnight, ""I promise!"" Well, the hours passed and the champagne was going down way too easy. Around 3 a.m., drunk as a skunk, I headed for home. Just as I got in the door, the cuckoo clock in the hall started up and cuckooed 3 times. Quickly, realizing he'd probably wake up, I cuckooed another 9 times. I was really proud of myself for coming up with such a quick-witted solution in order to escape a possible conflict with him. 

The next morning my husband asked me what time I got in, and I told him 12:00. He didn't seem disturbed at all. Whew! Got away with that one! Then he said, ""We need a new cuckoo clock.""

When I asked him why, he said, ""Well, last night our clock cuckooed three times, then said, ""oh shit,"" cuckooed 4 more times, cleared its throat, cuckooed another 3 times, giggled, cuckooed twice more, and then tripped over the cat and farted.

“Leave it with me,” says the mechanic. “Come back in 20 minutes.”
So, off goes the penguin. It’s a pretty hot day and he’s a cool weather kind of guy so on spotting an
ice cream van he goes and buys himself a 99. Now, penguins aren’t very good at eating ice creams—
the lack of opposable thumbs makes it tricky. So by the time the penguin has finished his 99, he is
completely covered in ice cream. It is all over his beak and all over his flippers. Feeling a little
sticky, he goes back to the garage.
“Oh, hello,” says the mechanic, wiping his hands on a cloth.

A policeman is walking around on patrol when he spots an older gentleman sitting on a bench outside Vladivostok train station. The man on the bench seems to be muttering intensely to himself. Curious, the policeman walks up to him and asks:

""Good citizen, what are you mumbling about? Has something happened?""

The man looks up, confounded at first, before his eyes orient on the policeman.

""Oh, sorry, good sir officer, I didn't see you there. No, nothing is wrong. I am just very focused. You see, I am old, and at my age, you never know when Death comes knocking. Therefore, I have decided that I shall learn Hebrew, in case I get to heaven.""

The policeman nods to himself at the wisdom in this, but while he doesn't want to distress the old gentleman, he can't help but ask:

""But, good citizen, what will you do if you instead end up in hell?""

The old man spreads his hand and shrugs.

""Well, as you hear for yourself, good sir officer, I already speak Russian.""",The language of Heaven,170

""Hello father O'Mally, you've lead a pious life and have spread the word to many followers but for your final test to enter into heaven you must answer 3 questions"" St. Peter asks Father O'Mally the questions 

""How many seconds are there in a year?""

""Which days in a week start with the letter T?""

and ""What is God's first name?""

Father O'Mally paused for a moment and asked St. Peter to give him a day to think of the answers and St. Peter obliged.

Father O'Mally returned the next day and St. Peter asked him the questions again.

""How many seconds are in a year?""

""12""  Said Father O'Mally

Not the answer he was expecting, St. Peter questioned how Father O'mally got this.

""So O'Mally, how many seconds are in a minute?""

""60"" said O'mally

 ""So how did you get 12 seconds?""

""Easy, you have January 2nd, February 2nd, March 2nd, etc...""

While not the answer he was expecting, St. Peter allowed it and moved on to the next question.

""Which days in a week start with the letter T?"" 

""Today and Tomorrow"" said O'Mally

This was again not the answer that St. Peter was expecting but he allowed it, even though he was becoming quite frustrated with the Irish Priest.

""Final Question,"" said St. Peter, ""What is God's first name?""

""Andy"" said O'Mally

St. Peter again asked how O'Mally hae gotten this answer, to which he replied...

Meanwhile a group of rowdy frat boys, obviously on vacation, are being loud and obnoxious.  One of the frat boys leaves the group and begins hitting on group of women that are seated at the other side of the bar.  The women are not into it, but the frat boy is ignoring their rebukes, until one of the women steps up and physically pushes the guy away.  As he retreats back to group, he starts making obscene jokes and gestures and is taking his anger out on other random people in the bar, trying to act tough and save face.

At this point, the man in the corner gets up and stumbles over to the group of frat guys.  Immediately, they begin to tease him about wearing glasses and looking like a nerd.  The man takes it all in stride and starts joking back with them.  They soon welcome him to their group.  He then says, ""Since you guys are from out of town, you probably don't know it but the winds up here are strong enough that if you step over the balcony and spread your arms, you can float on the wind.""  While drunk, the frat boys call bullshit on the man and tell him to prove it.  He casually walks over to the edge, climbs over and jumps off, spreading his arms and legs like an eagle.  After a quick drop, he floats back up and is riding the wind between the skyscrapers.

The recently rejected frat boy decides that this would help regain his confidence and decides to join the man out in the air.  As he steps off the outside of balcony, he drops like a rock.  He immediately starts screaming and as his life flashes before his eyes, he is plummeting towards the ground.  Inches from the pavement, he feels a tug on his leg and looks up to see the local man grabbing his leg and lifting him back towards the night sky and the balcony above.  Once back on solid ground it is evident the frat guy has shit his pants and his face is white as a ghost.  He immediately convinces the group to leave and the bar returns to it's normal, quiet, self.  As the local man grabs another drink, the bar tender mumbles, ""You're a real asshole when you get drunk, Clark.""","In a rooftop bar in Metropolis, a man is sitting in a corner by himself throwing back drink after drink and looking like he needs to let the weight of the world fall off his shoulders.",6

I recently asked my friend's little girl what she wanted to be when she grows up.  She said she wanted to be President some day.  Both of her parents, liberal Democrats, were standing there, so I asked her, 'If you were President, what would be the first thing you would do?'  

She replied, 'I'd give food and houses to all the homeless people.'  
   
Her parents beamed with pride.

'Wow...what a worthy goal.' I told her.  'But you don't have to wait until you're President to do that. You can come over to my house and mow the lawn, pull weeds, and sweep my yard, and I'll pay you $50. Then I'll take you over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out, and you can give him the $50 to use toward food and a new house.'  

She thought that over for a few seconds, then she looked  me straight in the eye and asked, ' Why doesn't the homeless guy come over and do the work, and you can just pay him the $50?'  

I said, 'Welcome to the Republican Party.'  

Her parents still aren't speaking to me.

Alarmed, Tiger starts to retreat when the bear casually asks Tiger what he's doing.  Having never spoken to a black bear before, Tiger was a little hesitant at first but upon realizing that the bear was not a threat he tries his best to explain the game of golf to this black bear.  After learning that it is a game played competitively, the bear asks to be shown how to play and wants to place a friendly wager that he could beat Tiger.  Confident in his abilities to beat a rookie golfer, let alone a black bear, Tiger agrees to a one hole playoff over a piece of Fruit Stripe gum.  Tiger goes first and snacks a line drive straight down the middle of the fairway.  The black bear then grabs a club but as he approaches the tee box he freezes, turns to Tiger and asks, ""What do I do now?""  Wanting to be fair, Tiger points to a tree off in the distance saying ""See that tree over there, hit the ball just to the left of that on the short green grass.""  The bear then tees off and hits an incredibly accurate shot, landing within 5 yards of the area Tiger had told him to aim.  When the bear goes to hit his second shot, he again asks what to do, to which Tiger responds by pointing to a pond separating the fairway from the green and tells the bear to land it just short of the water. Miraculously the black bear does the impossible a second time. Astonished, but still focused on winning the wager, Tiger hits an equally exceptional shot to land just ahead of the black bears second shot.  Once more, the bear has to ask what the next step of the game is to which Tiger replies, ""Ahh yes, you see the flag on the green over there? The object of the game is to get the ball into that small cup in the fewest number of shots."" The black bear, furious at this point, replies, ""WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT ON THE FIRST SHOT!""

Because of hectic schedules, it was difficult to coordinate their travel schedules. So, the husband left Minneapolis and flew to Florida on Thursday, with the wife flying down the following day. The husband checked into the hotel. There was a computer in his room, so he decided to send an e-mail to his wife. However, he accidentally left out one letter in her e-mail address, and without realizing his error, sent the e-mail. 

Meanwhile, somewhere in Houston, a widow just returned home from her husband's funeral. He was a minister who was called home by the Lord following a heart attack. The widow decided to check her e-mail since she was expecting messages from relatives and friends. After reading the first message, she screamed and fainted. The widow's son rushed into the room, found his mother on the floor, and saw the computer screen which read: 

* To: My Loving Wife
* Subject: I've Arrived
* Date: November 18, 2004

It was early winter and the lower portion of the cove had frozen over.

Alan asked Mary if she would walk across the frozen part of the cove to the general store and get him some smokes and beer.

She asked him for some money, but he told her, ""Nah, just put it on our tab.  Old man Stacey won't mind.""

So Mary, being the good wife she was, walked across the ice, got the smokes and beer at the store and then walked back home across the cove.

When she got home with the items she said, ""Alan, you always tell me not to run up the tab at Stacey's store.  Why didn't you just give me some money?""

Alan replied, ""Well, Mary, I didn't want to send you out there with cash when I wasn't sure how thick the ice was!""",Alan and Mary,3

We ask what, and he says ""I'd love it if as I left, you could wave at me and say bye dad, it would mean a lot to me."" So we decide to humor him.

As he leaves, we're getting our bill. My wife goes along with his ""bye dad"" thing, and I see that there's an extra meal on our ticket. I ask the waitress, and she says, ""oh, you paid for your wife's dad!""

Now, I see him walking past the front window, so I run out to stop him. He sees me and runs to this old beat up car. He fumbles to get it open, and as he tries to climb in, I grab him, and I'm pulling and pulling on his leg.

One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond to look it 
over, as he hadn't been there for a while. 

He grabbed a five-gallon bucket to bring back some fruit. 

As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee. 

As he came closer he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond. 

He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end. 

One of the women shouted to him, ""We're not coming out until you leave!"" 

The old man frowned, ""I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or make you get out of the pond naked.""

Not to say that it doesn't have flaws but who are we kidding? They live in heaven compared to other third world countries

Can we make something greater when it is already great? I don't know

Each and everyone of us has a different opinion about ""great"", we can't have a universal meaning for great. 

Not to get too much lost in this post but I think, and only I, that america is already great the way it is.

You find out you have a lot in common, shes just like your last best friend, and as a bonus, you can cross the first girl to have ever bought you a drink off you list!. But then you realize something: She put the drink on your tab, and shes got BAGGAGE! You find out she's in a shitty marriage, probably has a criminal record that she seems to think is no big deal, a laundry list of failed friendships, and all those things you ""had in common"" were a product of her agreeing with everything you said. You realize this was a bad idea, so you move onto Santa Clause.

Santa promises to make your dreams come true. That debt you have? Gone. All those problems? Gone. Great! you've finally made a friend you can count on! While he wasn't lying about WANTING to help with all of that, you remember that Santa isn't real, and figure out Santa is actually the owner of the bar. He's now offered you free drinks all night but after having a few, you get a check. Confused, you look at it and see that the drinks were actually free, but he instead is charging you the tax on the drink, a delayed cover charge, a ""convenience"" fee, a pouring fee, and a delivery fee. Next thing you know, your free drinks actually cost you more than if you had just bought them. You realize there's more to pay for free than not, so you say no thanks, and approach the popular guy.

Wow this guy is cool! And he wants to be YOUR friend?! NO WAY! Now you have a rich and cool friend! Friendship should come easy to him, considering he has so much money, right?! Yeah, sure, he thinks the people in the corner with the funny hats and the stupid accents should be escorted out. Sure, he talks shit about everybody you know, but that's just his ego, right? There's no way he would talk about you behind your back! Not you! He's the one who asked you, remember? Then you realize all of your best friends have stopped talking to you. Even your business colleagues have ceased relations with you. You're not taken seriously anymore, and even worse off, the cool dude isn't hitting you up anymore to hang out. He doesn't reply to your texts or calls. You're left with the memory of a fun ride, and that's about it. You've sacrificed your friendships for money and fame, and you got none of that.

So who would you take a drink from? 

Thanks for reading guys! ","[Election 2016] A pretty girl, Santa Clause, and the most popular kid from your high school walk into a bar. They all offer you a drink and their friendship. Who do you choose?",1

Father Bob decides he'll run back for the soap. Rather than get dressed, he peeks out into the hallway, and since no one is around, he decides to make a run for it. 

He gets the two bars of soap and checks the hall before heading back to the showers. All was clear, so he makes a break for it. 

Just as he turns the corner to the showers, he spots three nuns walking toward him. With nowhere to go, and hoping that the nuns will think he is a statue, he stands perfectly still, holding the two bars of soap. 

The nuns approach and the first nun says, ""Oh my, look at that! Isn't that the most life-like statue you've ever seen?"" She steps up for a closer look, reaches out and gives a couple of tugs on the priest's weenie. Startled, he drops the first bar of soap. 

""Oh Heavens,"" she exclaims, ""I got a bar of soap!"" 

The second nun is also amazed at how realistic the statue looks, so she steps in for a closer look. She takes a couple of yanks on the priest's weenie, and he drops the other bar of soap. 

""My goodness, I got a bar of soap also!"" 

The nuns can't believe it. 

The third nun, overcome by the miracle statue, walks up to it and gives a few tugs to the priest's weenie.

The guy is amazed and soon a woman comes in and orders a rum and coke. Again the bartender gives her a apple and tells her to try it.

She takes a bite and it tastes like coke then bites the other half and it takes like rum. She also is amazed at this.

A little while later another guy walks in. The woman and man tell him about the apple. The bartender says he can make the apple taste like anything he wants.

The man says he wants a apple that tastes like pussy.

You first choose the pretty girl. You find out you have a lot in common, shes just like your last best friend, and as a bonus, you can cross the first girl to have ever bought you a drink off you list!. But then you realize... something: She put the drink on your tab, and shes got BAGGAGE! She is in a horrible marriage, probably a criminal record, a laundry list of failed friendships, and all those things you ""had in common"" was a product of her agreeing with everything you said. You realize this was a bad idea, so you move onto Santa Clause.

Santa promises to make your dreams come true. That debt you have? Gone. All those problems? Gone. Great! you've finally made a friend you can count on! While he wasn't lying about any of that, you realize that Santa isn't real, and Santa is actually the owner of the bar. While he can help you in the ways he said, he also is charging you the tax on the drink, a delayed cover charge, a ""convenience"" fee, a pouring fee, and a delivery fee. Next thing you know, your free drink just cost you 3/4ths of the money you walked in here with. You realize there's more to pay for free than not, so you say no thanks, and approach the popular guy.

Wow this guy is cool! And he wants to be YOUR friend?! NO WAY! Now you have a rich and cool friend! Friendship should come easy to him, considering he has so much money, right?! Yeah, sure, he thinks the people in the corner with the funny hats and the stupid accents should be escorted out. Sure, he talks shit about everybody you know, but that's just his ego, right? There's no way he would talk about you behind your back! Not you! He's the one who asked you, remember? Then you realize all of your best friends have stopped talking to you. Even your business colleagues have ceased relations with you. You're not taken seriously anymore, and even worse off, the cool dude isn't hitting you up anymore to hang out. He doesn't reply to your texts or calls. You're left with the memory of a fun ride, and that's about it. You've sacrificed your friendships for money and fame, and you got none of that.

Oh yeah, I forgot. The punchline! WE'RE ALL FUCKED! 

Good day, and thanks for reading","During the primaries, a pretty girl, Santa Clause, and the most popular guy from your high school walk into a bar and offer you their friendship and a drink. Who do you choose?",1

We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. It's terrible. It's just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you. First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that.

I was in the check-out line when a woman  behind me asked if I had a dog.

What did she think I had..an elephant?

So because I'm retired and have little to do, on impulse I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, I was  starting the Purina Diet again. I added that I probably  shouldn't, because I ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.

I told her that it was essentially a  Perfect Diet and that the way that it works is, to load your jacket pockets with Purina Nuggets and simply eat one or two  every time you feel hungry. 
 
The food is nutritionally complete, so it works well and I was going to try it again. (I have to  mention here that practically everyone in line was now enthralled with my story.)

Now, Mark is confused. He says to Saint Peter, “I got into Heaven? Really? No offense, but I was a dirty, rotten, son of a bitch.”

Saint Peter smiles and says, “It is not my position to question the will of God. Are you ready to come in?”

Mark continues and says, “There has to be some kind of mistake. I was a swindler. I swindled nearly every person I’ve ever met.” 
Saint Peter nods and says, “Again, it is not my position to question the will of God.” 

Mark continues and says, “I was a murderer! I’ve murdered a couple of people.” 

Saint Peter, getting frustrated, says, “I was told to let you in. I didn’t ask why. Not my choice in the matter.” 

Mark continues and says, “I was a rapist. I raped people. Are you telling me they let swindling, murdering rapists into Heaven!?” 
Saint Peter says to Mark, angrily, “You don’t think we already know all that? Are you coming in or not?”

Mark thinks and says, “I really don’t think I deserve to be here,” to which Saint Peter responds, “Fine! You can go to Hell,” then he snaps his fingers and sends Mark straight to Hell. 

Mark finds himself among a crowd. Up on a craggy cliff, Satan appears, and bellows out to the terrified masses below, “Welcome, unrepentant sinners, to eternal damnation… wait a minute, is that Mark? Who the fuck let that dirty, rotten, son of a bitch in!? You ask God for ONE favor-”

The Democrats here elevated a classic cream of mushroom, picking mostly Hen of the Woods while the overwhelming majority of Republicans here insisted on drinking the Kool-Aid, even though the beverage is technically not a soup in any way.

The Republicans were presented with a fountain of hot spring water, in which a small ham was placed. They were very proud of their ingenuity. A consomé of edamame was most popular among the Democrats, however a few faithfully subsisted on some muscadines they tried to grow in office.
Alaska • 28 delegates
Republicans flip flopped around in a Shark Fin Soup but we have to wait until March 26th to know how the Democrats prefer their Ceviche.
Colorado • 66 delegates
All of the soup in Colorado is excellent, no jokes here. The Democrats were going to make the best decision and they did. By the time July rolls around, the Republicans’ soup will old and smelly in the fridge and it will probably not be edible.
Georgia • 102 delegates
The Republican party had more ham but the FCC might be fining $1000 for failure to identify what animals they actually ate. The chickenhawk &amp; dumplings was the Democratic favorite.
Massachusetts • 91 delegates
Democrats came up with a neat idea to use razor clams in a New England chowder but they settled on a she-crab soup instead. Republicans gobbled the guk.
Minnesota • 77 delegates
In a refreshing change for Republican diners, Ajiaco was the crowd favorite while Democrats feasted on Lutefisk.
Oklahoma • 38 delegates
While the state is still searching for its signature soup, Republicans went with a prociutto-wrapped jelly donut. The bacon end got burnt, and the belly came up on top. For the Democrats, it was a Coffee Party USA, they swept in on a wind Dean Dozen of the plain, cake donuts- the best of the donuts.
Tennessee • 67 delegates
A coalition was formed to procure a spread of country hams for the Republicans. Diners preferred the taste of animals that were willing to be slaughtered. Sanders supporters got tired of soup too so they started pouring bourbon to accompany neglected goo goos clusters while the majority of the Democrats imagined a future of lame duck soup noodles in a blue bowl.
Texas • 222 delegates
Lunch pail democrats we’re not pleased with their party’s decision to go with Mrs. Grass as the golden nugget has been discontinued. Republicans opted for their shelf staple, Campbell’s Chunky Barbecue Seasoned Pork.

The grassroots vegetable soup stole the show on the Democratic menu here. In a Frankenfood alternative, Republicans opted for the Government cheddar cheese dip.

Never arrived to class on time and always made sure to make a huge fuss about it.

Didn't talk to her all that much, but I had a few conversations with her.

Her wrists had cuts and burns all over them. She wore t-shirts so she never hid them.

I asked her why she would hurt herself like that.

She said ""No one loves me and my life is painful"" etc., etc.

""No one loves you? What about your parents or your boyfriend?""

Answer she gave me was something like ""They actually don't love me,"" or some shit like that.

Made a point to not interact with her too much after that, because she's too much of an attention whore.

End of the school year, she came up to me and asked if I wanted to go somewhere with her that Sunday.

I'm not good with these situations, so I couldn't say no, even though I didn't like her.

Sunday came, and we went to one of those tower car parks.

Just as we got to the top, she told me that she wanted me to be here as a witness for her suicide.

""Oh shit,"" I thought. She was going to jump and was forcing me to watch!

Had I known that she was going to do this, I wouldn't have gone with her.

""Not watching unless you do a flip."" I said that to try and shock her into realizing this was stupid.

Complete shock was written all over her face. She thought I'd try and stop her.

""E-eh? You're not going to stop me?""

""No, go on ahead. If you really wanted to live, you'd stop yourself.""
After a while, she got off the ledge.

The doctor says ” Sir, I have lost my sense of taste.”

Engineer replies “Nurse, can you please bring the medicine from box 19 and put 3 drops in the patient’s mouth.”

The doctor immediately screams “WHAT THE?!? This is Gasoline!”

Engineer responds “Congratulations! You’ve got your taste back. That will be $400.”

The doctor gets very annoyed and goes back after a couple of days later to recover his money.

Doctor this time tells the engineer “I have lost my memory, I cannot remember anything.”

Engineer again says “Nurse, please bring the medicine from box 19 and put 3 drops in the patient’s mouth.”

The doctor “But that is Gasoline!”

Engineer smiles and says “Congratulations! You’ve got your memory back. That will be $400.”

The doctor leaves angrily and comes back after several days, more determined than ever to make his money back.

This time the doctor said “My eyesight has become weak.”

Engineer replied “Well, I don’t have any medicine for this. Take this $1,000,” passing the doctor a $500 bill.

I ended up calling the number and some guy answered, it sounded like he was driving as i could hear road noise and he had me on speakerphone. After he said hello, I explained to him that his number was on the men's room stall at the bar i was at. He immediately started yelling off the cuff about his ex. ""What the fuck is that bitch doing? I SWEAR i'M GOING TO KILL HER!"" After i calmed him down, he asked me where this was and i told him the name of the place. He apologized and asked if i could wait there. Sure, i was partially buzzed and had no where to go, so why not right? 

About 10 minutes later in walks this dude in a pizza uniform. Holy shit, it's just some kid. probably early 20's. Him and i get to talking and he's telling me about his crazy af ex-gf who he found in bed with his dorm-mate. After he caught her, she flew off the handle, it seems. Tore up his microbiology final and threw his pet hamster across the room, killing it on the concrete wall. 

He goes on for a few minutes, and i'm even feeling slightly rage filled about how much of a bitch one person can be. I ask him if i can buy him a drink because, hell, he looks like he could use one. Sure he replies, he called up his boss and told him he was taking a dinner break.

This kid, ""Steve"" tells me about how he can best get revenge on her. I come up with a plan. I ask Steve where his ex-lives I call the pizzeria he works with and order the house-special, no shrooms, because fuck mushrooms, amirite? But i tell them i want Steve to deliver them of course i give them her address. Steve runs back to the shop, picks up the pizza with instructions to return to me.

Steve gets back about 45 minutes later. We get in his car and i tell him to drive me to her place. We get there and i tell him to just lean the seat back and stay hidden, i got this. I go up to the porch of the house and ring the door. Nothing. i wait a couple moments and ring again. I start looking around and happen to notice a curtain pushed open and a head looking out to the driveway. Suddenly i hear "" THAT FUCKING COCKSUCKER IS STALKING ME!"" i'm guessing she recognized the car. A couple of other loud voices seem to eminate from the other side of the house but i can't make out what they're saying. i hear a couple of loud footsteps and then the locks are unlocking from the door an what appears but this petite redhead, who, despite being in a fit of rage, is actually quite stunning. She started to yell, but quickly stopped when she realized that i was not Steve.

I told her how i was the manager of the pizza place and heard that he broke up with her. How he had some pictures on his phone of her and i really wanted to get in touch with her as i had been recently divorced and that Steve was being a shit at work and wanted to get revenge on him. She seemed to open up to the idea that he was going to be fired from the job and would go along with any idea of doing something to crush his spirit. She asked me what i'm going to need in order to put my plan in action. I turned to her and motioned towards the pizza and that it was getting hot on my hand and she had me bring the pizza inside so we could discuss the plan. She asked about Steve's car, and i told her that it was actually a coincidence and that i was borrowing his car because mine broke down, and i just needed to run an errand while he stayed back at the shop. We worked out a devious plan to set up Steve and ate some pizza while i talked about his downfall. When all was said and done, she was actually quite happy and offered to pay for the pizza, knowing how Steve was going to end up in jail soon enough. I respectfully declined, she insisted again. I told her no, but i need some cash to put gas in the car, as the fuel light had come on. She asked me how much i need and i said ""Oh, about tree-fiddy""",I found a number on the Men's stall room the other day.,0
