The wife was very excited about this and wanted everything to be perfect. At the very last minute, she realized that she didn't have any snails for this dinner party, so she asked her husband to run down to the beach with the bucket she was handing him to gather some snails. Very grudgingly he agreed. 

He took the bucket, walked out the door, down the steps, and out to the beach. As he was collecting the snails, he noticed a beautiful woman strolling alongside the water just a little further down the beach. He kept thinking to himself ""Wouldn't it be great if she would even just come down and talk to me."" He went back to gathering the snails. 

All of a sudden he looked up, and the beautiful woman was standing right over him. They got to talking, and she invited him back to her place. They were at her apartment a ways down the beach, and they started messing around. It got so hot and heavy, that he was exhausted afterwards and passed out there. 

At seven o'clock the next morning he woke up and exclaimed, ""Oh no!!! My wife's dinner party!!!"" He gathered all his clothes, put them on real fast, grabbed his bucket, and ran out the door. 

He ran down the beach all the way to his apartment. He ran up the stairs of his apartment. He was in such a hurry that when he got to the top of the stairs, he dropped the bucket of snails. There were snails all down the stairs. The door opened just then, with a very angry wife standing in the door way wondering where he's been all this time. He looked at the snails all down the steps, then he looked at her, then back at the snails and said: ""Come on guys, we're almost there!""

the cow would move away. No matter what approach the bull tried, the cow would move away from the bull and he was never able to do the deed.

The people were very upset and decided to go to
the local Vet, who was very wise, to tell him what was happening and ask his advice.

""Whenever the bull tries to mount our cow, she moves away. If he approaches from the back, she moves forward. When he approaches her from the front, she backs off. If he attempts it from the one side, she walks away to the other side"", told the people to the Vet.

The Vet rubbed his chin thoughtfully and pondered this
before asking, ""Did you by chance, buy this cow in Wales ?""

The people were dumbfounded, since no one had ever mentioned that they had brought the cow over from Wales. ""You are truly a wise Vet,"" they said. ""How did you know we got the cow from Wales ?

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. 


The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.


Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""


The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" 


The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. 


The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. 


Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk!",A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery....,16

""What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!"", he said to himself. As he was walking along the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. When he turned to see what the cause was, he saw a 7-foot grizzly charging right towards him. He ran as fast as he could. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing, He ran even faster, crying in fear. He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. His heart was pounding and he tried to run even faster. He tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up, but saw the bear right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him. 

At that moment, the Atheist cried out ""Oh my God!...."" Time stopped. The bear froze. The forest was silent. Even the river stopped moving. 

As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky, ""You deny my existence for all of these years; teach others I don''''t exist; and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer?"" 

The atheist looked directly into the light ""It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask You to treat me as Christian now, but perhaps could you make the bear a Christian?"" ""Very well,"" said the voice. 

The light went out. The river ran again. And the sounds of the forest resumed. 

And then the bear dropped his right paw ..... brought both paws together...bowed his head and spoke: ""Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful.""",An Atheist and a Bear,161

“You gotta be joking,” blustered Lenski. “You must be trying to get me killed!”
‘Trust me,” said the officer, sending Lenski out into the field with a reassuring pat on the shoulder.

Pretty soon Lenski found himself in the thick of battle with a Russian infantryman advancing on him. Having little choice, he raised his hands, pointed at the soldier, and yelled, “Bang! Bang!” The Russian fell over, stone dead. This worked on about twenty Russians. Fired with confidence, Lenski returned to the munitions officer and asked about a bayonet.

“Oh, we’re all out,” said the officer apologetically, “but if you just point with your index finger and scream, ‘Stab! Stab!’ you’ll get excellent results.”

Out went Lenski into battle again, and soon he was surrounded by heaps of dead Russian soldiers. In fact, he thought he had wiped out the whole platoon and was just taking a breather when he saw a giant Russian coming toward him. Strutting forward, Lenski shouted, “Bang! Bang!”

The Russian kept on coming.
“Stab! Stab!” cried Lenski.
The Russian kept on coming, right over Lenski, crushing him to a pulp.

The poet is picked first. He stands by as the blade is raised, then he is asked, “Would you rather be face up or face down?” “Down,” he says. They place him in the guillotine, the blade is raised, there is a drum roll, and the executioner pulls the cord releasing the blade… and it hangs up halfway down!

Now, there was (in this story) a rule against “double jeopardy”, so the poet goes free and runs off into the crowd rejoicing.

The politician goes next, after the guillotine is checked out thoroughly, the track greased and tested on a melon. Same story. He also goes free.

Now it’s the physicist’s turn. The engineers take the guillotine apart and replace all the worn components, test it three times and finally ask the physicist if he wants to be face up or face down. “Up, please. I like to see what’s ahead!” says the physicist.

The blade is hoisted, there’s a drum roll, and just as the executioner gets ready to pull the cord, the physicist points up at the guillotine and shouts, “Wait! I think I see your problem!”",My physics teacher told me a joke today,7

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Reggie, how about Tom Hardy?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" 

So Reggie and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Hardy's door, and Tom Hardy shouts,
""Reggie! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Reggie's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Hardy's house, he tells Reggie that he thinks him knowing Hardy was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Reggie says.

""President Trump,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Reggie says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" 

and off they go.
At the White House, Trump spots Reggie on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Reggie, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Reggie, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope jtank77,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Reggie. ""I've known the Pope for years."" 

So off they fly to Rome.
Reggie and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Reggie says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Reggie emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Reggie returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Reggie asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Reggie?'",My second favorite joke: everybody knows Reggie,0

They spend the next hour and a half chasing out virtually all of the quacks, and Dwight looks satisfied, but Jeffrey doesn't. 

""Hey Dwight, I think we forgot that one guy there, the tall 22-year-old oaf who's lapping up all the fruit punch!"" Dwight looks at the boy. ""I think there's an adequate amount of fruit punch left for everyone, and he doesn't look like he's consumed far too much, just two and a half glasses. And that's Matt, he's Horace's son, and I remember seeing him when he was pretty young. Horace never really came to our reunions, so naturally Matt wasn't really there too. He's part of the family, don't worry."" Jeffrey takes one long good look at Matt.

Ever since I was born I have been, if no better way to put it, average. My mother used to tell me the story of when I was born. Apparently, when I first popped out, I didn't cry, as one would expect a newborn baby to. I simply peered around a bit as the nurses rushed over to take care of me. How's that ""average""? I don't know. It's just a story my mom used to tell me, and I think it sets the stage rather well for what was to come.

The days of my innocence flew by, and soon I was about to enter 9th grade. That was when my dad was posted to a new state by his company. Leaving behind my home of nearly 14 years, I stepped into the brave new world of Mississippi. Of course, that meant I enrolled in a new high school. There, lost and alone, I stumbled around until I met my two guys who would become the best friends I would ever have.

To cut a long story short, I got to know them in math class. Bored by a particularly dry lecture (something about calculus) we struck a conversation and found that we shared a common interest: We were all crazy into gaming. We talked about the newest Metal Gear, and it all went uphill from there.

Their names were Luke and Missile. Luke was a bit of a nerd, but an all-round cool guy, and an amazing friend. If you were in a jam, you could be sure Luke would be there to see you through. Missile, on the other hand, was a wild one; always on the move, and with such an excited and bubbly manner of speaking you could feel yourself getting carried along as he spoke. At first, I thought he was Latino, but turns out he was half-filipino. Oh, and his real name was Gonzales. He just liked being called ""Missile"" (for whatever reason, I do not know. I doubt even he himself really does).

So it was with these two that I spent a happy 6 months in high school. My parents seemed to be happy that I was coping well. We lived in a good neighborhood, and our next-door neighbor, a German fellow by the name of Mr Anderson who always wore sunglasses and had a pot belly, would often invite us over for barbecues and such. Luke and Missile would join in on occasion, and we would talk about life, school, and anything really, before popping in Mario Party in Mr Anderson's Wii and playing to our heart's content. Life was going pretty well.

Then, I met her. Her name was Trucy, and I will forever remember the day I first laid my eyes on her. It was in art class, and amidst the smell of stale paint and canvas I caught a whiff of perfume. I looked up, and there she was. Beautiful brown curls framed her perfect, blue-eyed face. And that smile. Oh god. I swear I collaped into a dreamy, unmanly heap on the table for the entire lesson which followed.

When I met up with Luke and Missile in the cafeteria, my thoughts still dwelled on her. Luke must have sensed that something was going on, because he waved his hand in front of me, saying ""Earth to Arlon, Earth to Arlon, Arlon do you copy"", which snapped me out of my trance-like state. ""What's with you man?"" he asked. ""You're not your usual self today.""

""Oh, Nothing."" I lied.

But, of course, they found out eventually. And they were really cool about it. Turns out, Missile knew Trucy from Economics, so with that in mind, we started to brainstorm ideas on how to approach her. Luke suggested we take it slow. ""What about you 'invite' us all to the movies, Missile?"" he said. ""We'll book tickets, then get trucy next to Arlon. We can work it out from there.""

We did exactly that, and it turned out pretty well. Better, in fact, than I expected -- we managed to exchange phone numbers. Missile and Luke congratulated me on a job well done, then we went to get Taco Bell. There, we planned our next course of action.

Over the next few weeks, Trucy and I got to know each other, whether through phone calls or the clandestine operations Luke and Missile helped me arrange. Soon, I didn't need their help anymore, and we went on our first date together at a park (yes, very creative I know). It was then that I knew I had to tell her.

""Trucy?""

""Yes Arlon?""

""There's something... i need to tell you.""

""What is it?""

I hesitated. Then, I saw them. Sitting on a bench reading newspapers. Cheeky bastards, turns out they had arranged this too? Luke smiled and gave me a thumbs-up while Missile mouthed ""Just do it."" So I did it.

""I... I kinda like you, hehe"" (it probably sounded even more awkward than it does here)

""Oh, Arlon""

And we shared our first kiss. I was in heaven.

My heaven would last through the three years we dated. Then, just when I thought our relationship was truly budding, we broke up. Yes, it was that abrupt. Trucy loved someone else now, and I was left behind.

The feeling in my chest that I experienced that day, cannot be described in words. Suffice to say, I was devastated, heartbroken. I went home the day she broke up with me without speaking a word to anyone. When I got home, I shut the door and tried to rationalise with myself.

""It's ok Arlon. You'll manage. There are plenty other girls out there""

""Don't be sad Arlon. it was not meant to be.""

But the more I thought about it, the worse I felt. Over the next few days, Luke and Missile tried to talk me out of it, tried to make me forget it, get it over with. But it did not help. I slipped further and further into depression. Yes, I started hanging out late and doing drugs. Yes, I started doing alcohol. I went from respectable, generally nice guy to a coke-snorting, chain-smoking hobo. But through all this, Luke and Missile stood by me. Shame on me that I didn't appreciate them then. I remember once, I, in a drunken stupor, smashed a bottle and used it to stab Missile, who was trying to stop me from drinking so much ( and probably get alcohol poisoning).

That was the end of it between me and Missile.

I tried committing suicide once. I climbed to the top of the roof and jumped down. I got caught in some tree branches and ended up on the ground with only a gash across my leg. I cursed the heavens loudly for letting me survive. Mr Anderson, alerted by the noise, quickly brought me in and wrapped up my wound. I sobbed as he picked up the phone to dial my parents, who were at work.

A year later, I saw Trucy outside a bar with her new boyfriend. I couldn't control myself and rushed up to them.
""YOU RUINED MY LIFE!""

The two of them were taken by surprise and the boyfriend raised his fist.

""YOU TOOK HER FROM ME"" I yelled. ""YOU TOOK MY LIFE FROM ME!"" and I swung wildly at him. Suddenly, there was an excruciating pain in my abdomen. I screamed, then I collapsed.

Next thing I remember seeing was the cold, sterile hospital ceiling. I awoke to find Luke, Trucy and my parents by my side, her boyfriend leaning against the wall.

The doctor came in, and revealed to me that I had a tumor in my liver. I started to cry. I had wasted my life, all my potential, over one stupid breakup. Why did I start doing drugs? Why did I start doing alcohol?

""It should be okay,"" the doctor said. ""But we'll need to monitor it for a while to look for any unusual developments. Rest now, ok?""

My tears turned into those of joy. It was like being born again. I had a second chance. It was time to turn over a new leaf.

At the advice of Mr Anderson, my parents put aside their pride and hired a professional counsellor to guide me through the tough times. I also had to take antidepressants. But I was getting better. Trucy agreed that she had handled the breakup badly, and we promised to keep in touch, if only just as friends.
I would laze in the couch feeling a little blue. Today, I was feeling it a little more than usual. I started playing Metal Gear Soild V half-heartedly to take my mind off it, when the doorbell rang. It was Luke.

""Came to visit,"" he said. ""How are things?""

""Oh, they're alright.""

We chatted for a while. Then he said. ""Cheer up, old sport. Here, have a look at this, figured you would find it funny."" He whipped out his iPhone 6 and opened up 4chan.
And that's how I got cancer.","As I type this, I am slowly dying of cancer. This is my story, and I hope whoever reads this takes this as a warning.",2

Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin.  Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, and Captain Crunch.  The grave site was piled high with flours. 

Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded.  Born and bread in Minnesota, Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers.  He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. 

Despite being a little flaky at times, he still was a crusty old man, and was considered a positive roll model for millions.  Doughboy is survived by his wife Play Dough and three children: John Dough, Jane Dough and Dosey Dough, plus they had one in the oven.  He is also survived by his elderly father, Pop Tart. 

The funereal was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.

In a first grade class, they were practicing rhyming. The teacher stood before the class and asked the kids to find words that rhymed with whatever word she would say.

There, of course, was one young boy named Johnny who always found a way to make things dirty. Today was no different.

The teacher asked the class, 'Can anyone tell me a word that rhymes with ""Pick""?'

The teacher realized her mistake as soon as Johnny raised his hand as quickly as he could. She could not allow him to say something inappropriate when the parents were all here.

To the teacher's delight, Susie also raised her hand, and the teacher promptly asked Susie what word she had come up with.

'Sick', Susie said.

'Very good, Susie', the teacher said, and Susie's mother looked very proud.

The teacher continued and this time asked for a word rhyming with the word ""class"".

Once again, Johnny raised his hand faster than a speeding bullet, and was visibly anxious to give his answer.

The teacher, just like before, realized her poor choice or word. Even though she felt bad for snubbing Johnny again she prayed that someone else raise their hand. As if responding to her prayers, Billy raised his hand. The teacher pointed to Billy and he responded with ""Brass"".

'Well done, Billy' The teacher said.

For the next word, the teacher felt she had to let Johnny answer. She wouldn't want to pick someone else over him a third time, especially not in front of his parents. So she thought for a moment looking for a word that could not possibly rhyme with something dirty. She eventually came up with a word, almost chosen at random.

'Now, class. Can anyone name a word that rhymes with the word ""wharf""?'

Johnny, with a proud smirk on his face, raised his hand and the teacher pointed to him.

'Yes, Johnny, would you please tell us your word' the teacher said.

Johnny stood up and said as loud as he could 'A dwarf, with a fucking huge cock!'",First grade rhyming NSFW,1

On the other end of the bench sits an old man, who is holding the reins of a camel which stands next to him. The journalist, feeling impatient, glances at his watch only to find that it has stopped working. Turning to the old man beside him, he decided to ask the time.
&gt;
Journalist: Excuse me, do you happen to know the time? 
Old man: one moment please...

The old man reaches to the camel beside him and gently cups it's scrotum in his hands, carefully lifting it a few inches. 
&gt;
OM: It is about 1:00.

The journalist was shocked, but also curious. He was very familiar with the local customs, but this was something he had never heard of before and he had to know more. Having a fairly decent sense of time, the journalist decided to secretly test the old man on his accuracy while attempting to discern his methods. 
After waiting what seemed like a half hour, the journalist turned to the old man and asked him the time. One more, the old man carefully elevated the camel's testicles before lowering them and turning back to the journalist. 
&gt;
OM: It is about 1:30.

The journalist was shocked and decided that missing a few busses was worth uncovering the old man's secret. After counting out what he thought was ten minutes, he once again asked the old man the time. The old man, now annoyed, lifted the camels jewels up and down again and turned back to the journalist. 
&gt;
OM: It is currently 1:40.

By now the journalist was increasingly impatient and couldn't stand not knowing the old man's secret for a moment longer. 
&gt;
J: Ok, i just have to know, sir. How can you possibly know the time by lifting the camel's balls? 

The old man sighed and elevated the camel's package one last time. This time, however, he motioned beyond the leathery sack with an outstretched finger. 
&gt;
OM: There is a clock tower right over there!

""Mr. Jones?"" the doctor asks.


""Yes sir, what's happened? How is my wife?""


The doctor sits next to him and says, ""I have good news and I have bad news. First the bad news: Your wife's accident resulted in two fractures of her spine."" ""Oh my God"" says Mr. Jones. ""Will she ever recover?""


""Well, Mr. Jones, her vital signs are stable. However, her spine is inoperable. She'll have no motor skills or capability. This means you will have to feed her. Mr. Jones begins to sob. ""And you'll have to turn her in her bed every two hours to prevent pneumonia."" Mr. Jones begins to wail and cry loudly.


""Then, of course,"" the doctor continued, ""you'll have to diaper her as she'll have no control over her bladder and of course these diapers must be changed at least five times a day."" Mr. Jones begins to shake as he cries, sobs, wails. The doctor continues: ""And you'll have to clean up her feces on a regular basis as she'll have no control over her sphincter. Of course, you must clean her immediately to avoid bedsores.""

Now Mr. Jones is convulsing sobbing uncontrollably and beginning to withe off the bench into a sobbing pitiful mass.

Just then Dr. Smith reaches out his hand, pats Mr. Jones on the shoulder, and says ""I also have some good news.""

""What could possibly be good about this!"" wails Mr. Jones

Dr. Smith: ""I'm just fucking with you, she's dead.""",Mr. Jones gets a call from the hospital. They tell him his wife's been in a terrible car accident.,53

His whole life he has been a huge fan of tractors, his curtains and carpets had tractor patterns on, there were posters of John Deere's covering his walls, he even had his parents buy him a waffle maker that makes waffles in the shape of tractors. As he grew up and started to hit puberty John started, as all boys of his age do, being way too interested in impressing girls, he soon realized that girls don't really care much for tractors and this was proving to be a problem. On his 18th birthday however he finally decided that something has to be done if he was ever going to stop the mockery from his friends for not having kissed a girl. But what was to be done? John decided that he was going to switch over to cars, it is a fairly easy swap and girls like cars, right? He went home that day and started taking down his curtains and ripped out his carpets and replacing them with car patterns, the posters were replaced next with pictures of Lamborghini's and Ferrari's. He even had his parents throw out his beloved waffle maker and have them replace it with one that makes waffles in the shape of cars. With John's whole life now changed he decided he would go in to town to the local bar for a well deserved beer, so he makes the 10 mile drive into town and as he walks up to the bar he realizes that he forgot his wallet at home. He looks at the bartender and says ""Listen man I've had a long and emotional day is there anything I can do for just one beer"" now this was a typical small town bar, no windows and only one entrance to the building, the place was basically a walking fire hazard and obviously then a lot of smoke was hanging around in the bar at about eye level. So the bartender looks back at him and says ""You see all this smoke hanging around? If you can get all this smoke out, I will give you your beer"". John looks around a bit and inhales as much air as he can, and walks outside and exhales. He returns to find the bar without a trace of smoke and the bartender staring at him with eyes as big as plates. ""How the hell did you do that!"" he exclaims ""It's easy"" said John ""I'm an ex-tractor fan""",John grew up on a farm,8

So, Timmy's parents decide to send him to a local Catholic School which was said to be the best school in the neighbourhood. 

After his first day of Catholic school, Timmy sprinted past his parents and up the stairs into his room! He stayed in his rooms for hours in complete silence, only leaving to have dinner before rushing back upstairs!

When his parents checked on their son, they were completely amazed as they saw Timmy surrounded with math textbooks; studying in complete silence without any breaks! They couldn't believe their eyes! Although they wanted to know what made him change his mind, they decided not to ask and just let Timmy continue studying.

This continued to be Timmy's routine until Timmy and his parents were called in for an interview with the headmaster. As they're sitting in the room with the headmaster, Timmy's parents are utterly shocked as the headmaster tells them that their son is extremely gifted in math and, if he continues to improve, they could get him into any school they wanted!

Now Timmy's parents were incredibly curious! What made their son change his mind about math? When they asked him, little Timmy said this;

""Hi there, my friend."" Satan says. ""As part of a new management policy, a few things have changed. Instead of being whisked away to your eternal torment, you will be shown a series of rooms. Whichever room you select will be where you spend eternity. Understand?""

&amp;nbsp;

The man agrees, and Satan walks him down a hallway lined with doors. A little ways down, they stop, and Satan opens one. 

&amp;nbsp;

""Does this one suit you?"" he asks.

&amp;nbsp;

The man looks inside, a bit curious. The room is filled wall to wall with people standing on their heads on a hardwood floor, with demons holding pitchforks next to them, stabbing them every time they begin to fall over.

&amp;nbsp;

""Eh...I don't know...."" the man says.

&amp;nbsp;

""Ok, no problem, let's keep going."" Satan says. They keep traveling down the corridor, opening one door after another. Each one is nearly the same, people standing on their heads on different materials with demons standing ready to stab them if they fall over.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, they reach one last door, and Satan opens it. Inside, there are hundreds of men and women, all standing knee deep in the worst filth imaginable. Feces, urine, rotten meat, foul garbage, the most revolting substances in existence. However, they're all drinking coffee and chatting with the demons in the room, seemingly at ease.

&amp;nbsp;

After a few moments contemplation, the man indicates that this is the room that he wishes to spend eternity in. Satan agrees, ushers the man inside, and locks the door. The man slogs his way through the filth, grabs a cup of coffee from a table near the side of the room, and joins a group of people and demons in the back corner, chatting about everything from the political parties to which team they think will win the Superbowl.

&amp;nbsp;

Roughly 10 minutes after the man gets comfortable, a loudspeaker in the corner of the room crackles to life.

""Ok, break over. Back on your heads.""

Frank, being on the run and short on funds, he turned to what he knew best—robbing a bank. There were several customers in the bank, including John, the local Mormon bishop, a pillar of his community.

John always tried to find the best in people, and held himself to the highest moral standards. No drinking, no smoking, no swearing, and not even fast food would pass his lips.

And so when John saw Frank, he stepped in. He tried to tell Frank how, if he would now only do the right thing, that he, John, would speak on Frank's behalf and would do everything in his power to have his sentence reduced. Because John had a lot of pull in the local community, including personal friendships with the members of the parole board.

But Frank, desperate, hit John over the head, knocking him unconscious, and ran quickly out the bank with his loot, where he was soon caught and returned to prison, and several years added to his sentence.

John woke up in the hospital, surrounded by his friends and family. But everybody's relief was short lived, because something strange had happened to John. John was now swearing up a storm! The ladies and children present sat there in shock, while John lit the room up like a sailor, almost peeling the paint off the walls with his indecency.

John's wife shooed everyone out, and called for the doctor. Frantic with worry at such a big personality change in her husband, she asked the doctor if he had any idea what was wrong. And he replied,

""Oh yes, I've seen this before. When he was hit on the head, he was con cussed!""",A bank robber escaped from prison,0

Hard worker, but he has to be, growing up in the poor neighbourhoods of Moscow. Doesn't like violence, so he doesn't join the army, and the only thing he's really good at is physical labour. Poor Yuri's daily routine was basically to get out of bed in his cramped, dirty little bachelor apartment, really just a hole in the wall, then walk to work through muddy streets in the summer, slushy streets in the winter, and break his back for ten hours a day to get paid thirty rubles a month.


Every day, when he comes home, he falls asleep with the mantra in his head: Yuri, it's okay. Everyone has a difficult life here, and you are used to it. You are used to these hardships. Don't let them bother you. And every day, he'd wake up and do it all over again.


But, one day, as he was walking home from the quarry, he sees this huge billboard on the side of a building that had just been put up. Rise of capitalism and all that jazz. On the billboard is a beautiful Russian woman in a bathing-suit, posing and flashing her pretty teeth. Under the woman is the address to the local gymnasium and the phrase: LEARN TO SWIM! TEN RUBLES!


So, naturally Yuri is a bit hesitant. That's a third of his monthly earnings, but he sees the pretty girl on the advertisement and starts thinking, Yuri! Look at that! Maybe, if you go to the pool and learn to swim, you could meet a beautiful woman like that! Maybe this life of hardships and toil doesn't have to be so dull!


So, Yuri convinces himself to go. He saves up a bit of money, and sure enough, a week later he is at the gym and he slaps down the ten rubles to learn to swim. Now, while he didn't meet any beautiful women there because mostly it was just lonely guys who responded to the ad, he decided not to let that ruin the investment and he took to swimming with his entire being. His Russian work ethic made him excel in all his classes, and soon, he had learned the front stroke, the back stroke, and was swimming laps like an Olympic hopeful. For a time, he was very happy, but slowly, he realized he would not meet any beautiful women at the pool, and he was not learning anything else from the novice instructors.


So, he goes back to his usual life of hardships, working at the quarry, and only goes to the pool once in a while when he has a day off to keep up his swimming. But then, one day, as he is returning from work...he sees that the billboard has changed. LEARN TO DIVE! TWENTY RUBLES! With the sexy Russian woman now in a two-piece suit, nonetheless.


So, once again, Yuri says: Yuri! Look at that! Maybe, if you learn to dive, you could finally meet that beautiful woman, and at the very least, swimming will be exciting again! Maybe this life of hardships and toil doesn't have to be so dull!


Naturally, twenty rubles takes him a while to save up. He suffers incredible hardships, eating only the cheapest food. He doesn't pay his electricity bill for a month, and ends up spending many nights cold and shivering in addition to the usual hardships. However, it lasts only a few weeks and he has easily saved his rubles. Goes down to the gym and plunks down the money, informing the cashier that he intends to learn to dive!


So, he puts all his effort into learning to dive.Learns the half-gainer, full-gainer, back-flips, swan-dives... Mastered it all in less than a week. Our man Yuri was making high-dives at the end of the month that would have put him on the jet to Olympia.


Still, it wasn't enough to completely remove him from the hardships of reality. There were a few women in the class, but they were all future hopefuls that were ten or twelve years old. Yuri never met the hot woman from the billboard, but soon he was the best in his class...nay...in Russia! So he became dejected again with the fact that he could not learn anything more and started picking up overtime at the quarry instead of going to the pool. This only made him more miserable, and soon, he had accepted that his life of hardships was not going to get any better.


Then, one day, he sees a new billboard up on the building as he's coming home from work. This one has a beautiful American woman on it, smiling and waving in front of the Statue of Liberty. Under the picture is: COME TO AMERICA! FIFTY RUBLES!


Yuri sighs and convinces himself to keep walking. But the next day, and the next day, he sees that sign and that promise of a new life in America, and he gets to thinking: Yuri! What are you doing here? You are the best swimmer in all of Russia, and yet, you wallow in your life of hardships! You are the best diver in all of Russia, and yet you go every day to your depressing job! Yuri, maybe if you go to America, you can leave your life of tiring work and hardships behind, and finally meet some nice women! YES! Yuri, don't you see? This is a sign!


So, Yuri begins to save up all his money. He eats nothing but the poorest food and even starts going to the homeless soup kitchen to make sure he is strong enough to keep working all the overtime he is pulling in. He sells all his worldly possessions minus a few sets of clothes and his bathing suit. Finally, after suffering incredible hardships - long, exhausting days and near-sleepless, shivering nights for an entire month - he is able to finally sell his little apartment and scrape together the fifty rubles plus food for the two-week-long trip by steamer.


Yuri the Greatest Swimmer and Diver in all of Russia walks down to the harbour, finds the ticket counter and plops down the fifty rubles, saying to the lady: 'Take me to America! I am leaving this life of hardship behind!'


Now, Yuri gets on the boat and they leave the port, heading West that very afternoon. It is a fine, sturdy boat, so his fears are lessened right away, and there are many other passengers who are like him, and who have even heard of Yuri's excellent skill at diving, so he has lots of people to talk to. In fact, he's almost a celebrity on board. But, with nothing to do but stare out the windows or wander around on the deck, everyone starts to get restless and bored. Yuri gets tired of talking about diving with everyone so he basically just sits in his cabin room and does nothing.


But, of course, Yuri is used to hardships and manages to keep himself busy by imagining all the things he can do once he gets to America. In fact, one day, about half-way though the trip, he starts to figure out he could open up a swimming school, and this makes him very excited. Before he can start drawing out plans, however...BOOM!


The boat slowly comes to a stop in the middle of the ocean and the captain comes onto the intercom. He says that one of the engines broke down and it will be at least three hours before they will be moving again. This makes all the bored people even more antsy, and Yuri hears many people grumbling and mad and complaining as he walks around that day. Suddenly, he comes up with an idea!


He says to himself: Yuri, you are the best Swimmer in all of Russia, are you not? You are the best Diver in all of Russia, too! Why not use this time to enjoy the ocean and go for a dive? Surely the Captain wouldn't mind! And sure enough, word that an expert diver putting on a show circulates around the boat and the captain agrees, hoping it will entertain and calm the passengers as the repairs finish. The water is tranquil and beautiful. The air is warm and there have been no signs of sharks or danger for miles and miles. So, confident it is safe, Yuri finally runs to his cabin and changes into his bathing suit. He even looks at the clock to make sure he waited an hour after breakfast before swimming.


When he comes up onto deck, most of the ship is there to watch. Everyone is excited and whispering: he's Yuri! The best Diver in all of Russia! This will be quite a show! Yuri, well, he is filled with happiness and confidence, so he declares to the crowd: I will attempt my highest dive ever from the top of the crow's nest!


So, he climbs up the ladder to the crow's nest high above the deck. It takes him a few minutes to get up there, but by the time he has finished climbing, everyone is excited and even the crew is watching. So, without wanting to wait too long, Yuri stretches, readies himself, and even checks the air with a lick of his finger.""


Yuri takes a few steps back on the crow's nest, then runs and leaps into the air! Two back flips! Then, a corkscrew! Then, a front flip! Then...BAM!


Yuri missed the edge of the boat and accidentally hit the metal deck! And everyone is sure he's hurt or dead, but as everyone comes running up to him, shouting 'Yuri! Yuri! Are you alright!?! Yuri! Are you hurt? Yuri!!!' he gets up, rubbing his head painfully. Then, he turns to the surprised audience, and says: 'It's okay. I'm alright. I'm used to hard-ships.'",Let me tell you the story of Yuri the Russian Diver,37

That evening, the ensign asked his captain, “Sir, why, before every battle, do you ask for your red shirt?”
The captain replied, “Well, if I am wounded in battle, the blood will not show and the crew will continue to fight.”

-----------------------------------

Timmy was a smart student in the 4th grade, and he was a stickler to the rules. One day, the kids in his class were passing a note around and it found its way to Timmy. Passing notes was against the rules, and Timmy told the kid that he would not pass the note any further, but the teacher found the note in Timmy's possession.

""Timmy, you know you cannot pass notes! Go ahead, read what it says.""

Timmy opened the note and softly spoke, ""It just says, purple spaghetti.""

The teacher snatched the note from Timmy's hand, her face scrunched up with anger and she scolded him, ""How dare you! Go to the principals office this instant!""

Timmy wandered the halls confused, he opened the door to the principals office and sat down. The principal walked in shortly after, and confronted him, ""Timmy, you are such a good student, how did you end up here?"" 

Timmy then told the principal about how his teacher kicked him out of class, and it was all because of some note. The principal was confused, he asked, 

""Well, what did the note say?""

""Purple spaghetti.""

The principal slammed his desk and screamed, ""Timmy, get the hell out of my school, you are expelled!""

Timmy made his way home and was more confused than ever. He opened the door to his house and sat on the couch. His mom walked in the room and said, ""Timmy, what are you doing home so soon? School doesn't end for another 3 hours!"" Timmy then proceeded to tell his mother about how the teacher kicked him out of class and how the principal expelled him. All because of some note. His mother was baffled, she asked,

""Well, what did the note say?""

""Purple spaghetti.""

Timmy's mother released a wave of unrelenting anger, she started to yell and hit him, ""Timmy, get the fuck out of my house! You are no longer my child - just get out of here!""

Timmy walked the street of his neighborhood until he didn't recognize the houses anymore, he was lost. He found a bridge and took shelter under it. It was really dark, Timmy was hungry and scared. A police officer pulled up to Timmy and asked, ""Hey kid, what are you doing out here so late, it's past your curfew."" Timmy then described the story about how the teacher kicked him out of class, how the principal expelled him, and how his mother disowned him and kicked him out of the house. All because of some note. The police officer looked bewildered, he asked,

""Well, what did the note say?""

""Purple spaghetti.""

The cop instantly grabbed his shoulder radio and began spouting, ""Dispatch all units, we have a Purple Spaghetti at my location, need back up immediately."" He let go of the button and pulled out his baton and started to beat Timmy. The other officers showed up in less than a minute and began to pile onto Timmy, they threw him into the back of a squad car and drove him to the county jail.

He was placed in a holding cell with many other criminals. One man asked the other, ""What are you in for?"" The skinny, but intimidating man spoke up, ""I robbed a store at gunpoint, but the damn cops showed."" The next man in line spoke up, he was a giant man with a dead look in his eye, ""I killed my girlfriend because she wouldn't shut up."" Everyone looked at Timmy waiting for an answer, he finally spoke up. He revealed the story about how the teacher kicked him out of class, how the principal expelled him, how his mother disowned him and kicked him out of the house, and how he was assaulted by a police officer. All because of some note. The prisoners were astonished, and they all asked,

""Well, what did the note say?""

""Purple spaghetti.""

The prisoners began to pull out their shanks and jump Timmy, he was stabbed 43 times in the neck. 

His life left his eyes and he ascended to heaven. He found the pearly white gates and approached them. The man himself, God, turned to face him. A look of confusion sprawled across God's face, he spoke, ""Timmy, you are three years early, what happened?"" Timmy stated the story about how the teacher kicked him out of class, how the principal expelled him, how his mother disowned him and kicked him out of the house, how he was assaulted by a police officer, and how he was violently stabbed by prisoners. All because of some note. God was mystified, he asked,

""Well, what did the note say?""

""Purple spaghetti.""

God spoke, ""Timmy, you need to go down a floor.""

A trap door appeared below Timmy and he fell into the pits of hell. When he landed he encountered Satan. Shocked, Satan inquired, ""Timmy, you aren't supposed to be here for another 3 years, what happened?"" Timmy confessed the story about how the teacher kicked him out of class, how the principal expelled him, how his mother disowned him and kicked him out of the house, how he was assaulted by a police officer, how he was violently stabbed by prisoners, and how he was sent to hell by God. All because of some note. Satan was confused, he asked,

""Well, what did the note say?""

""Purple spaghetti.""

Satan said, ""Timmy, you need to go down one more floor.""

Timmy woke up with a cold sensation on his back, he was laying on the floor of a supermarket. He got up and looked around, his eyes still adjusting to new environment. It looked like the supermarket that he used to go to, but he knew it wasn't. He figured that he had nothing else to lose at this point, and he went up to the cashier and asked him, ""What does purple spaghetti mean?"" The cashier looked at him and said, ""Oh, purple spaghetti, I know a guy that knows all about that."" He pointed at a purple house across the street and informed, ""That guy sitting on the porch knows all about it.""

Timmy thanked the man and started to run out of the store. He reached the parking lot, his eyes were fixed on the house, he was so confused. His feet hit the pavement, and now he was crossing the street. Timmy felt a pain on his right side, and then he saw blackness. He was hit by a car.

Moral of the story: Look both ways before you cross the street. ",Purple Spaghetti,122

She walked slowly towards the first man and said ""what do you do for a living?"" 
shocked and scared the man could only reply ""barber""

The little girl said, ""I don't know, Daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do."" 

The next day Grandpa died. The father thought it was a strange coincidence. A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers, which went like this -- ""God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, and good-bye Grandma."" The next day the grandmother died. 

My goodness, thought the father, this kid is in contact with the other side. 

Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the Dad heard her say, ""God bless Mommy and good-bye Daddy."" 

He practically went into shock. He couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office. He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch sent in and watched the clock. He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be OK. He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. 

Finally midnight arrived, he breathed a sigh of relief and went home. When he got home his wife said, ""I've never seen you work so late, what's the matter?""

So what's your story?"" 

So the first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony."" 

""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. 

The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. 

""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here."" 

Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death.

He fell through a floor tile and ripped off both of his ears. Since he was permanently disfigured, he settled with the company for a rather large sum of money and went on his way. 

One day, Merv decided to invest his money in a small, but growing telecom business called Plexus Communications. After weeks of negotiations, he bought the company outright. But, after signing on the doted line he realized that he knew nothing about running such a business and quickly set out to hire someone who could do that for him. 

The next day he had set up three interviews. The first guy was great. He knew everything he needed to and was very interesting. At the end of the interview, Merv asked him, ""Do you notice anything different about me?"" And the gentleman answered, ""Why yes, I couldn't help but notice you have no ears."" 

Merv got very angry and threw him out. 

The second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy. He asked her the same question, ""Do you notice anything different about me?"" and she replied: ""Well, you have no ears."" 

Merv again was upset and tossed her out. 

The third and last interview was the best of all three. It was with a very young man who was fresh out of college. He was smart. He was handsome and he seemed to be a better businessman than the first two put together. Merv was anxious, but went ahead and asked the young man the same question: 

""Do you notice anything different about me?"" And to his surprise, the young man answered: ""Yes. You wear contact lenses."" Merv was shocked, and said, ""What an incredibly observant young man. How in the world did you know that?"" 

The young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, ""Well, it's pretty damn hard to wear glasses with no ears!""

Suddenly, the lion grabs her by the collar of her jacket and tries to pull her inside to slaughter her, under the eyes of her screaming parents. The biker jumps off his Harley, runs to the cage and hits the lion square on the nose with a powerful punch.

Whimpering from the pain the lion jumps back letting go of the girl, and the biker brings the girl to her terrified parents, who thank him endlessly. A reporter has watched the whole event.

The reporter addressing the Harley rider says, “Sir, this was the most gallant and bravest thing I’ve seen a man do in my whole life.”

The Harley rider replies, “Why, it was nothing, really. The lion was behind bars. I just saw this little kid in danger, and acted as I felt right.”

The reporter says, “Well, I’ll make sure this won’t go unnoticed. I’m a journalist, you know, and tomorrow’s paper will have this story on the front page. So, what do you do for a living, and what political affiliation do you have?”

The biker replies “I’m a U.S. Marine, a Republican and I’m voting for Trump.”

The journalist leaves.

The following morning the biker buys the paper to see if it indeed brings news of his actions, and reads, on the front page:

""Welcome to Hell!"" He exclaims, rushing the man out of the marble clad lobby. ""Before you ask me who I am, I am the Devil and I am most pleased to announce to you, because of your service as such an important figure - you will get to spend a day in Hell, and a day in Heaven and choose where you want to go!"" 

Flabbergasted the former senator exclaims, ""Why... I would want to be in Heaven wouldn't I!?"" The Devil laughed. 

""Sir, that is completely up to you - now we have big days planned for so please, think carefully about where you wish to go."" It was at this point the senator was ushered into the most luxurious limousine he'd ever experienced and was whisked away down a boulevard reminiscent of the golden age of Hollywood; lined with gorgeous buildings, exquisite palm trees and beautiful people milling around the main street shops. 

He was taken to a country club and was met with all of his former friends who greeted him with open arms and wide smiles and invited him out to play some golf. 

The men reminisced, finished their game and went on to have the greatest meal of their lives in the clubhouse - champagne, filet mignon, lobster you name it it was probably on the table and that night the men headed to a hotel where they were allowed to indulge in whores and drugs. 

Once the senator had fallen asleep he was awoken very early by the Devil who told him it was time to visit St. Peter. So he gets dressed and begrudgingly is led to an elevator in the lobby which will take him to meet St. Peter in heaven. 

After what felt like an eternity the elevator stops and when the doors open he is met with a very short, very tired, very old man with a long flowing beard. 

""Welcome to Heaven."" He says, motioning the senator to follow him. IT was much different than Hell - everything was white and it looked like a hospital - long corridors which led to millions of different rooms, people all in robes floating about and something else he noticed was it was very, very quiet. 

He milled about for the day, talking to people and learning about their past lives and becoming bored out of his damned mind wishing the day would end. Eventual it would and St. Peter comes up to him and says, ""So senator, what will it be?"" 

""Well... in truth, I miss my friends and frankly, Hell was just so much more fun! This is just so boring and there is *nothing* to do! I want to be back in Hell!"" 

""As you wish,"" St. Peter said and with a flick of his wrist the senator is whisked away in a haze and suddenly lands quite hard on what feels like a bed of gravel. 

He looks around and gasps. 

The palm trees, buildings, people were nowhere to be seen, replaced by raging fires, demons and monsters, and various torturing of so many people around him. He turns his head and out of nowhere a half man, half goat creature appears and laughs at the man. 

""I see you're mine now!"" He exclaims. The senators breathes in deeply. 

""M-my friends! The golf course! Where did it go!? Why am I here!?"" This was met with an even more booming laugh.

""Senator one would think you'd be familiar with this game by now... yesterday we were merely campaigning. Today... you voted.""  ",[LONG] So a senator dies...,124

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",My favorite joke: Everyone Knows Dave,54898
