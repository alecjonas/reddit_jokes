The bartender offers him a drink. The fisherman says he does not have money to pay, so instead he offers a trade-- if he can get the bartender to laugh at his joke, then the bartender should provide a drink for free. The bartender, a smug, old pirate of a man accepts. After all, he is a moderator of /r/jokes, so he has become very accustomed to not laughing.  
  
The fisherman begins his tale. ""Years ago, I set out on a whaling expedition, when a fellow sailor told me about the mystical golden fishing rod.""

""Let me stop you right there"" says the bartender. I can see where this is going. Golden rod. This is a sex joke. I've heard it before.""  
  
""No. It's not a sex joke"" says the fisherman.  
  
The bartender, fascinated, realizes that this may actually be OC.  
  
The fisherman continues his tale. ""There once was a mystical golden fishing rod that was said to be so powerful that anyone using it could catch any fish.""  
  
""Wait a minute"" says the bartender. ""I think you're in the wrong place. This sounds like the tale of Darth Plagueis. You want /r/prequelmemes down the street"".  
  
""No. It's not a prequel meme"" says the fisherman.  
  
The fisherman continues his tale. ""One day, a little boy found the rod and used it to catch a lion fish. Neptune, god of the sea appeared. He was furious because the lion fish was his best friend. In retaliation, Neptune broke the rod into pieces, separating the rod and the reel. The little boy said 'Now I am sad'.  
  
""Oh, come on!"" said the bartender. ""Hey, Sad. I'm neptune! You want /r/dadjokes. Don't waste my time"".  
  
""No. It's not a dadjoke"" says the fisherman.  
  
The fisherman continues his tale. ""The boy took the pieces home, but they never worked again. Eventually, the rod was sold at a flea market, and the reel became the subject of many jokes.""  
  
The fisherman then asks ""So, what did you think?""  
  
The bartender, confused, looks up. ""What? That's it?""  
  
The fisherman nods.   
    
The bartender, now, is very confused. It's OC, sure, but it doesn't make any sense.   
  
He scratches his head and asks a question ""What do you mean about the reel becoming the subject of many jokes?""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Everyone knows Dave.,61

Of course, the wife promptly hacked her first shot right through the window of the biggest house adjacent to the course.

The husband cringed, 'I warned you to be careful! Now we'll have to go up there, find the owner, apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us.'

So the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. A warm voice said, 'Come on in.'

When they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the pieces of window glass.

A man reclining on the couch asked, 'Are you the people that broke my window?'

'Uh...yeah! , sir. We're sure sorry about that,' the husband replied.

'Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you.. You see, I'm a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for my self.'

Wow, that's great!' the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, 'I'd like a million dollars a year for the rest of my life.'

'No problem,' said the genie 'You've got it, it's the least I can do.. And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!'

'And now you, young lady, what do you want?' the genie asked.

'I'd like to own a gorgeous home in every country in the world complete with servants,' she said.

'Consider it done,' the genie said. 'And your homes will always be safe from fire, burglary and natural disasters!'

'And now,' the couple asked in unison, 'what's your wish, genie?'

'Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle, and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have sex with your wife.'

The husband looked at his wife and said, 'Gee, honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?'

She mulled it over for a few moments and said, 'You know, you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?'

You know I love you sweetheart,' said the husband. I'd do the same for you!'

So the genie and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying each other.

The genie was insatiable. After about three hours of non-stop sex, the genie rolled over and looked directly into her eyes and asked, How old are you and your husband?'

'Why, we're both 35,' she responded breathlessly.

'No Kidding,' he said.

'Thirty-five years old and you both still believe in genies?'",Husband and wife accidentally discover a genie,2839

A Man Walks Into a Bar...

he leans over and says to the bartender, ""Hey, will you give me a free beer if I show you something so amazing that I can guarantee you've never seen it before?""
The bartender says, ""Okay, but it had better be good.""
The man reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a hamster. He sets the hamster down on the bar. It scurries about, jumps off the end, turns a perfect somersault in midair, and lands on the piano. He then begins to dance across the keys, playing the piano beautifully. The bartender says, ""Wow! That was truly incredible! Have a beer.""
The man finishes his beer and says to the bartender, ""Hey, if I show you something else that is so amazing I can guarantee you've never seen before, will you give me another free beer?""
""If it's as amazing as that hamster, then sure,"" the bartender replies.
So the man reaches into his other coat pocket and pulls out a frog. He sets the frog down on the bar, and the frog begins to sing beautifully. The bartender is again amazed, and the man earns another beer.
As the man is drinking his beer, a guy at the other end of the bar walks over and says, ""What a performer! I'll give you $500 for that frog.""
The first man says, ""It’s a deal!"" and sells the guy his frog. The bartender shakes his head slowly. ""Not that it's any of my business, mind you, but that was a real, live singing frog. Why would you sell it for only $500? You could have made millions off of it.""
The man says, ""Nah, don't worry. The hamster's also a ventriloquist.""

When the Head Nurse Director became aware of Jenna's heroic act she immediately ordered her to be discharged from the hospital, as she now considered her to be mentally stable.

When she went to tell Jenna the news she said, ""Jenna, I have good news and bad news. The good news is you're being discharged, since you were able to rationally respond to a crisis by jumping in and saving the life of the another person. I have concluded that your act displays sound mindedness. The bad news is, Harold hung himself in the bathroom with his bathrobe belt right after you saved him. I am so sorry, but he""s dead.""

They hadn't been seeing each other for very long and she lived a considerable distance away.
He consulted with his sister and decided after careful consideration, that a pair of good quality gloves would strike the right note, not too romantic and not too personal.
Off he went with his sister to Harrods ladies dept and they selected a dainty pair of fur lined quality leather gloves. His sister bought a pair of knickers for herself at the same time.
Harrods had a free gift wrap offer but the assistant mixed up the two items, the sister got the gloves and Ron got the knickers.
Good old Ron sent off his gift wrapped present in a parcel with the following letter:
Dear Vicky,
I chose these because I've noticed that you are not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. If it had not been for my sister I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears shorter ones (which are easier to remove).
These are a very delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled at all.
I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little bit tight on her. She also said that they rub against her ring which helps keep it clean. In fact she hasn't needed to wash it since she began wearing them.
I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other hands will touch them before I have a chance to see you again.
When you take them off remember to blow into them a little bit because they will be naturally a little damp from wearing.
Just imagine how many times my lips will kiss them during the coming year.
I hope you will wear them for me on our next date.
All my love
Ron.
P.S. My mum tells me that the latest style is to wear them folded down with a little bit of fur showing.

Edit: confirmed it’s Ron!",Christmas shopping (long),2

She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss company. The sign reads, ""If you can catch me, you can have me.""

Without a second thought, he takes off after her. A few miles later  puffing and puffing, he finally gives up. The same girl shows up for the  next four days and the same thing happens. On the fifth day, he weighs  himself and is delighted to find he has lost 5lbs as promised.

He calls the company and orders their 5-day/10lbs program. The next day  there's a knock at the door and there stands the most stunning,  beautiful, sexy woman he has ever seen in his life. She is wearing  nothing but Reebok running shoes and a sign around her neck that reads,  ""If you catch me you can have me"".

Well, he's out the door after  her like a shot. This girl is in excellent shape and he does his best,  but no such luck. So for the next four days, the same routine happens  with him gradually getting in better and better shape.

Much to  his delight on the fifth day when he weighs himself, he discovers that  he has lost another 10lbs as promised. He decides to go for broke and  calls the company to order the 7-day/25 lbs program.

""Are you  sure?"" asks the representative on the phone. ""This is our most rigorous  program."" ""Absolutely,"" he replies, ""I haven't felt this good in years.""

About 30 minutes pass and he looks back to that seat... Empty!

So he walks down to this empty seat and talks to an older man who's sitting next to it.

""Excuse me,"" he says to the old man, ""is this seat taken?""

The old man responds, ""oh, well it was supposed to be my wife's, but she died..""

""Oh, I'm so sorry"" the man exclaims, ""wasn't there a family member or other loved one you could've given that ticket?""

The old man smirks, ""Nahh, they're all at the funeral!""

&amp;#x200B;

They loaded up Jack's mini van and headed north.

After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard.

They pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who

answered the door if they could spend the night.

&amp;#x200B;

""I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house

all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,"" she explained. ""I'm afraid the

neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Don't worry,"" Jack said. ""We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if

the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light."" The lady agreed, and

the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night.

&amp;#x200B;

Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way. They

enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.

&amp;#x200B;

About nine months later, Jack got an unexpected letter from an attorney.

It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined

that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the

ski weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

He dropped in on his friend Bob and asked, ""Bob, do you remember that

good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up

North?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, I do."" said Bob

&amp;#x200B;

""Did you happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house

and pay her a visit?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes,"" Bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out. ""I have to

admit that I did.""

&amp;#x200B;

""And did you happen to use my name instead of telling her your name?""

&amp;#x200B;

Bob's face turned red and he said, ""Yeah, sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I

did. Why do you ask?""

&amp;#x200B;

""She just died and left me everything.""

Steve was an ugly tomato, but Bill liked him. He had grown up in the same house together, a house with big plastic windows, and stifling humidity. Tomatoes are an insular, but rowdy, bunch. Only like to hang out with other tomatoes, and usually drink in terrifying excess when in groups.

""Martha, I had the worst day. I don't even know where to start...""

&amp;#x200B;

*Bill was a marketing consultant for the local private investigator, Larry, who was a celery stalk. Bill liked Larry, but sometimes did not approve of Larry's personal life; Larry had a tendency to ""investigate"" the homes of young fruits and vegetables, under the guise of his career. Bill knew Larry was just a creep, using his job as a cover for his awful fetish.*

*Larry had left on a ""job"" in the late afternoon, making Bill promise to stay on until his return to file paperwork on the case. So Bill waited at the office.*

*And waited.*

*5 o'clock, Bill's usual dismissal, rolled by.*

*Then 6 o'clock.*

*At half past six, Bill refilled his coffee cup for the last time, before resolving to leave the office no later than 7 o'clock, as he was already late for Steve's party.*

*At 6:58, as Bill was packing his briefcase to leave. The phone rang. Bill answered.*

*""Hello, may I please speak to William P. Lewis? This is Officer Redmond from the Farmdale police department.""*

*""Oh hey, Steve. This is Bill speaking - is everything okay?""*

*""Oh hi, Bill. I'm afraid not. A couple patrolmen saw a celery stalk hiding in the bushes by the public pool this afternoon, keeping too close an eye on a couple sunbathing tomatoes.""*

*Bill was a tad confused.*

*""Steve, that makes sense. Larry had mentioned he would be investigating over that direction today. But what's the problem?""*

*""Bill - I don't know how to say this, but he seemed to have been taking a, well...a bit too much pleasure in his job today. We've got him locked up for indecent exposure, among a variety of other charges.""*

*Bill thanked Steve, and hung up the phone. He wasn't sure how he would fix this. Beyond the terrible PR that the announce of this arrest would be, it was almost certain that Larry would lose his license. Bill knew he would have to find a new job. He sat at his desk, looking around the small, drab office, before slowly gathering each of his belongings into his satchel, and heading out for Steve's.*

*It was nearly 8:30 - two hours after Bill intended to arrive, when he rolled into the party. When Steve answered the door, it was clear to Bill that Steve was well past a pleasant state of inebriation. He was gone, and from the sounds of the drawling roar from the living room, all the other tomatoes were in the same condition.*

&amp;#x200B;

Martha's face softened, seeing that her husband was clearly exhausted from his day. But she was still a bit confused, Steve usually stayed at Steve's until well past midnight, and it was only 9:15.

""Honey, I'm sorry to hear that. But why aren't you at Steve's?""

""Well Marth,"" Bill called Martha Marth sometimes - a pet name...tomatoes aren't a particularly creative bunch, ""I was stuck at work late today, waiting for Larry, but then Larry was arrested and thrown in jail.""

Martha interupted, ""In jail? For what?""

Bill sighed, ""Not important. But I need to find a new...""

""Job!? Honey, you know how thin the labor market for tomatoes is. How will we manage?""

Bill hated when Martha interupted him, but he didn't have the energy to be upset with her at this point.

""Marth, we'll manage, we always do.""

""Okay. But why didn't you go to Steve's to let off some steam after such a bad day?""

""Well, I rolled over there as soon as I got out of work. But when I got there...""

""Yeah?""

""...all my friends were already smashed, and I didn't want to ketchup. How was the pool, today?""","Bill, the tomato, came home to his wife, earlier than expected.",0

Captain Zickerman looked out into the wide sea. The sky was clear a few hours ago. It isn't now. He saw the heavens shrouded with colossal clouds. This was not a strange experience for him. What was strange however, was the colour of the clouds. They were bright purple.

He was confused, sure; but there was nothing he could really took about it. He took a picture to tell it to his friends when he would get home. He wasn't particularly concerned. Perhaps it was just a strange feat of nature. Whatever the cause of the phenomenon was, it didn't feel that threatening.

But then it started raining. Not like storm raining, but closer to drizzle raining. Rain itself is a daily event in the life of a seaman. But to Zickerman's surprise, the rain was a dark reddish-brown. Was it blood? Was it ketchup? was it wine? He could not tell. The Sun had set a few minutes ago, and the rain had started cloaking the little trace of light there was. The waters turned red from the downpour.

Zickerman looked around in an emotion, that was equally close to fear and awe. The twilight sky was fogged with a mist of the same colour as the rain. The mariners were equally startled

Zickerman told them to set course for the closest land around them. Before the storm, they were three hour's distance from Bermuda. Apparently, the fog was too thick. They had lost signal to GPS satellites. Zickerman had an apprehensive feeling that the only thing they would do is make the red waters redder. Dismal, he sent an SOS signal. No response.

He sent another one. He was otherwise powerless at this point. He picked up a response.

""Hello, this is Micheal Brown aboard The Middlesborough. We have received your signal and will come to help you as soon as possible. What is your name and which ship are you on?""

""Thank God!"", exclaimed Zickerman, "" I'm James Zickerman on The Musketeer. As to our emergency, all I can say is:""

Both nations, hungering for world domination, have been at war with each other for over 20 years, and have decided that the fighting would never end, as the two were so closely matched in battle. In a last ditch effort to stop the bloodshed, the two leaders decided that in 10 years time, a dogfight would take place. The winning dog's nation would win the war, and become the supreme nation.

In Russia, Dog breeders worked with biologists, crossbreeding different species of wolves, trying to make the toughest, meanest, and deadliest dog to ever live. The dog was given steroids, fed with small animals, and had to be contained in a steel cage in order to keep it's handlers safe. People were afraid of this dog. There was no way whatever the Americans were doing could have possibly been stronger than this beast.

Finally, on May 25th, 2145, the dogs, their handlers, and the nations' leaders arranged to have the dogfight.

When the Russian dog was released, it burst into the arena, ready to kill. A few moments later, a large wooden crate with air holes was carried to arena, and opened. What emerged was pathetic. Out waddled an 8 foot long Weiner dog, that looked like it just woke up. It must have weighed 400 pounds, and was very clearly not in the best shape. The a Russian dog pounced, tearing chunks off of the Weiner dog with each bite. Finally, in one swift motion, the Weiner dog wraps around it's opponent, opens it's moth, and swallowed it's prey in one bite.

The Russian president opened his mouth to speak, but had no words. Finally, after a few minutes of dumbfounded silence, he says ""But.. how? We spent millions of dollars creating that beast. It could not be beaten.""
The US president simply shrugged and said ""while you were busy doing that, we had our best plastic surgeons try to make a crocodile look like a dog.""

One day in class I was sleeping and my teacher caught me and called on me to answer the question. I told her I didn’t know the answer because I was sleeping so she said just to say something to move the class along. I had no idea what to say so I just blurted our “Big Purple Fuzzy Feathers”. She got so mad at me that she sent me to the principal’s office. I didn’t know what I did wrong but still walked out.
The principal asked me what happened and I said “well in class I was sleeping and the teacher asked me a question. I didn’t know the answer but she just wanted me to say something. I had no idea what to say so I just blurted something out.” He said “well what did you say?” I said “Big Purple Fuzzy Feathers.” The principal got so heated he immediately called my parents to have a parent teacher conference and tell them what I’d done. I was still confused but figured I couldn’t argue back.
My parents arrived and asked what happened? I said “Well in class I was sleeping and the teacher asked me a question. I didn’t know the answer but she just wanted me to say something. I had no idea what to say so I just blurted something out. She got mad and sent me to the principal’s office. I told him and he got mad and called you so now I’m here talking to you.” They said “What did you say?” I said “Big Purple Fuzzy Feathers.” Then THEY got mad and told me how awful I was and sent me to a very strict boarding school. 
Fast forward and I am now 18 years old about to graduate. As I walk out of school a cop pulls up and says “Hey, I’ve seen you around before. You’re pretty quiet, so why are you at such a strict place meant for the toughest kids?” I said “Well back in elementary school, I was sleeping and the teacher asked me a question. I didn’t know the answer but she just wanted me to say something. I had no idea what to say so I just blurted something out. She got mad and sent me to the principal’s office. He got mad and called my parents. And when I told them what happened, they sent me here. And now I’m here talking to you.” He said “Well what did you say?” I said “Big Purple Fuzzy Feathers.” He immediately jumped out of his car and started chasing me saying I was under arrest. I had absolutely no idea why me saying that was such a terrible offense but I knew it would look bad having an arrest on my record so I ran and hid inside a nearby church. The cop lost sight of me and as I was hiding, a nun walked up and asked me what was wrong and why I was there. I said “Well back in elementary school, I was sleeping and the teacher asked me a question. I didn’t know the answer but she just wanted me to say something. I had no idea what to say so I just blurted something out. She got mad and sent me to the principal’s office. He got mad and called my parents. And when I told them what happened, they sent me to a strict boarding school. Years later a cop asked me why I was there and when I told him, he chased me and now I’m here talking to you.” She said “Well what did you say?” I said “Big Purple Fuzzy Feathers.” Then SHE starts to chase me. I lose her and vow to never say that word again as it keeps getting me in trouble even though it was a random thing I said. 
Fast forward 10 years later and one night I am in bed with my wife. She says “Hey, so I was thinking about where our kids might go to school when we have them. What was that boarding school like and why did you go there? Isn’t it super strict and rough?” I said “Well back in elementary school, I was sleeping and the teacher asked me a question. I didn’t know the answer but she just wanted me to say something. I had no idea what to say so I just blurted something out. She got mad and sent me to the principal’s office. He got mad and called my parents. And when I told them what happened, they sent me to a strict boarding school. Years later a cop asked me why I was there and when I told him, he chased me down the street. I hid in a church and told a nun what happened but then she also chased me. I got free and now ten years later I’m here talking to you.” She said “Well what did you say?” I was afraid to say it but hey, she’s my wife. What harm could it do? I said “Big Purple Fuzzy Feathers.” She got so mad she kicked me out of the house screaming she wanted a divorce. 
Feeling awful and confused, I walked down the road and just into town, not knowing what to do or where to go. I then noticed a small building with a sign saying it was a lawyer’s office. I thought “This is it! I won’t let her win a big settlement in the divorce for something so silly that doesn’t even mean anything! It was a random phrase I blurted out as I kid. I will work this out.” I run across the road and get hit by a bus, dying in the accident.

The snow was blowing so fast and piling up so high, I couldn't see any street signs. With no map in my car and a dead cell phone, I thought I might be stranded so I pulled over to the side of the road. 

Then breaking through the flurries, I saw the headlights of a plow truck in my rearview mirror. Thanking my lucky stars, I turned in and followed the truck, hopeful that it would lead me back somewhere I recognized.

I followed that truck for what felt like hours. He turned left, I'd turn left. He'd swing to the right, and I was right on his tail. After a while, I saw brake lights from the plow, followed by four-way flashers. The plow had stopped, and I saw the driver get out and approach my car. I rolled down the window to talk to him.

""Why are you following me, kid?"" the plow driver asked.

""Well sir, my dad told me if I was ever lost in a snowstorm, I should wait for a plow truck and then follow it.""

""Well,"" said the plow driver. ""I just finished clearing the Target parking lot. Want to follow me over to Best Buy??""","When I was learning to drive in the winter, my Dad told me, ""If you're ever lost in the snow, wait for a plow truck, then follow it.""",2499

She boldly walked over to the sleeping man, raised his kilt, and saw what nature had provided him at his birth.

Her  friend said, ""Well, he has solved a great mystery for us, now! He must  be rewarded!"" So, she took a blue ribbon from her hair, and gently tied  it around what nature had provided the Scotsman, and the two walked  away.

The poke bowl.

To help add some punch to it, the owner enlists the help of an old experienced consultant chef. From what he’s heard, she is at the top of her field. 
He organises for her to come and turn things around for the better.

She arrives and a quick sample is made up.

The chef takes a mouthful. 
She looks deep in thought.

“So what do you think?” Asks the owner.

“The rice.. no not that... the nori... that... that is fine...” the elderly chef continues muttering to herself.

The owner, a bit fed up, asks again.
“How can I make it taste better?”

Just as he asks, the chef’s eyes light up. 
She blurts out one word “Tuna!”

“Tuna? Why tuna?” Exclaims the owner.

A fierce gust of air picks up around them, billowing the ancient chef’s grey hair.
The wind chimes outside clang and echo mysteriously. 

The woman looks into his eyes with piercing wisdom like she is about to speak to him an age old adage.

“For tuna flavours the bowl”

He stops, wondering what this is all about and notices an old guy sitting on the porch in a rocking chair. The guy says, ""Hey, What's up with the talking dog?"" The old guys answers, ""He's yours if you want him."" The guy scratches his head, thinking if the dog can really talk, he would be worth millions on the talk show circuit. ""Can I talk to him first?"" he asks. ""Sure."" the old man says, ""he's right around back."" So the guy walks around the side of the house to find an old dog laying in the shade. The guy walks up to him and says ""Can you really talk?"" The dog lifts up his head and looks at the guy. ""Of course I can talk."" The guy is absolutely flabbergasted. He can't think of anything to say. Finally, he just wants to hear talk some more, so he asks the dog to tell him the story of the dog's life.
