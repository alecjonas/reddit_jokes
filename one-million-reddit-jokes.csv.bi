ove a pond who wanted to drop an inch to eat some food. In that pond was a frog who said to themself “If that fly drops an inch I can jump and eat them!”. Under the water there was a fish who said to themself “If that fly drops an inch that frog will jump for it and I can burst out of the water and eat the frog!”. Above the water there was a bird who said to themself “If that fly drops an inch the frog will jump to eat it and the fish will burst from the water to eat the frog and I can swoop and eat the fish!”. On the shore a hunter stood and thought to themself “If that fly drops an inch then the frog will jump for the fly, the fish will burst for the frog, the bird will swoop for the fish and I can shoot the bird!”. A mouse stood behind the hunter and thought “Fly drops an inch, frog jumps, fish bursts, bird swoops, hunter shoots, and the recoil of the shot will knock the ham sandwich out of the hunter’s pocket!”. There is a cat. Watching the whole scene and they think “Fly drops an inch, frog jumps, fish bursts, bird swoops, hunter shoots, sandwich drops, mouse runs, I eat the mouse!”. 

Well... The fly drops an inch, the frog jumps to eat the fly, the fish bursts out of the water to eat the frog, the bird swoops to eat the fish, the hunter shoots at the bird, the recoil knocks the ham sandwich from his pocket, the mouse runs for it, and the cat goes for the mouse but slips and falls into the pond. The moral of the story? It takes a lot of foreplay to get a pussy wet.",A sequence of events...,11

""Simply hold a lighted match directly under his feet."" was the shop owner's reply.

The shop owner held a lighted match under the parrot's left foot. Chet began to sing: ""Jingle Bells! Jingle Bells! ..."" The shop owner then held another match under the parrot's right foot. Then Chet's tune changed, and the air was filled with: "" Silent Night, Holy Night...""

The young man was so impressed that he paid the shop-keeper and ran home as quickly as he could with Chet under his arm. When the wife saw her gift she was overwhelmed.

""How beautiful!"" She exclaimed, ""Can he talk?"" ""No,"" the young man replied, ""But he can sing. Let me show you."" So the young man whipped out his lighter and placed it under Chet's left foot, as the shop-keeper had shown him, and Chet crooned: ""Jingle Bells! Jingle bells!..."" The man then moved the lighter to Chet's right foot, and out came: ""Silent Night, Holy night...""

The wife, her face filled with curiosity, then asked, ""What if we hold the lighter between his legs?"" The man did not know. ""Let's try it,"" he answered, eager to please his wife.

post,efc001,2qh72,jokes,false,1577248335,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/efc001/billys_birthday_gift/,self.jokes,,"Little Billy just turned 8. His parents went all out for the party. They rented a bounce house. The cake was three layers. They even hired the best clown in the state. All of Billy's friends from school were there, even some of the older cool kids made it. At the end of the party, when everyone left, Billy's father gave him one last gift It was wrapped up in a large box. Billy opened the box up and inside was a slightly smaller box. Written on the box was ""Open me on your 80th birthday."" Billy's dad, who has a big grin on his face, said ""I guess you'll just have to wait."" Later that night, Billy barely got any sleep as he pondered whether or not to open the box anyway. It took a great amount of restraint, but he decided not to open the box.

Five years later, Billy was celebrating his 13th birthday. He'd reached a milestone and that year had been quite eventful. He was growing up, noticing girls. His parents got divorced. It was a mutual decision, and they both told him that it wasn't his fault. His mother, however, still felt the need to over-compensate on his birthday. She managed to reserve Billy's favorite arcade for him and his friends. Overall, he had a great day, but later that night, he remembered his dad's gift. He had it stashed away in the closet. He pulled the box out to open it up, but looked at those words on the box that said ""Open me on your 80th birthday"". Billy contemplated opening the box up anyway. He figured he waited long enough, but ultimately, he chose not to open the box, and put it back in the closet.

Another five years passed, and Billy was turning 18. This year we also eventful. His parents reconciled. He had a girlfriend. He was starting college after the summer. He didn't need anything this year, and yet his parents surprised him with a brand new car. He was as happy as can be. Still in the corner of his mind, however, was the gift he received from his father ten years ago. Later that year, when he was packing things up for college, he came across the box that read ""Open me on your 80th birthday."" Surely it would be okay enough to open now, wouldn't it?"" Billy held the box in his hands for a good five minutes before deciding to pack it away without opening it.

Many years passed, and Billy, who was now going by Will, was turning 36. He got married, started a family and finally finished school, earning his PhD. Alas, his father passed away that same year. So it wasn't all good news. Will couldn't help but think about that box. He held onto it all these years. Still written on the box was ""Open me on your 80th birthday."" His father passed. He could open the box now, right?"" In the end, he couldn't bring himself to do it. He wanted to respect his father's wishes.

Nearly 50 years passed, and Will had lived quite a life. After earning his doctorate, he began teaching at the same ivy league school here graduated from. His children grew up, followed in his footsteps and had kids of their own. He'd lived a long life. His wife, however, passed the previous year. And Will knew he wouldn't last much longer. His 80th birthday arrived. And even in his advanced age, he never forgot spot the box his father gave him decades ago. He kept it so long. Every birthday was a constant reminder. He wanted to know what was inside. But the very movement he grabbed the box, he became overwhelmed with excitement and suffered a heart attack before he could even open the box.

I bet you're thinking that's where the story ends, right? Well it isn't. Minutes later, the housekeeper found Will on the ground with the box in his hands. She was going to immediately call an ambulance, but here curiosity got the best of her. Written on the box was ""Open me on your 80th birthday."" She removed the lid from the box. Inside, bound but a paper clip, was eight $1 bills and a small note, which the housekeeper read aloud to herself.

""I knew you wouldn't be able to wait. Happy 8th birthday, Billy.""",Billy's birthday gift,28

“Well, where to begin... uhhhh let’s start with my credit, I took a dive of a FICO score from 670 to 450 in the last 6 months,  my boss is cracking down on these new reports that corporate wants done daily and it’s causing me to work late almost every night, I’m being sued by my brother for the items I took from my father’s estate while it was still being processed before his will reading- also, my father passed away and left me nothing. 

“My daughter comes home every night either high or drunk and throws up all over the shag carpet, my son is obsessed with these “furry” conventions that he spends whole weekends at, my wife claims I no longer satisfy her in bed and I’m 90 percent sure she’s been cheating on me for a year, which would suck because I would want a divorce if I found it to be true and I live in a state that votes largely in favor of the wife and I’d probably lose the house and I’m in a good position to refinance and take some cash out. 

“So, I just want to know how I can turn my life around. Can you help me doctor? Could you please help a fly who’s been abandoned by the good life he grew up dreaming of?”

The proctologist buried his face in his hands for a moment, inhaled deeply, and resurfaced to face the fly.

“You do understand that I’m not a therapist? I mean, I’m a proctologist! You must have some idea of what my profession is. What made you come in here and think I could help?”

The fly sighed, and pondered the proctologist’s question for a moment.

A wife is shopping for a Christmas present for her husband, and as with many couples, she had no idea at all what to get. 

She is walking past a pet store, when the sign in the window catches her eye; “Christmas Frogs! The best present for your husband!” And she thinks to herself, how can that be? But she has no leads on anything else, so she walks into the store to ask. 

""Tell me more about the Christmas Frog"", she asks the store keeper.

""Well, apparently"", she says in a hushed tone, ""they give the absolute best blow jobs.""

The wife is puzzled, but with no other idea on what to get, she has the store keeper wrap one up for her. 

The next day is Christmas, and she brings out the wrapped box for her husband. ""Merry Christmas!"", she says, with a peck on the check. 

He opens the box, and there is the frog, just staring at him. 

""What the hell is this?"", he says. 

""Well, apparently"", she says in a hushed tone, ""they give the absolute best blow jobs.""

He looked at her evenly, mutters thanks, and puts the box aside. 

That night, the wife is awoken from sleep by terrible noise in the kitchen. There is banging and crashing, and the sound of dishes breaking. She goes though to the kitchen, and the room is a total mess. There is flour on every surface. There are broken eggs on the floor, and dirty utensils everywhere. 

In the middle of all the mess is the Christmas Frog, wearing a tiny chef's hat, and a tiny little apron. She looks up at her husband, confused, but before she can say anything, he says to her:

""If that thing can cook, you are fucking out of here!""",The Christmas Frog,10

Einstein first serves them all a cup of what he says is dark coffee, but is in fact dark matter. So as soon as he begins counting, they all accelerate away from him at 299,792,458 meters per second. So to them it seems as though Einstein has stopped counting and they all stop and proceed to hide.

Pascal immediately grabs two strudels off of the table and holds them out above his head. Newton sees this and takes a piece of chalk from his pocket and draws a square around his feet and stands there. 

Eventually after what seems to them to be infinity and 29 seconds, Einstein finishes counting to 30 and begins his search. Even though he is standing right in front of Pascal he cannot find him, because, you know, in order to find Pascal you must determine the sum of the binomials above him, and, of course, it is impossible to determine the absolute value of Pi. 

Then, Einstein looks over and sees Newton just standing there and says, ""ah hah, I have found you!"" And Newton replies, ""No, now you have found Pascal, for I am one Newton per square meter!"".

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and his roommate than met the eye.

Reading his mom's thoughts, his son volunteered,

“I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, we are just

roommates.""

​

About a week later, his roommate came to him saying,

“Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?""

​

He said ,""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just

to be sure."" He sat down and wrote :

​

Dear Mother:

I'm not saying that you ‘did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you ‘did not' take the silver plate But the fact

remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.

​

Love,

your son.

​

Several days later, he received an email from

his Mother which read:

​

Dear Son:

I'm not saying that you ‘do' sleep with your roommate, and I'm not saying that you ‘do not' sleep with her.

But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed,

she would have found the silver plate by now, under her pillow…

Paddy, being a careful sort, doesn’t want to splash out on a new fan so he rings his best pal Tommy and asks Tommy if he’ll flap a towel over Paddy and Mary as they make love.  That evening Tommy comes round and waves a towel over the couple as they go at it. Two hours later, there’s still no difference, Mary is still unsatisfied.

“Paddy, I tell you what,” suggests Mary, “Why don’t you swap places with Tommy? You can flap the towel and Tommy and I can try the love making.”

Desperate, Paddy agrees. Within 5 minutes of Mary and Tommy making vigorous love Mary reaches a thunderous climax, and then again. And then again. Finally after an hour they both collapse on the bed, exhausted.”

One day the owner of the building decided to get a PA system installed on every level, in case there was ever a fire and everyone in the building needed to be contacted at once. The system was installed on every level: level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4, level 5, level 6, level 7, level 8, level 9, level 10, level 11, level 12, level 13, level 14, level 15, level 16, level 17, level 18, level 19, level 20, level 21, level 22, level 23, level 24, level 25, level 26, level 27, level 28, level 29, level 30, level 31, level 32, level 33, level 34, level 35, level 36, level 37, level 38, level 39, and level 40.

One day, an employee named John was doing some paperwork on the 21st level when he saw the pager for the PA system in his boss's office. He could not resist. He picked up the pager, turned it on, cleared his throat, and told a joke. It was funniest joke anyone in the building had ever heard. They were rolling in the aisles, laughing their heads off. The accountants on level 3 were in tears. The engineers on level 34 were in hysterics. In fact, workers on every level -- level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4, level 5, level 6, level 7, level 8, level 9, level 10, level 11, level 12, level 13, level 14, level 15, level 16, level 17, level 18, level 19, level 20, level 21, level 22, level 23, level 24, level 25, level 26, level 27, level 28, level 29, level 30, level 31, level 32, level 33, level 34, level 35, level 36, level 37, level 38, level 39, and level 40 -- could not stop laughing.

It is the winter, so he doesn’t have many crops as they have been harvested, and he decided he wants to begin doing some work on his land. This isn’t the best time, however because the best time to do land work is in the spring when it is warm and the land is at its peak. But he decided he wants to try and do it anyway. 

So the old farmer goes to his barn to collect his tools but noticed they’re all frozen, some stuck to their holders and others to each other. His rakes are stuck to the wall, his tills are stuck to the floor, and his hoes are stuck together. Seeing this he says, “My goodness, this is such a mess! My rakes are stuck to the wall, my tills are frozen to the ground, and my wife got drunk with her friend again and now they’re frozen to each other!

Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule. Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her Mother was coming to visit.  This stressed Santa even more. When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where.  More stress. Then when he began to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys. So, frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a shot of whisky.  When he went to the cupboard, he discovered that the elves had hid the bottle and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made from. Just then the doorbell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door. He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas tree.  The angel said, very cheerfully, ""Merry Christmas Santa. Isn't it just a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Isn't it just a lovely tree? Where would you like me to stick it?"" Thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the Christmas tree.",A Christmas Story,15

Few years back his wife passed away of old age.

Seeing the farm in neglect, all the domesticed animals on the farm called for an urgent meeting.

The cow, who was the leader said : ""Looks like the farm is in a state of neglect. John doesnt seem to care about cleaning, watering and other basics. We need to do something about the shit situation here. Theres excrement all over the farm. Its unhygienic, smells gross and it feels weird to even graze across the farm. We need to do something about the shit."" 

The rabbit, in order to impress the boss, stepped up said : ""I can be of help here. Ever heard of Coprophagia? It means that we, the rabbits can eat our own excrement. Hopefully that will make this farm cleaner.""

Seeing this, the chicken said : ""I think I can eat my droppings too.""

The dog stood up and said : ""I will eat my shit. It will keep  my den clean and protect my puppies from predators that might get drawn from its scent.""

All remaining animals came forward offering to eat thier own shit in order to keep the farm clean. 

The monkey, who was sitting on the tree silently, finally couldn't contain his curiosity. He came down from the tree slowly and everybody could see him shaking with fear. Afterall, the cow was known to be a arrogant leader with anger issues. The monkey gathered all his strength and said in his trembling voice: ""Hey leader cow, everybody has decided to eat thier shit for the better hygene of this farm. You are the leader of this farm. You should lead with an example. Can you atleast promise to eat your own cake?"" 

The cow, stomped her feet in anger and said : ""Aint gonna have my cake and eat it too""",Hygiene was an issue at the farm,7

He lays in bed, thinking back on his life - his children, his parents, and his beautiful wife of 55 years.

Just as his mind begins to wander into sleep, he suddenly gets drawn back out by a familiar smell. He quickly sits up in bed, trying to place this aroma. Invigorated by its scent, he musters all his strength and manages to lift himself up out of bed and over to his walker. He slowly walks through the house towards the fragrance, its familiarity boosting his strength with each step.

As he rounds the corner, he sees a large tray of freshly baked cookies - cookies his wife hasn't made in over a decade. He reaches out to grab one, and just as he's about to touch the top cookie, a hand swats his away from the plate.

He looks up to see his wife standing there, snarling at him. She says:

Three hicks in town for a convention decide to go to a local whorehouse.  The Madam welcomes them and asked what they’re looking for.
One of the guys told her they wanted something they’ve never had before.
The Madam called one of her workers down and whispered in her ear.
The 1st guy went upstairs and came down later with a grin on his face.  The other two wanted to hear the details...”Well, he said, she put a pineapple ring around it and ate it off.  It was great”.
The 2nd guy was raring to go and headed up the stairs.  A little while later he came down grinning from ear to ear.  Of course his friends wanted to know what happened.  “Welp, she put a pineapple ring on it and then some whipped cream, and then ate it all off.  It was fantastic!”
By that time the 3rd guy could barely contain himself.  He bounded up the stairs, but wasn’t gone too long.  He slowly walked down the stairs and was so upset that his friends asked him what happened?  Didn’t he like it?  What’d she do?  
With a loud sigh he told them.  “First she put a pineapple on it, then she piled it with whip cream, and finally she put a cherry on top.” His friends asked, “What happened next”?

But then, the model's face enters the camera's view, and it's a man. This makes the other man jump with disgust, and he furiously yells at the model for having hidden his true gender until now. The yelling and argument goes on for a while, and, disgusted, he turns off his laptop.

A few hours later, he feels remorse for having yelled at the model so harshly. So he grabs his laptop and goes back to the cam site, to the very same model. He sighs deeply, and apologises:

They ask him ""What is your secret?"" and the old man tells them a story:

""Seventy years ago, there was a huge blizzard that came out of nowhere. It was winter, but it wasn't too cold for a week and it was only lightly snowing when suddenly the wind started blowing and the snowing intensified.

I went outside to call my dog when I barely saw a weak light coming from the woods. Surely someone got lost and was now trying to find a way to safety. I started calling for my dog, but I knew the lost person would hear me. Sure enough, the light started getting stronger and stronger until finally I could see a silhouette of a man holding a flashlight. When he came close enough, I ran to help him. You couldn't see more than twenty feet and I didn't want to risk getting myself lost as well. I helped the man get inside the cabin and my dog ran in few seconds later. I closed the door with great difficulty because the wind was blowing so hard.

I then helped the man get his jacket and boots off and sat him next to the fireplace. The man was in shock but without injuries. I poured both of us a glass of whiskey to calm down and then a bowl of stew I was preparing. The man calmed down and started thanking me. He said he really thought he was a dead man until he heard me calling my dog. He gathered last bits of his energy and walked towards the voice.

When we finished eating, we decided to both go to bed. But I only had one bed so we would have to share. No problem, we thought, because it was very cold, and our bodies would keep each other warm. Well, one thing lead to another and we started touching each other, then kissing and then making love. Even though we were both exhausted from what happened, we made love the whole night and  that was the most passionate love I ever made in my life.

In the morning, the weather cleared up and after breakfast, the man put on his jacket, gathered his things and said he had to go. His wife and three children were expecting him and must be mortified because he didn't come home. He then gave me the juiciest kiss on the cheeks and left. I watched him go and realized I didn't even ask his name. That was the last time I saw him.""

The TV crew looked at each other in shock and after a few seconds one of them said: ""No, we meant what is your secret for long and active life.""

""Oh, that?"" the man said, ""Clean air, regular exercise, healthy food, no stress... That kind of stuff.""",TV crew decides to visit a hundred years old man living alone in a cabin in the woods,338
