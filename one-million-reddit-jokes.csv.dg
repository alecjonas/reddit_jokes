In order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to purchase a bull from the stockyard in a far town so that they can breed their own stock.  


They only have $600 left. Upon leaving, the brunette tells her sister, 'When I get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home.'  


The brunette arrives at the stockyard, inspects the bull, and decides she wants to buy it. The man tells her that he will sell it for $599, no less. After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news. She walks into the telegraph office and says, 'I want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pickup truck and drive out here so we can haul it home.'  


The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then adds, 'It's just 99 cents a word.' Well, after paying for the bull, the brunette only has $1 left. She realizes that she'll only be able to send her sister one word.  


After a few minutes of thinking, she nods and says, 'I want you to send her the word 'comfortable.'   


The operator shakes his head. 'How is she ever going to know that you want her to hitch the trailer to your pickup truck and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her just the word 'comfortable?'

I played to one of the biggest crowds I have ever played to and at the end of the night I took a beautiful woman home. She proceeded to brake into her own home because the key wasnt working,then she opened the front door proclaiming ""it wasnt locked"". I became the guard rails for her stumbling terror as she nearly fell into everything on the way to her bedroom. A few minutes later she said she needed  to use the toilet so I waited about 10 minutes that's when I felt the need to check on her. I found her asleep on the john I picked her up and herded her into her room.Five minutes later she went back to the bathroom I waited 10 or so minutes, and sure enough  she was asleep in the bathroom this time sprawled out on the floor. I picked her up and herded her to her room. Yet once again she decided to use the bathroom ,but this time she came back. She finally got under the blanket and went to sleep,the next morning her first words were ""oh my God did we have sex"" I said ""no"", then her mother brought over her 3 year old who woke me up, but not her by opening the door and staring at us. A few minutes later I met her brother who asked me if she was awake and about 10 minutes later she got up. She wanted to get ice so I went to her parents house next door, her dad asked me if I had a beer and thought my name was Philip even though I said George. I got the whole BF treatment without even getting a kiss. The next few days I stayed over at her house the farthest I got was spooning or ""cuddling"" as she called it. The day after ""cuddling"" she accused me of just hanging out to bang her I told her ""If I would have been feeling more presidential i would have grabbed your pussy when you were drunk"".the next day she acted like she wanted to hang,but I never heard from her again. So my trip to play a festival was nearing its end it had it's up and downs but wasn't ready to stop going south.i later found out one band collected tips for every band made about $200 and kept all the money the venue gave for the bands.

So, he went to the local shipyard and spoke to a salesman. He handed over his gold and was brought a decent sized ship. He didn't understand how he could afford such a boat. 

He soon learned why the ship was so cheap: with every step he took, every wooden plank creaked and moaned under his boots. After a few days out at sea, he couldn't take it anymore. He brought it back and asked to exchange it. The salesman understood and brought him the only other ship they had: one small enough for a child. The pirate thought it over and finally gave in.

As long as he would squat down, he could fit in the boat. But he discovered a new problem: the ship's wheel was down by his fly! After a few more days out at sea, he returned again and asked for the first boat back. The salesman was confused and asked why.

The pirate rubbed his groin and said ""Well, the first ship was rather annoying, but this one keeps driving me nuts!""",A pirate buys a cheap ship,7

The chief said “ You all must go to the jungle and every man must bring me 10 fruits and then I’ll decide your fate”. They do so as told. The first man  to return was Jake and he had 10 bananas in his hands, feeling confident about the offering he had for the leader. 
The leader then told Jake, in a very serious demeanour that if he manages to shove all the 10 bananas up his arse, he would spare his life. Jake tries, but eventually fails at the third banana and dies of critical blood loss. 
 Then comes George, somewhat scared since he had brought only 10 grapes as the offering, but is delighted to hear the chief’s demand. While on his 9th grape, George starts laughing uncontrollably so much so that he fails to even breathe and meets the same fate as Jake. 
They both meet in heaven, and George asks what Jake had brought and realises why he died. Jake also enquires about the same, and is astonished as to why George died since he had grapes. George then says: “Dude, when I was on the ninth, I saw that fucking Johnson hauling 10 pineapples”.","Jake, George and Johnson were abducted by a cannibalistic tribe.",4

It’s clearly a place that only typically caters to locals, but he’s welcomed and sat at a table and handed a long, one-page menu that’s written entirely in Spanish, and he notices that the menu is just one long list of items, with prices going from cheapest to most expensive. 

The item at the top is listed for €1, while the bottom item is €100. He calls the waiter over to explain. 

“Si señor, you see... here at this restaurant, all we serve is bull. The bulls that are killed by the matadors in the bullfights, they bring them here... and every single part of the bull can be eaten, and we will serve you any part you want.”

“Oh... I see! How interesting! Ok... bring me this!”, says the guy, pointing to the bottom item. 

“Are you sure, señor? That...”

“Yes yes... I know. I have no idea. Surprise me!”

“Of course señor”

The waiter goes off, and a while later returns with a plate, covered in one of those silver half-domes. He puts the plate down, and with great dramatic fashion — TaDa!! — lifts the dome, to reveal the contents... what look like two massive grapefruit-sized meatballs. 

“Oh....”, says the guy, “Are those what I think they are?”

“Si señor, the bull’s testicles! Try them... it is our delicacy. Very delicious!”

The guy digs in, and indeed... delicious... but very heavy and meaty. He can barely make it halfway through one of them. 

No problem... he happily pays and makes plans to return with his friends. 

Next night he comes in with his group of friends, who are all interested at where they’re being taken, having heard the rave reviews all day. 

“Leave it to me to order!”, says our guy. 

And a while later, the waiter comes back with the plate, puts it down and — TaDa! — the big reveal, except this time, the two meatballs are tiny... like little grapes. 

“What! I don’t understand!”, says the guy, “What is this?”

The pastor, embarrassed, said ""Of course. You are right. I will go get ready.""

The tortoise, unanimously agreed upon as being the fairest of all the animals, was appointed as the official judge. The rules were simple: tell your joke to the tortoise, and if he laughs, you live, but if he does not, you die. The competition would continue until the population of the kingdom was reduced in half.

All the animals spent the rest of the week preparing. Never before in the animal kingdom had so much original content been created. Jokes upon jokes were imagined, tweaked, and committed to memory. The animals worked tirelessly, until finally, the joke telling day came.

All the animals were gathered in a great assembly. Before animals were chosen at random to present their jokes, an offer was extended to any animal who thought they had a truly exception joke. The zebra volunteered almost immediately. It was not very often that he got to go first at anything because of that whole pesky ""Z"" thing. Additionally, he felt that his joke was quite funny, and wanted to make sure that he got a chance to present it to the tortoise before the tortoise was tired of laughing.

He nervously approached the podium, and presented his material. It was short, sweet, and had an excellent punchline. To the zebras relief, the whole animal kingdom erupted in a roar of laughter, and it fact, it took several minutes for everyone to calm down...

...except for the tortoise. Without emotion, he just stared back at the zebra. The zebra was shocked, the rest of the kingdom astonished, but sadly, everyone knew what this meant. The zebra was escorted away, never to be seen from again.

It came time for the second animal to give his joke. Again, they polled for volunteers, and after some hesitation, the chimpanzee raised his hand. The chimp figured it had a good repertoire of making others laugh, and while the tortoise was apparently a tough crowd, he figured he probably had a decent shot. He had worked hard on this, and had about a five minute act.

The chimp's animatedly presented his finest material. It was a bit song, a bit dance, and a ton of humor. The kingdom chuckled throughout the act, but when the chimp dropped his final punchline, the kingdom went bezerk. Never before had such a funny joke been told: the whole act, while funny in itself, was the perfect setup to the final line. This was not a joke, it was a work of art.

Once everyone had again calmed down, all eyes were on the tortoise. He was unmoved. The chimp was astonished, the kingdom flabbergasted. The chimp was escorted away. He tried to fight back, to plead with the tortoise, but to no avail. He was never seen from again.

At this, no one dared to volunteer. Two masters of the craft were just set away to their doom. How could anyone compete? There was silence across the animal kingdom. Everyone felt the weight of the impending doom that was their fate. There were no more volunteers, their only hope was to not be called. All they could do was wait.

It was then than the bison was called. He lumberd up to the front. He took a big gulp; he knew he really wasn't good at joke telling anyway, and was pretty sure that he was destined to die. He hesitated, stutterd, stammered, but presented his joke to the best of his ability anyway. When the punchline was delivered, (or at least what seemed to have been whatever punchline there could have been at such a scenario,) there was a collective moan over the kingdom. The joke, was it even a joke?, was horrible. Everyone knew that he would be escorted away to his...wait, what? The tortoise! He began to chuckle. Not just a ""heh"" chuckle, this was a real chuckle. Not a chuckle, this was a lough! Then more and more! He was laughing so hard he was having a hard time catching his breath. How could this be? Did the tortoise have some strange sense of humor? Why was he laughing at this? Was he senile? The kingdom was sent into confusion.

Finally the lion interjected. ""SILENCE!"" he shouted. He addressed the judge: ""Oh wise and fair tortoise, why is it that you find the bison's joke so humorous, but none of the other animals' jokes?""

""The other animals?"" replied the tortoise. ""I was still laughing at the zebra's joke!""",The animal kingdom had become overpopulated.,329

On her way back to her mansion in her limo, she spotted a homeless guy by the stoplight.

So she asks him: hey you, is there anything you need?

The man: ohhhh, yes some chump change would great. You see, I’m saving up to go to Florida to see my Mom. She is dying of cancer. And she doesn’t even have a vehicle to go to all the appointments.

She was touched and thought this was an excellent exposure if she helped him. 

So she told him: why don’t you get in the car, I can give you a ride to the airport and get you a ticket to Florida.

The man: Awww thank you, thank you! You are a goddess!

So they drove to the airport. Meantime the paparazzi ain’t no slackers. Somehow they already heard about the actress and about her helping the homeless guy. 

When they arrived at the airport, the terminal was already filled with reporters.

Showered by flash lights and praises, the actress realized this was exactly what she needed to do. But She didn’t want this to end this quickly. 

So she announced that she will personally take a road trip with this homeless guys to Florida so he and his mother could be united again. 

She was determined to milk out as much positive publicity as possible by taking the longest way to Florida.

The first half of the trip was amazing: every city they stopped, they were welcomed with crowds and reporters. Social medias were exploding with their following comments.

She even bought the homeless guys clothes, fresh haircut and a whole spa treatment along the way. 

He turned out to be quite a looker.

One thing leads to another, they hooked up during their stop in New Orleans.

But then their relationship went straight downward. 

The crowd disappeared.

Reporters were nowhere in sight.

All the fuss was gone

The actress was extremely disappointed. And she grow tired of the homeless guy. However, she couldn’t afford to ditch the homeless guy without suffering even worse publicities. So she took him all the way to Florida.

Finally, they arrived at the mother’s house.

He rushed to the bedside where the mother is very much in a weakened state.

The Actress was moved by the emotional scene. So she told him: you can have the limo. It will help with the transportation. 
And she walked away. 

As soon as she walk out, she got struck by the lightening.

As she was dying, she muttered: I did every good deed I could, I tried, I even got fucked by a homeless guy. What can I do to get some Karma around here?

At the meantime, not knowing anything about the actress, the guy was telling his mom with a trembling voice:

Devastated by the event, they had no one to turn to as both parents were only childs and they had no other close family to turn to. 

They eventually get placed into an orphanage and slowly begin to get used to the awful, miserable life of living off of bare minimums in this poorly funded orphanage.

With not much to do, and not many toys to play with at the orphanage, Pat learned to pass the days reading from the poor selection of books and nursery rhymes that had been donated to the orphanage.

Nat was not as creative but still managed to get what she wanted by manipulating the other boys in the orphanage with her adorable features and the boys would shower her with chocolate and candies and many other gifts they acquired in the hopes of holding her hand at playtime.

As they grow older and older, their chances of getting adopted are near zero and they need to start finding ways to provide for themselves.

As it turns out, from reading all those books, Pat was incredibly creative at writing music and lyrics. He eventually started earning some money by performing at local Rap shows. 

Unfortunately for Nat, her habit of manipulating men had taken a turn for the worse and she got into prostitution. 

Now, they were both making some decent money in their respective ""careers"". However, Pat was not happy with Nat for her decision to become a prostitute, so he cut her out of his life and they went their seperate ways.

Pat's Rap career took off and he became very successful. He bought himself a nice house with all sorts of nice stuff including a backyard oasis with a beautiful outdoor kitchen with a BBQ. He was living the dream.

Nat also managed to find immense success as she worked her way up the prostitute ranks and opened up the most successful, legal brothel in the country. People would come from across the world to visit her brothel. She was truly a self made woman.

One day, Pat's friend Joe goes on a vacation across the country and being the wild young man he is, Joe decides to visit the most famous brothel in the country. He walks in and is greeted by the madam, who is none other than Nat! Unbeknownst to him, he starts talking to the madam and she explains her entire life story and how she ended up where she is today.

At she finishes her story, Joe's eyes are wide open in amazement as he has heard the the other end of the story and he recognizes the madam's brother as Pat!

Joe explains the entire situation to Nat, and that same night they fly back to reunite Pat and Nat.

*Ding Dong!*

Pat hears his doorbell ring so he gets up from his desk and goes to open the door and is greeted by none other than Nat. They take one long look at each other and begin crying profusely and hug each other and they explain their respective situations and how they ended up where they are.

After a few hours of catching up, Pat insists that Nat spends the rest of her stay here at his house and he says that to celebrate their success, they're going to have a BBQ in his beautiful backyard kitchen. She agrees and goes to clean up and get changed.

Later that night, Pat and Nat are having a great time pouring some of the finest liquors either of them had ever enjoyed, and savouring some of the best cuts of meat available. 

*Ding Dong!*

Their lovely evening is interrupted by the doorbell ringing. Pat says to Nat ""You stay here in the backyard I'll go see who's here.""

Pat walks to the front door and opens the door to find his buddy Joe and his other buddy Tom. He asks them what's up and they explain that Tom just got dumped by his wife and he is trying to get laid to forget about his now ex wife, and they are wondering if his sister Nat could help him and that he would even pay Pat to use his house for the evening.

So Tom asks Pat ""Well, is Nat available?""

Pat smiles brightly and says:

Native says, “Well I guess let’s have a look at it and then I’ll decide.”

It was one of the biggest landmarks in the town. You could just look at that big metal sign and see how proud the man was of his trade.

No matter how good a businessman he was, Ed's arrogant behavior was loathed by pretty much everyone. He was too proud of his riches, didn't have a care for the poor, and never backed down from humiliating people who weren't well-off. But he was a powerful man, and no one could do much about it. 

One day though, disaster struck. After a couple of months of rain and moisty weather, Ed's products began to catch rust. Lo and behold - before you know, the man was nearly bankrupt. 

The worst of it probably went over the big sign itself. Because of the rust, one day part of the sign came off.

The famous ore trader, the proud, arrogant Ed Smith was truly humbled now. An egotistical man finally brought back to earth by the same Nature that gave him so much. And his landmark metal sign now laid on the ground amid the dirt where his riches came from.

So the barman, absolutely dumbstruck that this rabbit had just waltzed into the pub speaking fluent English and asking for toasties, makes the cheese and ham toastie for the rabbit. He wolfed it down, and left. The next night the bar was a little busier, and the rabbit came in, asked for the cheese and ham toastie, ate, and left. This happened night after night, and by the end of the week the barman was really rubbing his hands together - the business was great, people were flocking into his pub, he even had to put extra lawn chairs on the roof. And the rabbit comes in and asks for a cheese and ham toastie, but this time the barman can't serve him one. He's completely out of stock. So he says to the rabbit, ""How about a cheese and onion toastie instead?""

""Hmm, are you sure I'll like it?"" the rabbit says.

""Of course you will. It's different. It's nice."" says the barman.

So the rabbit eats the toastie, thoroughly enjoys it, and leaves. He doesn't come back the next night. Or the night after that. In fact, he never shows up again until about a week later. The pub has almost no business now, since the rabbit had gone. The barman was clearing up the few glasses that had been used, and saw a ghost of a rabbit in the corner. He said ""By gum, what on earth happened to you? You haven't come in ages!""

""I died,"" said the rabbit, in a very sad and gloomy tone.

""My goodness, how did that happen?"" exclaimed the barman, with visible despair.

""Well,"" said the rabbit, ""I'd been mixing-me-toasties.""",This is the story of how a pub gets famous.,0

A leading local politician and member of the congregation was chosen to make the presentation and to give a little speech at the dinner. However, he was delayed, so the Priest decided to say his own few words while they waited:

'I got my first impression of the parish from the first confession I heard here. I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place.

The very first person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and, when questioned by the police, was able to lie his way out of it.   
He had stolen money from his parents, embezzled from his employer, had an affair with his boss's wife, taken illegal drugs, and gave VD to his sister. I was appalled.

But as the days went on I learned that my people were not all like that and I had, indeed, come to a fine parish full of good and loving people.'...

Just as the Priest finished his talk, the politician arrived full of apologies at being late. He immediately began to make the presentation and gave his talk:

'I'll never forget the first day our parish Priest arrived,' said the politician. 'In fact, I had the honour of being the first person to go to him for confession!'",A Priest was being honoured at his retirement dinner after 35 years in the parish.,132

Still in awe, he then asked one of the employees where he could find Oscar. 
    
    
""Oscar? I know two Oscars who work here. Are you looking for Oscar Peterson or Oscar Cocks?"" 
    
    
""Oscar Peterson is the guy. Never heard of an Oscar Cocks,"" said the man with a slight chuckle. 
    
    
""Well that Oscar specializes in insects. The insect habitats are found at the far east side of the zoo. Just head down this path, follow it all the way through and you'll get there eventually. You'll pass a bear habitat and a monkey habitat on the way there and right before the building is a huge gorilla habitat. As long as you pass those, you'll find the building.""
    
    
The man thanks the employee and heads toward to the bear habitat. 
    
    
""Woah! These bears are so majestic and amazing! Look at how big they are too!"" he thought to himself as he walked past their habitat.
    
    
He then walked towards the monkey habitat. 
    
    
""I never really liked monkeys. At least I know I'm going the right way"" he said as he quickly walked past the monkey habitat. 
    
    
Soon enough, he stumbled upon the gorilla habitat.
    
    
""Those gorillas are huge! But what's that over there...?"" 
    
    
There stood a big, muscular man in a zookeeper uniform covered in hair from head to toe. He was about 6½ feet tall and looked just like a gorilla. 
    
    
""This zookeeper seems to be heading towards the same building I am"", said the man as he approached the zookeeper, maintaining a disturbed stare. 
    
    
As he passes the zookeper, he glances towards his nametag and reads ""Oscar"".
    
    
""This must be Oscar Cocks! I can't believe I ran into another Oscar while looking for Oscar!"" thought the man with an amused smile on his face.
    
    
After a short walk, the man finally arrives at the building with the zookeeper right behind him. He enters the building and even holds the door open for the zookeeper as they greet each other with a smile. The man is then greeted by his buddy as soon as he walks inside.
    
    
""Hey buddy! How've ya been? I'm glad you could make it! You managed to get here on your own too!""
    
    
""I'm good! I asked for help from an employee on where to find you. I even have a little story I wanna tell ya."" He then whispers ""*It's about a guy who has the same name as you. He's the guy who I held the door open for earlier. He might hear us if we talk in here*"". He then continues, ""So what do you say we go out and grab some lunch?""
    
    
""Sounds good to me but give me a while and let me get my stuff. I've been working on this insect habitat all day and it's HUGE. We had to move a bunch of insects around just to make room for the construction. We used barrels for spiders, buckets for ladybugs and that crate you see over there is for grasshoppers among other things. In the mean time, why don't you have a look around? I'll be right over there by the habitat. If you need anything or have any questions about something just give me a holler.""
    
    
Oscar then walked to the nearby habitat that was under construction. 
    
    
The man strolled around and saw different charts and exhibits about insects. He eventually became bored and decided to lean against what seemed to be a wooden ^pole while waiting for his buddy. 
    
    
After a while, he feels a tingling sensation all over his body followed by sharp pains. The man turns around to examine the ^pole and notices hundreds upon hundreds of insects crawling about on its surface. As he frantically tries to identify if the bugs nibbling on him are venomous or not, all the while trying to get the insects off of him, he sees Oscar Cocks along with a bunch of other zookeepers making their way towards him. 
    
    
""Crap! If the zookeepers find out that I've been squishing their insects, I'll be in big trouble! I need Oscar's help! But if I called out Oscar's name, the zookeeper might be the one to approach me... But at the same time I need to know if these insects are venomous!"" The man pauses for a bit and finally reaches an epiphany.
    
    
He clears his throat and hollers at his buddy, 
    
    
""Hey OP,  what is this? A post for ants?""",A man went to a gigantic zoo to visit his buddy Oscar [LONG],11

“Exactly!” responds the student.

He grunted a few times like he was in pain, but I thought he was just drunk.

Then, he disappeared from my rareview, and I got a little chill down my spine. I did a quick turn around but didn't see him. ""WHAT The FUCK!?"" I slammed on the brakes and heard a big thump. Looked in my rearview and Gary's reappeared with a bloody face! Now, I'm not superstitious but the stories of dead accident victims haunting this area floated across my mind.

He took with him the family rifle for protection, and the $20 gold coin he had seen his father hide under a loose floorboard in the kitchen. 

Saddling one of the 2 horses, he rode down the curving path then out of the gate at the entrance of the farm and into the night, full of excitement and without an ounce of regret. 

... 

3 years later, destitute and downtrodden, he stumbled back through the same gate late one afternoon. 

His bare feet were blistered and dirty, his clothes ragged, and his face gaunt. 

His adventure had been fruitless, the little gold he'd found in 3 years of prospecting had barely provided enough for him to eat, and he'd been forced to sell his horse and rifle to survive. 

After nearly 3 years of meager meals and grueling labor, he acknowledged defeat and used the last of his meager resources to return home. A carriage and train had carried him most of the way, but, after running out of gold, the final 300 miles he'd traveled by foot. 

He hadn't heard from his father since he left, and he feared his wrath upon returning home. He felt guilt from having deprived his father of his gold, his horse, and his rifle, and he had nothing to show for it all. 

As he approached the house, he saw the grass was long and unkempt, the path partially washed out and full of potholes, and the fields that should have been full of young corn were instead choked with weeds. 

Rounding the corner, seeing the house ahead, he saw the picket fence had fallen over, and several shutters hung loose from the windows. 

On the porch sat a figure, slowly rocking in a chair. As he drew close, he recognized that it was Chief Eagle Claw, his father's closest friend. 

As he stepped up on the porch, Eagle Claw didn't so much as glance at him. 

The young man stood awkwardly, shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot, waiting to be acknowledged. 

Finally, unable to stand the silence any longer, and bursting with questions, the young man exclaimed, ""Chief Eagle Claw, what happened here? Why isn't the grass cut, and why of the house in such disrepair?"" 

Eagle Claw said nothing and continued to slowly rock. 

The young man tried again,"" Chief, why aren't the fields planted?""

Again he was met with silence, the old chief didn't so much as glance his way. 

Growing frustrated, the young man spoke again, this time with a tinge of anger in his voice. ""Chief Eagle Claw, where is my father?"" 

Chief Eagle Claw finally looked up, and locked eyes with the young man. He held his gaze for a moment, and the young man felt reproach in his stern expression. 

Then, gesturing beside the house to a small mound grown over with weeds that the young man had not noticed before, he said 'There your father.'

Feeling remorse and denial rising inside him, the young man spoke again, panic tinging his voice. ""I don't understand. I don't see him, where is my father?"" 

Eagle Claw looked him in the eyes once more, and the young man finally understood. He could sense the words that were coming next, and trembled, wishing he could somehow avoid them and their terrible truth. 

But it was too late, the question had been asked, and the answer must be given.

Gesturing to the mound once again, this time emphatically, and in his deep powerful voice, Chief Eagle Claw bellowed, ""There is your Father!"" 

Then, with the corner of his mouth rising in a barely perceptible smirk, he added, ""Rest in peace in box.""","Oklahoma, 1849. A young man, bored with his commonplace life on his father's farm, made the decision to seek adventure in California, prospecting for gold.",0

A few weeks go by and the group is sitting on the beach one evening shooting the breeze. This particular evening the sunset is beautiful. In fact, its the most beautiful sunset any of them have ever seen!

The man sees this sunset and gets thinking about his life back home and all the romances he's had and all the sunsets he's seen. He begins to get some... physical urges. He can't get these urges to go away and needs to relive them.

The man slides over to the pig and tries to get close and intimate with it. As he starts to put his hands on the pig the dog sees and starts to get angry at all the drama that is about to be created. The dog begins to bark and growl at the man who suddenly backs off. The man comes to his senses and forgets about the whole thing.

A few weeks go by with no further incidents. Then one day a beautiful woman washes up on shore. In fact, the most beautiful woman any of them have ever seen.

She's injured so the man takes care of her, nurses her back to health, shows her around the island and makes her feel better about her new life ahead on the island.

The trio take her in and they all become fast friends.

A few more weeks later and the quartet are sitting on the beach in the evening. There again is a beautiful sunset. In fact, its somehow EVEN MORE beautiful than the last one.

The man begins to get the urges back again but this time he has a better opportunity to satisfy himself. The man slides over to the woman and whispers gently in her ear...

She fell to the harsh, bitter colds of last year, as so many of us have. And my other boy, Gregaro... I no longer love him. As much as it pains me, when I look in his eyes, all I see is the same cowardice that I see in my own face when i look in the mirror. If only I weren't so cowardly, perhaps then I could find the strength to reach for the cocked and loaded gun that lays on the bedside behind me and end this hellish facade once and for all.
