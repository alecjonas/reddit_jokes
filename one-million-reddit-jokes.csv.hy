In light of the rising frequency of human/grizzly bear conflicts, the Montana Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers, hunters, and fishermen to take extra precautions and keep alert for bears while in the field. We advise that outdoorsmen wear noisy little bells on their clothing so as not to startle the bears that aren't expecting them. We also advise outdoorsmen to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear.

It is also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear activity. Outdoorsmen should recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear poop. Black bear poop is smaller and contains a lot of berry seeds and squirrel fur. Grizzly bear poop has little bells in it and smells like pepper spray.",Bear Alert!,13
post,9ewpu4,2qh72,jokes,false,1536665572,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9ewpu4/one_mans_life_mission/,self.jokes,,"A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task.

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!
With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

Scene: A grand ballroom full of political elite at a special dinner thrown by the President of Mexico, celebrating Mexican Independence. There's music, dancing, opulent tables full of food and fine drink. At the far end is a grand staircase, lined with men in military dress, announcing dignitaries. 

**President of the United States and First Lady!**

The scene pans up to the top of the stairs as Donald Trump and Melania round the corner. The entire room grows quiet. Atop Donald's head is a cone-shaped party hat. Melania looks embarrassed.

As Trump proudly walks down the stairs, the President of Australia leans in and asks the President of Mexico how they got Trump to attend the party. The President of Mexico replies: ""We told him it was his birthday"". ",I woke up laughing this morning...,4

post,9esq3b,2qh72,jokes,false,1536626098,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9esq3b/texas_chili_cookoff/,self.jokes,,"Notes From An Inexperienced Chili Tester Named FRANK, who was visiting Texas from the East Coast: *""Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon, when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy,*

*and besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting - So I accepted.""*

Here are the scorecards from the event:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MOBSTER MONSTER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.

JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.

FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 2 - ARTHUR'S AFTERBURNER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.

JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

FRANK: Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 3 - FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.

JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of peppers.

FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all the beer.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC

JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.

JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.

FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burnout taste buds? Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look HOT just like this nuclear waste I'm eating. Is chili an aphrodisiac?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 5 - LINDA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very Impressive!

JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.

FRANK: My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage; Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off? It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 6 - VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.

JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb!

FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit on myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. She must be kinkier than I thought. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should take note that I am worried about Judge Number 3, He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.

FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CHILI # 8 - Helen's Mount Saint Chili

JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare it's existence.

JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank, wonder how he'd have reacted to a really hot chili?

""It's off season, so there's nothing open in town this late, but we can take you in the morning. You can spend the night with us.”

The woman thought: ""Well, I really don't have a choice. Besides, I can handle myself."" So she agreed. Besides, she thought the men were handsome, and so she suggested they have some fun together.

As they were taking their clothes off, the woman said, ""By the way, you DO have protection, don't you?""

""You know, condoms.""

Every Sunday they used to go to the local pub, sit at the bar and order a pint of Guinness each. This tradition went on every Sunday for years until Seamus emigrated to England. Before he left the 3 made a pact that, wherever they were in the world, they would continue the tradition. They would go to the local pub and drink 3 pints of Guinness, one for each of the brothers.

&amp;#x200B;

So, every Sunday Paddy and Mick went to their local and ordered 3 pints of Guinness. The bar man asked them why they ordered 3 pints when there was only 2 of them, so Paddy and Mick explained their pact. They continued the tradition every Sunday until Mick emigrated to the US. Before he left, Paddy reminded him of the pact and told him he had to go to the local and drink 3 pints of Guinness, one for each brother. Paddy, true to his word, continued the pact and went to the local every Sunday ordering 3 pints of Guinness and drinking them one by one. The bar man got a kick out of this bcos he thought it was a nice tradition.

&amp;#x200B;

One Sunday Paddy went to his local and ordered 2 pints of Guinness. The barman's smile faded and he solemnly poured the 2 pints. As he placed them on the counter in front of Paddy, he offered his condolences, saying he was sorry for his loss. Paddy was a bit confused by this and asked the barman what he meant. The barman explained that obviously one of his brothers must have passed away, to say that he was only drinking 2 pints of Guinness. Paddy broke out in hysterics, laughing but touched by the barman's compassion. ""You're a good man Jim"",Paddy said, ""but my brothers are alive and well"". Confused, the barman asked why then, did he only order 2 pints. ""Well Jim, I decided to give up the drink"".","Paddy, Mick, and Seamus",3

I had always had dreams of being a rock star and here was a chance to indulge my fantasies.  It was also shiny and red.  Oh, and the price was only $10.  So I inquired about purchasing the set.

---

""For $10, I'll take this monstrosity and you won't need to worry about finding a place to keep it anymore.""

""Are you kidding?""

""No, I'll give you $10 right now and take it away immediately.""

""Are you sure you know what you're doing?""

""Yes, I'm purchasing a shiny red drum set.""

""But this drum set is cursed.""

""Cursed, you say?""

""Yes, cursed.""

""Are you interested in selling it or not?""

""Well, I guess I just want to get rid of it.  But my conscience would never be at rest if I thought I had forced someone to take these drums.""

""They're shiny and red and I want them.""

""Well then, I guess you can have them.""

---

Ignoring the warning, I went ahead and packed up the whole set and proceeded to bring them home.  On the drive, I couldn't help but keep looking back at them with all of their shiny redness.  I guess I must have been a little distracted and wasn't paying attention to where I was driving.  Which is why I parked in my neighbors driveway.  He seemed a slight bit upset about that.

After finding my own driveway, I proceeded to unpack the drums and assemble them.  There was a kick drum, a snare, three toms, a hi-hat and a ride cymbal.  As I placed them, I couldn't help but notice my reflection upon the shiny red surface.  I stood and admired their beauty.

The next day, I thought that I should try playing the drums.  It was then that I noticed that I didn't have any drumsticks.  So I looked around to see if I had anything that might resemble a drumstick.  The best I could manage was some extra chopsticks from my favorite restaurant, ""The Red Dragon.""  I knew it wasn't exactly the same, but at least the color matched.  I stood behind the drums and started to give it a try.

Now, my neighbor must have very sensitive hearing, because not long after I started, he arrived upon my doorstep, complaining about all the racket.

---

""What are you doing?""

""Yesterday, I bought a shiny red drum set and today I was overcome with the desire to try and play them.""

""Well, I happen to be a well-trained musician and I can tell you now, that those drums sound terrible.  I have perfect pitch and I tell you that they are completely out of tune.""

""Really?  I had no idea drums could be out of tune, but I guess I'll take your word for it.""

---

He then proceeded over to the drums and gave them a look all over.  I could see his reflection upon the shiny surface as he surveyed the whole of them.  After a few minutes, he proceeded to gather up the whole lot and walked out the door with them.  Anxious to not see my dreams disappear, I immediately set to follow him.

As I exited the house, I saw him taking a good, measured wind up and then he proceeded to demonstrate his perfect pitch.  He got the whole set squarely in the dumpster on the first try.","Last week, I was at a yard sale",2

They were looking forward to pleasant weather and a nice time together.




Unfortunately, there was some sort of mix-up at the boarding gate, and the man was told he would have to wait for a later flight. He tried to appeal to a supervisor but was told the airline was not responsible for the problem and it would do no good to complain.




Upon arrival at the hotel the next day, he discovered that Miami Beach was having a heat wave, and its weather was almost as uncomfortably hot as Seattle's was cold. The desk clerk gave him a message that his wife would arrive as planned. He could hardly wait to get to the pool area to cool off, and quickly sent his wife an e-mail, but due to his haste, he made an error in the e-mail address. His message therefore arrived at the home of an elderly preacher's wife whose even older husband had died only the day before!




When the grieving widow opened her e-mail, she took one look at the monitor, let out an anguished scream, and fell to the floor dead. Her family rushed to her room where they saw this message on the screen:

&gt;Dearest wife,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Departed yesterday as you know. Just now got checked in. Some &gt;confusion at the gate. Appeal was denied. Received confirmation &gt;of your arrival tomorrow.

He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs.
Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, “What’s your business role at this convention?”
” Lecturer,” she responded. ” I use information that I have learned from my personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.”
“Really?” he said. ” And what kind of myths are there?”
“Well,” she explained,” one popular myth is that African-American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Jewish descent who are the best. I have also discovered that the lover with absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck.”
Suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed. ” I’m sorry,” she said, ” I shouldn’t really be discussing all of this with you. I don’t even know your name…”
“Tonto,” the man said, “Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me Bubba.”

They all agree and await the leader’s first request. So the leader says: “You each must bring me 100 of a fruit of your choice. You must collect it on this island and bring it here within the next 6 hours.”


Once again they all agree and depart on their scavenging hunt. After about on hour the Englishman returns with 100 peaches.

Now the tribes leader tells him the second request which is that he must now fit all 100 pieces in his butt.


Shocked, but fearing for his life he starts to slowly put them in one by one... as he reaches 11 he says he can’t do it and begs for mercy. But the leader of the tribe shows no mercy and has the Englishman executed.


Shortly after this the Belgian arrived with 100 blueberries &amp; gets told my the tribe’s leader what he has to do next. As he sees the body of the dead Englishman he quickly starts fitting in as many as he can in his butt... 

But then when the Belgian reached 87, he stops and bursts out of laughter. Now the tribe’s leader is so confused and says: “Why did you stop now? You’re so close to finishing?”


To which the Belgian replies: “I know! But I couldn’t help but laugh because I just saw the Frenchman arrive with 100 pineapples!”

At one point, Mick the bartender says, ‘You’ll not be drinking anymore tonight, Paddy’. Paddy replies, ‘OK Mick, I’ll be on my way then’. Paddy spins around on his stool and steps off. He falls flat on his face.

‘Damn,’ he says and pulls himself up by the stool and dusts himself off. He takes a step towards the door and falls flat on his face again.

‘Damn, damn!’

He looks to the doorway and thinks to himself that if he can just get to the door and some fresh air he’ll be fine. He belly crawls to the door and shimmies up to the door frame. He sticks his head outside and takes a deep breath of fresh air, feels much better and takes a step out onto the sidewalk and falls flat on his face.

‘By Jeebers… I’m a little crocked,’ he says.

He can see his house just a few doors down, and crawls to the door, hauls himself up the door frame, opens the door and shimmies inside. He takes a look up the stairs and says, ‘No damn’ way’. He crawls up the stairs to his bedroom door and says ‘I can make it to the bed!’ He takes a step into the room and falls flat on his face.

He says ‘Damn it!’ and falls into bed.

The next morning, his wife, Jess, comes into the room carrying a cup of coffee and says, ‘Get up Paddy. Did you have a bit to drink last night ?’

Paddy says, ‘No Jess, what makes you say that?’

The husband soon comes in and reads the note, he then took a pen out of his pocket and wrote a reply on the note paper, then changed his clothes while singing as if nothing has happened. 

He opened his phone and started saying ""Hey honey, yeah i'm coming today, thank god my wife left me and went to her parents' house, i hope she never comes back. I never enjoyed living with her anyways, i wish i met you before i met her, my life would've been better that way"". Soon as he was done with the phone call he left the house.

The wife was shocked and became furious under the bed, she came out crying and started packing her stuff because of what her traitor husband said.

Crying and full of tears, she noticed the note paper and read what her husband wrote: ""Your feet are visible behind the bed, fool, I went to buy groceries, you'll have enough time to wipe your tears when i come back""

After few hours of walking by river he hears loud screaming by woman. She is screaming ""HEEEELP. MY SON IS DROWNING AND I CANT SWIM HELP PLEASE"" and he looks at the river where young boy is fighting the water with the last bits of energy.

After a long journey he arrives at the mining camp, 200 miles from civilization. The camp is small, with only a handful of miners.

He promptly meets up with the manager, and asks what his duties are.

""Firstly, you work six days of the week, every day except Saturday. Your primary duty is to help clear out the rubble, and dump it into the rock quarry down the road. The work isn't easy, but you will get used to it. Also, you are on KP duty on Friday nights.""

Morning comes, and Paul goes to work. The work is hard, but he is strong enough that it isn't a real problem.

However, by the time Thursday comes around, Paul is feeling kind of lonely. With the nearest women 200 miles away, he can't imagine how the other miners endure from day to day. So, he approaches the manager.

""What do you want?"" asks the manager.

""Well, the work itself is fine, and I have no complaints about it, but...well sir, I wonder what the other miners do for women around here?""

""Ah. Say no more. Let me show you something.""

The manager leads Paul into the mine, and turns down an unfamiliar passage. He continues on deeper into the mine into older and older tunnels until he finally stops at the end of a tunnel which must be well over a hundred years old. At the end is a barrel.

The manager says: ""The other miners use this.""

""What?""

""Well, you see that knot hole? Try it out.""

Paul is decidedly skeptical about the idea, but he is desperate, so he gives it a shot. He absolutely can't believe the results. He practically busts a nut--the best damned blow job he's ever gotten.

Well, Friday comes around, and the work is getting him down, so he goes back to the barrel to try it again. Wow! This time the blow job is even better than last time. Truly unbelievable!

So, after a long day, and KP duty that night, Paul sleeps in on Saturday. He gets up at 11 and really feels great. He can't think of much to do, so he heads off to visit the barrel. 

On his way to the mine, he bumps into the manager, who asks him:""What are you doing here?""

""It's my day off ...""

""Day off? Hell no! It's your turn in the barrel.""",The Alaskan Miner,16

Approximately 3 spoons per table per hour are dropped. If our staff carry spoons, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save *15 man-hours per shift *

As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he replaced it with his spare one.

""I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now.""

I was impressed. I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the Indian waiter's zip. Looking around, I saw that all of the Indian waiters had the same string hanging from their zips. I asked the waiter, ""Excuse me, can you tell me why you have that string there?""

Then the Indian waiter lowered his voice. ""Not everyone is so observant. Accenture also suggested we can save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the tip of our manhood, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 45%.""

I asked quietly, ""After you get it out, how do you put it back?""

He whispered, ""Accenture didn't mention that in report, so, We use the spoon "" ",Last night I went to a restaurant and noticed that the waiter had a spoon in his shirt pocket.,44

The young man proved to be a stellar quarterback, and he led the Lions to their first Super Bowl victory.  After the game, the young man called his mother.  ""Mom,"" he said, ""I've won the Super Bowl!""

""Go away,"" she replied.  ""You are not my son!""

""What do you mean, mother?  I've won the biggest game of the year.  I've accomplished so much.""

""Look at us:  I can't walk to the market without getting mugged.  There are gun shots and sounds of violence round the clock.  Your brothers must escort your sister wherever she goes to keep her from being raped.  Life is hell!  Why did you ever make us move to Detroit???""

St. Peter greets them, but it turns out the place is a bit crowded at the moment:

St. Peter: “I’m terribly sorry guys, but we’re a bit tight on space, so let’s do the following; each of you will tell me how you died, and whoever tells the funniest story will be given the chance to come in”.

All three men look at each other, and John decides to go first. 

John: Mine is quite a complex situation... I came back home early tonight, and I found my wife in shock and completely naked. 

At that moment I knew she was with a lover, so I started looking for the bastard, while my wife was just screaming at me that nothing was wrong; she had just turned a naturist. 

In the middle of the argument, I heard a noise at the front window and saw the guy holding with just the fingertips on the void begging me for help. I took my shoes off and slapped the crap out of the bastard, but he wouldn’t let go! 

So I went to the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it in his face! Finally the fucker went down... but I was so unlucky that the cord got tangled around my foot and I was also thrown to the street. Last thing I remeber is hitting face first to the floor.

St. Peter is laughing his ass off, but is also eager to hear the next story. Paul’s next.

Paul: My death is weird as fuck. I had been jobless for over a year, so I was over the moon when a temporary agency finally offered me some work as a window cleaner yesterday! 

I was nicely doing the job, starting at top window of an eight-story appartment building. But the company that hired had a crappy scaffolding that broke down after half an hour, and I fell down! 

In a moment of luck, I managed to get hold of a window frame and started crying for help to the people inside. All of a sudden, a crazy guy comes outside furious and starts slapping my fingers. He went inside, and as I was almost managing to gain entrance, there comes the idiot back throwing a fridge in my face! 

I landed on a soft mattress on the back of a lorry, but next thing I remember is the fridge hitting me again, and here I woke up!

St. Peter is now rolling on the ground, unable to hold back tears of joy as he listens to the end. He looks at the remaining guy and says, still laughing: “OK, it’s gonna be hard to beat that one, but go ahead!”.

Steve: Compared to the other two, my death is quite dull. See, I was just fucking this chick I met on Tinder last night, when all of a sudden the main door opened. “Shit, my husband’s back” she said. 

“I’ll go and distract him; you go find somewhere to hide!”. So I hide in the fridge, heard a loud argument, and last thing I remember is waking up here...

He hated that name and asked everyone not to call him Onestone. 
After years and years of torment, Onestone finally cracked and said, 
""If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!"" The word got 
around and nobody called him that any more. 
Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird forgot and said, ""Good morning, Onestone."" 
He jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night. 
He made love to her all the next day, until Blue Bird died from exhaustion. 

The word got around that Onestone meant what he promised he would do. 
Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until a woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away 
for many years. 
Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw 
Onestone. She hugged him and said, ""Good to see you, Onestone."" 

Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, then he made 
love to her all day, made love to her all night, made love to her all 
the next day, made love to her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!

 Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened the priest ran and got the town magistrate.

When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said: ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.

He listened for a while longer, and said: ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening: ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""

Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery.

It's just Beethoven decomposing.""",Most people know who Ludwig Van Beethoven is.,334

""What do you do for a living?""
""Well, I guess you could say I'm somewhat of a pro"", he replies.

""As in, a professional sportsman or something? Wow, that's cool! Which sport do you play?"", she enthusiastically asks. 

""I... I'll tell you in just a bit"", he says, looking around rather nervously. 

She's a bit confused by his answer, but doesn't mind waiting. He seems like a pretty good guy, and not bad-looking, either. If he's some kind of famous sports star, that's a double-win. So they order another round, and keep on talking. ""What are your hobbies?"", ""What music do you listen to?"", ""Do you come here often?"", and whatnot.

After about 10 minutes, still curious, she once again asks:

""So... what was it that you do for a living, again?""

""I... just a few more rounds of beer and I'll tell you, cool?"", he says sheepishly.

""Haha sure, no problem"", she says, slapping him warmly on the back.

So they order yet another round of beer and keep on talking. ""What's your family like?"", ""What are your friends like?"", ""Do you have any dreams you want to follow?"", and etcetera. 

Half an hour later, and feeling much more attached to this guy, she decides to ask again:

""You were going to tell me something about your job... what was it, again?""

""Oh, uhm, right. Just wait a little bit more, it'll be a nice surprise"", he assures her. 

""Already giving me a nice surprise, and we've barely even met? Wow, guess I'll have to wait, then"", she replies, smiling.

So they call for another round of beer. This time, the conversation is a bit more... interesting. ""How's your romantic life?"", ""Any SO's you're hoping to meet later this evening?"", ""Do you wanna hang out again sometime?"". 

Their conversation had been going really well for about an hour, but suddenly, the guy's wrist-watch buzzes. 2AM.

""Shit, I gotta go. I need to finish and submit a paper before 6AM. I'm really sorry, we can get together sometime later."", he says, jumping out of his chair.

""Submit a paper? What? For the sport you're a professional at? I didn't know athletes had to publish papers"", she replies suspiciously.

""Sports? What? You've got me all wrong.  I never said sports. I don't do sports!"", he says, already on his feet.

""What do you do, then?! Come back here! Tell me!"" she shouts, raising her voice and drawing weird looks from everyone around. 

""You know what? Fuck it. I'll tell you if you pay for my drinks"", he says, walking away and clearly annoyed. 

""Okay! I'll pay your goddam drinks, just tell me!"", she pleads.

“You have made it to heaven, now all you have to do is pass the test to see what your fate will be.”

“What is the test?”
One man replied.

Peter says, 
“You must walk through the room of ducks. If you are able to make it to the other side with out stepping on a duck you will be paired with most beautiful woman in the world for all eternity.”

The men start rejoicing, but Peter stops them and warns,

“BUT If you step on a duck you will be paired with the ugliest woman in the world for all eternity.”

The first man enters the room with confidence. He makes it only about half way and steps on a duck.

Peter says, 
“You have failed. You will be paired with the ugliest woman in the world for all eternity.”

The second man says, 
“I can do this! Step aside.”

The man makes it almost all the way through, but unfortunately steps on a duck just short of victory.

Peter says to the man, 
“You have failed. You will be paired with the second ugliest woman in the world for all eternity.”

The last man is hesitant to enter the room, but he eventually makes it all the way through with out stepping on a single duck.

Peter exclaims, 
“You have made it! You will be paired with the most beautiful woman in the world for all eternity!”

The man is suddenly transported beside the woman.

He turns to the woman and asks,

The second drunk, looking at him puzzled, says, ""What the hell? I don't want a hot dog; I want a goddamn drink!""





The first says, ""I know. We buy the hot dog, stick it down the front of my pants, go into a bar and order our drinks. When the bartender tells us the price, you drop to your knees and suck the hot dog like you're sucking my dick - and the bartender will throw us out and we won't have to pay for anything!""




The second drunk says, ""Well, it sounds like a good enough idea to me.""





So they buy the hot dog and the first drunk sticks it down his pants. They go into a bar, order two whiskeys, and when the bartender tells them the price, the second drunk drops to his knees and sucks on the hot dog. The bartender throws them out and tells them not to come back.




The drunks go on to hit 19 bars. Finally, the second drunk says, ""We've got to switch places 'cause my knees hurt from dropping to the floor.""




The first drunk says, ""You think that's bad? I lost the hot dog in the third bar!"" ",2 Drunks and a Hotdog,35
