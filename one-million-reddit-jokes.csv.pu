The discussion turned to how difficult it was to communicate back and forth between heaven and hell.

Eventually, they decided that a bridge would be built between the two kingdoms.  It would be expensive, but as long as both sides each paid half of the costs, the bridge could be built and maintained in perpetuity for the benefit of both sides.

The contract was signed and the bridge was built.  For a long time, the arrangement in the contract was followed, but eventually, Satan started getting behind on his share of the payments.

God noticed that the bridge was starting to fall apart in places, and sent a polite note to Satan.  ""I know you've been busy down there, and I know times have been tough, but if you would please try to pay at least some of what you owe toward the bridge, that would be great.""

Satan's reply was quick and to the point: ""Fuck off."" 

Enraged, God sent off a reply.  ""We have a contract and you aren't holding up your end of it.  Pay up or I'll sue you until your eyeballs bubble.""

Satan's reply came promptly.  ""Where are you going to find a lawyer?""",God and Satan were talking together one day...,1
post,5pxs0k,2qh72,jokes,false,1485282436,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5pxs0k/fbi_interview/,self.jokes,,"The FBI was hiring and after many applicants, narrowed their choices down to 3 men. Each told to appear for a face to face interview and for them to bring their girlfriend/fiancé/wife. 


The first man is a 25 year old, just married, still fresh from college. Him and his wife are sitting close and talking about the plans they have for a wonderful life. The door opens, the agent tells the 25 year old to come back. Just as his wife gets up, the agent tells her that she has to wait outside until her part of the interview. 


The 25 YO sits down across from two agents. Both discuss how he is the perfect age, fitness level, and has a sharp mind for their type of work. But they say they need him to do one thing before they can offer the job. The 25 YO says, tell me what it is and I will do it. 


One of the agents pulls out a gun and puts it on the table and says: you have to prove your loyalty by going out there and shooting your wife. 


The 25 YO looks disgusted. Says he understands but he refuses and that he loves his wife too much. The agents say, thank you that will be all, and the 25 YO leaves. 


About an hour later a 35 YO man comes with his wife. They are discussing what to do about their bills, what's for dinner, what to do about their kids when they have to go to college. 

The door opens up and the agent asks the 35 YO to come back into the room. The 35 YO tell his wife to sit tight he will be back. 


He sits down across from the two agents. They begin to tell him that they usually rule out men his age for their work. However he scored off the charts in almost every test administered. They went on to say he even did better than most men in their 20's. 

But then comes the same question. Agent pulls his gun out, asks the 35 YO to go out there and shoot his wife. The 35 YO looks at the gun and his face leads you to think that he is actually considering it. However after what seemed to be a tense moment the man says he cannot. While him and his wife fight from time to time, they are best friends and he cannot leave his children with only one parent. 


The agents dismiss him and wish him luck. 


An hour later a 45 YO comes in with his wife. They are flat out arguing with each other. Even insulting each other out loud with raised voices. The door opens and the agent tells the 45 YO to come in back. The man then snaps at his wife to keep her ass in that seat. To which she flips him off. 


The 45 YO sits down across from the two agents. They begin to say how much they admire this man. 45 YO and in better shape than most 18 YOs who have applied. Smart, fit, agile, and no nonsense when it comes to getting tasks done. They say the job is his if he does one thing. 


The 45 YO man says just tell me what it is and it will be done without hesitation. 


The one agent pulls his gun out and says that the 45 YO has to go out there and shoot his wife. 


Without losing a second the 45 YO grabs the gun, throws the door open and then all you hear are gun shots, then the sound of an empty clip, then some struggling, and finally silence. 


The door fly's back open and it's the 45 YO man standing there. He is all sweaty, clothes messed up, scratches on his face, busted lip, nose, and his eye looks to be swelling up. 


Both agents just look at each other in a sort of amazed shock. 


The one agent says: just what the hell happened out there. 


The 45 YO man says: some asshole put blanks in the gun, she came at me and I had to use one of the chairs to beat her to death. So I got the job right?",FBI interview,273

Like many young men, the boy didn't really know what he  wanted to do, and he didn't seem too concerned about it. 

One day, while the boy was away at school, his father decided to try an experiment. He went into the boy's room and placed on his study table four objects:
A bible, a silver dollar, a bottle of Jack Daniels,  and a Playboy magazine.

'I'll just hide behind the door,' the preacher said to himself, 'and when he comes home from school this afternoon, I'll see which object he picks up.'

'If it's the Bible, he's going to be a preacher like me,  and what a blessing that would be! 'If he picks up the dollar, he's going to be a business man, and that would be okay, too. 'But, if he picks up the bottle, he's going to be a no-good drunkard, and Lord, what a shame that would be. 'And worst of all, if he picks up that magazine, he's going to be a skirt-chasing bum.'

The old man waited anxiously, and soon heard his son's footsteps as he entered the house whistling and heading for his room.

The boy tossed his books on the bed, and as he turned to leave the room, he spotted the objects on the table. With curiosity in his eye, he walked over to inspect them.

Finally, he picked up the Bible and placed it under his arm.
He picked up the Silver Dollar and dropped into his pocket.
He uncorked the bottle and took a big drink while he admired this month's centerfold.

He went to a sex shop and explained his situation. The man there said, ' Well, Dave,  I don't know that I have anything that will keep her occupied for so many weeks, except... The Magic Penis!'

Dave said, 'The what'?

The man repeated, 'The Magic Penis,' and pulled out what seemed to be an ordinary dildo.

Dave laughed, and said, 'It looks like a dildo!'

The man then pointed to the door and said, 'Magic Penis, door!'

The penis rose out of its box, darted over to the door and started pounding away at the keyhole. The whole door shook wildly with vibrations, so much so, that a crack began to form down the middle. Then the man said, 'Magic Penis, return to box!' and the penis stopped and returned to the box.

Dave bought it and took it home to his wife.
After Dave had been gone a few days, his wife remembered the Magic Penis. 

She undressed, opened the box and said 'Magic Penis, my vagina.'

The penis shot to her crotch. It was absolutely incredible. After three mind shattering orgasms, she became very exhausted and decided she'd had enough. She tried to pull it out, but it was stuck as her husband Dave had neglected to tell her how to turn it off so she put her clothes on, got in her car and started for the closest hospital.

On the way, another incredibly intense orgasm made her swerve all over the road. A Police Officer saw this and immediately pulled her over. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink.

Gasping and twitching, the woman said, 'I haven't had anything to drink officer. You see, I've got this Magic Penis thing stuck in my crotch and it won't stop screwing me.'

The officer looked at her for a second, shook his head and replied, 'Yeah right... Magic Penis, my ass!'",Magic Penis,157

One sunny day in January, 2017, an old man approaches the White House from across Pennsylvania Avenue where he’d been sitting on a park bench. He speaks to the U.S. Marine standing guard and says,

“I would like to go in and meet with President Obama.”
... 

The Marine looks at the man and says,

“Sir, Mr. Obama is no longer president and no longer resides here.”

The old man says,

“Okay,” and walks away.

The following day the same man approaches the White House and says to the same Marine,

“I would like to go in and meet with President Obama.”

The Marine again tells the man,

“Sir, as I said yesterday, Mr. Obama is no longer president and no longer resides here.”

The man thanks him and again walks away.

On the third day, the same man approaches the White House and speaks to the very same U.S. Marine, saying,

“I would like to go in and meet with President Obama.”

The Marine, understandably agitated at this point, looks at the man and says,

“Sir, this is the third day in a row you have been here asking to speak to Mr. Obama. I’ve told you already that Mr. Obama is no longer the president and no longer resides here. Don’t you understand?”

The old man looks at the Marine and says,

“Oh, I understand. I just love hearing it.”

The Marine snaps to attention, salutes, and says,

“See you tomorrow, Sir!”",President Obama and the old man,32

“Of course I can,” the young man promised.

post,5prx15,2qh72,jokes,false,1485207980,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5prx15/the_curse_of_the_twang/,self.jokes,,"It was a winters night, and the traveller struggled up the lonely snow filled road path toward the farm house where two lights shone out into the darkness sending hope to a weary man. 

Knocking on the door, the traveller shivered as he waited for someone to answer. Eventually, he heard the sliding of a bolt, the handle turned with a creak, and the farmer, holding a torch peered out into the cold night.

“What do you want?” asked the farmer.

“I am lost, my car broke down, and I was hoping to call for some help.”

“Ain’t got no phone.” replied the farmer, beginning to close the door over.

“Please!” called the traveller, more loudly than he wanted, “Do you have a room I can stay in for the night? I promise to be no trouble. If I stay out here I will freeze to death.”

Pausing for longer than the traveller liked, the farmer opened the door further.

“Suppose..”

Not waiting for the man to change his mind, the traveller stepped quickly into the hallway closing the door behind him.

“Come with me.” turning, the farmer began walking to the stairs, and began to climb.

With the traveller following, they eventually reached a door at the top of the stair. Holding the handle, the farmer paused, doubt crossing his face.

“Alright, here is your room, but before we go in, I need you to know something.”

“Yes?” asked the traveller.

“This is my daughters room. She is a fine lass, but a bit dim witted. I am going to trust you to share a bed with her ‘cos it’s the only spare one we have see? But, if you try anything...well, be warned, the Curse of the Twang will befall you, alright?”

The traveller suppressed a yell of “Yes! Get in my son!” only managing a timid squeak, “Curse of the Twang?” he asked.

“Yes, its a curse see? And well, it comes to those who touch my beautiful daughter see?”

“Yes, you have my word sir. On my honour.”

“Fair enough then.”

Opening the door, the farmer led the man into the room. “This is my daughter Aileen.”

There sitting in bed was a twenty something buxom woman. The traveller nearly giggled, “And you are fine with me to share this bed with you lady?”

“Oh yes, for the curse will protect me.”

“Right,” said the farmer, “best be getting some sleep then.

With that the farmer left closing the door. The traveller wasting precious little time, got undressed and slipped into the bed beside the farmers daughter.

With the lights off, the traveller started to get a little fresh, with a tickle and a playful squeeze. The farmer’s daughter giggled and played along.

Suddenly, the door opened and the farmer stood there. “you ain’t trying anything are you?”

“No. Not me.” replied the traveller.

“Mind that curse fella.” said the farmer and closed the door.

Well, as you can imagine one thing led to another and deeds were done. The traveller, happy and satisfied, fell into a blissful sleep.. “what curse?” he thought to himself...

“Oi you, fella!” the traveller was suddenly awake, shocked and trying to come to his senses. The farmer daughter was still in bed beside him and the farmer was standing by the bedroom window holding a rock. the farmer hefted the rock in his hand and the traveller could see it had a piece of paper wrapped around it and some string attached.

“I warned you that the curse of the Twang would come to you if there was no good going on with my daughter. I’ve tied this rock to your left ball.” and with that the farmer threw the rock high out of the window into the night sky.

Without a moments hesitation the traveller leapt out the window, and falling toward the soft snow below he caught the rock in mid air. There on the paper wrapped around the rock he saw some words....he could hear them speaking to him in the farmers voice.

“I tied your right ball to the bed post.”

""As part of our skilled migration scheme, you will each have to propose a design for a planned 200 storey mixed-use development here in Heaven. The person with the most attractive proposal will be granted entry into Heaven. You have 4 days to complete your proposal.""


The German engineer and the Indian engineer feverishly set about working on their drafts. The Chinese engineer, however, just dicks around, occasionally doodling on his draft paper and making funny shapes in AutoCAD whilst mooching off the free food and drink provided.


The four days are up, and the engineers are called to the boardroom. The German is first to present.


""Due to the soft and unstable nature of the clouds that make up much of the ground in Heaven, it is necessary for free cantilever grout mixed piles to be driven to a considerable depth. This, along with the overall height of the structure, would ordinarily result in a dead load that would send the building plummeting through the clouds and down into the mortal realm, but my design takes advantage of the fact that rare and difficult-to-refine materials with high tensile strengths such as graphene and titanium are readily available in their required forms. The use of these materials, though costly, will significantly reduce structural self-weight without compromising on stability and soundness. Naturally, only the most highly-trained German construction workers and materials engineers will be hired to ensure consistency and professionalism. The proposed cost of my design will $200 billion, but I assure you that the building will be standing even till the end of time.""
 
Impressed but a little apprehensive about the proposed cost, St. Peter calls on the Indian engineer to present.


""I prefer to take a more economical approach to my designs. Sure, you can build a nice, sturdy, and shiny building if you throw ridiculous amounts of cash at it, but do you really want to look at the same building for all eternity? My design will be composed entirely of recycled styrofoam blocks to save weight and cost, and the construction crew will consist of unskilled labourers from my country willing to work far below the poverty line. The estimated cost of my design will be $20 million. Sure, it might crumble here and there occasionally, but you'll be saving the environment by reducing the amount of styrofoam floating around in the ocean.


""Besides,"" he chuckled, ""it's not like you can die again even if you fall off a building in Heaven.""

Shaking his head at the ridiculousness of the Indian engineer's plan, St. Peter calls on the Chinese engineer to present.

The Chinese engineer stands, clears his throat, and says ""My design will cost $250 billion. That is all.""


St. Peter nearly jumps out of his chair in incredulity. ""What?! Your proposal is $50 billion more expensive than than the German's, and he plans to use the rarest and most expensive materials known to man. Pray tell, how do you justify the cost of your design?""

 
 The Chinese engineer winks and whispers into St. Peter's ear. ""We steal the Indian's design, I take $100 billion and you keep the rest. How does that sound? ;)""","A German engineer, an Indian engineer, and a Chinese engineer die and go to Heaven",10

He thinks it was just a figment of his imagination and drives on without a second thought. 

Soon he sees another sign which says:

HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION 

5 MILES 

Suddenly, he begins to realize that these signs are for real. 

Then he drives past a third sign saying: 

SISTERS OF ST, FRANCIS

His curiosity gets the best of him and he pulls into the drive. 

On the far side of the parking lot is a somber stone building with a small sign next to the door reading: 

SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS 

He climbs the steps and rings the bell. 

The door is answered by a nun in a long black habit who asks, ""What may we do for you, my son?"" 

He answers, ""I saw your signs along the highway, and was interested in possibly doing business."" 

""Very well, my son. Please follow me."" 

He is led through many winding passages and is soon quite disoriented. 

The nun stops at a closed door, and tells the man, ""Please knock on this door."" 

He does as he is told and this door is answered by another nun in long habit, holding a tin cup. 

This nun instructs, ""Please place $50 in the cup, then go through the large wooden door at the end of this hallway."" 

He gets $50 out of his wallet and places it in the second nun's cup.

He trots eagerly down the hall and slips through the door, pulling it shut behind him. 

As the door locks behind him, he finds himself back in the parking lot, facing another small sign:

The bartender deploys the drinks to everyone around the smoky bar, the newcomers raise their glasses, and everyone drinks.

The scientist and the engineer then pay their substantial tab, leave a generous tip, and pull away in a Tesla. Naturally, everyone is a bit confused about what just happened, but before long everyone gets back to NASCAR, NFL, Fox, country music, cigarettes, cheap beer, Trump, and arguing about Ford versus Chevy.

While the engineer sets the car to autopilot, the scientist pulls up this very joke, half composed, on his iPad, and with furrowed brow says, ""We still need a punch line.""

The engineer nods in affirmation, and says, ""Look in the rear view mirror.""

He looks. The small dive bar recedes into the darkness as the Tesla picks up speed, rapidly and silently.

After about five minutes the old man lets another one go and says, ""Aha, I'm ahead 2 to 1""

The dean says, ""I'll show you. Do you own a weedeater?""
