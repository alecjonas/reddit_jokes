The Doctor says, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches.

The bad news is that it will require removing your testicles.

You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.    

The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.' 

Joe is shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. 

He had no choice but to go under the knife. The surgery cost him US$ 75,000.

When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.   

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. 

He saw a Men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new Suit.' 

He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new Suit.'

Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?'

Joe was surprised, 'That's right, how did you know?' 

'Been in the business 60 years sir.' 

Joe tried  the shirt and it fitted perfectly. 

Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new Underwear?' 

Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure..'

Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! You got it wrong this time! I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old..'

They are pulling the walrus by the tail, but it's really hard to pull since its tusks keep digging into the snow and the tail continuously slips out of their grip.

Halfway home, they come across a geologist. The geologist sees their struggle and says:

""You should grab the walrus by its tusks, that way you can hold it better and the tail will just slide on the snow"".

The Eskimos try that and it's indeed easier. So the Eskimos and the geologist part ways. In a few hours one Eskimo says:

""Geologist smart. Really easy to pull walrus"".

The other exclaims:

the black man does not even open the lunch box, as the 135f radiant heat off the roof has placed the ubiquitous smell of cornbread in the air.  a man of his word, he jumps.

So one of my aunts is African American and ever since Black Panther came out, we all call he Aunt Wakanda (I know ...). Any way, my wife always tries to get my Aunt to go to our Catholic church with us, but my Aunt refuses even though she grew up in the church. We finally asked her why she won’t ever go with us and she said that she swore to never go back after growing up in Catholic school and growing a deep hatred for nuns.

My Aunt is a fairly heavyset southern woman who loves herself some food, so my wife made the suggestion that we should wait until our Catholic church does one of their big charity bake sales and just try to get my Aunt to at least come to that even if she won’t step foot inside for Mass. I thought that was pretty dumb and said, “Hun, that is kind of stereotyping to think that my heavy Aunt Wakanda would come just for food.” However, she was right, and my Aunt actually seemed interested. We warned my Aunt that there would still be nuns at the bake sale, but she agreed that she would still come by if my wife would bake her southern favorite (hot crossed buns) to give to the nuns to sell for the charity event. 

When we got home after the event, my wife asked me what the moral of this whole story was and I replied (queue music) “My Aunt Wakanda don’t want nuns unless they got buns, hun!”",Wait for it ...,1

""I toast to spending the rest of my nights between my wife's legs!""

So he won the best toast of the night for the first time. He arrived home buzzed and overly excited thinking this was the night they would finally have sex.

""Really, what did you toast for?""

But Johnnie was suddenly scared of making things worse: ""Well... I toasted to spending all my days in church!""

So the next day, Johnnie and Mary are walking in town and one of Johnnie's friends approaches the couple with a naughty smile.

""Mary... did you know Johnnie won the best toast last night?""

Johnnie freezes and Mary replies: ""Yes, but that's odd... every time I tell him to do it he refuses. If we ever do it, he falls asleep halfway through.

A man walked into then ladies department and shyly walked up to the woman behind the counter and said,
“I'd like to buy a bra for my wife.”

'”What type of bra?”, asked the clerk.
“Type?”, inquires the man, “There's more than one type?”

“Look around”, said the saleslady, as she showed a sea of bras in every shape, size, color and material imaginable.
“Actually, even with all of this variety, there are really only four types of bras to choose from.”

Relieved, the man asked about the types. 

The saleslady replied: “There are the Catholic, Salvation Army, Presbyterian, and the Baptist types.
Which one would you prefer?”

Now totally befuddled, the man asked about the differences between them.

The Saleslady responded, 'It is all really quite simple.'

The Catholic type supports the masses. 

The Salvation Army type lifts the fallen. 

The Presbyterian type keeps them staunch and upright. 

The Baptist type makes mountains out of molehills. 

BONUS:
Oh and have you ever wondered why A, B, C, D, DD , E, F, G, and H are the letters used to define bra sizes?

If you have wondered why, but couldn't figure out what the letters stood for, it is about time you became informed!
{A} Almost Boobs.
{B} Barely there.
{C} Can't Complain.
{D} Dang!
{DD} Double dang!
{E} Enormous!
{F} Fake.
{G} Get a Reduction.
{H} Help me, I've fallen and I can't get up!",What religion is your bra??,22

After being on the island for a couple days a plane flies overhead and sees their SOS on the beach. With their supplies almost exhausted they start to search the island for food and water while they wait for the rescue to arrive and come across an old oil lamp. As a joke one guy syas to the others ""Maybe if we rub it a genie will pop out"" and gives it a quick buff with his sleeve. Low and behold to their surprise a genie really does appear and offers them each 3 wishes for freeing him.

So the first guy says ""For my first wish I want 5 billion dollars!"" The genie snaps his fingers and tells him that its done. The second guy yells out ""I want to be the richest man alive"" and the genie again snaps his fingers and tells the man that he is now richer than Bill Gates. The third guy takes his time and after much humming and hawing says to the genie ""I wish that my left arm was constantly rotating clockwise."" The genie thinking that this is a very odd request asks if he's sure and the guy reaffirms his wish so the genie snaps his fingers and the guy's left arm starts to rotate clockwise.

For his second wish the first guy asks for the ""The hottest wife in the world."" and the genie snaps his fingers and bombshell appears on the mans arm. Seeing this the second guy wishes ""To be able to sleep with any person he wants"" so the genie snaps his fingers and the second guy beckons to the first's new wife. The third guy acter more humming and hawing finally says ""I wish my right arm was constantly rotating counter-clockwise."" Again the genie questions him if that really is his wish before snapping his fingers and the man's right arm begins rotate the opposite way of his left.

Going back to the first guy the genie asks him for his third and final wish to which the man states that he wants to be the president of the United States. So the genie snaps his fingers and tells him that as soon as his feet touch the ground back in the US that he will be sworn in as president. Moving on to the second guy the genie begins to ask what his second wish is but the guy cuts hims off and demands unlimited political power. The genie angrily snaps his fingers, tells him that it is done and the second guy begins telling the first how to run the country when they get back. The third guy again is humming and hawing and seeing the rescue boat drawing near says ""I wish my head was constantly nodding up and down."" The genie really doesn't see why the third guy keeps making these strange wishes and again asks if he is 100% sure that's what he wants and the man says yes. So the genie snaps his fingers and the man's head begins to nod up and down.

At this point the rescue boat has pulled into shore so they three guys board it and one the way home agree to meet again in five years to see how each is getting on in life after their incredible experience. 

Five years later they all meet again and the first guy says ""Life is good. I got re-elected for a second term as president, I'm still super rich and my wife is still the hottest woman on the planet.""
The second guy tells them ""Life is great. I'm still the richest man alive, get to tell the first guy what to do and sometimes I bang his super hot wife."" 

Now both guys turn to the third who's arms are still rotating and his head is still nodding up and down and he tells them ""You know what guys? I think I fucked up.""",So a Cruise Ship Sinks...,12

Short on time with days till or, he remembers ""shoot! I don't have a tux!"". He hurries to a suit store where dozens of late comers just like him are standing in l Thw boy stands there for hours waiting to get fitted and purchase his new tux. And leaves the store just as it's closing.
The boy is excited knowing he has a nice set of threads to impress his date, but he remembers he hasn't bought any tickets to the actual dance! The next day he runs to the school to buy tickets, only to find just like him, there were dozens of late comers waiting in line to buy tickets. Though he's not so disappointed as he isn't at the end of the line. A good half hour goes by and he finally buys the last two prom tickets for him and his date. Tickets in hand, knees shaky, and heart pounding the boy calls the girl to tell he has the tickets. ""Great! I have a dress all ready and I can't wait for the dance!"". 
After days of nerve wracking patience, the boy picks up the girl to take her to their junior prom. When they get to the door leading to prom they have to wait in line for another time! Frustrated and fed up with lines, the boy drags his date to the front of the line, hands the greeter the tickets and they both walk in side. 
The night is going well. The music ia hot, both the girl and the boy have sweet dance moves and they tear up the dance floor. An hour goes by and the girl is tired and very thirsty. She says to the boy ""would you be a dear and go get us something to drink?"". The boy gladly walks to the drink bar and he finds what else? More lines! He stops his foot and crosses his arms, scanning the bar fir a shorter line. The apple juice line, the orange juice line, the soda line. And then he sees it!!...

Germany went into a deep depression after his defeat in the last fight. His bar tab from his enemies' victory drink was crushing. He started hitting the gym, and wanted revenge. One day, he returns to the same bar. Britain, France, Russia (who changed his name to the USSR after his personality change), everyone. They all stare at him.

Germany walks to Chezhslovokia and asks for his wallet. He refuses, but France and Britain make him give it up, so he does.

Germany thanks him, before hitting him over the head with a bat. Austria gives up immediately.

He walks over to Poland, but Britain and France warn him. He calls over the USSR, and they both beat Poland to a pulp.

Britain and France have enough, and officially declare a bar fight. Nothing happens.

Again, the tension is thick enough to cut with a knife. Germany picks up France, and throws him through a window. He gives up.

The USSR takes some steroids.

Britain stands on the bar counter while Germany swings his bat. Britain blocks or dodges all of them. Germany is tired, and thinks that now is the perfect time to attack the USSR.

The USSR gets thrown through a window, and hit with Germany's bat several times, but then the steroids kick in. He uppercuts Germany and he goes flying.

Meanwhile, Japan, who is making sexual advances towards China, hits America over the head with a barstool. America is furious, and they fight.

Italy passes out.

Britain jumps on Germany while he is fighting the USSR. France comes back out of nowhere.

Germany can't take anymore, so he hits himself with his bat, and dies. They split Germany in half as a trophy.

Meanwhile, America is still fighting Japan, whips out a knife and stabs Japan twice.

Everyone is surprised.

One year Joe and Martha went to the fair and he said: “Martha, I’m 71 years old. If I don’t ride that plane this year I may never get another chance.”

Martha replied: “Joe, that plane ride costs $10, and $10 is $10.”

The pilot overheard them and said: “Folks, I’ll make you a deal, I’ll take you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say one word, I won’t charge you, but if you say one word it’s $10.” Joe and Martha agreed and up they went.

The pilot did all kinds of twists and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word was heard. He did all his tricks over again, but still not a word. They landed and the pilot turned to Joe: “By golly, I did everything I could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn’t.”

She kept records and any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced.

This took a lot of time, so she bought some tiny bells and attached them to her roosters. Each bell had a different tone, so she could tell from a distance which rooster was performing. Now, she could sit on the porch and fill out an efficiency report by just listening to the bells.

Sarah's favorite rooster, old Butch, was a very fine specimen but, this morning she noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all! When she went to investigate, she saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing, but the pullets hearing the roosters coming, would run for cover.

To Sarah's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring. He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job, and walk on to the next one. Sarah was so proud of old Butch, she entered him in a show and he became an overnight sensation among the judges.

Father O'Malley comes out from Sunday mass to talk with his parishioners and Mrs. Coughlin asks if she may have a word with him.

""Of course, Mrs. Coughlin. What seems to be the problem?

“This may sound like a strange question, but I have a problem with my parrot and I hear that you have two wonderful parrots. And I don't know who to turn to.”

“Well you certainly have come to the right person. What exactly is the problem?”

“You may remember that my dear husband, God rest his soul, enjoyed a game or two of poker.”

“I do recall Jim was quite the man with a deck of cards.”

“Well to make a long story short, he was in this card game with a bunch of sailors only a month before he passed away and ended up winning a parrot to which he became very attached.”

“So, now I have this parrot and I don't know what to do with it. She has the foulest mouth I've ever heard. I'm too embarrassed to even tell you what she says.”

“Anyway, I've tried everything. I've scolded it. I've taken away her treats. I've even washed her mouth out with soap. It just hasn't deterred her at all. I can't take it anymore.”

As she starts to sob, Father O'Malley tells her not to worry he has the answer to her problem and brings her over to his office in the rectory.

As they enter the office, Mrs. Coughlin is amazed to see two parrots sitting in their cage, very calmly praying with little rosary beads in their claws. 

“Mrs. Coughlin I’d like you to meet my parrots, Tom and Harry.”

“Boys say good morning to Mrs. Coughlin”

Squawk! Good morning Mrs. Coughlin they say in unison and return to praying their little rosaries.

“See how well they're behaved they are? I think if you were to bring over your parrot to spend a few days with my fine birds she would end up being just like them.”

Oh, thank you father. If you don't mind I'll go home and bring my parrot right over.

That's a fine idea. I'll see you soon.

Twenty minutes later Mrs. Coughlin is back with a covered cage in her hand.

Father O'Malley welcomes her in and tells her to place the cage on the hook next to his birds who continue to pray on their rosaries whike staring at the new cage placed next to them.

Mrs. Coughlin take off the cover and immediately her parrot squawks at the other parrots.

“Hey boys! Want a blow job?”

Tom looks over at Harry and says,

“We can finally throw these fucking beads away, our prayers have been answered.”",Parrots. long,15

“You came just in time as I am in need of putting up a new fence for my cattle.” 

The rancher gathers the materials and they ride out on horseback to the field, under the heat of the beating sun. 

They arrive to the first spot for a fence post. The rancher spits out his dip and tells the boy, “first you gotta take your post hole digger and start digging a hole about yay wide by yay deep. Like this.” He starts digging a hole for a post and works up a sweat, but at last, he makes the whole deep enough. 

“Next you grab a post and set it in there like so. Some people fill their holes with concrete, but I’ve never been a fancy type. I just fill mine back up with dirt and it will last for decades. Make sure she’s nice and straight, and make the sure dirt is packed hard.”

The boy had been watching the rancher, taking mental notes. The sun was right over their heads and they started getting soaked in sweat. 

After a couple of posts were put in, the rancher says to the boy, “I’m going to let you put in the rest of the posts. I’ve gotta work on other things. Once you’re done with the posts, I’ve got all the fencing on a trailer. You can pick it up and staple the fence up. Then you can move the cattle into the new area. All you have to do is open the fences and put the cattle dogs on’em - they’ll run right in. Easy enough. I’ve taught you how to put in some quality posts and everything, can I trust you?”

The boy replies, “Yes sir. I’ll put in all these posts and then staple up the fence to finish the job while you work on other projects.” 

“Good boy, make me proud”

So the old rancher returns to the house and to his shop to work on other things while the boy works hard in the field all day.

The young man worked constantly and was able to put up the fence very quickly.


Later that day, a cow runs right into the old man’s shop. The cow looks at the old man and mooos, as if taunting, before running back outside. 

Baffled, the old man exclaims, “what the hail!” He darts out of the shop and looks out to the field. He sees cattle roaming all over, they’re out of their pasture. “Godammit!” The old man runs as fast as he can to the boy in the field. 

He sees that the new fence had been easily trampled to the ground by the herd because of poor construction and lack of thought on the boy’s part. “What the hell did you do boy!?! I told you to put in a fence and now look at what you done!”

“I’m sorry sir, what I did is unforgivable. I’m a lowlife. I live my life with my head fully wedged into my ass.”

“You’re goddamn right godammit! You screwed everything up! I gave you one job!”

The rancher was frothing at the mouth by now.

You know what, it would behoove you to go unfuck yourself! I wouldn’t trust you to cook, you’d burn the god damn hot water. Jesus H. Christ kid! Everything is fucked up. Everything is fucked big time!! And it’s all because of your shit posting!”","Once upon a time, an young man asked his grandfather, an old rancher, how to put up a fence...",4
