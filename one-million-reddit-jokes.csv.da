""20 pounds in a week"" 
""50 pounds in a week"".

Next morning a beautiful woman wearing nothing but Nike shoes and a placard on her chest knocked on John's door. The placard read, 

"" If you catch me you can do anything you want with me""
 
 As soon as John read that, the woman ran away, and John followed. After 3 hours John caught her and then had his way with her. This went on for a week and John was impressed by the results. So impressed, that in fact he called the company and asked for the 20 pounds a week plan to be activated. 

Next morning 3 beautiful women wearing nothing but Nike shoes and a placard on their chests knocked on John's door. The placards read,

The jews vote and decide on an old, wise rabbi. 

The time for the debate comes, and it dawns on them that they can't understand each other, so they decide to have a nonverbal debate. 

The pope waves his finger around in the air, and the rabbi replies by pointing down at the ground. The pope then holds up 3 fingers, and the rabbi replies by holding up a single finger. The pope then takes out bread and wine, and the rabbi takes out an apple. The pope concedes, and lets the jews stay in italy. 

After the debate is over, a young cardinal asks the pope why he conceded. The pope replies to the cardinal 

""I waved my hand in the air to show that God is all around us, and he pointed to the ground to show that God is right here with us. I held up 3 fingers, symbolizing the trinity, and he held up one, symbolizing the one god we share between us. I then took out the bread and wine, a reminder of the last supper and of holy communion; and he took out an apple, symbolizing the fruit of knowledge that lead up to that moment. From that point, I knew he had me beat.""

while this is happening, a jew asks the rabbi how he won the debate. 
""heck if i know, he waved his hand in the air to show that he would remove all of the jews from italy, so i pointed down to show that we're staying right here. he said we had 3 days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger."" 

""and what about the last part?"" 

""well he took out his lunch so i took out mine!""",The pope decides to remove all of the jews from italy.,23

This annoyed Ethel, and she'd taken to telling him, ""Dammit Harold, one of these days you are going to shit your guts out.""  Harold would always just grin and go about his morning ritual.

One year for Thanksgiving, Ethel had to get up early to prep the turkey.  As she was removing the bird's giblets, she had a wonderful idea for a practical joke.  She quietly tiptoed into their bedroom while Harold was still asleep, and gently slipped some of the lumpier gibs into his boxer briefs and snuck back to the kitchen giggling to herself.

About a half hour or so later, she heard the usual morning trumpeting but this time accompanied by a blood-curdling scream, followed by loud footsteps and the slamming of their bathroom door.  Ethel laughed to herself and went on with the meal prep.

About 10 minutes later Harold emerged from the bathroom with a triumphant smile on his face.  ""Ethel, you were right, my morning methane had such a powerful follow through that I went and shit my guts right out.  But by the grace of God and these two fingers, everything's gonna be alright.""","Harold and Ethel had been happily married for years, except for one quirk",14

Very similar to a shrew, it was about 24 centimeters in size.

They followed it back to its home where they found tons more.

It became famous. Many people used it as a calming tool and a therapeutic pet in ""Riposse therapy"". Now...

Years later, one of them was brought to the house of the Dalai Lama by a monk.

""Sir, look at this thing! It's so cute! The therapy definitely worked on my friend, but is it worth for me?""

""Put it away.""

""Why?""

""You see, I've seen these things before in the wild. They're cute, but...

Days later, I got a vision from the Buddha himself. He told me...

So all the male animals were chasing her and she picked the lion. You know, king and all that goes with it. They got married, lived happily ever after until the fox got pregnant. That sounded cool until she gave birth to...5 pink, cute piglets. The lion as an alpha male got really mad and dumped her in an instant.

Now we have the fox-pretty and elegant but with the little piglets on her hands and her future is not looking as bright as it did. But one day the wolf approached her:

\-I wanna marry you, you are so attractive that by merely showing around me you'll increase my profile. I'll take care of you and your piglets but there is one condition-don't cheat on me or there will be violence!

The cornered fox readily agreed and soon they were married. In a year or 2 tho she got pregnant and what do you know-she gave birth to 6 cute, tiny piglets! As promised the wolf erupted in short, firm violence and not long after the fox was single again.

Now nobody wanted to marry her and her future started looking grim with all the little piglets on her hands. But one day the rabbit approached her:

\-I have always been in love with you girl, I thought I have no chance with you but now that no one wants you can I offer my help? I have just one thing to ask you-I love you too much so please don't cheat on me or my heart will be broken and I will have to suicide. The fox happily agrees and they live happily ever after. Until.... several years later she gets pregnant. The whole forest anxiously expects the results and the naysayers are not disappointed-the fox gives birth to 7 healthy piglets! The fox grabs his gun, says goodbye and through his tears asks:

\-I told you'll break my heart, you'll kill me....why did you have to cause this to me?

\-Well honey tell me what I can do. You know all men are pigs, right?",The naughty fox,0

He rolled over to pick himself up, but he saw the bear, right on top of him, raising his paw above him to strike. At that instant, the atheist, without thinking, cried out, ""Oh my God!""

Time stopped. The bear was frozen in place. The forest was silent. Even the river stopped moving. All of a sudden, a bright light shined down from heaven. A voice thundered, ""You deny my existence for all these years, teach others I don't exist, and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you expect me to help you now? Am I to count you as a believer?""

The atheist thought for a second, then answered. ""It would be hypocritical of me to proclaim myself as a believer after all these years; but, perhaps you could spare my life by making the bear a believer in your laws.

""very well"", said the voice. ""I'll try"".

The light vanished. The river started moving again. And then the bear put his paws together, bowed his head, and spoke:

""Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful. Amen.""","An atheist was taking a walk through the woods, admiring all that the ""accident of evolution"" had created.",95

As we passed, they all said in unison, ""You may now kiss the bride!"" My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.

The raven didn't do much, he was simply sitting on his ass. After some time another raven spotted the solid branch and the first raven and decided to sit directly beside him. The second raven asked the first raven: 

""Hey pal, what are you up to?"" 

""Nothing"", the first raven answered, ""I am just sitting on my ass.""

The second raven was seemingly impressed by the beauty of his new friends' words and answered: ""What a great idea, let me join you!""

After some time a little rabbit came across the big oak, when he suddenly realized two ravens sitting on their asses on a solid branch.

""What are you guys doing?"", the rabbit asked.

""Not much, we are just sitting on our asses"", the ravens answered.

The rabbit also liked the idea and looked for a shady, but cosy spot beneath the big oak.

Time passed and a fox came by. Firstly, he wanted to attack the rabbit, but then he realised that the rabbit was not alone: There were to ravens unmistakably sitting their asses on this solid branch and also the rabbit didn't seem to do any more.

""What are you three guys doing there?""

""Hardly anything, we are just sitting our asses"", the three animals answered, and the fox joined the rabbit beneath the tree.

The four animals spent several hours in this position, living in peace and perfect harmony.

Suddenly, out of thin air, a really loud explosion was hearable, followed by a second.
The rabbit was smashed against the oak because of the power of the gun the hunter has used. But also the fox was dead immediatly after the missile has hit his head trough his right eye.

One of the ravens leaned towards the other ""See, sitting on one's ass is only possible in a higher position.""",The Tale Of The Two Ravens,14

The pianist says - “this is one of my favourites. It’s called ‘I Was Fucking Your Dog But It Bit My Penis So Now My Balls Hurt’”.

The manager, appalled, says - “how dare you suggest such a title, this is a prestigious restaurant and I won’t hav-“.

“No believe me sir, you will adore this one”. The pianist went on to play the most energetic and whimsical jazz solo the manager had ever heard.

Obviously, the manager was stunned. “That was actually rather brilliant, do you however happen to know any quieter tracks?”.

“Yes of course, here’s one known as “I Was Batting Off to a Photo of Your Daughter But My Wife Walked In So Now She’s Divorced M-“

“Excuse me please but such things cannot be said in this restaurant, how dar-“

“No sir, believe me, it’s a fantastic track, I’m sure you and all of your patrons will love it”.

Waved on, the pianist begins to play the most beautiful, slow, and solemn ballad the manager has ever heard in his life. “That was quite something. Is there any chance you know any blues?”

Without a word the pianist started tapping away, perfect timing, perfect progressions, perfect everything. It was a stunning blues performance.

The manager, stunned almost beyond words, fathomed, “Amazing! What was that one called?”

“‘As Your Father Gave Me a Colonoscopy I Accidentally Jizzed All Over The Operating Table’”.

The manager flinched, and after a moment proposed - “You really are incredibly good, if I was to hire you could you refrain from sharing your song titles with any of our diners?""

""Absolutely"". And the pianist was hired on the spot.

A couple of months go by, and the pianist has been doing very well so far, and hasn't opened his mouth once about his song titles, even when asked. One night, however, the pianist is playing away on a particularly busy evening, and has been bursting at the seams of his bladder since he first sat down. During a quick one minute speech from the owner, the pianist decides to take the opportunity to sprint to the bathroom and relieve himself. Halfway through his toilet visit, he hears his boss from the bar - ""where's that fucking pianist?""

Without properly preparing himself, the pianist runs out of the bathroom, cock out and all, and sits back down and starts playing away. After his next song concluded, one of the patrons walks over and asks - ""Do you know your cock is hanging out and dripping piss all over the floor?"".

The pianist replies - ""Know it? I wrote it!""",The Crude Pianist.,93

Tiger nods a quick “hello” and bends forward to pick up the nozzle.

“What are dose? asks the attendant.
“They’re called tees” replies Tiger.

My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend? She was a dream! There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. 

One day her little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me."" I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, ""We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family"".

""Yes"" she says, ""I remember it well.""

""Ok"", he says. ""How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake..?""

""Oh Jim, you Dirty Old Devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!"" she replies with excitement in her voice.

 A Police Officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks ""I've just got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll keep an eye on them so there's no trouble.""

So he follows them.

 The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on to each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence.

 The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in... 

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

 The Policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

 After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The Policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

 So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Please excuse me, but that was something. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

 Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

""Fifty years ago that wasn't an Electric Fence.""","The husband leans over and asks his wife ""Do you remember the first time we had sex? [...]""",371

post,cpsh8k,2qh72,jokes,false,1565699469,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cpsh8k/when_my_grandfather_was_a_young_boy_living/,self.jokes,,"they didn't have much as way of entertainment except for fishing and hunting with his big shaggy dog, Bear. When he wasn't helping his parents out with chores, he spent most of his summers out in the forests camping with Bear, hunting squirrels and rabbits, or just fishing along the river. He'd wandered a bit further away one day than he normally did, and came across an old monastary with a congregation of friars. 

Now, this region of Kentucky wasn't very well off, so what a lot of the small town farmers did was take their goods in to the larger city to sell at farmers markets and to stores. The friars were no exception to this because while they didn't need much money, they did need some to buy food and clothes. When my grandfather came across that old monastary, he'd seen acre after acre of wide open meadows just full of wildflowers of every sort you could imagine. Big yellow flowers, little red and blue speckled flowers, daisies, queen's lace. The fields were alive with bees buzzing and humming birds humming, truly, it was a beautiful, inspiring sight. And out there, scattered throughout the meadows, the friars, each with a big woven basket filled to the brim with boquets they crafted by hand. These were what they would send in to town to be sold.

My great grandfather, that is, my grandpa's dad, worked for a man that lived in the city most of the local farmers would travel to to sell their produce. This man was a baron of sorts; he owned several businesses in town and he was always on the look out for a new business or property to invest in to grow his wealth. His name was Hugh, and he wasnt known for his huge, friendly demeanor. What he was known for was his ruthless and cunning sense of busines. Hugh never let anything get in his way when it came to growing his business. 

A year after my grandpa and Bear met the friars, a reporter came to town to photograph the festival they had every summer in town. This festival was the town's yearly highlight, at least as big a deal as Thanksgiving and nearly as big a deal as Easter and Christmas (which in those days made it a Very Big Deal indeed)! Every year for the festival the friars would supply the most stunning flower arrangements for the town's main street, through which the town would have a small parade with the mayor tossing candies for all the children, and men and women in costumes dancing along to music played by the school's small band. Folk from all around the town would journey in for the day, set up food stalls to sell pies and hot cakes, roast rabbit on toast and spicy squirrel stew. This year the festival was held in even higher anticipation because of the participation of the local fire department. They'd offered to lead the parade with a big red firetruck, and the firemen all dressed up in celebration. 

The fire department's presence was as much for the celebration as it was for safety. The previous year an unfortunate accident had caused a large fire to catch and spread to the forest around the town. Several blocks of the town had been evacuated before the fire was finally contained and put out, but not before some acres of the forest had burned down. But that event had gotten my grandpa's small town on the radar of the big city, and the local paper had decided to feature them in an article this particular summer! 

The festival was a tremendous success! The food was fantastic, the parade was picturesque! The friars flower displays were the highlight of the night, and the photographer made sure to do them as much justice as he could. Truly, they were the talk of the festival, to the point that some weeks later at the next farmers market in the city, the friars sold out of their boquets in the first hour of the morning! Word had spread, pardon the pun, like a fire, and everyone wanted to buy the friars flowers!

Even old Hugh had seen and heard word of the sudden popularity of these boquets and went down to the market to see for himself. He stood, mouth agape, as a crowed massed around the floral displays, pushing to be the next to buy before the flowers were all gone. Much to the dismay of the friars, their newfound popularity lead to incredible new demand. And though they did try to prepare more boquets for the market, they were realy selling more than they'd ever intended. For while the did it for a little money to afford necessiries, for the friars, spreading beauty and peace with their flowers was more than enough in return.

When Hugh saw the potential in the popularity of the flowers the friars grew, his mind immediately started working on a way to turn it to his benefit. He waited for the crowds to finally die down and went to speak to the holy men. 

""I'd like to make you an offer,"" Hugh said. ""Your beautiful flowers are the talk of the town. I'd like to help you out by handling all the sales of the flowers for you, for a small cut of the profit! That way, you can focus on growing and creating your wonderful boquets, without worrying about the hassle and bother of coming into the market each week and dealing with the crowds!""

The friars thanked Hugh for his offer, but they explained to him that for them, the boquets were not just a business endeavor, it was their service to the community to spread peace and joy with God's flowers and blessings. And with that, the friars packed up and started the journey back to their monastary.

Well, Hugh was not satisfied at all with that answer, and he came up with a plan. Over the next few weeks he ordered crate after craft of exotic flowers from all around the world. Beautiful flowers from Morocco to France, stunning petals from China to India. Anything colorful and amazing that he could learn about. He set up a large shop just down the road from the Farmer's market where the Friars had their stall, and he called it The Festival Flourist and Fantastic Flowers. At first, the town was abuzz with these new and wonderful flowers, but after a few weeks, as the novelty wore off, the sales declined and soon Hugh's shop was empty. 

For some reason he couldn't figure out, though, the friars were doing as well as ever! Week in and out, lines down the street would stand patiently waiting for the friars flowers. And cunning as he was, Hugh would not rest until he'd made his new business a success. 

A year or so later, my grandpa was on another fishing adventure with Bear, just following allong with stream, sometimes wading through the shallower parts of the water, othertimes dropping in a line and resting in the shade of a tree, when he saw thick, black smoke rising above the forest. Curious as any young boy would be, he set off at a run through the trees, heading towards the smoke. 

When he reached a large open meadow, a devastating sight lay before him: dozens of friars with brooms and small buckets were frantically working through the flower meadows tyring their best to fight thick, hot flames that were scorching along the ground! Some how, all the flower meadows had caught fire, and try as they might, nothing the friars could do was stopping the flames. 

The fire department was evnetually contacted and they made it out to the monastary before too much of the forest had burned down, but sadly all of the flowers in the meadows had been left a charred, ruined mess. For the first time in years, the friars had no flowers to for the town's festival. Full of dismay, they sent word to the mayor that there was nothing they could do to salvage the flower displays for that year's parade, and whispers grew with worry that the festival that year might not live up to the town's hopes. 

It was then that, just by hapenstance, Hugh visited town to meet with the mayor about opening a new business there in town. When he heard about the problems with the fire and the flowers, of course he'd be delighted to supply the town with all the flowers they could need, for a small fee. In the end, I'm afraid that there's no truly happy ending here: the Mayor accepted Hugh's flowers and his flower shop's popularity grew from then on. 

But the moral of the story is this, my friends: 

Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars. ",When my grandfather was a young boy living outside a small town in rural Kentucky,5

The magician snapped his fingers and, into thin air, appeared a magical, samite chastity belt with a hole cut through the fabric over the vagina.  In the hole of the fabric was an invisible, razor-sharp spring-loaded blade.  Merlin grabbed a nearby candle, stuck it into the hole, and SPROING!  The blade shot out and chopped the candle clean in half.  ""Splendid!!!"" said Arthur.



Arthur went out on his quest, returned a month later, and lined up all his knights in a row.  ""Alright, men,"" he said, ""Show me what you've got.  Take off your breeches.""




Ashamed, they all took off their breeches and, to Arthur's astonishment, *every single one of his knights* was now a eunuch.  Gawain, Tristan, Percival -- all just had stubs now.  All except Galahad.  Galahad's cock remained full and intact.



With tears of gratitude, Arthur approached the young knight.  ""Ah, Galahad!!!  Galahad the Pure!!!  Let it be known that you are now the heir to my entire kingdom, to Excalibur, and to all that I have!  Tell me, oh brave spirit, how were you able to resist temptation where all others had failed?""

He took out a paper and a pen from his bag and wrote ” I  can not hear or speak. You write on this paper whatever you want to say”

The lady wrote everything what she said earlier and gave it to him!

post,cpo9bv,2qh72,jokes,false,1565671683,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cpo9bv/samsung_note_7/,self.jokes,,"There was once a man named Sam, who lived in a town named Samsville - ironic, I know.  Well, Sam was a really good singer, so good that he became famous and began touring the world.  On Sam's tour, he was singing, like any ordinary song, and then, suddenly, he sung a note so perfect it could melt hearts.  A member of the audience who happened to be a Father of a church cried out that he knew what that was; a holy note.  He explained that a holy note was extremely rare, and could only be sung by the most talented of singers.  Now that it was known that Sam was able to sing holy notes, his tours became infinitely times more popular.  As he toured the world, Sam sung holy notes 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and then his tour was over.  After the tour, Sam decided to go back o his home town of Samsville for one last show to the people he knew and loved.  He performed the show in their local church which was oddly large, and the mayor of the town attended.  About halfway during the performance, Sam sung a note so horrible that it sounded like a cross between a loud metal fork being scraped across a dinner plate and a demon screeching.  After he sung this note, Sam burst into flames and melted to the ground in a puddle of human goo.  Everyone was so shocked, the whole church was silent.  After a moment, the mayor questioned what just happened.  The Father of the church looked at the mayor with a sad look and said, ""don't you know mayor... Sam sung Note 7...""

&amp;#x200B;

End of joke, if you didn't get it, here's an explanation.  The phone Samsung Note 7 was notorious for bursting into flames so at the end of the joke where the Father says that Sam sung Note 7, its a joke about the phone.  I know it's less funny when I have to explain it, but to some of the people that I have told this joke to in real life, I had to explain it.  :D",Samsung Note 7,12
