This locksmith however, has two very special traits. One, he is an undead skeleton retired from being a lowly exp grind mob, and two, is able to open any lock. His skills are unrivaled, but when even he is stumped, he can detach one of his bones to utilize as a tool. All of his bones are still in control of the skeleton, even if they are detached, giving him very precise movements when opening a lock. His fame reached the ears of millions, and thousands flock him ever day, some requesting to become an apprentice, others begging to open a lock that they lost a key to, and finally, the bold who challenges the locksmith in opening an impossible lock. The skeleton is able to open all of the challengers locks with ease, but he will never forget the one time he was bested.

It was an old sage, seemingly on the verge of collapse, carrying a small box with an equally small lock. The sage had traveled many a distance to see if the legendary locksmith will be able to open the lock of pandora's box. ""It was locked by the gods, so therefore a being that defies the wills of the gods is the only one who will be able to crack it open!"" 

Naturally, the skeleton couldn't resist the challenge and worked his magic right away. It was a simple lock  he thought, but as his tools came in contact with the metal of the lock, they simply vanished from his skeletal hands. Carefully, he took off one of his fingers off his left hand and skillfully maneuvered it into the gaping hole. Steadily to not come in contact with the walls of the inside. Painstakingly working, the skeleton was just about complete when he made a  horrible mistake. The ridges suddenly changed, the gods's magic reanraaging the interior of the lock and bumping into the bone multiple times. While at first nothing happened, soon his finger, unable to handle the multitude of curse that was lain on the lock, cracked. Defeated, the skeleton withdrew the finger, just as shattered as his now broken finger. The sage just sighed, exhausted from the many years of wandering, and picked up the box. Their parting word were, ""I will be back.""

The skeleton from that point was determined to open the lock. He took challengers from across the continent, and even traveled to foreign lands to compete with the greatest locksmiths ever seen before. It was just a normal day when he see a familiar hunched back figure making it's way towards him. Without a word, the sage placed the same box before him. The skeleton smiled, his bones creaking as skeletons lack the muscles, and the flesh to show that emotion, and uttered one phrase.

Guy: ""Doc, don't tell me my wife's dead. I just can't take it. Really, I can't take it. I love her.""

Doctor: ""Well, sir, I do have some bad news."" Again the guy interrupts.

Guy: ""Doc, just tell me, did she make it?"" Doctor: ""As I was saying, we did all we could. Right now she's in a vegatative state, which is likely where she'll remain for the rest of her life. She can stay here overnight, but after that, you'll have to take her home because your insurance doesn't cover this type of thing.""

The guy slumps, just crushed.

Doctor: ""With the right care, which will include you feeding her five times a day, cleaning her and giving her constant care on a daily basis, she'll likely live for at least another 30 years.""

The guy sinks even lower, just crushed, and starts to cry.

Doctor: ""As I said, your insurance doesn't cover this kind of care, so you'll have to make some sort of arrangements to purchase the equipment you'll need for your wife. I would suggest you put your house on the market today and sell it as quickly as possible and buy a mobile home. You're gonna need the excess cash. It should be enough to buy the equipment your wife needs and for you to live on for the next couple of months. By then, you should be able to qualify for welfare and other forms of state and federal aid.""

By this point, the guy is sobbing uncontrollably.

The doctor reaches over, puts his hand on his shoulder and says, ""Hey, look at me.""

The guy looks up and the doctor smiles and says, ""I'm just fucking with you, she's dead.""",So a guy's at work when he receives a call from the hospital informing him that his wife's been in an accident.,139

Myto woke up every morning and had a Chocolate Brownie for breakfast. The only brownies the prison sold were from a strange company called Dria. Every night, however, Myto noticed something. The power always went out at exactly 9 PM. Being an electrical engineer, Myto decided to find out why this was the case. He asked his bunkmate, Big Joel why this happened. Big Joel shook his head and sighed. “Don’t know why it’s got to be this way. It just do. Power goes out every night at 9.” Myto was perplexed. He resolved to fix this issue using all his electrical engineering prowess. He realized that by using the strange brownies made by Dria, he could make a con brownie. He hid a very powerful battery that he stole from the guards and hooked it up to the wires of his cell. To his delight, the cell lit up! Of course, this didn’t sit well with the other prisoners.

And each and every morning for those 15 years, Martha has said to him disgustedly, ""One of these days, you're gonna fart your guts out!""

But this has had no effect on Bob as he has continued merrily with his routine each morning.

Martha is totally fed up with this and then one Thanksgiving morning when she got up early to get things ready, she got an idea while preparing the turkey.

Before Bob got up, she crept upstairs and placed the turkey innards in his pajama bottoms, giggling to herself as she did so.

A little later that morning, Bob woke up and went through his usual morning ritual with glee.

Martha heard a scream as Bob jumped out of bed and ran into the bathroom.

She laughed to herself, but when Bob didn't reappear from the bathroom for a long time she started to get concerned.

So she ran upstairs and was just about to knock on the bathroom door, when Bob opened it and came out, pale as a ghost.

He said, ""You were right, honey, you were right! I did fart my guts out, but by the grace of God and these two fingers I got them back up there again!""","Bob and Martha have been married for 15 years.

The CEO of the company proudly said that many years ago on his wedding night, he had sex with his wife 6 times.

The General Manager next to him said he did it 5 times on his wedding night.

Then a couple of others said 4 times, 5 times and so on and finally all turned towards a fresher clerk who seemed to be rather shy and asked how many times did he do it on his wedding night.

The clerk replied: ""Only once Sir!"".  
The CEO laughed hard and asked, ""WHY?""

The clerk replied: ""That's because she was feeling slight pain and also experienced a little bleeding. Quite clearly, she wasn't used to having a lot of crazy sex at once, Sir. Only a whore could handle..."" and  he stopped.

A long pindrop silence ensued.

EDIT - For people asking for the punchline. The Joke meant that clerk's wife was quite fresh having little or no prior sexual experience, which is considered a good thing in some parts of the world. Whereas, the other's wives were quite experienced to be capable of receiving too much sex in one go, only whores can. So joke's on the CEO"".",Wedding night sex,0

They had a line in the water in one of their favourite secret fishing spots.
Now a fish came along and saw the line... And the fishermen saw the fish hoping that it would take the line because if it did the fly would drop 6 inches and they would catch the fish and have a tasty dinner.
BUT..... There was a bear watching the fishermen so If the fish took the line and the fly dropped 6 inches the fishermen would get the fish and then the bear would get the fishermen.
BUT..... There was also a feral cat watching the sandwiches that the fishermen had beside them. 
The cat was waiting because if the fly dropped 6 inches the fishermen were going to get the fish and the bear was going to get the fishermen and the cat was going to get the sandwiches.
NOW.... The fish took the line and the fly dropped 6 inches so the fishermen caught the fish.. Then the bear got the fishermen then the cat got the sandwiches.
BUT...during the mayhem and confusion of it all the cat got knocked into the river briefly.
The moral of the story is... If a fly drops 6 inches a pussy is going to get wet.",The Moral Of The Story (shortened version),7

For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.

So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.

A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

Father,' replied the son,I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

Father,' said the son to this,I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father,but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

Dear son,' said the father,I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

Dearest father,' the son started,I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

Father,' the son said,You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-'

""Logic?"" Jim asks. ""What the hell is that?""

""Here, I'll give you an example. Do you own a weed wacker?""

Proudly, Jim responded, ""Yes, I do.""

""Well, if you own a weed wacker, then logically speaking you own a lawn,"" the Dean said.

""Yes, yes I do have a lawn!""

""Well, if you have a lawn, then logically speaking you own a house.""

""Yes, yes I do have a house!""

""And if you have a house, then logically speaking you have a family.""

""Yes, yes I do have a family!""

""And if you have a family, then logically speaking you have a wife. And if you have a wife, then logically speaking you're heterosexual.""

""Yes, yes I do have a wife and I am heterosexual! Wow, I can't believe you found out all of that just because you knew I had a weed wacker!"" Jim exclaimed.

""Yeah, that's what logic is,"" the Dean responded. Jim excitedly went back to the bar, awaited by Bob.

""Bob, I'm taking 4 classes in college. English, Math, Science, and Logic,"" Jim told Bob.

""Logic?"" Bob asks. ""What the hell is that?""

""Here, I'll give you an example. Do you own a weed wacker?""

""No.""

At first I thought I was just full from the milk, but my skin started to form stretch marks and I was visibly wider. I didn't know what was happening but I had an uncontrollable urge to drink more milk. I drove into the nearest gas station and literally ripped the door off the rifrigerated section containing the milk.

I started chugging gallon after gallon of milk standing right there in the store, my skin ripping at the seams. The cashier ran over to stop me but I swatted him aside and in one clean blow he landed across the room, shattering every bone in his pathetic meat suit. There was nothing left of him but a wet bloody puddle deprived of structure. I never thought I had it in me to kill but by now I had ascended beyond petty morality.

As I finished my eighth gallon it felt as though my stomach would rupture. My ribs broke out of my chest like a baby xxenomorph. My finger bones had grown through my hands a white nub could be seen protruding from my nose. My face was so stretched over my now massive skull I looked like Jenny McCarthy. My biceps and muscles were hard and calcified. My boner now had a bone.

I finished my twelfth gallon and began screaming and flexing, my skin tearing around my robust skeletal frame. With one final push I shed my meat chrysalis. I was free.

I didn't even use the door I simply walked out the wall of the gas station. Mortar and stone yielded to my mighty calcium. The cops were already there. In terror they began firing at me but even lead is no match for calcium. I walked straight toward one, reached down his throat and pulled his skeleton from his flesh sheath. With his bone I assembled a mighty claymore sword. With a single swing I cleaved the Earth in twain and descended into the inky black.

The young man makes tremendous love, her husband couldn’t hold a candle to this young man’s abilities. His stamina is never ending, he’s like a machine in bed. When the affair started the wife and the young man used to keep it strictly between the time her husband was at work but she longed for more. They came up with a solution of making a hole on her side of the bed. This way he could make endless passionate love to her from underneath the bed even while her husband home. Things were going great until the wife couldn’t keep quiet during intercourse, constantly moaning. 

“Aaaah, aah, aah”

All the while her husband was lying right next to her. When her husband inquired about this sound, she said it was the air conditioner malfunctioning. 
The husband became extremely irritated at this sound and told his wife to smack the unit around to quiet it down, as the AC was on her side of the bed. 

They continued this secret affair for a while before the husband had had enough of this broken AC and his wife’s refusal to try and fix it in the night. 

So the next night when they were about to go to bed, the husband lied down on the wife’s side of the bed, so he could try and fix the AC when it started malfunctioning again. The wife reluctantly agreed, she was sure the young man underneath the bed would realize what had happened and just remain still for tonight. 
She was awakened in the middle of the night from sounds coming from her husbands side of the room. 

“Uhhhhh, uhhhh, uuuhhhh”

Concerned she asked her profusely sweating husband, “Is everything alright?” 

“It’s just this goddamn AC” he replied",A surprising affair,1

The doctor, smiling, replied: ""Poison, of course. In exactly 24 hours, you will die a brutal death.""
