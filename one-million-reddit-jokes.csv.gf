The lieutenant told him that on the first day, the plague victims became covered in pustules and boils. On the second day, an incredible fever started which never breaks. On the third day, without exception, the victim was dead.

Pol Pot was extremely concerned for his life after hearing this. Unfortunately, the Khmer Rouge had already executed all of the doctors and intellectuals who he could turn to for help. One of his lieutenants reported that he knew of a wise old man in a small village not far from the capital who the killing squads had not yet gotten around to executing. Pol Pot took his bodyguards to the village to visit the man.

Pol Pot explained that there were reports of a plague and explained all of the symptoms. He told the man that if he could keep him safe from the plague, he would spare him from the killing fields. The wise old man thought about it for a few moments, smiled, and nodded his head.

""I know just what you need"" he said.

He went into his house for a moment, and then returned with a miniature clock and a thin piece of leather. After attaching the clock to the leather strip, he bound it around the dictator's wrist.

""This, Brother Number One, will keep you safe from the plague""

Pol Pot returned to Phnom Penh after this and waited in his palace. Soon, the plague hit the city. On the first day of the plague, all of Pol Pot's bodyguards, lieutenants and servants broke out in terrible boils and pustules. On the second day, they all developed tremendous fevers which never broke. By the third day, they were all dead. Incredibly though, Pol Pot was spared the ravages of the plague, never developing any of the symptoms.

The plague finally burned out after raging through Cambodia, further depleting its already terribly suffering population. Pol Pot was happy to be alive, but was still bothered by how his life had been saved. He returned to the small village near the capital and found that the little old man had been spared by the plague.

""Tell me, old man, how this contraption saved my life"" the dictator said, showing him his wrist.

The old man responded:

""Ah well, everyone knows that a watched pot never boils""",Pol Pot was in his palace...,5

post,ahsoas,2qh72,jokes,false,1547947063,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ahsoas/archie_the_strangler/,self.jokes,,"A British gangster sat in the corner of a pub with his best mate. Tired and frustrated, he sighed and turned to his friend ""I can't stand it anymore, every day and every night she whines and complains at me. On and on and on... I'm so sick of it, I'd gladly have her killed if I could!""

His friend calmly moved forward in his seat. ""Are you sure? I know someone. In fact, he's right over there...""

""Yes, I'm sure. I won't survive another week if I have to go home to her again!""

""Alright then, come with me"". They both got up and headed over to the huge figure the other side of the pub. He was enormous, with a shaved head and a rough stubble. They approached him and sat down opposite him at the table. ""Hey Archie, my mate here's got a serious problem with his wife, do you think you could do something about her?""

Archie looked up and with a coarse voice replied ""guys, I'll deal with any problem you have. Men, women or kids, just tell me who, when and where and I'll do it"".
""Okay, tomorrow afternoon she'll be working at the supermarket. She's very loud and never shuts up so you can't miss her... So how are you going to do it?""

Archie smiled ""I strangle everyone I kill with my bare hands, so that's how I'll kill her too. You got a problem with that buddy?""

The gangster smiled, ""no, no, that's fine. Actually that's quite a fitting end for the old hag. How much will this all cost then?""

""I'll do it for a pound""

The gangster was shocked, ""a pound! Are you sure?"" Archie nodded and the gangster dropped a coin into his hand.

The following day, Archie prowled up and down aisles. The store seemed rather quiet until he moved closer to the tills; then he heard her. The unmistakable sound of gossip and complaining, Archie had found his target and he made his way towards her. By the time he reached her, he understood why the gangster wanted her dead; she was insufferable. He reached over the counter, and right there, in front of a customer, he began to strangle her. The woman struggled but it was hopeless.

Just then, the customer the wife had been gossiping with started to panic, but before she could even scream, Archie had her throat in his other hand. In less than a minute, he'd strangled them both to death. As he made his way his way out of the shop, the security guard walked through the main entrance, bumping straight into Archie. The guard saw the women lying on the ground and looked up at him, but Archie had already grabbed the guard's throat too. Moments later, the guard dropped to the floor and Archie made his escape.

The next day, the British gangster picked up the newspaper from his letterbox and sat at the table. He unfolded the paper and there, in big bold writing was the headline...

**""Archie chokes three for a pound""**

Boss knew something was off, but better not to have John around sick he though, if he was even really sick, so he decided to talk in private, after John was feeling better.

""Yes, I'll be coming tomorrow as usual.

When he slipped, the fence split him in half, right up the middle, but miraculously, each half of Don survived!  Each half got up, started hopping away, and essentially started living separate lives.

The left half, more prone to rational thought, spent most of its time in libraries, and got an accounting gig.  The right half, more creative, picked up painting, and taught pottery at the local community college.  

On top of the spectacle of a man split in half, the townsfolk could not believe how rarely they saw both halves of Don at the same place.  Indeed, nobody could think of even one occurrence of this happening.

Now one day, half a man walks into a bar.  The left half of Don, always punctual, walked into the local watering hole at precisely 8:00, and ordered a shot of whisky, which the bartender poured for him.

At 8:01, the right half of Don wandered in, sat down, asked for a beer, and nodded to his other half, which nodded back.  As the bartender poured him the beer, the left half of Don took his shot, left just enough to cover the bill, and left at precisely 8:02.

The bartender was astounded-- he was the first person to see the two halves interact since the accident.  As it dawned on him how rare this was, the bartender exclaimed, a little louder than he wanted to, ""Whole Don here for just one minute!""

The man himself was bald and even with all his wealth, he felt something was missing in his life and thus wanted to do one nice thing for his follicly challenged fellows.

&amp;#x200B;

So the train service is started and they are top of the line. Private booths, cushy seats, WIFI, the works. All for the price of a regular train ticket. Bald people finally felt like even if they have nothing in life at least they have one thing no one else has.

&amp;#x200B;

It just so happened that one day a man had to go into the city and was running very late for his appointment. He didn't have enough money for a cab only enough for a regular train ticket.

&amp;#x200B;

The man knew that this was a ""bald-only"" train but due to his circumstances decided to risk it. He snuck on and found himself a private booth all for himself and settled in for the ride.

&amp;#x200B;

In due time the conductor started to come around to both verify that the men were indeed bald and to check/sell tickets. In this instance, the conductor was a blind man, and he would verify the passengers' baldness by feeling their scalp.

&amp;#x200B;

The man heard the knock on his booth from the conductor.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm here for verification, sir.""

&amp;#x200B;

The man, not wanting to get thrown off the train, did the only thing he could think of and pulled his trousers down and presented his bare ass to the conductor.

&amp;#x200B;

The conductor felt the butt for a second and was remarked:

&amp;#x200B;

""Allow me to say, sir, what a magnificent bald head you have. It even has a part in the middle.""",The Bald Train,1

He went to a sex shop in the French Quarters and explained his situation. The salesman said, “Well, I don’t know that I have anything that will keep her occupied for so many weeks, except the Voodoo Penis”.

The husband said “The what?”

The man said it again and pulled out what seemed to be an ordinary dildo.

The husband laughed, and said it’s just a dildo.

The salesman then pointed to the door and said, “Voodoo Penis, door!”

The penis rose out of its box, darted over to the door and started pounding the keyhole. The whole door shook wildly with vibrations, so much so that a crack began to form down the middle.

Then the salesman said “Voodoo Penis, return to box!” and the penis stopped and returned to the box.

The husband bought it. He took it home to his wife. After the husband had been gone a few days, the wife remembered the Voodoo Penis.

She undressed, opened the box and said  “Voodoo Penis, in my vagina”

The voodoo penis shot to her crotch. It was absolutely incredible. After three mind shattering orgasms, she became very exhausted and decided she had enough.

She tried to pull it out, but it was stuck. Her husband had neglected to tell her how to turn it off.

So she put her clothes on, got in her car and started for the hospital.

On the way, another incredibly intense orgasm made her swerve all over the road. A police officer saw this and immediately pulled her over.

He asked for her license, and then asked how much she had to drink.

Gasping and twitching, the woman said “I haven’t had anything to drink, officer. You see, I’ve got this Voodoo Penis thing stuck in my crotch and it won’t stop giving me orgasms”

The officer looked at her for a second, shook his head and replied, “Yeah right, Voodoo Penis, my ass!”

As the car approaches the checkpoint, the guard walks up to the car for documents, but upon seeing the Pope and the driver, he immediately runs back and to the checkpoint booth and raises the barricade to let the car through.

They met in grade school and instantly knew that they would be married and be with each other forever. Their families became close friends and as they grew older it became more and more obvious to everyone that they were destined to be together.   


At high school graduation this fine young man dropped down to a knee and proposed to the love of his life. She accepted and the entire auditorium erupted in cheers. The two of them were so well known that the entire town and even some of the surrounding areas were happy for them.  


One week before their wedding they decided to go to the movies to relax as the stress of the wedding was getting to be enormous. Well disaster struck. On their way home the car they were driving was struck by a drunk driver and they both perished. The entire county showed up for the funeral and it was a dark time for the community.  


When the two youngsters arrived at the Pearly Gates they were greeted by St. Peter. He announced that even heaven knew of their love and wanted to know what they could do. Sheepishly, they asked for an audience with God himself. St. Peter ushered them in to God's private chambers and they asked of God ""God, we have been in love for so long and we never got to get married. Would it be possible to get married in heaven?"" Well God thought that would be a great thing and an event unlike any heaven had had in quite some time. They were shown their ""cloud"" and God told them he would get back to them with the details.   


Well a few centuries pass and they never hear anything from God so they request another audience to find out what is going on. God informs them to be patient as he is working on it.  


A few more centuries pass and God summons them to his chambers and informs them that everything is all set and they will be married on the next Sunday and all of the angels of heaven will be there.  


It was an amazing ceremony and the reception was something that would never be topped again. The now married couple retired to their little slice of heaven to live out their afterlife together as they always intended.  


A couple of months go by and they request another audience with the almighty. While meeting with him they declare ""God, we can't stand each other anymore and would like to get a divorce. Can you help us?""  


God looks wearily into his hands and says ""Are you kidding me, it took me four hundred years to find a priest up here, and now you want me to find a lawyer??"" ",Once upon a time there were two youths in love,5

 So back she went. When she arrived, Tony proceeded to take off his socks. On his left food, he had 3 toes missing. She ran back to her mother, aghast; “Mama, mama! Tony has a foot and a half!”
 Mama turned, and replied “Gina,stay here and stir the pasta, this is a job for Mama.”

The brothers, being from the city, are clearly bothered by all the cow poop. And it's all they can complain about for the entire trip. The older brother has to pee and in the meantime the younger brother sneakily puts some of the cow poop in a plastic bag. For a prank later.

But little did the little brother know that the big brother really didn't have to pee. He also filled a plastic bag with cow poop for a prank.

So when the big brother returns the two boys continue walking as if nothing happened.

In order to provoke the little brother about his upcoming prank, the big brother jokingly starts talking about ""Operation Poop"". But without actually revealing that he is going to pull off a prank.

The Operation Poop thing becomes kind of an inside joke thing that the two brothers keep talking about, but without knowing of eachother that they both want to pull off a prank. 

20 minutes later, they arrived at the dad's house. Since there are no hospitals near where the dad lives and he does not own a telephone, the dad asks his sons if they want to try to find a good stick for him. So he can use the stick to walk with. The stick has to be very solid and the dad recommends the brothers to look for a specific kind of stick that is used to hold up fences, because they are usually made from strong wood, thick and give no splinters.

So the brothers start looking around for these kinds of sticks. They continued to talk about Operation Poop and eventually used the expression so often that they shortened it, so it can be said faster. Later on each went their own way so they don't look at the same spots all the time.

After a while, the big brother finds a large sheet of paper with an advertisement sticked to a billboard. He decides that it could be useful for his prank. By wrapping the paper around the cow poop, he can make a ""poop bomb"" that shreds when it hits somebody at a high velocity. Covering the person in poop. 

Meanwhile, the little brother finds the absolute perfect stick for his dad. It is dry, perfectly round and wonderfully has no pieces of barbed wire or nails in it like all the other similar sticks. But instead of taking it, he decides to cover one side entirely in cow poop, and lay that side on the ground. So when the big brother finds the stick, his hand will be completely covered.

Eventually the big brother finds the poop stick. He enthusiastically screams ""YES!!! It's perfect!"". The little brother hears it and runs a little closer to witness his prank happening.

The big brother quickly grabs the stick without care. And the prank is successful. His hand is covered in poop. Disgusted, he shouts: 

""This is a shitpost!""

.

After a while he realized that the little brother did this as a prank. The poop has clear fingerprints on it. So the big brother angrily decides to execute ""Operation Poop"" and throws his own prank bomb at the little brother. Right into his face.

The little brother, noticing what the object that just hit him was, shouted:

""OP is a shit poster!""

This bookkeeper is deaf.

When the godfather goes to shake down the bookkeeper for his missing $10 million, he brings along his attorney, who knows sign language.  The godfather asks the bookkeeper, “Where is the 10 million bucks you embezzled from me?” 

 

The attorney, using sign language, asks the bookkeeper where the $10 million is hidden. 

 

The bookkeeper signs back, “I don’t know what you are talking about.” 

 

The attorney tells the godfather, “He says he doesn’t know what you’re talking about.” 

 

That’s when the godfather pulls out a 9mm pistol, puts it to the bookkeeper’s temple, cocks it and says, “Ask him again!” 

 

The attorney signs to the underling, “He’ll kill you for sure if you don’t tell him!” 

 

The bookkeeper signs back, “OK!  You win!  The money is in a brown briefcase buried behind the shed in my cousin Enzio’s backyard in Queens!”

He rings the bell, the owner appears and tells him the dog can be viewed in the back garden.

The man sees a very nice looking Labrador Retriever sitting there.

""Do you really talk?"" he asks the dog.
""Yes,"" the Labrador replies.

After recovering from the shock of hearing the dog talk, he man asks, ""So, tell me your story.""
The Labrador looks up and says, ""Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the SAS.

""In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one imagined that a dog would be eavesdropping.

""I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years.
But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at Heathrow to do some undercover security work, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded several medals. I got married, had a few puppies, and now I've just retired.""
The man is amazed. He goes back into the house and asks the owner how much he wants for the dog.

""Ten quid,"" the owner says.

""£10!!? But this dog is absolutely amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheaply?""

Completely shocked he talks to the devil and says: ""Welp, I've been wrong all my life and I guess I'm now to pay the price for my lack of faith""

Satan laughs and replies: ""Awh it's not so bad down here, let me give you the tour so you can see for yourself""

He then proceeds to escort Jack through a beautiful lush green plain with flowers, scattered here and there there's a bunch of houses where other ""damned"" live.

As they pass through each house the inhabitants recognize Satan and invite them inside for a drink and a chat, request that's always granted by the two.

Every time they stop to a house Satan never fails to display how much of a lovely guy he really is by telling amazing stories, singing, cracking jokes and just generally being a great person.

At sunset the devil sees that Jack was very tired and decides to show him the house he'll be spending the rest of eternity into.

As they walk to Jack's new house the two pass close to a huge wall and Jack asks: ""What's behind there?""

Satan: ""Oh, nothing that should concern you, pay it no mind""

Despite his curiosity Jack thought better not to bother Satan with further questions and just followed him to his new house where Satan promised he'd be back the following morning to show him the recreational center before finally bidding him a goodnight after a long day.

That night however Jack kept thinking back at the whole situation he's in and how surreal everything was until his thoughts eventually jumped to the wall he saw earlier in the day.

After a few minutes trying to guess what could there be behind that wall that Satan couldn't even tell him he decided he should investigate, as such he took a deep breath and dived into the night walking back to the place where the wall was.

Once there he searched for some clues until he saw some faint light coming from a spot in the wall; upon closer inspection he saw that there was a hole and the light was coming from behind the wall.

Jack took a deep breath and scrounged up the courage to look into the crack on the wall and what he saw was a spectacle much alike what he always thought hell would be.

On the other side of the wall huge flames were scattered all over a burnt and scalding hot ground and much to his horror he saw other souls inside that nightmare being eternally burned and never consuming, screaming and pleading for help.

Jack rushed back into his place where he just quietly sobbed and cried all night for he was sure now that the Devil was just toying with him to give him a bit of hope right before tossing him into eternal despair.

The following morning Satan showed up once again and told Jack to come with him.

Jack pleaded: ""PLEASE! PLEASE! Don't take me to hell, I'll do anything just let me stay here, I don't wanna burn for all eternity!""

Satan: ""What are you talking about??? I'm just gonna show you the recreational center like I told you yesterday""

Jack: ""Don't lie to me, I saw what was going on behind the giant wall!""

Satan: ""Ooooh you saw that! Don't worry that's not for you, that's the Christian hell""

Jack: ""The christian hell? Why would the christian hell be like that?""

The devil led him to the door of the next room. In it was Al Gore with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time. ""No, this is no good; I've got his problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day,"" commented Donald.

The devil opened a third door. Through it, Donald saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.

Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, ""Yeah man, I can handle this.""

The devil smiled and said..........

""OK, Monica, you're free to go.""","One day in the future, Donald Trump has a heart-attack and dies.",185

The preacher took the mower home and when he got ready to mow, he yanked and pulled and tugged on the cord.  Nothing worked.  It wouldn’t start.  Thinking he’d been swindled, he took the mower back to little Johnny’s house.

“We went to Bobby’s house and watched a movie.” 

 

“What did you watch?” asked Marsha. 

 

“The Ten Commandments,” answered Tommy.  The Robot went around to Tommy and once again slapped him, knocking him off his chair.  With lip quivering, Tommy got up, sat down and said, “I am sorry I lied.  We really watched a tape called Sex Queen.” 

 

“I’m ashamed of you Son,” said John.  “When I was your age, I never lied to my parents.”  The robot then walked around to John and delivered a roundhouse right that nearly knocked him out of his chair. 

 

Marsha was bent double laughing, almost in tears. “Boy, did you ever ask for that one!  And you can’t be too mad with Tommy.  After all, he is your son!”

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephant's foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.

The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn't the same elephant...

The professor was delighted. However, when the plumber gave him the bill a minute later, he was shocked. 

""This is one-third of my monthly salary!"" he yelled.  

Well, all the same he paid it and then the plumber said to him, ""I understand your position as a professor. Why don't you come to our company and apply for a plumber position? You will earn three times as much as a professor. But remember, when you apply, tell them that you completed only seven elementary classes. They don't like educated people.""  

So it happened. The professor got a job as a plumber and his life significantly improved. He just had to seal a screw or two occasionally, and his salary went up significantly.  

One day, the board of the plumbing company decided that every plumber had to go to evening classes to complete the eighth grade. So, our professor had to go there too. It just happened that the first class was math. The evening teacher, to check students' knowledge, asked for a formula for the area of a circle. The person asked was the professor. He jumped to the board, and then he realized that he had forgotten the formula. He started to reason it, and he filled the white board with integrals, differentials, and other advanced formulas to conclude the result he forgot. As a result, he got ""minus pi times r square.""  

He didn't like the minus, so he started all over again. He got the minus again. No matter how many times he tried, he always got a minus. He was frustrated. He gave the class a frightened look and saw all the plumbers whisper:

He got out a ladder, a rope, a net and a shot gun. And then pulled out a rusty old dented up crate that the home owner heard snarling and snapping from. The owner asked what was in the crate. That's jojo my dog. What I'm going to do is release jojo then climb up there and net the gorilla and knock him off the roof to the ground here. When he lands on the grass jojo is trained to run to the gorilla and bite him in his privates and keep him busy so I can tie him up. He handed the owner of the house a shotgun.

With laboured breath, he leaned against the doorframe, gazing into the kitchen. Were it not for death’s agony, he would have thought himself already in heaven: there, spread out upon waxed paper on the kitchen table, were literally hundreds of his favourite chocolate chip cookies. Was it heaven? Or was it one final act of heroic love from his devoted wife, seeing to it that he left this world a happy man?

Mustering one great final effort, he threw himself toward the table, landing on his knees in a rumpled posture. His parched lips parted: the wondrous taste of the cookie was already in his mind, seemingly bringing him back to life.

He tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up, but saw the bear right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him. 

At that instant the Atheist cried out, “Oh my God!” Time stopped. The bear froze. The forest was silent.

As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky, “You deny my existence for all of these years, teach others I don’t exist, and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you now expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer?”

The atheist looked directly into the light, “It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask You to treat me as a Christian now, but perhaps could you make the BEAR a Christian?”

“Very well,” said the voice.

The light went out. The sounds of the forest resumed. And then the bear dropped his right paw, brought both paws together and bowed his head and spoke:

I am writing in response to your request for additional
information. In block number three of the accident report form, I put “trying to do the job alone” as the cause of my accident. You said in your letter that I should explain more fully, and I trust that the following details will be sufficient.

I am a bricklayer by trade. On the date of the accident I was
working alone on the roof of a new six-story building. When I
completed my work, I discovered that I had about 500 pounds of brick left over. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley that, fortunately, was attached to the side of the building at the sixth floor.

Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung
the barrel out, and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went back to the
ground and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the 500 pounds of brick. You will note in block number 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135 pounds.

Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rather rapid rate up the side of the building.

In the vicinity of the third floor I met the barrel coming down. This explains the fractured skull and broken collarbone. Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley.

Fortunately, by that time, I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope in spite of my pain. At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground—and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Devoid of the weight of the bricks, the barrel now weighed approximately 50 pounds.

I refer you again to my weight in block number 11. As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent down the side of the building.
In the vicinity of the third floor I met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured ankles and the lacerations of my legs and lower body. The encounter with the barrel slowed me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell onto the pile of bricks, and fortunately, only three vertebrae were cracked.

I’m sorry to report, however, that as I lay there on the bricks, in pain, unable to stand, and watching the empty barrel six stories above me, I again lost my presence of mind and let go of the rope. The empty barrel weighed more than the rope, so it came back down on me and broke both my legs.

I hope I have furnished the information you require as to how the accident occurred.

A young man shopping in a supermarket noticed a little old lady following him around.  If he stopped, she stopped.  Furthermore, she kept staring at him. 

 She finally overtook him at the checkout, and she turned to him and said : ""I hope I haven't made you feel ill at ease;  it's just that you look so much like my late son."" 

 He answered, ""That's okay."" 

 ""I know it's silly, but if you'd call out ""Good bye, Mom"" as I leave the store, it would make me feel so happy."" 

 She then went through the checkout, and as she was on her way out of the store, the man called out, ""Goodbye, Mom."" 

 The little old lady waved, and smiled back at him. 

 Pleased that he had brought a little sunshine into someone's day, he went to pay for his groceries. 

 ""That comes to $121.85,"" said the clerk. 

 ""How come so much ... I only bought 5 items.""

A Madison, WI policeman had a perfect spot to watch for speeders, but wasn’t getting many.  Then he discovered the problem.  A 12-year-old boy was standing up the road with a hand-painted sign, which read, “RADAR TRAP AHEAD.” 

The officer later found a young accomplice down the road with a sign reading, “TIPS” and a bucket full of money.  (And we used to just sell lemonade!) 

 

BETTER: 

 A motorist was mailed a picture of his car speeding through an automated radar post in La Crosse, WI.  A $40 speeding ticket was included. 

 Being cute, he sent the police department a picture of $40.  The police responded with another mailed photo—of handcuffs. 

   
BEST: 

 A young woman was pulled over for speeding.  A Wisconsin State Trooper walked to her car window, flipping open his ticket book. 

 She said, “I bet you are going to sell me a ticket to the State Troopers Ball.” 

 The officer promptly replied, “Wisconsin State Troopers don’t have balls.” 

 There was a moment of silence while she smiled, and he realized what he’d just said.  He then closed his book, got back in his patrol car and left.  She was laughing too hard to start her car. ","Good, Better, Best",12

I saw that my mother was calling, and I picked up and hastily said 

“I’m busy Mom”

*click* and I hung up just as quickly.

“Who was that?” asked the girl.

“Oh just my mom, she likes to check up on me since i’m her only child”.

The girl looked pleased began to tell a story.

Just then, the phone rang again, it was my mother. I picked up and said

“I’m on a date Mom, i’ll call you later”

*click*

The conversation eventually turned toward parenthood. 

“I would love to have kids” the girl said.

“Ugh, no thanks. If I ever had a kid, I would just pack up and leave” I answered back.

The phone began to ring again, with my mother’s name showing on caller ID. I picked up frustrated and screamed 

“WHAT THE FUCK IS SO IMPORTANT MOM?”

I heard silence for a moment and then she responded

“WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU? YOUR WIFE IS GIVING BIRTH RIGHT NOW”

*click*
