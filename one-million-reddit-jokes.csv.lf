-The client: is room 39 empty?
-The boss: yes, sir.
-The client: can I book it?
-The boss: of course you can.
-The client: thank you.
Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.
The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.
The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.
Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.
After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.
The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.
In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.
He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.
The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.
The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.
After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.
The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.
This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.
Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.
The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.
The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up.
To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.
The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.
In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.
-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''
-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.
-''Swear''
-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''
So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss.
Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.
When he does, I will let you know... thank you for reading.",A man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss,0

Now by God in his wisdom a task they'd been laid.


See them gathered together, by calling divine


to fashion a vulva of peerless design.


The first man, a butcher of eminent skill


took a hold of his blade and set to with a will.


He poked it and pinked it and pricked it a bit


and with swift upward stroke near in twain it was split.


The next man to the fore was a carpenter deft.


With his chisel and gouge he applied to the cleft.


Carving in to the center he whittled a void,


and to shape it a rasp and a ream he employed.


Now on to the third man a tailor by trade,


who produced a sleek sheathing of silk he had made.


Which he tacked into place by the use of a pin,


and with dexterous stitches affixed it therein.


The fourth was a hunter, a stalker of game.


With a bundle of furs to his errand he came.


Contemplating what coiffure best tops such a box,


he selected, bedizened and swathed it in fox.


Fifth man and fisherman. Catcher of cod.


With pelagic produce of tackle and rod,


he created an attar redolent with spices


and misted the whole with parfume; Eau de Pisces. 


A plumber, the sixth in the line, brought his hoses


and parting red seas like proverbial Moses,


he laid in a drain 'neath that Latinate mountain


to an aureate sprinkler, a tinkling fountain.


And at last we've arrived, it's the ultimate man.


An assessor of quality, test tool in hand.


His probe is determined, the breach bares the brunt...


It's the acme achieved! A SPECTACULAR CUNT!








","The creation of a pussy, improved version.",10

After a few minutes of hard and wild lovemaking, George fell back into the sand, exhausted.

“Muriel, I’ve never seen you move your body like that before! That was ten times more intense to last time we were here!,” George said, panting.

Sixth was a preacher, whose name was McGee,

Last came a sailor, a dirty little runt,

He sucked it and fucked it and called it a cunt.

A tourist visiting Bhutan, a professional photographer, was excited to see a magnificent yak by the road as he drove by.

He had been cautioned by his guide to keep a safe distance as yaks sometimes are aggressive. But his excitement got the better of him, and with his expensive and impressive looking photography gear dangling from his neck he ventured closer and closer to get that perfect shot.

It was only when he saw the yak charging toward him that he realized there was no way he was going to make it back to the safety of his vehicle.

The ensuing commotion combined spurts of running, valiant efforts to dodge the onrushing yak, and some serious wrestling. When the dust settled, the tourist was relieved to find himself sweaty and breathless but otherwise unharmed. However, his camera and lens had disappeared.

Looking up, he was dismayed to see his prized gear dangling from the yak's horns as he wondered how the fuck he was going to get it back.

The story has a happy ending: After some searching, the guide was able to find the yak herder who managed to retrieve the camera safely. :)",The Yak Photographer,0

He awoke before the Pearly Gates, where St. Peter said, ""You died in your sleep, Bob.""

Bob was stunned. ""I'm dead? No, I can't be! I've got too much to live for. Send me back!""

St. Peter said, ""I'm sorry, but there's only one way you can go back, and that is as a chicken.""

Bob was devastated, but begged St. Peter to send him to a farm near his home.

The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking, and pecking the ground.

A rooster strolled past. ""So, you're the new hen, huh? How's your first day here?""

""Not bad."" replied Bob the hen. ""But I have this strange feeling inside. Like I'm gonna explode!""

""You're ovulating."" explained the rooster. ""Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before?""

""Never."" said Bob.

""Well, just relax and let it happen."" says the rooster. ""It's no big deal.""

Bob did and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg!

Bob was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood.

He soon laid another egg -- his joy was overwhelming.

As he was about to lay his third egg, he felt a smack on the back of his head, and heard his wife yell.....

""Well, there's good news and there's bad news,"" she says. ""The bad news is that the muscles around your penis are deteriorating, and there is no cure.""

The guy, on the verge of panic, finally regains his composure. ""So what's the good news?"" he asks.

The doctor says: ""There is an experimental treatment available, but there are no guarantees. It involves transplanting the muscles from a baby elephant's trunk into your penis. Would you like to try it?""

The guy thinks about it and finally says, ""Well, the thought of going through life without being able to have sex is just too much for me. What have I got to lose? Let's do it.""

So the doctor performs the operation. A few weeks later, the guy takes his girlfriend out to a nice restaurant to celebrate his new equipment. While sitting at the table, he feels a stirring between his legs; it gets progressively worse until it reaches the point of being painful. Seeking relief, he reaches down and unzips his fly to relieve some of the pressure.

Suddenly, his penis leaps free from his pants, slides over the tabletop and grabs a dinner roll, then returns to his pants again.

""Wow!"" says his stunned girlfriend, ""That was impressive! Can you do that again?""

No way!, thought the man, so he climbed the ladder to the next cloud. On this cloud was a slightly thinner woman, who was slightly easier on the eye.

""Screw me hard or climb the ladder to success,"" she said.

""Well,"" thought the man, ""might as well carry on.""

On the next cloud was an even more attractive lady who, this time, was quite attractive.

""Screw me now or climb the ladder to success,"" she fluttered.

As he turned her down and went on up the ladder, the man thought to himself that this was getting better the further he went. On the next cloud was an absolute beauty. Slim, attractive, 10/10 model.

""Fuck me or climb the ladder to success,"" she flirted.

Unable to imagine what could be waiting, and being a gambling man, he decided to climb again. When he reached the next cloud, there was a 400-pound ugly man, armpit hair showing, flies buzzing around his head.

His first mate asks him why he needs his red shirt and the captain says that it is so that no one will be able to see blood on him if he is wounded.

The first mate accepts this and returns with his red shirt.

The pirates easily destroy the battleship and loot it returning supplies and riches to their own ship.

The next day a crew member in the crows nest calls out again, “Arrr! There be two battleships on the horizon, captain!”

Again, the captain yells, “Get me my red shirt!”

Once again the pirates defeat the ships.

On the third day a crew member shouts from the crows nest, “Arrr! There be five battleships on the horizon, captain!”

The captain calls, “Get me my red shirt!” and proceeds to conquer the ships with his crew.

On the fourth day the crew shouts, “Arrr! There be one hundred battleships on the horizon, captain!”

The man reaches into the bag and pulls out a little man, of about 12 inches height, and sets him on the counter. He reaches back into the bag and pulls out a small piano, setting it on the counter as well. He reaches into the bag once again and pulls out a tiny piano bench. The little man sits down at the piano and starts playing a beautiful piece by Mozart.


“Where on earth did you get that ???” asked the surprised bartender. The man responds by reaching into the paper bag. This time he pulls out a magic lamp. He hands it to the bartender and says: “Here. Rub it.”


So the bartender rubs the lamp, and suddenly there’s a gust of smoke and a beautiful genie is standing before him. “I will grant you one wish – just one.”


The bartender gets real excited. Without hesitating he says, “I want a million bucks !”


A few moments later, a duck walks into the bar. Another duck, then another soon follow it. Pretty soon, the entire bar is filled with ducks and they keep coming!


The bartender turns to the man and says, “You know, I think your genie’s a little deaf. I asked for a million bucks, not a million ducks.”


The man replies, “Do you really think I asked for a 12 inch pianist?”

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”
The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.
Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.
The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.
The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”
The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”
The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”
The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”
The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”
The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”
The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”
The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.
Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.
The man demands the key to the stone door.
The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.
He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.
Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.
So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.
Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”
The man is relieved to no end.

After years had passed, there were simply no more jokes left to tell. The two devised a number system to expedite the joke-telling in the event that one of them wanted to remind the other of one of their many jokes. One would call, ""46!"" and the other would pause for a minute and then burst into laughter. ""233!"" he'd call back, and the other would laugh as well.

One day, a new prisoner joined them in their cell. He was puzzled by their system at first, but they soon explained to the newcomer that each number represented one of many jokes that they both knew. 

One day, as usual, Prisoner A remembered a joke he wanted to tell. ""77,"" he called to Prisoner B. Prisoner B's eyes lit up in recognition and he chuckled. Suddenly they both turned, because Prisoner C, the newcomer, was laughing louder than they'd ever heard someone laugh.

Prisoner C was rolling on the ground, tears of laughter pouring down his face as he gasped for breath. When he finally got a hold of himself, Prisoners A and B were staring at him in complete confusion.

""What was that about?"" they asked.

Prisoner C wiped his eyes. ""I'd never heard that one before!""

Ving and his sister Ling were quiet to start off with, but eventually I made good friends with Ving. After talking to him for a few weeks he revealed to me that he absolutely abhored his name, and that he'd do almost anything to figure out how to get it changed. I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said

""Lee, like Bruce Lee or some shit.""

I was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework. Ling overheard us and chimed in,

""If you do that, father will disown you as our child. That name has been in our family line for generations.""

Ving never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan. The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall. After we arrived, he had gotten the name-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change. I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice. Tears began to stream down his face. He finally decided that he was gonna have to cancel his request, and Ling looked relieved. The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancelation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her. Suddenly, A short asian man with neon shorts, ray-bans, and an american flag t-shirt bursted into the room. Ving turned in awe and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks.

""D-D-Dad?""

With a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son.

So I was fishing at this pond close to home, see. And all day I was fishing, with nothing biting. Just as the sun was setting, something was finally tugging and wouldn't you know, the most brightly coloured gold FISH(!) was at the end of my fishing string. And wouldn't you know it the damn thing spoke to me...    
- Hey man, so you caught me. A damn fine job you did. But hear me out! Let me fly free as the eagle... I'll give you 3 wishes!    
- Well hot dang, I said, scratching my sweaty forehead neath my Chicago Bulls cap. Well I best take advantage of this. Goldfish, my first wish is to have the best damn car this west of the Mississippi. I want it to hit 200 mph in 4 second and no damn less, and make her red as Satan.    
- No damn problem, friend, the goldfish said. When you get home you'll see the damndest car you've ever laid your eyes on sitting right there on your front door.    
- Damn straight it better. Speaking of my front porch, I want my second wish to be that my shitty hobble of a wanna be trailer home to become the most luxurious, immense, gold plated, marble filled palace any king wouldn't even have dreamed of.    
- Good Lordie Lordie, Fisher Man, nothing could be truer. Run on home, your Palace of the Heavens awaits ye!    
- Well hot dang, fishie! For my last wish, well... I got 7 kids. All dumb as rain. Make 'em be something. I want them to be smarter than Einsteen himself. Make sure they gonna make something of themselves.    
- Say no more, brother. You just let me fly and all these wishes will come true!    
So I threw that damn magical goldfish in the pond as hard I could and ran home as fast as my legs would let me. Sure enough, the reddest fastest meanest automobile this side of the Mississippi was sitting in front of the biggest most luxurious palace I could've ever imagined. My eyes were already watering as I ran up upstairs the marble staircase into my new library, where I saw my 7 youngings, all dressed all sharp like with bowties round their necks discussing quantum physics and the like on a chalkboard, as they do.    
My eyes were crying such tears of joy and my heart was filled so much good will that I couldn't just let things be, so I ran back to the damned pond, jumped in the water and met the goldfish once more. I pulled him out the water, kissed him big and sloberlike on the mouth and said to him:    
- Goldfish, man, you made me so happy, I'll do anything to make us even. I gotta make it up to you cause you made me the happiest damn man in the world.    
- Ah, it's nothing Fisherman, you let me fly free so we're even enough I reckon.    
- Nah, Goldish, I insist. Name one thing, and ifn't be in my possibility, I'll do it for you.  
- Okay, Fisher Man, then. If that's what you want... Let me suck your cock!    
    And that's when the damn fish turned into an 8 year old boy, yer honor!!!","Goldfish, man, you made me so happy, I'll do anything for you...",12

The wife ends up giving birth to twins, both boys. Eventually as the babies grow the couple notice that the two never face the same way. Wherever one of them looks the other is always facing the opposite direction, no matter what they do. The couple decide to name them Toward and Away.

The kids grow and have a happy childhood despite this strange behavior and when they turn 10 years old their father decides he wants to teach them to learn how to be fishermen like him. He teaches them all the tools of the trade, the right knots to tie, the proper way to care for the equipment, how to steer the boat and catch the wind in the sails, and all the other ins and outs of the trade.

One day the three head out on a fishing trip together. The mother kisses them goodbye, wishes them well, and watches as they sail off. Three week.s go by before the father, and only the father, returns, looking haggard and gaunt.

""What on Earth happened?!"" exclaims the wife upon his return. ""You were gone for so long that I had almost given up hope. Where are our sons?""

""My dear,"" says the man, ""I'm afraid they are dead. I only barely survived myself.""

""What happened to you?"" asks the wife.

""Well, the day we set sail we found a great school of fish and were catching many large fish to bring home. Suddenly an enormous fish, bigger than the boat, lept out of the water and capsized us with the wave that came from it. We were flung into the water where we clung to driftwood to stay afloat. As we tried to get back together the fish breached again, swallowing Toward in its great jaws.""

""Oh, my, that's terrible!""

""It is, but you should have seen the one that got Away!""",A fisherman and his sons.,0

The next day, the devil stops to check on them and sees them dressed in parkas, mittens and bomber hats, warming themselves around the fire. The devil asks them, ""What are you doing?

The two guys reply, ""Well, you know, we're from Michigan, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy for a chance to warm up a bit, you know.""

The devil decides that these two aren't miserable enough and turns up the heat. The next morning, he stops by again and there they are, still dressed in their parkas, mittens and hats. The devil asks them again, ""It's awfully hot down here, can't you guys feel that?""

Again, the guys reply, ""Well, like we told you yesterday, we're from Michigan, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy to warm up a little bit, you know.""

The devil gets a little steamed up and he decides to fix the two guys. He cranks the heat up as high as it will go. The people are wailing and screaming everywhere.

""Everyone down here is in abject misery, and you seem to be enjoying yourselves.""

The two Michiganders reply, ""Well, ya know, we don't get too much warm weather up there in Michigan, we've just got to have a cookout when the weather is this nice.""

The devil is absolutely furious, he can hardly see straight. Finally, he comes up with an answer. These two love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. He decides to turn all the heat in hell off.

The next morning, the temperature is below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere, the people are shivering so bad, they are unable to wail, moan or gnash their teeth. The devil smiles and heads for the room with the 2 Michiganders. He finds them back in their parkas, mittens and hats. They are jumping up and down and cheering. The devil was dumbfounded.

post,7m9zs5,2qh72,jokes,false,1514319045,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7m9zs5/mr_dick/,self.jokes,,"Mr. Dick grew up in the suburbs of a lower-middle-class growing community in southern Alabama. He would often wonder how in the world it came to be that his last name was Dick. ""What a god-awful last name that is,"" he would often muse. However, Mr. Dick wasn't the kind of person that would let something as mundane as an unfortunate last name bring him down. He owned it.

Throughout his adolescent and teenage years, his friends made fun of him, but he didn't take it personally. He took the high road and decided to laugh with them. In doing so, he nevertheless maintained a respectable degree of popularity and wasn't an outcast. He would make jokes with his friends that, someday when he has a son, he would name him Harry. That way his name would be Harry Dick. He was so committed to this joke in fact, that when he actually did have a child, he actually went through with it and named *her* Harry.

That's right. Did I stutter? No, I fucking didn't because I'm typing and that wouldn't make sense. His first and only child was a daughter and he didn't want to miss the opportunity, so his first and only child's name was Harry Dick.

What a shitty name for the poor girl growing up... Like, what's she going to do with that when she's being made fun of in school? You can't just laugh that one off like it's all good. She got bullied and outcasted hard. Over the years, growing towards teenagehood, she grew a bitter hatred for her dad. How could he do such a thing to his own daughter, putting her through all of this misery? Asshole.

At the age of 13, she discovered that it was possible to change her name. Upon this discovery, she instantly became heart-set on finding some kind of employment, some kind of allowance, anything to earn the required $400 necessary to make the change. She mowed lawns, she did babysitting, and she saved every bit of holiday money she could from relatives. In the span of 6 months, she worked and worked until she was finally able to afford the $400 bill.

It was a Monday. Sunshine poured endless through her window that morning dawning the beginning of her new era. Finally, she could have a fresh start. She could fit in. She could defeat the bullying. Skipping breakfast, she ran outside, hopped on her bike, and rushed to the courthouse with her money.

Perhaps a little too fast, unfortunately. As she was rounding the corner to the courthouse without looking out for traffic, a huge truck smashed Harry Dick right in the face. The Driver just happened to be her father, Mr. Dick. Struck with an unimaginable sense of shock and disbelief, he practically fell out of his truck and rushed to Harry Dick's aid. The faint cacophony of sirens in the distance growing closer and closer was drowned out by an incapacitating drought of any semblance of positive emotion as Mr. Dick fell to his knees and cradled his daughter. Her body felt limp. Waiting there with his daughter for the emergency response to arrive was the longest two minutes and twenty-one seconds of his life.

After intense emergency care, it was finally resolved that Harry Dick was in a comatose state, and the doctors couldn't say how long it would take for her to wake up.

Horrifically, it would take Harry Dick 18 years to wake up. When she finally did, her dad was called right away. Mr. Dick couldn't believe it. His daughter has finally woken up. He had completely given up hope after the first two years. They even had a memorial service after five years.

When she woke up, she could barely remember anything. She could remember some names of people. She was able to recognize her father when he arrived, and she remembered that she hated him for naming her something so ridiculous and unfitting. Even after the eighteen-year coma, she had enough bitterness inside of her to not even want to talk to her father.

With all of the medical bills stacked up over the last two decades, Harry Dick would be drowning in debt for likely the rest of her life. Despite that, she still wanted to find the measly $400 necessary to change her name. It's been a long time coming, and especially with her aged complexion, her diminished literacy skills, her painful muscular atrophy, her likely permanent disabled state, her lack of a circle of friends to seek guidance from, and everything else that makes her life a nightmare, she really needed this one thing for herself. This one thing to find some degree of resolve in her pitiful life.

Her dad, understanding this, decides to front the money for this name change for all the damage he's caused in her life, even though he really couldn't afford it himself. It was the least he could do.

He drives her to the courthouse. He helps her into a wheelchair and strolls her into the building. They get the paperwork as an administrator, shocked to even hear of such a horrible name of a poor woman in such a horrible state, asks to speak to Harry Dick personally and privately in her office without Mr. Dick present.

Their conversation begins with her struggling to communicate her complex emotions as she tries to retell the story of her tragic life. Everything that's happened to her... the bullying, the work she did, the fateful Monday morning that ruined her life... The administrator couldn't believe what she was hearing. As a gesture of good faith and humanity, the administrator told Harry Dick that she would personally pay for this documentation to be processed, and that she deserved something nice to happen in her life. The look on Harry's face crevassed something that barely resembled a smile on her contorted face as one tear lead to two, and two tears lead to three. The administrator resolutely asked her what she wanted her new name to be. A resounding sniffle encompassed the majority of Harry's following dramatic pause. Finally, she declared as triumphantly as she could muster, ""I'd like my last name to be changed to Vagina.""",Mr. Dick,0

Tyrone then says, ""Alright Fred, here's how it's gonna be.  You're in prison now and in my cell.  That means one of us has to be the husband and one of us has to be the wife.  You know what I mean?""

Fred's heart sinks when he hears this, but it's not entirely a surprise given everything he's heard about prison.

Tyrone then asked Fred, ""Now which one you wanna be - the husband or the wife?""

Fred is repulsed by the mere implication of what that meant, but figured if this is how it was gonna be, he'd better take the lesser of two evils, so he replied to Tyrone, ""I guess I'll be the husband.""

To advance the husbandry of Bhutan's yak population, the United Nations Development Program identified a yak expert to formulate a suitable program. The expert was duly fielded, and in short order proceeded to drive up the winding roads in the Himalayas, in the general direction of the yaks.

On a particularly nasty bend on the road a giant beast of an animal, with shaggy hair and horns that seemed to span the road, blocked the SUV the expert was travelling in. Visibly alarmed, the yak expert exclaimed, ""What in heaven is that animal?!"".

Astonished, his chauffeur replied, ""That, Sir, is a yak.""",Yak Tales from the Himalayas,1

He had finally been granted R&amp;R and was on a train bound for London. The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat.

The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog. The war weary soldier asked, “Please, ma’am, may I sit in that seat?”

The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, “You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can’t you see my Little Fifi is using that seat?”

The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.

Again he asked, “Please, lady. May I sit there? I’m very tired.”

The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, “You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!”

The soldier didn’t say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.

The woman shrieked, railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, “You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road.

“And now, Sir, you’ve thrown the wrong bitch out the window.”

St. Peter greets them at the gate with a warm welcome.

“Sisters, you have all three been paragons of the Catholic faith. The good Lord would like to bestow upon you one last day on earth as anyone you would like to be. Live for a day as whomever you’d like, no judgments!”

The first nun, the eldest of the three, thinks for a moment, and then shyly states, “I think I’d like to be Raquel Welch for a day.  She was always so sexy and glamorous, and all the men wanted her.  I’d like to experience that.”

Poof.  She disappeared back to earth.

The second nun, the youngest of the three, thought for a while and declared, “I want to be Britney Spears for a day.  All that sexy dancing and singing, and all the men think she’s hot.”

Poof, she’s gone.

The third nun doesn’t hesitate.  She declares, “Sarah Pipilini.”

St. Peter stands there for a moment, confused.  He opens up the giant roster for all of humanity and pores through it.  Finally he shakes his head and says, “I’m sorry Sister, but I can’t find a record of a Sarah Pipilini anywhere...living or dead.”

“Nonsense,” says the third nun, and she produces a newspaper article from her habit and hands it to St. Peter.

After reading the article St. Peter begins to chuckle.

“Sister, it was the SAHARA PIPELINE that was laid by 10,000 men.”

Christmas next year is cancelled! Think about it... don't drink and drive...just joking go ahead I love reading about young people in the obbituaries...just kidding do be careful and Merry Christmas and just kidding the jokes not gonna end like that, though I'm making it up as I go along...see the raindeer were like ""meh it's only 2 AM, we've had longer nights, plus we're not drunk, ok we're home old man get your naked ass over to your wife, so he does but first he lights a joint and gets good and roasted. He walks in naked to Ms Claus. He remarried last year to a beautiful 19 year old blonde girl from Iceland who really likes sex and one of her fantasies is to be woken up with sex so he does, she was sleeping, but he was generous on the lube so she didn't complain, but I won't go into details but they come together and Santa gets to sleep early, he takes boxing day off, but he has a second job obviously, after work he generally likes to play pool with the raindeer and poker with the elves, but he's been a little down lately. But the sex obviously would put a stride in anyone's step, so hopefully he sleeps well. Ms.claus forced him to go to church this morning. ""Bitch"" He thought. He doesn't like Church. He thinks the idea of some guy magically knows what everyone is up to all the time to be silly.

Contrary to popular belief he doesn't see you when you're sleeping and know when you're awake he's just a mortal. He thought the only magical thing he has is his deer. Just joking magic deer don't exist. ""Who said that?!"" Says Santa, and it's as though he woke up from a nightmare in someone else's house he looks outside and sees his Jeep and starts to remember who he is ""right I'm Santa I own a Jeep I have work on the 27th I own a Jeep, flying raindeer don't exist, that would be wiered, I'm 1747 years old"" just kidding Santa is 63, no one lives much past 120 anymore these days! ""WHO Said that??!"" Santa screams ""are you hearing the voices again darling"" says 39 year old Ms Claus ""yes, that's right you're 39 in the dream you were ... nevermind"" just kidding Ms. Claus died three years ago today and Santa never remarried ""Stop!I don't know who you are but you've taken away my raindeer and you've taken away my wife, my second wife's youth, then you took away my second wife altogether, you're  making my existence vanish by your word, what are you?"" I am your creator ""but do I exist?"" Depends if kids are reading this or not. ""My existence depends on whether or not kids pay attention to me?! And if not?!""
