He listens for a few moments and says to the assistant, “I'm terribly sorry, but I am the world's leading expert on European wasps and this is not accurate at all. I don't recognize any of those sounds. Are you sure this is the correct recording?”
 

The assistant checks the turntable, and replies that it is indeed European Vespidae Acoustics Volume 2. The assistant apologizes and lifts the needle onto the next track.
 

Again the expert listens for a few moments and then says to the assistant, ""No, this just can't be right! I've been an expert in this field for 43 years and I still don't recognize any of these sounds.""


 The assistant apologizes again and lifts the needle to the next track.
 

The expert throws off the headphones as soon as it starts playing and is fuming with rage. 

""This is outrageous false advertising! I am the world's leading expert on European wasps and no European wasp has ever made a sound like the ones on this record!""


The manager of the shop overhears the commotion and walks over.

""This is an outrage! I am the world's leading expert on European wasps. Nobody knows more about them than I do. There is no way in hell that the sounds on that record were made by European wasps!""

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""
 

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.
 

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.
 

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :

The Secretary General of the UN decides to test them. He releases a rabbit into the woods and each of the divisions has to catch it.

The CIA goes in. They place animal informants throughout the forest. They question all plant and mineral witnesses. After three months of extensive investigations they conclude that rabbits don’t exist.

The FBI goes in next. After two weeks with no leads they burn the forest to the ground, killing everything in it, including the rabbit, and they make no apologies. That rabbit had it coming.

The KGB goes in last. They come out a few hours later with a badly beaten bear. The bear is screaming: ""Okay! Okay! I'm a rabbit! I'm a rabbit!""

On top of that we only have 4 parachutes because obviously the pilot doesn’t usually jump sooooo I’m taking one because this is my plane and you guys can figure the rest out.” And out he jumps.

The pilot runs to the back and says, “Planes on autopilot and I’m taking one of these chutes because I have a wife and newborn waiting at home for me I can’t die so you have about 5 minutes before the plane begins to rapidly descend,” and out he jumps.

Dan looks at Edward and Johnny and says, “Well.. I love you guys but I’m one of the smartest men in the world and thus mankind requires my intelligence,” so he grabs one and out he jumps.

Edward starts dying laughing just absolutely hysterical, rolling on the ground, deep belly laughs, tears practically streaming down his face. Johnny slaps Edward and says, “WHAT THE FUCK MAN?!

Any instrument he touches he can instantly play at a masters level. Unfortunately for the musician he lived in a country ruled by a dictator. One day the dictator learns of the musician's talent and has the musician brought before him.

The dictator gives the musician a task: compose and conduct a symphony to be played at the next political rally. Having no choice the musician agrees. He toils day and night for the next month, feverishly trying to create the perfect composition. When the day of the rally comes the musician confidently strides on stage, bows to the dictator, *tap tap taps* his baton on the music stand, and begins conducting. 

And the most godawful sound comes from the orchestra. Like nails on a chalkboard bad. The dictator is furious. He orders the musician to be executed the next day. After he's thrown in jail for the night, the musician asks if he can have a last meal. After deliberating the guards decide it wouldn't hurt anything. The musician orders the hottest curry the guards could find. As hot as it could possibly be. And he eats all of it right down to the last bit.

The next morning comes and the guards haul the musician out of his cell, drag him to the execution chamber, and strap him into the electric chair. As they throw the switch the lights begin to flicker, smoke starts billowing, and there's a massive *POP*. The guards quickly turn off the power and start peering through the dissipating smoke. Much to their surprise the musician is sitting there unharmed. They quickly get the dictator on the phone and explain that the musician is still alive. The dictator decides to see the miracle musician for himself. 

Once the dictator arrives he sees the musician, who seems to be in a jovial mood. Enraged the dictator throws the electric chair switch again. Once again the lights begin to flicker, smoke starts billowing, and there's a massive *POP*. The dictator slowly turns off the power and allows the smoke to clear. Sure enough the musician is unscathed. 

""How?! How are you still alive?!"" the dictator yells.

The musician contemplates his answer for a moment and replies, ""Well, you see, I am an incredible musician. But sir...... I'm a terrible conductor.""",So there's this musician.....,5

post,b1glkg,2qh72,jokes,false,1552665448,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/b1glkg/sheep_shagging/,self.jokes,,"An old Oxford professor is nearing retirement and decides that he wants to do something fun for once. He's spent his whole life researching scientific theories in his lab and wants to do something outside for a change, so he asks his assistant for a suggestion of something different to go and research.


This assistant is a bit of a git and decides he'll play a prank on the old man, and suggests he research 'sheep shagging'.


The professor thinks this is a great idea and heads off to Wales to begin his research.He heads out to the countryside and finds a farmer to quiz about his unnatural habits. The professor greets him and asks if he's got time to answer a couple of quick questions.


""No problem boyo"" says the farmer, ""go right ahead.


""Well,"" said the professor, ""what I'd like to know first is, do you own any sheep here?""


""Of course boyo, biggest farm for miles round here I have. We've got loads of 'em""


""Great, now the next question is a bit personal - do you use your sheep for sex?""


""Ohh, too right boyo. There's three or four out there who are my particular favourites.""


""So, how exactly do you... do it?""


""Well, normally I take them down to the river, I slap their back feet in my wellies, the sheep pushes back from the water, bloody heaven boyo.""


The professor thanks him and heads for the airport. Having heard about the Kiwis, he heads out to New Zealand with exactly the same plan. He finds a farm, talks to the farmer and gets the same responses.


""Round up the sheep, head 'em up towards a cliff and off you go. Back feet in my boots, sheep pushing back from the cliff, bloody marvelous mate."" 


Again, the professor thanks him and decides that his research needs only one more addition. So he jets off to the world centre of sheep shagging, Australia. Once in Australia, he drives out to the bush, finds the biggest farm he can and knocks on the farmhouse door. He repeats his questions to the farmer. ""Too right mate. Usually I stick their back legs in me wellies, front legs over me shoulders and away we go!""


""So the sheep faces you? That's strange - I've been talking to people around the world about this, and they all do it with the sheep facing away from them.""


The Aussie is shocked. For a few seconds he can't speak, then he manages to stutter, ""What? No kissing?""",Sheep Shagging,12

The monarch could have killed him but was moved by Arthur's youth and ideals. So, the monarch offered him his freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer and, if after a year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death.
 
The question?....What do women really want? Such a question would   perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young Arthur, it seemed an   impossible query. But, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end.
 
He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everyone: the princess, the priests, the wise men and even the court jester. He spoke with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer.
 
Many people advised him to consult the old witch, for only she would have the answer.

But the price would be high; as the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged.
 
The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no choice but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer the question, but he would have to agree to her price first .
 
The old witch wanted to marry Sir Lancelot, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend!

Young Arthur was horrified. She was hunchbacked and hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage, made obscene noises, etc. He had never encountered such a repugnant creature in all his life.
 
He refused to force his friend to marry her and endure such a terrible burden; but Lancelot, learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur.
 
He said nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table.
 
Hence, a wedding was proclaimed and the witch answered Arthur's question thus:

What a woman really wants, she answered....is to be in charge of her own life.

Everyone in the kingdom instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared.
 
And so it was,   the neighboring monarch granted Arthur his freedom and Lancelot and the witch had a wonderful wedding.
 
The honeymoon hour approached and Lancelot, steeling himself for a horrific experience, entered the bedroom. But, what a sight awaited him. The most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him on the bed. The astounded Lancelot asked what had happened .
 
The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her when she appeared as a witch, she would henceforth, be her horrible deformed self only half the time and the beautiful maiden the other half.
Which would he prefer? Beautiful during the day....or night?

  Lancelot pondered the predicament. During the day, a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his castle, an old witch ? Or, would he prefer having a hideous witch during the day, but by night, a beautiful woman for him to enjoy wondrous intimate moments?
 
What would YOU do?

What Lancelot chose is below. BUT.....make YOUR choice before   you scroll down below. OKAY?     
 
Noble Lancelot said that he would allow HER to make the choice herself.
 
Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time because he had respected her enough to let her be in charge of her own life.
 
Now...what is the moral to this story?

&lt;Scroll Down&gt;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The moral is: 
If   you don't let a woman have her own way, 
things are going to get ugly...

Joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

A bear sees the fish and decides it will get the fish when it jumps.

A hunter with a cheese sandwich in his pocket sees the bear and waits for it to go for the fish to shoot it.

A mouse sees the cheese sandwich and decides to wait for the hunter to shoot so that the sandwich will fall and he can get it.

A cat sees the mouse and decides to wait for it to go for the sandwich to jump and catch it.

So, the fly drops, the fish jumps, the bear goes for it, the hunter shoots, the sandwich falls, the mouse goes for it, and the cat jumps, but he misses and goes into the water.

So naturally after the women enter heaven they are very carful not to step on any ducks. 

After a few days the the 1st women eventually stepped on a duck, very quickly St. Peter came over with a man with a hunch back, a crooked smile and uneven eyes and handcuffed him to her for all eternity. 

After several weeks in heaven the 2nd women’s finally steps on a duck, and once again, very quickly, St. Peter come over with a man who has very uneven facial hair, and covered in warts, and she was handcuffed to him for the rest of eternity. 

A few months go by and the 3rd women has not stepped on a single duck, and she’s very proud of herself. 1 day she’s minding her own business and St. Peter come overs with the most beautiful man she has ever seen along with a pair of handcuffs. He has big muscles, wonderful jaw line, piercing blue eyes, and she then turns to St. Peter.

“Oh goodness! Thank you so much! What ever did I do to deserve this!”

3 guy friends (no homo) die and go to heaven, where together they are asked questions by St. Peter. After passing all questions, 
St. Peter asks, ""so far you have done well, but I have one final question to ask.""

All men accept and ask what it is.

St. Peter asks the first guy, ""How many times have you cheated on your wife?""

The first guy thinks to himself, ""Well, he already knows, so I may as well not lie."" He then says, ""I have cheated on my wife 5 times. Twice early on, twice later, and a final time because I found out she had cheated on me.""

St. Peter points to an old looking SUV and says, ""You will drive around in this. Its not in the best shape, but it does work and you can have your friends in if you want,"" to which the first guy thanks him.

St. Peter then turns to the second guy and asks him how many times he had cheated on his wife, to which the second guy responds with, ""I have only cheated on my wife once!""

St. Peter points to a red, sports car and says, ""You will be riding around in this. It is nice, fast and you will have some style in your car.""

Then the first guy waited for St. Peter to ask him, and he proudly states that, ""I have not ever cheated on my wife, not once!""

St. Peter shows him a decked out limo, with drivers, a bar, and a table for poker and other games. The first guy is very grateful, and thanks St. Peter.

The next day, the friends are enjoying there rides, and they decide to meet up. Though both guy 1 and 2 find guy 3 crying historically.

""What's wrong? You got that decked out limo, why could you possibly be sad?"" they said.

Guy 3 looks up and says, ""I just say my wife riding on a skateboard!""",Heaven Rides,3

The elder tells the boy, you must kneel before the Chief while he inspects your totem.  If he likes it, you must stand up and he will bestow you with a silver necklace which he will place around your neck.  If he is not impressed, you must lie face down with your head in the dirt until every guest has walked away.  The boy kneels before the Chief as the Chief makes a careful inspection of the totem.

""I promise"" said the elephant.

Years later the elephant was walking through the woods when he heard the faintest shouting. The elephant looked down and saw a mouse stuck in the same hunter's pit that he was stuck in years before.

""Of course,"" the elephant replied. The elephant walked over the pit so that he was straddeling it and popped a massive boner. The mouse grabbed onto the elephant's boner and escaped from the hunter's pit.

&gt; The rules of the contest required each finalist to compose a four-line poem in one minute or less, and the poem had to contain the word “Timbuktu.”

&gt; The San Francisco State graduate went first. About thirty seconds after the clock started he jumped up and recited the following poem:

&gt; “'Slowly across the desert sand
Trekked the dusty caravan.
Men on camels, two by two
Destination -- Timbuktu.”

&gt; The audience went wild! How, they wondered if the redneck could top that?! The clock started again and the redneck sat in silent thought. Finally, in the last few seconds, he jumped and recited:

&gt; “Tim and me, a-huntin' went.
Met three whores in a pop-up tent.
They was three, we was two,
So I bucked one and Timbuktu”",Timbuktu,13

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1,500!"" she cried,""$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.""",A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon.,46

When he got to heaven, God was showing him around. They came to a modest little house with a faded Colts flag in the window. “This house is yours for eternity, Peyton,” said God. “This is very special; not everyone gets a house up here.” 

Peyton felt special, indeed, and walked up to his house. On his way up the sidewalk, he noticed another house just around the corner. It was a 3-story mansion with a blue and red sidewalk, a 50 foot tall flagpole with an enormous Patriots logo flag, and in every window hung a red Patriots towel. 

Peyton looked at God and said “God, I’m not trying to be ungrateful, but I have a question. I was an all-pro QB, I hold many NFL records, and I even went to the Hall of Fame.” 

“So what’s your point Peyton?”, God asked. 

“Well, why does Tom Brady get a better house than me?” 

God chuckled, and replied “Peyton, that’s not Tom’s house, it’s mine.”",Peyton Manning goes to heaven,4

The priest, being a gentleman, said, ""Due to the circumstances, let's just share the room. I'll sleep on the floor, you can have the bed. I'm sure God will understand"".

The nun agrees and they turn off the lights to sleep.

Halfway through the night, the nun who has always had the hots for the priests gets frisky and suddenly has an idea.

""Father, it's very cold. Could you help me...? I'm sure God will understand...""

Hearing this, the priest gets up from the floor, gets a blanket and gives it to her.

Irritated but determined to succeed, she tries again after a few minutes.

""Father, I'm still cold! Could you *please* help me...? I'm sure God will understand...""

So the priest gets up, gets a blanket and gives it to her and lies down again on the floor.

By now the nun is mad enough that she throws caution to the wind. She sits up in bed and puts on a seductive pose, before saying:

""Father! It's still cold, and no amount of blankets will help! Just for tonight, why don't you treat me as if I were your wife...? I'm sure God will understand...""

The priest slowly sits up from where he lies, breathing deeply as he considers this heavy decision.

""Treat you like a husband would his wife, you say...?""

The nun slowly nods and winks.

Then he makes up his mind and says:

They  continue walking through the nice park, flowers everywhere, and the  devil shows the atheist a garage full of beautiful cars. ""These are your  cars now!"" and hands the man all the car keys. Again, the atheist tries  to thank the devil, but he only says ""Everyone down here gets some cool  cars! How would you drive around without having cars?"".

They  walk on and the area gets even nicer. There are birds chirping,  squirrels running around, kittens everywhere. They arrive at a fountain,  where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a  bench. She looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other.  The man couldn´t be any happier. The devil says ""Everyone gets to have  their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!""

As  they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. He peeks to the other  side and is totally shocked. There are people in pools of lava,  screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with  their tridents. Other devils are skinning people alive, heads are  spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. A stench of sulfur  is in the air.

Terrified, the man  stumbles backwards, and asks the devil ""What is going on there?"" The  devil just shrugs and says: ""Those are the christians, I don´t know why,  but they prefer it that way"".

 After one particular event however, the council was at a standstill. Nobody could agree on what should be done, and so one of the elder members suggested they think outside the box.
“We should contact the Elder Mink, for he is the wisest in all the lands” said the Turtle.
“But he is not of this Forest!” cried the Monkey, “How could he know what is best for us?”

And so the council voted, with asking the Mink passing with 7 votes to 3. They sent their fastest bird to seek out the foreign Mink’s help.

When word finally came back, in the form of a letter, the council hurriedly gathered to hear what was written. Upon opening it, both those for and against were shocked at what he said!

Finally one day Justin said to Christian, 'I'm fed up with being a prawn; I wish I was a shark, and then I wouldn't have any worries about being eaten.'  
A large mysterious cod appeared and said, 'Your wish is granted', and lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark. Horrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by his old mate. Time passed and Justin found life as a shark boring and lonely. All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them. Justin didn't realise that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight. While swimming alone one day he saw the cod again and he thought that perhaps he fish could change him back into a prawn. He approached the cod and begged to be changed back, and, lo and behold, he found himself turned back into a prawn.  
With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes Justin swam back to his friends and bought them all a cocktail. Looking around the gathering at the reef he realised he couldn't see his old pal.' Where's Christian?' he asked.' He's at home, still distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy and became a shark', came the reply.  
Eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture, he set off to Christian's abode. As he opened the coral gate memories came flooding back. He banged on the door and shouted, 'It's me, Justin, your old friend, come out and see me again.' Christian replied, 'No way man, you'll eat me. you're now a shark, the enemy and I'll not be tricked into being your dinner.'  
Justin cried back ' No, I'm not. That was the old me. I've changed.' ...............

After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.""

The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?""

""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet..

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested.. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.""

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1,500!"" she cried,""$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500.""",Your duck is dead,15

And every time he would say to her, ""Ethel, you know that I'd love to go for a ride in that helicopter."" But Ethel would always reply, ""I know that Walter, but that helicopter ride is 50 dollars and 50 dollars is 50 dollars.""

Finally, they went to the fair, and Walter said to Ethel, ""Ethel, you know I'm 87 years old now. If I don't ride that helicopter this year, I may never get another chance."" Once again Ethel replied, ""Walter, you know that helicopter is 50 dollars and 50 dollars is 50 dollars.""

This time the helicopter pilot overheard the couple's conversation and said, ""Listen folks, I'll make a deal with you. I'll take both of you for a ride; if you can both stay quiet for the entire ride and not say a word I won't charge you! But if you say just one word, it's 50 dollars.""

Walter and Ethel agreed and up they went in the helicopter. The pilot performed all kinds of fancy moves and tricks, but not a word was said by either Walter or Ethel. The pilot did his death-defying tricks over and over again, but still there wasn't so much as one word said. When they finally landed, the pilot turned to Walter and said, ""Wow! I've got to hand it to you. I did everything I could to get you to scream or shout out, but you didn't. I'm really impressed!""

Walter replied, ""Well to be honest I almost said something when Ethel fell out but, you know, 50 dollars is 50 dollars!""",Walter took his wife Ethel to the state fair every year,130

Not long afterwards, they felt more turbulence, and again heard the pilot say, ""OK so we just lost our second engine, but not to worry, we are still running well on two engines. We will arrive at our destination 1 hour later than scheduled.""

The passengers exchanged worried looks and started talking among themselves.

Again, they felt the jet dip and rumble, and again, they heard the pilot say, ""We lost our third engine,  and we will arrive 2 hours later than scheduled at our destination.  My apologies for the inconveniences this delay is causing all of you.""
