Later, Jim went to the kitchen to get some refreshments. Bob's wife followed and asked, 'Did you see anything that you like under there?' Surprised by her boldness, Jim admitted that, well indeed he did.

She said, 'Well, you can have it but it will cost you $500. 'After taking a minute or two to assess the financial and moral costs of this offer, Jim confirms that he is interested.

Sue told him that since her husband Bob worked Friday afternoons and Jim didn't, Jim should be at her house around 2 p.m. Friday afternoon.

When Friday rolled around, Jim showed up at Bob's house at 2 p.m. sharp - and after paying Sue the agreed sum of $500 - they went to the bedroom and closed their transaction, as agreed.

Jim quickly dressed and left. As usual, Bob came home from work at 6 p.m. And upon arriving, asked his wife: 'Did Jim come by the house this afternoon?'

With a lump in her throat Sue answered 'Why yes, he did stop by for a few minutes this afternoon.'

Her heart nearly skipped a beat when her husband curtly asked, 'And did he give you $500?'

Sue, using her best poker face, replied, 'Well, yes, in fact he did give me $500.'

---

Radio Yerevan was asked: Is it true that there is freedom of speech in the Soviet Union in the same way that there is in the USA?

Radio Yerevan answered: In principle, yes. In the USA, you can stand in front of the Washington Monument, shout ""Down with Reagan!"" and you wouldn't get punished. In the USSR, you can stand in the middle of the Red Square, shout ""Down with Reagan!"" and you won't get punished, either.

---

Radio Yerevan was asked: What is chaos?

Radio Yerevan answered: We do not comment on national economics.

---

Radio Yerevan was asked: Why is there no flour in the market?

Radio Yerevan answered: Because they began adding it to bread.

---

Radio Yerevan was asked: What is a Soviet musical duet?

Radio Yerevan answered: A Soviet musical quartet after a trip abroad.

---

Radio Yerevan was asked: Why is our government not in hurry to land men on the moon?

Radio Yerevan answered: Because they might decide to not return.

---

Radio Yerevan was asked: What is ""Russian business""?

Radio Yerevan answered: To steal a crate of vodka, sell it, and then drink the money away.

---

Radio Yerevan was asked: Was comrade Lenin a scientist or a politician?

Radio Yerevan answered: Of course, a politician. If he were a scientist, he would've first tried his theories on dogs. ",A collection of Radio Yerevan jokes,16

Off he is whisked to different hells to choose from. He sees a hell where people are being burned whole, ‘No’, he says. Next he sees a hell where people are being fried in boiling oil, he rejects it too. He also refuses a hell where people are continuously heaved and dropped on bed of nails. Finally, he comes to a hell where all people are neck-deep in a large pool of shit. The stink is terrible but he notices that every one of them are having Starbucks coffee. He asks the accompanying guard if the coffee was free. The guard confirms it.


‘Darn it, if I have to choose one of the hells, let it be this, at least I can have free Starbucks’. So he chooses the hell. He is pushed forward into the pool. He winces and almost gags as he is being dropped neck-deep in shit. After he fights the retch, he asks the guard if he can order coffee now. The guard nods and says he may. He orders a grande Café Latte. He is about to sip from the glass when another guard comes along sounding a bell.

Laughing uncontrollably they hug each other for a successfully accomplished mission.

""Come on, let's go to the next bar and see if we can't play those suckers too.""

They proceed to the bar in the next town. They drink, they sing, they laugh... The second one crawls under the table and before long they are ruthlessly kicked out again.

So they proceed to the next bar. And so on and so forth, their gimmick improving with each passing performance. 

3 or 4 bars later, the second one complains to the first, 

""Hey, great idea, man. But do you think we could switch roles? My back is starting to hurt from having to crawl under the table every time. Here, give me the sausage, and you go under and pretend to blow me this time.""

The next day he was in the shower when he heard the voice again. ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" He ignored it and went to work, but while in the elevator going up to his office, he heard it again. ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" Later that day, while he was in a meeting, he heard it again. ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" On the car ride home, he heard it again. ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" In bed trying to sleep, he heard it again. ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas.""

The next day was worse. He started hearing the voice every hour on the hour. ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" He didn't tell anyone, because he didn't want anyone to think he was crazy. He tried to ignore it, but the voice was persistent... ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas.""

The next day, he was hearing the voice over and over and over again. It was louder than ever. ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas."" ""Quit your job. Sell your house. Go to Vegas.""

Finally, the guy snaps. ""Fuckit!""

He goes up to his boss, tells him to take this job and shove it up his ass, then walks out. He goes home and contacts a realtor, and sells the house the next day. He packs up the cash in a suitcase, buys a plane ticket, and flies to Vegas. After he walks out of the airport and says, ""Alright, now what?"" ""Go to Caesar's Palace.""

The guy hails a taxi and immediately goes to Caesar's Palace. As soon as he walks into the front door, he hears the voice again. ""Go to the roulette table."" The guy goes to the nearest roulette table. ""Put it all on red 21."" The guy takes all of his money and puts it on red 21.

""Don't bother, I got expelled.""

""Well, they summoned me to the principal's office, and sitting there were the math teacher, the gym teacher, and the art teacher. And they asked me to explain myself.""  
""The art teacher?"" started the father,  ""Why the fuck was she there?  What the fuck did you say  that upset them?""  
""I don't know!  I just explained to the principle exactly what I said before.  That there's no fucking difference between 7 * 9 and 9 * 7, I had nothing else to stand on in the gym but my cock, and I also asked him why the fuck is the Art teacher here?""

""I'd like to see Comrade Brezhnev"" she says. The guards exchange looks with each other and tell her, ""Comrade Brezhnev is quite busy, but you can ask his secretary.""

Incredulous, the woman shouts,

""Do you know who the fuck I am? I slept with Brezhnev!!"" The guards then get on the phone with Brezhnev's secretary who tells them to let her through. The secretary gets out from his desk, greets the woman and asks her what she wants.

""My name is Klavdiya Ivanova,"" she says. ""I live in a tiny village in Siberia called Mukhosransk but I want a flat in Moscow with registration."" The secretary hears her out and goes to relay her message to Brezhnev.

""Leonid Ilich,"" he tells him,  ""a woman by the name of Klavdiya Ivanova from Mukhosransk just walked in, told me she slept with you and that she wants to see you.""

""Hmm, I don't quite recall that moment. What does she want?""

""A flat in Moscow with the proper paperwork"" says the secretary.

""Give her a flat and make sure she doesn't come here again.""

A month later, Mrs. Ivanova goes to the Kremlin again and demands to see Brezhnev. She tells the secretary that Brezhnev gave her a one bedroom flat, but she wants a three bedroom one. Brezhnev makes arrangements to give her a new flat. Another month passes, and Mrs. Ivanova is at the Kremlin again demanding that they give her a flat with a view of the Kremlin. Exasperated, Brezhnev tells the secretary to ask her when she slept with him. The secretary then exits Brezhnev's study and asks the woman.

""I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but can you please tell me when exactly did you sleep with Leonid Ilich?"" 

""It was during the last Congress of the CPSU during Comrade Kosygin's speech that we slept together. He at the podium and I in front of my TV.""

When he left the hospital he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He saw a men's clothing store &amp; thought, ""That's what I need - a new suit."" He entered the shop and told the salesman, ""I'd like a new suit."" 

The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, ""Let's see ... size 44 long."" 

Joe laughed, ""That's right, how did you know?"" 

The tailor replied, ""Been in the business 60 years!"" Joe tried on the suit. It fit perfectly.

As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about a new shirt?"" 

Joe thought for a moment and then said, ""Sure."" The salesman eyed Joe and said, ""Let's see, 34 sleeve &amp; 16-1/2 neck."" 

Again, Joe was surprised, ""That's right, how did you know?"" 

""Been in the business 60 years!""


Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly. As Joe adjusted the collar in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about new shoes?"" 

Joe was on a roll and said, ""Sure."" 

The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, ""Let's see ... 9-1/2 E."" Joe was astonished, 

""That's right, how did you know?"" 

""Been in the business 60 years!""


Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly. Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, ""How about some new underwear?"" 

Joe thought for a second and said, ""Sure."" 

The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, ""Let's see... size 36.""

Joe laughed. ""Ah ha! I got you! I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."" The salesman shook his head, ""You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 underwear would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.",A cure for headache,95

A  horny  American is walking along Jalan Bukit Bintang, in Kuala Lumpur one night and a very gorgeous girl catches his eye.

He strikes up a conversation with her, and quickly discovers that she is one 
of those ""exclusive"" ladies-of-the-trade.

""How much do you charge?"", asks he.

Mary replies, ""It starts at 500 ringgit for a hand-job.""

He says, ""500 ringgit for a hand-job? No hand-job is worth that kind 
of money!""

With a saucy flick of her eyelashes, Mary says, ""Do you see that Mary 
Restaurant on the corner?""

""Yes.""

""Do you see the next Mary's about another block further down?""

""Yes.""

""And beyond that, do you see the third Mary's, just by the side of the old 
Cathay cinema?""

""Yes.""

""Well,"" says Mary, smiling invitingly, ""I own those.

And, I own them because I give a hand-job that's worth 500 ringgit.""

He then exclaims, ""What the hell? You only live once. I'll give it 
a try.""

They retire to the nearby Marriott Hotel.

A short time later,  he is sitting on the bed realising that he 
just experienced the hand-job of a lifetime, worth every bit of 500 ringgit.

He is so amazed, he says, ""I suppose a blow-job is 1,000 ringgit?""

Mary replies, ""RM1,500.""

""I wouldn't pay that for a blow-job!""

Mary then says, while signalling him to come closer to her.

""Come closer to this window, big boy. Do you see that bank just across the 
junction to Jalan Sultan Ismail?

I own that bank outright. And I own it because I give a blow-job that's 
worth every sen of 1,500 ringgit !""

And poor customer , basking in the afterglow of that terrific hand-job, 
decides to cancel his intended new mobile phone and says, ""Give it to me 
!!!""

Ten minutes later, he is sitting on the bed more amazed than before.

He can scarcely believe it but he feels he truly got his money's 
worth.

He decides to dip into what else he may have left with him for one more 
glorious and unforgettable experience.

He then asks Mary,""How much for some pussy?""

Mary replies, ""Come over here to this other window, I want to show you 
something.

Do you see how the whole city of Kuala Lumpur is laid out before us ..... 
all those beautiful lights, banks .... corporate offices .... business 
houses ..... and big-&amp;-small shops and places?""

""Wowwww !!"" he shouts out in awe, ""You own the whole city ??""

""No,"" Mary replies, ""but I would if I had a pussy.""",A Raunchy One!,273

The mum was shocked at the feedback and withdrew her son from the school and even moved out of Sydney, went north to Newcastle.  

25 years later, the teacher was diagnosed with an incurable cardio disease.  All the doctors strongly advised her to have heart surgery, which only one
surgeon at the John Hunter Hospital could perform
Left with no other options, the teacher decided to have the operation, which was successful. When she opened her eyes after the surgery she saw a
handsome doctor smiling down at her.  

She wanted to thank him, but could not talk. Her face started to turn blue, she raised her hand, trying to tell him something but eventually died.  The doctor was shocked and was trying to work out what went wrong, when he turned around he saw our friend Wally, working as a cleaner in the clinic, who had unplugged the oxygen equipment to connect his Hoover!

*****

There was a family who had a pair of twins, both a mere 4 years old. One was a charming little boy, the other a dainty, coy girl.

One day, the girl and her mother went into the shower. The mother dropped the soap and the girl bent down to pick it up. On the way down, she saw the mother's vag, and curious, she asked: ""What's that?""

Thinking of a way to get out of the situation, she attempted a nonchalant answer. ""That? Oh, that's just my garage.""

Afterwards, upon drying off and changing, she walked past the father and her brother with a smug smile on her face, having known something he didn't.

It was now the boy's turn to shower with his father. The father accidentally dropped the shampoo and the boy bent over to pick it up when he asked: ""What's that?""

The father, having thought it through, replied, ""That's my Little Red Racing Car.""

The next day, the twins showered together.

The boy dropped the soap. As he bent over to pick it up, he saw the girl's vag and asked: ""What's that?""

""That's my garage.""

In turn, the girl asked: ""What's that?""

""That's my little red racing car.""

After a few moments of silence, the girl asked, ""Wanna put the Little Red Racing Car inside the Garage?""

""Sure,"" replied the young boy.

A few minutes later, the mother, alone in her room, suddenly heard screaming from the bathroom.

She rushed in to assess the situation when she saw the boy on the floor grabbing his crotch in a pool of blood. His scrotum was next to him, having been cut off.

The girl was holding a knife. The mother asked, all a fluster, ""What happened?""

The girl simply shrugged and replied, ""The Little Red Racing Car was too big so we cut off the back wheels.""",The Little Red Racing Car,9

The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine, and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.""

Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He couldn't concentrate long enough to answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife.

When he left the hospital he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He saw a men's clothing store &amp; thought, ""That's what I need - a new suit.""

He entered the shop and told the salesman, ""I'd like a new suit."" The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, ""Let's see ... size 44 long."" Joe laughed, ""That's right, how did you know?"" ""Been in the business 60 years!"" Joe tried on the suit. It fit perfectly.

As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about a new shirt?"" Joe thought for a moment and then said, ""Sure."" The salesman eyed Joe and said, ""Let's see, 34 sleeve &amp; 16-1/2 neck."" Again, Joe was surprised, ""That's right, how did you know?"" ""Been in the business 60 years!""

Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly. As Joe adjusted the collar in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about new shoes?"" Joe was on a roll and said, ""Sure."" The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, ""Let's see ... 9-1/2 E."" Joe was astonished, ""That's right, how did you know?"" ""Been in the business 60 years!""

Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly. Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, ""How about some new underwear?"" Joe thought for a second and said, ""Sure."" The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, ""Let's see... size 36.""

Joe laughed. ""Ah ha! I got you! I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."" The salesman shook his head, ""You can't wear a size 34.

The American Medical Association has weighed in on Trump's proposed health care package to replace Obama-care:

The Allergists were in favor of scratching it, but the Dermatologists advised not to make any rash moves.

The Gastroenterologists had sort of a gut feeling about it, but the Neurologists thought the Administration had a lot of nerve.

Meanwhile, Obstetricians felt certain everyone was laboring under a misconception, while the Ophthalmologists considered the idea shortsighted.

Pathologists yelled, ""Over my dead body!"" while the Pediatricians said, ""Oh, grow up!""

The Psychiatrists thought the whole idea was madness, while the Radiologists could see right through it.

Surgeons decided to wash their hands of the whole thing and the Internists claimed it would indeed be a bitter pill to swallow.

The Plastic Surgeons opined that this proposal would ""put a whole new face on the matter.""

The Podiatrists thought it was a step forward, but the Urologists were pissed off at the whole idea.

Anesthesiologists thought the whole idea was a gas, and those lofty Cardiologists didn't have the heart to say no.

In the end, the Proctologists won out, leaving the entire decision up to the assholes in Washington",The American Medical Association weighs in on Trumpcare,5

He is welcomed by the villagers with open arms, and a great feast in his honor is given. All the villagers and the journalist eat their fill until they cannot possibly take another bite. The journalist retires to a bed the villagers prepared for him. In the wee hours of the morning, the journalist sits bolt upright, his lower abdomen seeming to want to explode. He makes his way into the brush and squats to relieve himself. He very quickly realizes that he has a bit of an obstruction problem, as only a few drips of waste are evacuated. He sighs to himself, grabs the nearest palm leaf, and wipes what little there is to wipe, wondering how he is going to address this dilemma. No sooner does he stand than he realizes that things are beginning to move along quite rapidly in his digestive system. The effect is profound and almost alarming! The next morning, the journalist takes out his notebook and begins to scribble a draft of his dissertation on the miraculous jungle flora.

Walking around one day, the engineer notices that the moving walkway motor has jammed, so he unjams it. People can now get from place to place more easily.

The TV was grainy and unclear, so he fixes the connection to the satellite dish and now they get hundreds of high def channels.

One day, God decides to look down on Hell to see how his grand design is working out, and notices that everyone down there is happy and enjoying umbrella drinks.

God asks the Devil “What’s up?”

The Devil replies, “Things are great down here since you sent us an engineer!”

“What?” says God, “An engineer? I didn’t send you one of those. That must have been a mistake. Send him upstairs immediately.”

The Devil responds, “No way. We want to keep our engineer. We like him.”

God demands, “If you don’t send him to me immediately, I’ll sue!”

The Devil laughs. “Where are YOU going to get a lawyer?”

""Well, first, there's an crocodile in the swamp out back with a nail through it's foot. If you can go there, wrestle that croc, and pull that nail out, you move on to the second challenge.""

""What's the second challenge?"" the man asks.

""Now, which way to that fucking dog!?"" he yells. 

The bartender points. The man leaves. People open up all the windows, and they hear all kinds of barking, snarling, screaming, punching, and then yowling coming from behind the gas station.

He's absolutely shredded, full of cuts and lacerations and barely standing. Even his pants are down and his cock is hanging out, also all bloodied and bruised.

Now this king also lived in grass hut, except his hut boasted a second floor.
