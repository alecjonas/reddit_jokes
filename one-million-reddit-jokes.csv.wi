The couple find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. While waiting, they begin to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? When St. Peter showed up, they asked him.

St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.

The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.

'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'

'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'

St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.

'OH, COME ON!', St. Peter shouted, 'It took me three months to find a priest up here! Do you have any idea how long it'll take me to find a lawyer ?

When the Godfather goes to confront Guido about his missing money, he takes along his lawyer who knows sign language. 

 The Godfather tells the lawyer, ""Ask him where the money is.""  The lawyer, using sign language, asks Guido about the money.  

Guido signs back ""I don't know what you are talking about.""

The lawyer tells the Godfather, ""he says he doesnt know what you are talking about.""  The Godfather than pulls out his pistol, puts it to Guido's head and says ""Ask him again!""

The teacher asked, 'Harry, what's your problem?'


Harry answered, 'I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!'

Ms.. Brooks had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office.
While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed.

Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test.

Principal:'What is 3 x 3?'

Harry: '9.'

Principal:'What is 6 x 6?'

Harry: '36.'

And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know.
The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, 'I think Harry can go to the 3rd grade'
Ms. Brooks says to the principal, 'Let me ask him some questions.'
The principal and Harry both agreed.

Ms. Brooks asks, 'What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?'

Harry, after a moment: 'Legs.'

Ms Brooks: 'What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?'

The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!

Harry replied: 'Pockets.'

Ms. Brooks: 'What does a dog do that a man steps into?'

Harry: 'Pants..'

The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open.

Ms Brooks: 'What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?'

The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer,

Harry replied, 'Bubble gum.'

Ms. Brooks: 'What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?'

Harry: 'Shake hands...'
The principal was trembling.

Ms.. Brooks: 'What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?'

Harry:'Firetruck.'

A scholarly looking man is strolling around with a book under his arm and is noticed by a stranger.  The stranger (who is a musician) is curious about the book and approaches the man.

""What is that book you have there?""

""This is a philosophical book, it has taught me many things""

""Well, what have you learned from this book?""

*the man, noticing the stranger's dragging a violin case*

""For example, do you play the violin?""

The stranger replies ""Yes""

""Well then, you must like music""

""Yes""

""Which means you also like clubs""

""Yes, i do""

""Well, when you go to a club, you drink""

""That's correct""

""And when you drink, you enjoy dancing with pretty girls""

""Why yes!""

""So it follows that you are certainly not gay""

""Wow! That's amazing! I'd love to buy that book from you.  Name your price!""

So they negotiate terms and the man sells the book to the stranger.  So the stranger begins strolling around with the book under his arms.  One day he's approached by another.  Curiously, he asks ""What is that book you're strolling around with?""

""This a philosophical book, it has many things to teach""

""Well, tell me, what have you learned from this book?""

*the man with the book thinks for a moment*

""Do you play the violin?""

""No, I don't""

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a very strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" 


The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" 


The man says, ""All right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?"" 


The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk."" 


The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. 


He says, ""I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth."" 


The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound."" 


The monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says, ""The sound is right behind that door."" The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. 


He says, ""Real funny. May I have the key?"" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. 


The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. 


Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. 


Finally, the monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" 


The man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end.


He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

Hello, I'm an overprotective father looking to furnish my daughter's new apartment when she starts in UCF next semester, and I saw your ad on craigslist for couch and loveseat. When I purchase this couch I'll be periodically checking my daughter's furniture with a black light for semen stains. Call me crazy, I don't care. If I'm paying for her college, she has to save herself and put up with a crazy father.
What I need to know is, will I find any prior to purchase and may I check it with a black light?

Dear Mr. Gruden (Fellow American),

Thank you for your caring, and refreshing email.  You never really know what you are going to run into with this Craig's List but its good to know there is another flag waving Fellow American who considers Craig a friend. Let me first say I am so relieved that I'm not selling you the couch in my garage!

Anyway, I am no expert in the spectrum of light colors so I am a little confused about your ""black light"". My wife and I have industry standard white lights? Do black lights give off black light to make a room darker? I struggle with stress based insomnia and this sounds like something I should look into to. 

Sorry for my delay there. I was just GOOGLING what a black light is. Its a detective device to catch semen but also a ""party-starter"" (source: Wikipedia). Without delaying my response any further, I will do my best to answer your previously stated semen question.

I can not imagine that there is any human semen on my couch, or loveseat (I guess its now a non love seat huh? chuckle, chuckle). I must admit that I do have a few real prankster friends though and there is just no telling what those boys have done that I have yet to find out about. I'll tell you what, there is nothing scarer than getting a firecracker full of flour stuffed in your tailpipe! Shayne got me good on that one! What I can assure you is that Lizel , my sister wife, REFUSES couch based intimacy so I can't imagine what your detective device would find.  In the interest of full transparency, when I am not home I have a nagging suspicion that Winston, our dog, finds the agility to POUNCE onto the couch and try to dig a hole in the cushion (no damage as such, just a gut-hunch). I can not determine or confirm his true intentions for this imaginary cubby hole hide-away. I suspect he may be part squirrel. Seems like he is always trying to bury nuts!!!! Damn Dog! 

I do not have children, Fellow American, however I can only hope to raise my unborn daughter(s) in the same self respecting way you are. I often chuckle chuckle with my wife that I will lock them up in a dark closet in baggy sweat shirts until they are 32, at which time I will hopefully be able to sell them exclusively for livestock. You might be thinking I should part ways with them for land based property but I have a pretty dynamic bullet proof plan to acquire A LOT of property in the next 32 years and by such time I will need the livestock for tax exemptions because the carrying costs can be very burdensome--much like a promiscuous daughter (See: Music Television Channel's TEEN MOM).

Finally, I am hip to what the college students are doing these days. They are beyond random room searches, in fact they prepare for them. If you are going to do detective work at your daughter's place I highly suggest a FULL SWEEP OF THE AREA, not just on a specific piece of property. I can also connect you with Duane, who does personal security and we can put so many tracking devices on your daughter that she won't even know where she is!

Sorry for my long winded email. I hope that this helps to answer your questions. Please let me know if you would like to set up a meeting, and best wishes to you on your search for family-based purity.

Sincerely,
Your Friend.

Fellow American, 

You are getting a little aggressive and making me uncomfortable. Are you asking if the couch in my garage WHICH YOU DEFINITELY DONT WANT is for sale?

If you are asking if the couch and loveseat in my house which I posted for sale yesterday is for sale well then I dont know why you are asking if it is for sale because I posted it for sale and you responded about purchasing my couch for sale and I responded about the purchase of my couch that is for sale.

If you feel I'm aggressive, why did you post personal information?
Anyway, my apologies if I came off as aggressive. I am just hesitant with these craigslist list things. Too many people endanger themselves. My daughter was actually going to furnish her own apartment on craigslist but she's too beautiful and I know she'd wind up dead. Nobody is going to want a slightly overweight and balding man such as myself.
Anyway, my apologies for the confusion.
When could I look at the couch ?

Fellow American (Mr Gruden),

I was raised with a fear of baldness. My mother's father was bald at the age of 30. I am told that you get your hair jeans from your mothers father. I never knew him. Died in a auto wreck. Guess he never passed his jeans on because I feel as though my politician like hair is one of my few redeeming qualities. My hair cutterer is cute too.

I apologize for being redundant, but I am still confused on which couch you are referring to. Are you referring to THE COUCH IN MY GARAGE WHICH YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT, or are you referring to the couch I originally posted about on the list which Craig manages? In an earlier email, you seemed to want THE COUCH MY GARAGE WHICH YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT. Please advise so as to avoid future confusion.

Did you se the recent news story about the UCF Student that was on LSD (laxidazical super drug) and had a bad trip last week? You definitely want your daughter to stay away from him!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The local Orlando news did a story. The kid just kept yelling ""MARY JANE, MARY JANE"" while they tased him. IS YOUR DAUGHTER NAMED MARY JANE?! OH GOD. IT MAY BE TOO LATE IN REGARDS TO SEMEN.

I am glad you are protecting your daughter from the University of Central Florida and Greater Orlando Internet-Furniture-Salesman-Murderer(s). As aforementioned, I respect for fathering.

PS. ARE YOU RELATED TO THE LEGENDARY JON GRUDEN (NFL COACH) AND HIS LESS IMPRESSIVE BROTHER WHO ONCE COACHED ARENA FOOTBALL IN ORLANDO AND NOW COACHES (KIND OF) THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS (also--do you have a stance on the team name?). MEMORIBILIA?

Dear Mr. C
I guess we're on a last name basis. Feel free to call me Mike anytime though Drew.  I definitely am talking about the couch in your living room if it's clean. I am very interested, at least my daughter seemed to like the pictures. You seem to obsess over small details, like balding. I'll give you some advice. Do not wear a hat too often. I'm convinced my balding is from my yamaka, as I'm only bald in the spot in which I wear it. Regarding relations to football Grudens, no I'm not related. My doctors last name is Carr. Do you have a doctor in your family here in Florida?
Anyway, it's been nice chatting, but I'd like to get back to business.
Yes the couch in your living room.

Dear Mr Gruden but Certainly Not a Football Gruden,

Thank you for your tips on male pattern baldness and prevention. My mother at one point always talked to me that if I continued to wear a hat I would go bald but I always thought she was just nagging me. I GUESS MOM WAS RIGHT AGAIN. I do have some gray hairs though. Some people say thats a distinguished look, and I say those people have a foot in the grave. I pull the gray hairs out because I struggle with colorless objects. I feel they present negative energy. I need to stop this as I am pulling myself towards baldness with each hair (pun intended). The only doctors in our family are the ones that my BROTHER SUES FOR BIG CHECKS! BREAK YO NECK? CALL CHARLIE! #CHECKS.

I wore a yamaka once when I was a kid at Corey Hertz's bot mitzvah. I accidentally dropped a book on the floor during the service. Geez, I was so embarassed!!! That was in middle school and I ended up going to a different high school to start fresh! I am glad to hear that you are passing ON THE COUCH IN MY GARAGE WHICH YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT. I think at this point, I am not going to sell my couch to your daughter (although she does seem lovely), as I don't want some creep in my house with a semen device!!!! BECAUSE WHAT IF SOMETHING IS FOUND THAT LIZEL MY SISTER WIFE CANT EXPLAIN. I CAN NOT DEAL WITH THAT! NO SIR! NOT TODAY! 

PS. Here is a picture I found of the Gruden (NFL) Family from a historical point in time. Just in case you don't remember a distant family member. Disclaimer: I was not there when the photo was taken and I can not (unfortunately) provide accurate photographer credit.

 

Best of luck in your search for a semen free seating/nap device for your daughter. I hope you can find a couch that pulls out. I like those pull out couches as they provide options for napping and visitors. I am sorry to bother your business dealings, you contacted me first!!!!

Prayers For Your Future Son in Law.

There is a far-off place that consists of a triangular lake surrounded by land, with three kingdoms on the three sides of the lake. The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people. The second kingdom is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power, too. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.


The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it’s a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armor and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armor and a few dozen squires of their own. 
The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.


The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and make merry, partying into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and also drink late into the night.

In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.


The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hung over and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night, but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.


It just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides​.


***BONUS***: Today in class, my professor (who earned his PhD at age 30) was discussing thermodynamics and such, when he uttered the phrase, ""Cold is not dark.""",My chemistry professor e-mailed this joke to me.,26

A man is driving down the road  and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?
The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a very strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.



The man is disappointed  but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know. 


If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?


The monks reply, You must travel the earth  and tell us how many blades of grass  there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk. The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.


He says, I have traveled the earth  and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.


The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.

The monks lead the man to a wooden door  where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.


He says, Real funny. May I have the key? The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door  made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key  from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, This is the last key  to the last door.

The man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end  .

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed  to find the source of that strange sound.

But he can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.

""It's my field, the duck landed on my field. It's my duck... We can, however, do a deal. It's a tradition around these parts. How we settle things."" the farmer said before the hunter could quarrel any further.

He was hit by a truck owned by the Eversweet Company. 
In court, the Eversweet Company's hot-shot  solicitor was questioning Paddy. 
'Didn't you say to the police at the scene of the 
accident, 'I'm fine?' asked the solicitor. 
Paddy responded: 'Well, I'll tell you what 
happened. I'd just loaded my fav'rit cow, Bessie, into da... ' 


'I didn't ask for any details', the solicitor 
interrupted.  'Just answer the question. Did you not say, at 
the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine!'?' 


Paddy said, 'Well, I'd just got Bessie into da 
trailer and I was drivin' down da road..... ' 
The solicitor interrupted again and said:  'Your 
Honour, I am trying to establish the facts: at the scene of 
the accident, this man told the police on the scene that he 
was fine. Now several weeks after the accident, he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply 
answer the question. ' 


By this time, the Judge was fairly 
interested in Paddy's answer and said to the solicitor:  'I'd 
like to hear what he has to say about his favourite cow, 
Bessie'. 
Paddy thanked the Judge and proceeded:   'Well as I 
was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my fav'rit cow, into de 
trailer and was drivin' her down de road when this huge 
Eversweet truck and trailer came tundering tru a stop sign 
and hit me trailer right in da side. I was trown into one 
ditch and Bessie was trown into da udder. By Jaysus I was hurt, very bad like, and didn't want to move. However, I could hear old 
Bessie moanin' and groanin'. I knew she was in terrible pain just by her groans. 
Shortly after da accident, a policeman on a motorbike turned up. He could hear Bessie moanin' and groanin' too, so he went over to her. After he looked at her, and saw her condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. 
Den da policeman came across de road, gun still in 
hand, looked at me, and said, 'How are you feelin'?' 


'Now wot da fock would you say?'

They're missing one of their regulars when they notice the new female attending and decide to invite her to join them.
They tell her 7am tee off. She agrees but informs them she may be 15 minutes late.

Friday rolls round and the Doctors turn up and the female attending is actually first one there.
She tees off first, left handed which the doctor's comment on because rest of them are right handed.

As the game goes on it turns out she actually quite good, hitting par on most holes and ends up winning with 3 under par.

The Doctors are stunned and they demand she join them again the following week so they can redeem themselves.
She agrees but informs them she may be 15 minutes late again.

So 1 week goes by and the Doctors turn up at 7am and once again shes there first all ready to go.
The female Doctor tees of first again this time right handed. The other doctors didn't really question it, just assuming she was ambidextrous and were more worried that they she might be better with her right hand.

She goes on to win again this time doing even better 4 under par. The male doctors are now getting quite competitive and they insist that she joins them again for the next game. She says yes but once again she might be 15 minutes late.

The next week rolls and the doctors turn up expecting her to be there again but this times shes 15 minutes late. The female doctor apologizes and gets on with the game. She plays with her right hand and doesn't do quite as good but still beats the male Doctors.

After the game the Doctors have to find out whats going on.

Male Doctor: ""whats with the use of both hands?""

Female Doctor: ""when I was young my actually taught me how to use both hands so I could use any set of clubs.""

Male Doctor: ""so how do you know which hand you are going to use that day?""

Female Doctor: ""Well, when I wake up a peek under the covers and look to see which way my husbands penis is laying. If its to the left, I'll play left handed, to the right and I'll play right handed. I've been doing it since I married him and its never let me down.

Male Doctor: ""and what if its pointing up?""

Female Doctor replies ""that's when I'm 15 minutes late"".

The receptionist tells him there is a one hour wait, so he sits down in the waiting area and starts looking around sheepishly and wondering whether his minor problem is worth such a wait for a diagnosis.

In the corner of the room he notices a machine that says ""place urine sample here for diagnosis"". Curious, the man walks over. The instructions on the machine say to place a urine sample in a recess in the machine, and it will near-instantly provide a 100% accurate diagnosis of any medical problems. The man thinks to himself ""What's the worst that can happen? it's just a sore elbow"", so takes a cup into the toilets and gets a sample ready. He puts it in the machine, and presses the button. The machine whirrs for a second then spits out a short receipt. The man holds it up to his face.

YOU HAVE TENNIS ELBOW.
REST THE ELBOW AND USE ICE TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION

The man is impressed, but now decides he wants to try and trick the machine.

He returns home, and gets urine samples from his cat, dog, wife and daughter. For good measure, he gets some motor oil from his car, and finally, masturbates into the cup as well.

He takes the cup of foul mixture back to the doctor's surgery and places it in the machine before pressing the button.

The machine makes R2-D2 noises for what feels like minutes, then finally spits out a long receipt.

YOUR CAT IS FINE
YOUR DOG IS FINE
YOUR WIFE HAS HERPES
YOUR DAUGHTER IS PREGNANT
YOUR ENGINE IS GOING TO BREAK

               One Testicle

There once was an Indian who had only one testicle
And whose given name was 'Onestone'.
He hated that name and asked everyone not to call him Onestone.

After years and years of torment,
Onestone finally cracked and said,'
If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!'
The word got around and nobody called him that any more.

Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird forgot and said,
'Good morning, Onestone.'
He jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night. He made love to her all the next day,
Until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.

The word got around that Onestone meant what he promised he would do.
Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until
A woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away.
Yellow Bird , who was Blue Bird's cousin,

Was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.
She hugged him and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.'
Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest,
Then he made love to her all day, Made love to her all night,
Made love to her all the next day,
Made love to her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!
Why ???

Everyone knows..
You can't kill Two Birds
With OneStone !!!

Timmy asked innocently ""Daddy what does shit mean? His father unprepared exclaimed quickly ""It uhhh means shaving cream."" Timmy yet again believed this and walked down to the kitchen.
His mother was busy cutting the turkey when he came down, she then accidentally cut her finger. ""FUCK"" she exclaimed, grasping her bleeding finger. Timmy not noticing the blood of course asked innocently, ""Mommy what does fuck mean?"" His mother surprised he was there quickly said ""It means cutting the turkey dear""
Suddenly the doorbell rang

Timmy quickly exclaimed ""Ill get it""
he ran to the door and opened the door seeing his family.
wanting to be polite he said

You may get back into Heaven, if you can beat my only son in a programming contest.""

Satan and Jesus meet to agree to the terms. The contest is a simple one. God will set a timer for six hours, and both Jesus and Satan will sit down at their desktops and pound out as much perfectly-formatted HTML as they possibly can. The contest is officially scheduled for Easter Sunday, and news spreads far and wide. 

Easter Sunday rolls around. People from all over flock to Heaven to witness the contest. It is broadcasted live on several news stations, and is even live-tweeted by some representatives from Google. At exactly 8:59 AM, Satan and Jesus both sit down at two computers, facing each other. They log in and open up their scripting program. At 9 AM, Archangel Michael drops a flag and the race begins. 

One hour, and several cups of coffee, pass. Both Satan and Jesus are going strong. Satan is adamant that he will beat Jesus and get back into Heaven, while Jesus just really enjoys coding (it's a hobby of his). The official line count is read off every hour, and at 10 AM, Satan is slightly ahead. 

By 11 AM, Jesus has caught up to Satan, because Satan found an error and had to rewrite several pages of code. He is slightly annoyed, but still determined to beat Jesus. 

By noon, Satan and Jesus have caught up again, as Jesus decided to reformat a large section of his work to make it more streamlined and perfectly formatted, as per the contest rules. Satan is starting to get cocky, showing off to the crowd by typing with his barbed tail, typing with his eyes shut, typing with his trident, et cetera. The crowd oohs and ahhs appropriately. 

At 1 PM, they both stop for some lunch. Satan decides to trick Jesus into taking a longer lunch break, so he gives Jesus five loaves of bread and three fishes. Jesus breaks off pieces to feed himself, but simply cannot finish his meal. With Satan getting ahead of him, he passes off the meal to the group of 5,000 men gathered around him. They are all fed, with leftovers. Jesus continues programming. 

By 2 PM, both Satan and Jesus are getting rather dehydrated, so they stop for a water break. To get even for the loaves and fishes trick earlier, Jesus pours Satan some water, but secretly turns it into wine. If Satan is drunk, his coding can't be perfectly formatted. 

2:59 rolls around. Satan has typed 5,638 lines of code, while Jesus has only typed 5,277. The crowd is tense as they race towards the finish line. Suddenly, God steps in, pulls the plugs on both computers, and loudly announces ""JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH WINS! SATAN WILL NOT RE-ENTER HEAVEN!"" 

Satan is furious. ""How can this be?"" He asks. ""I had far more lines of code than Jesus! My code was perfectly formatted, too!""

Jesus taunts Satan. ""Well I don't see your code, Satan. It must have been lost when the computers were shut off.""

""Your computer was shut off, too!"" Satan retorts. ""I guess neither of us win!"" 

God, rather proud of his son at this point, walks over and turns back on both computers. Predictably, Satan's coding cannot be found, but when Jesus's computer is booted back up, his program is right there on the desktop. God opens it, and it runs like a charm. 

""How can this be?"" Satan snarls. ""I finished more coding! It should be there! I should've won this!"" 

""Satan, my friend,"" God says, ""You have made a grave mistake. See, you may code faster, and perhaps even better than my son, but Jesus... 

Jesus saves."" ",So Satan decides one day he wants to get back into Heaven...,1

""I still don't get it"" responded the Little Johnny. ""Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,"" said the dad. ""Okay then...good night"" said Little Jonny went off to bed.  In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying.  He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper.  So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help.  When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep.  Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, buthis dad wasn't there.  So he went to the maid's room.  When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid.  Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud,  ""OH!! Now I understand the government! The President is screwing the work force, Congress is fast asleep, nobody cares about the people, and the future is full of shit!""",What is government? asked little Johnny from his father.,29

post,335i9f,2qh72,jokes,false,1429470754,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/335i9f/nerd_season/,self.jokes,,"A truck driver hauling a tractor trailer filled with computers stops for a beer. As he approaches the bar, he sees a big sign on the door reading, 

“Nerds Not Allowed — Enter at Your Own Risk.”

He enters the bar and sits down. The bartender comes over to him, sniffs him, says he smells kind of nerdy, and asks him what he does for a living. 

The truck driver says he drives a truck, and the smell is just from the computers he is hauling. The bartender says okay, truck drivers are not nerds, 

and serves him a beer.

As he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in with tape around his glasses, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils, and a belt at 

least a foot too long. The bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away.

The truck driver asks him why he did that. The bartender said not to worry, the nerds are overpopulating the Silicon Valley, and now they are in 

season.

“You don’t even need a license,” he said.

So the truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, and heads back onto the freeway. Suddenly, he veers to avoid an accident, and the load 

shifts. The back door breaks open and computers spill out all over the freeway. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming, grabbing up the 

computers. They are all engineers, accountants, and programmers wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen. He can’t let them steal his whole 

load. Remembering what had happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, felling several of them instantly.

A highway patrol officer comes zooming up and jumps out of the car screaming at him to stop.

The truck driver says, “What’s wrong? I thought nerds were in season.”

“Well, sure,” says the patrolman, “but you can’t bait ‘em.”",Nerd Season,30

The couple found themselves sitting outside, waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. While waiting, they begin to wonder: could they possibly become married in Heaven? When St. Peter showed up, they asked him.
St. Peter said, 'I don't know. Nobody asked this before. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.
The couple sat and waited, and waited. Six months had passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.
'Yes,' he informs the couple while wiping the sweat off his brow, 'you can get married in Heaven.'
'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'
St. Peter, now purple-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.
'OH, COME ON!', St. Peter shouted, 'It took me all this time to find a priest up here! Do you have any idea how long it'll take me to find a lawyer?'",Getting married in heaven,24
