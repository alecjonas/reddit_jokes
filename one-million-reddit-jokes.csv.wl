As it happened, he got away with this for some time, but eventually the local church decided to do a big restoration job on the outside of one of their biggest buildings.

Smokey put in a bid and, because his price was so low, he got the job.  

So he set about erecting the scaffolding and  setting up the planks,
and buying the paint and yes, I am sorry to say, thinning it down with turpentine...  

Well, Smokey was up on the scaffolding, painting away, the job nearly completed, when suddenly there was a horrendous clap of thunder, the sky opened and the rain poured down washing the thinned paint from all over the church and knocking Smokey clear off the scaffold to land on the lawn among the gravestones, surrounded by telltale puddles of the thinned paint.
 
Smokey was no fool. He knew this was a judgment from the Almighty, so he got down on his knees and cried:

""Oh God, Oh God, forgive me; what should I do?""  

And from the thunder, a mighty voice spoke.

There was this man named Tim and Tim comes from a long line of train conductors. His father was a train conductor and so was his father before him. But as Tim grew up he realized that was not his passion but the pressure from his family to follow in his fathers footsteps was too great, so after Tim graduated high school he enrolled in training in hopes to be hired at a train station. After a few years of going through this training school and failing many attempts, Tim finally passed and got his credentials. He was hired right off the bat at a successful train station as a train conductor. Of course since Tim was so bad at his job he did not do very well. The first train he is on crashes and kills 19 people due to his incompetence. He was fired and charges were brought up against him. Tim, living in like Russia or somewhere, was sentenced to death the next day. But before they kill him, they asked what he wanted from his last meal. Since Tim obviously did not want to die this way he thought of a clever way to stall his execution by asking for an outrageous last meal. He asked for a specific ancient chinese rice recipe only obtainable from a vendor in China, sacred beef from a cow in India, and a blue apple from Nigeria. The Russian government, although upset about it, jumped on this list as fast as they could because they really wanted to execute this guy that killed 19 people! So the Russian diplomats went off to China and found a very old Chinese man and asked for his family’s ancient chinese rice recipe, and of course the Chinese man would never give it up to these foreigners and he was even offended by their asking for it and felt it would bring shame to his family. The Russian diplomats offered the Chinese man $5,000 and he immediately accepted the offer. Then the Russian diplomats went off to India to grab some sacred beef from a cow. The Hindus are disgusted that they want to kill one of their sacred cows to give to a criminal and they want to imprison the Russian trespassers, but then the Russians offered them $5,000 as well, and they accepted it immediately too. Now finally the Russians are off to Nigeria for the blue apple and the same deal happens. The Russians want Tim dead so bad that they offered the same deal to the Nigerians, $5000 for the blue apple. They accept and now the Russians are off back to the prison to kill Tim, he eats his last meal as slow as he could and when he finished they hooked up to the chair. They pull the lever and shock him, but Tim doesn’t die. The Russians are confused and they believe its an act of God so they release him. Now that Tim is out of prison he needs to get a job and since he really only knows how to be in one line of work, he goes back to get a job at another train station and a train conductor. Tim is a creature of repetition and so on his first train, it crashes again and killed 36 people this time due to his mistakes. The Russian government seriously wants this guy dead so they put him back onto death row and ask him what he wanted to his 2nd last meal. Tim still didn’t want to die so he asked for the same meal again! Although reluctant the Russian diplomats are off again and start by going to China and see the old man again, but to their surprise he wasn’t there, and in his place was a significantly younger Chinese man. The Russians approach him and asked where was the old man. The rice vendor informs them that was his father that passed away after he sold them his rice and now he is in charge of his shop. The Russians ask him if they can have some of the rice for their prisoner and the young chinese man curses them out saying that they are the reason his father died and he would never give them his rice. The Russians offer him $10,000 and he accepted it without thought. Now onto the quest for beef. The Russians go back to India and asked the Monks to give them more beef. When asked, the Monks tell the Russians that they made the Gods very angry at them so this time they would have to do a sacred dancing ritual to honor and sacrifice the cow. After days of learning the dance and meditating the Russians leave with their beef and go on back to Nigeria. This time they did not want to offer any money to the Nigerians so the Russians simply stole the apple. They brought all the supplies back to the prison in Russia and gave them to Tim. He eats and enjoys then is put back into the chair. The Russians being afraid of another act from God shock him anyways and sure enough the shock to his head doesn’t kill him so they release him. Now Tim is out and is unemployed because no one will hire this idiot, but his father was able to convince his boss to hire him as another train conductor. Of course his first train crashes again and killed 59 people! Tim is now used to being on death row tries to think of another last meal he can request to stall for even longer. He asked again for the rice and the beef, but instead of the blue apple, he wants a giant mango from Australia. The Russian Diplomats are off once more, but this time they aren’t dealing with shit. They go to China and murdered the vendor and stole the rice. They go to India and murdered all the Monks and stole the cows. They go to Australia and shake down a giant mango that crushes and kills their outback guide. They hurry back to the prison shove the food down Tim’s throat and strap him to the chair. The Russians highly doubt that the third time will go wrong. They pull the lever and nothing happens! They pull it twice! Three times! Nothing! They finally ask Tim, “WHY WON’T YOU DIE?!”, Tim has a puzzled look on his face and responds, “I do not know.. I guess I’m just a bad conductor”. ",Tim The Train Expert,2

A pregnant woman goes to a bank to collect the money for the ultrasound she is gonna have soon, when all of the sudden the bank gets robbed. 3 armed guys run into the bank shouting everyone to get down. The woman, being pregnant, can't get down that easy. One of the armed guys panics and thinks she is resisting, so he shoots her and hits her multiple times in her belly. Thankfully, the woman survives, and she gets rushed to the hospital. After everything seems fine, the doctors decide she should have her ultrasound. The doctor see's that she is gonna give birth to 3 children 2 girls and 1 boy, BUT, they all have been hit by a bullet. However, the doctor thinks that it'll be fine and at some point of their lives, the bullets will come out.
So, a few years later, one of the girls comes crying to her mother ""Mommy, I just peed and when I wanted to flush the toilet, there was a bullet in the water"" so her mom calms her down and explains the Bank robbery story. After this the girl is calmed down but still a bit worried. A few weeks later, the other girl comes running and crying to her mom. Before she can even speak, her mom says ""let me guess, you went to the toilet and found a bullet?"" ""yes mommy, how do you know?"" and to her, the mom too explains the armed robbery story. But then a few months later the boy comes crying to his mom, so before he can speak she says ""let me guess, you were doing some business in the toilet when there was a bullet inside of it?"" ""NO"" the boy replies, ""I was jerking off and all of the sudden I shot our dog""

The scholar says, ""The rules are simple, we both will communicate each other without using words. Once one person cannot interpret the other, he loses.""

The two met in face to face while others watch.

The scholar says, ""I'll start.""

He raises 1 finger in front of the drunkard's face. The drunkard retaliates by raising two fingers (like a peace sign). 

The scholar raises a fist in front of the drunkard's face. The drunkard raises a fist and put his other palm under the elbow, whilst shaking the fist.

The scholar gives him an 'ok' sign (creating a circle with index finger and thumb). The drunkard put his palms together like a prayer and raises it in the air while letting the palms separate.

The scholar looks at him confused not knowing what to do. After muttering ""Whaaaat? What?"" under his breath, he turns to everyone and says, I admit defeat. And slowly turn to walk away.

The villagers ran to the scholar saying, ""What happened? What happened? What did he say to you?""

The scholar replied, ""I started by saying Unity"" and he said, ""Diversity"". Then I said, ""Power"". And he said, ""Absolute POWER"". Then I said, ""World Domniation. An.. and... I don't know. I don't know what he meant by that."" Saddened and ashamed he walked away.

All the villagers now ran to the drunkard asking, ""What happened? You won. What did he say to you?""

The drunkard says, ""I don't know man. This fucking queer comes to me and tell me that he wants to stick ONE finger up my ass. Hell no, I told him I'm gonna stick TWO fingers up his ass.

The barkeeper says ""If you put 5 dollar in the jar, I will give you three challenges, if you complete all three challenges you will get the entire jar!"". The man is a bit courageous so he puts 5 dollars in the jar. The barkeeper says ""great, these are the three challenges; first you have to chug this entire bottle of wodka, if you move a muscle  or can't keep it in you lose. If you've done that, you've to pull a tooth from a big bulldog with a toothache outside. And your last challenge is to have sex with the old lady upstairs. She is old and has never had sex in her entire life so you have to give her that pleasure."" 

So the man takes the bottle of wodka and chugs the entire bottle as if it's water. After that the man is pretty drunk and stumbles outside to the bulldog.

To rectify this problem the Japanese company bought a X-ray scanner from the US for $60,000 to check on the assembly line whether the container contained soap and wasn't empty.
A similar problem happened at Nirma soaps, in Ahmedabad in INDIA.. Guess what they did????
They bought a bajaj fan costing around Rs.1500/- and placed it on the edge of the assembly line.

Two good friends, Jerry and Ralph, were out walking in the desert one day when Jerry goes off behind a cactus to take a leak.  While he's draining his bladder a snake leaps up and bites him on the end of his dick.  Ralph on hearing Jerry's scream runs over and says, ""What happened?""  
Jerry, who's starting to feel some numbness creeping up along his member explains that a snake bit him on the end of his dick. 
""What kind of snake?"", Ralph inquires.  
""I don't know, spotted ... with flecks of orange, red on it .... fuck, does it matter? Just call a doctor and hurry.  I feel like shit.""  
So Ralph moves off and pulls out his cell and calls his doctor explaining the situation.  
The doctor asks, ""Did you get a good look at the snake?""  
Ralph repeats what Jerry said to which the doctor replied, ""Oh my, that's a very poisonous snake.  You have to get the venom out as quickly as possible or your friend will die.""  
""How do I do that?"" asked Ralph.
""You're going to have to suck it out with your mouth"", the doctor instructed.
""Okay, okay.  Thanks Doc"", Ralph responds as he quickly hangs up and runs over to his friend Jerry.
Jerry has deteriorated quite a bit by now and is starting to sweat and shake uncontrollably.  He sees Ralph running up and in a weakened, anxious voice asks ""So?  What did the doctor say?""

Ralph looks at his friend and replies ""He said you're gonna die.""

post,31rrh3,2qh72,jokes,false,1428428090,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/31rrh3/a_conductor_on_a_train/,self.jokes,,"There once was this guy who worked for the Railroad as a conductor. Let's say his name was Joe. Well, Joe was walking through the train, en route, collecting tickets from the passengers. He comes to car 12, booth 3. In it was a man.

So, he asked him for his ticket: ""Excuse me sir, do have your ticket?""

""Oh, I am soooo sorry, I dropped it out the window by accident,"" he replied.

""Sorry sir, can't have any passengers without tickets."" He grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and threw him out of the train. Well, he landed on the tracks and was run over by the train. Naturally, the conductor was arrested and thrown in jail. He was convicted of murder before a jury of his peers, and sentenced to death by electrocution.

The day of his execution came up, and he was asked what he would like for his last meal. He asks for a banana. They gave it to him, he ate it, received his last rites, and was escorted to the chair. The executioner strapped him in, hooked everything up. Last, he threw the big switch once, and nothing happened. So, he did it again, and nothing happened. Well, by law the guy was legally dead, so they had to release him.

Oddly enough, the guy got a job on another railroad, as a conductor! One day, he was gathering tickets, and came to a booth with a little boy.

""Young man, do you have your ticket?"", asked the conductor.

""A-a-a, I'm sorry, I ate it by mistake.."", said the little boy.

And.. the same thing happened -- the boy was thrown off the train and killed. The guy was arrested, sentenced to death by electrocution. It came to him last day. The death row guard asked him what he would like for his meal. He asked for banana again. He ate it, and a priest gave him last rites.

He was escorted to the death chamber. This time, though, they were smart.

They washed his hands to get rid of any banana slime, they washed up the chair. Next, they placed him the chair, and hooked him up. The switch-puller pulled the switch once, and nothing happened. The switch-puller pulled the switch twice, and nothing happened, not even a single hair raising on the guy's chest.

Well, as the law says, they had to let him go...

Even more amazingly, he got a job on yet another railroad.

This time it was a rabbi. Same old stuff. Rabbi had no ticket (he forgot to buy it). Guy threw him off the train, rabbi died. Guy was arrested, convicted, sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the guard asked him what he would like for a last meal, he asked for a banana. He ate it, received last rites, and was escorted to the chamber.

However, this time the officials where going to get it right! They scrubbed his body with a brillo pad. They scrubbed the chair with steel wool. They tried the chair on a few other prisoners...

Okay, they strapped him in, and threw the switch once, nothing happened. Threw the switch a second time, nothing happened. At this point the guy was legally dead, etc, etc.

But, before the guy could leave, the executioner, extremely frustrated (he'd seen this same guy three times already). asked, ""What is it with the banana!""

The guy replied, ""I just like bananas.""

So, the executioner screamed, ""THEN HOW COME YOU DON'T DIE!!!!!""

""I dunno,"" replied the guy, ""I guess I'm just not a very good conductor.""

The first lost salesman manages to find a farm. He goes to the door and knocks. An old farmer answers it.

""What do yer want?"" He question the salesman.

""Oh please sir, I'm lost and I need a place to stay the night. Please can you let me in?""

""I won't let yer in, but yer can stay in the barn."" The farmer replied, leading him down to the barn. He opened the barn door and let the sales man in. ""If I catch yer anywhere near my daughter, yer gonna regret it.""

A little while later, the second travelling salesman, also lost, ends up at the same farm. He knocks on the door and the farmer lets the second salesman stay in barn, once again reminding both salesmen of the deal they have about staying away from the daughter.

A little while later, well into the night, the third travelling salesman ends up at the same farm, and gets the same treatment as the other two salesmen.

Sometime in the night, the farmers daughter, seeing all the young, good looking salesmen, decides to go down to the barn to ""entertain them"".

The farmer, hearing thumping and moans coming from the barn, grabs his shotgun and heads down to the barn. He throws open the door.

""WHAT ARE YER DOIN'""? He screamed at all three of salesmen. He pointed his shotgun at the salesmen. ""Get out ter that field, and bring me a fruit."" The farmer stood outside the barn as the three travelling salesmen ran off to field to grab a fruit.

The first salesman returns to the farmer with a grape. The farmer points his gun at the salesman. ""Considering yer got yer pants down, stick that grape up yer ass while keeping a straight face, if yer don't, I'll shoot yeh.""

The salesman prepares himself and, easily, shoves the grape up his ass without wincing, smiling, or crying. The first salesman manages to escape.

The second travelling salesman returns with a strawberry. The farmer tells him the same things, but just before the salesman is about to shove it up, he burst out laughing.

""WHATS SO FUNNY?"" The farmer asks angrily.

post,31r7p1,2qh72,jokes,false,1428419613,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/31r7p1/12_inch_pianist/,self.jokes,,"So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can’t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there’s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.

So the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”

And the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”

So the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.

So the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”

And the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

So the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”

And the guy’s, like, “World peace.”

So the bartender is understandably ashamed.

And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.

And the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”

And the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”

But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”

And the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”

And the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”

And the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”

So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.

And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”

And the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”

And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”

And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”

And then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”

And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!

And the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”

And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”

And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”

And the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.

And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.

And the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”

And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”

And the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”",12 Inch Pianist,0

Without replying the man slowly reaches over and grabs the brown bag. Opening it, he pulls out a tiny piano. To the bartender’s surprise he reaches back in and pulls out a tiny man, who couldn’t be standing more than a foot tall, dressed in a full tuxedo. The tiny man walks up to the piano, pulls out the piano bench and carefully sits down. He then continues to play some of the most beautiful soothing music the bartender has ever heard.

“Where on earth did you get this little man?!”

“Oh I have a genie.”

The bartender can barely contain his excitement, “You do? Can I see it?”

“Of course, of course,” says the man pulling out an ornately decorated lamp.

The bartender takes the lamp and rubs it and out pops a genie.

“You have summoned me. What is your one wish sir?”

“I want a million bucks!” The bartender shouts.

Immediately the room begins to fill up with ducks. Feathers are flying everywhere, the other patrons begin screaming and running for the doors.

As the ducks continue to appear out of thin air, the bartender looks frantically at the man with the brown bag who has a sly smile on his face.

A woman gives birth but doesn't get to see the baby straight away. Don't ask me why, it's just the way the joke is.

So once she feels better, like any mother, she's eager to go see her baby.

She notifies the doctor. 

'Doctor! I'd like to see my baby!'

okay ma'am, come this way.

He's signals for her to follow

They approach the first room, a perfectly healthy baby.

'Doctor, is this my baby, she excitedly asks'

The Doctor replies, no this is not your baby, your baby is worse than this.

Oh, she says.

They approach the next room, this baby has no legs.

'Doctor... is this my baby?'

no, no.. this is not your baby, your baby is worse than this.

She's a bit like wtf? But okay...

They get to the next room.

This baby has no arms and no legs, just a torso with a head

'Doctor! Is this my baby?!'

ah, no this is not your baby, your baby is worse than this.

Baffled, the woman continues to the next room.

They approach the room and the lady looks in, this baby is just the head.

'DOCTOR! Is this MY baby?!!'


No. no I'm afraid your baby is worse than this.

Unable to believe what she hears, they continue to the next room.

This time, they peer into the room, and it's just a ear, a baby ear.

Mentally exhausted at this point, the lady says.

'doctor... is this my baby?'

The doctor replies.

'Yes, and as if luck would have it, the fucker is deaf too.'

Not a peep.

""Now, comrades: who sneezed?"" Absolute silence. ""Third row! Stand up! Guards! Op....""

""Wait! Wait!"" From the sixth row a man rises, shaking so hard with fear that he can barely stay on his legs. ""Please! Comrade Stalin! It was me. I sneezed.""

Stalin fixes his eye on the wretch. The entire audience watches, paralysed.

post,31oykr,2qh72,jokes,false,1428366901,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/31oykr/calculus_class/,self.jokes,,"So in my calculus class last year in math, there were these two Chinese twins. Ving, and Ling. Ving was always super cool with me. In exchange for answers (he was super smart) I would hang out with him and be his friend and stuff. After I cheated off of him and studied with him though, I did get to be his friend and we got very close. His sister, Ling, was always uptight about school and she made sure to study, she got stressed about a B, etc. One day I was hanging out with Ving, and we started talking about names. He went off on this huge rant about how he hated his, and how he wanted to change it to something more Asian-American, like Lee. I told him that the Courthouse downtown had a form that you could fill to legally change it. He told me:

""I always give you answers. If you could just drive me down to the courthouse this one time, I will never forget you. I just hate this god-forsaken Chinese name and I want to get rid of it forever."" He seemed pretty adamant about it, so I decided the best decision would be to take him. We walked out to my car, and right as I put the keys in the ignition Ling came running and tapped on the car door like a madman. I rolled it down and she started freaking out about how Ving's name had been passed down through generations and generations, but Ving didn't care. He just wanted to go down to the Courthouse and get it over with. Ling figured that coming with would be the best idea, so if anything else came up that she would be needed for, she would be there for Ving. Honestly, I felt stuck in the middle of a family feud, so I just took her along.

When we got to the Courthouse, Ving confidently walked up to the front desk and asked the receptionist if he could change his name. She gave him a little packet of paper and told him to sit down. Ling and I waited patiently while Ving filled out his info. I was watching him fill it out and I noticed he really did want to change his name to Lee. Before he finished, though, he started tearing up. He told me he couldn't change his name. He asked the lady at the front that he couldn't do it, and she told him he would need twenty dollars to cancel the request. Ling was so relieved and happy that he changed his mind, she dug through her purse, found the money, and started to hand it to the receptionist.

It was at this moment that the most stereotypical Asian man burst through the doors. He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, a visor, American flag shorts, flip flops, everything. This little guy was decked out.

When Ving and his old man saw each other, they both started bawling, and embraced each other. Out of his tears, Ving said

""Dad, I love my name. I want to be Ving forever, and I'm going to name my kids Ving, and they're going to name their kids Ving, and-""

And the old man said ""Dont, stop. Be Lee, Ving! Hold onto that fee, Ling.""",Calculus Class,202

""God!"" Mr. Jones cried out as he was stuck again with the hatpin.

""Right again,"" said the minister, smiling. Before long, Mr. Jones again winked off. However, this time the minister did not notice. As he picked up the tempo of his sermon, he made a few motions that Mrs. Jones mistook as signals to bayonet her husband with the hatpin again.

post,31ocag,2qh72,jokes,false,1428356516,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/31ocag/guy_walks_into_a_bar/,self.jokes,," a guy walks into a bar one day and he can’t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there’s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.

So the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”

And the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”

So the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.

So the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”

And the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

So the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”

And the guy’s, like, “World peace.”

So the bartender is understandably ashamed.

And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.

And the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”

And the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”

But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”

And the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”

And the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”

And the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”

So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.

And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”

And the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”

And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”

And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”

And then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”

And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!

And the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”

And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”

And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”

And the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.

And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.

And the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”

And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”

And the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”

And he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.

And suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.

And the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”

And the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”

And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”

And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.

So the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.

So the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”

And the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.

And the guy’s, like, “Well done.”

And then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.”

And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.

And the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”

And the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.”

An American tourist goes on a trip to China. While in China, he is very sexually promiscuous and does not use a condom all the time.

A week after arriving back home in the States, he awakes one morning to find his penis covered with bright green and purple spots. Horrified, he immediately goes to see a doctor. The doctor, never having seen anything like this before, orders some tests and tells the man to return in two days for the results.

The man returns a couple of days later and the doctor says: “I’ve got bad news for you. You’ve contracted Mongolian VD. It’s very rare and almost unheard of here. We know very little about it.”

The man looks a little perplexed and says: “Well, give me a shot or something and fix me up, doc.”

The doctor answers: “I’m sorry, there’s no known cure. We’re going to have to amputate your penis.”

The man screams in horror, “Absolutely not! I want a second opinion!”

The doctor replies: “Well, it’s your choice. Go ahead if you want, but surgery is your only choice.”

The next day, the man seeks out a Chinese doctor, figuring that he’ll know more about the disease.

The Chinese doctor examines his penis and proclaims: “Ah, yes, Mongolian VD. Velly lare disease.”

The guy says to the doctor: “Yeah, yeah, I already know that, but what we can do? My American doctor wants to operate and amputate my penis!”

The Chinese doctor shakes his head and laughs: “Stupid Amelican docta, always want to opelate. Make more money, that way. No need to opelate!”

“Oh, Thank God!,” the man replies.

“Yes,” says the Chinese doctor, “you no worry! Wait two weeks... it fall off by itself!”",Mongolian VD,4

""I'm a great gambler, and I can prove it,"" says Grandpa. ""How about a demonstration?""

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he ends up urinating all over the auditor's desk.

None has ever been to the spot they're camping in, but a friend has told them all about it and given them directions from the campsite to the nearby privy.

They arrive at twilight and make camp. After exchanging tales of social justice for a few hours and burning men in effigy over a roaring campfire, one of them heads off to use the privy.

When she arrives, she is shocked.  She had expected a cozy little outhouse, perhaps with a quarter moon carved into the door.  What she finds instead is nothing more than a hole in the ground, and to add insult to injury there's a huge boulder covering it.  Worse yet, it's perched precariously on a narrow ledge overlooking a thousand-foot drop. But duty calls, so she grabs a nearby stick and begins to lever the boulder out of the way.

Back at camp, the other two hear nature calling at the same time. They begin arguing about who needs to use the privy worse when one simply takes off running. The other follows, hot on her heels, and the two begin shouting angrily at one another as they race toward it.

After a lot of hard work, the original girl sits down to do her business. Just as a smile of pure enjoyment etches itself across her face, she hears her friends' approaching screams punctuated by fast, thunderous footfalls and snapping branches. Before long, they burst out of the forest and onto the narrow ledge and, unable to stop in time, knock the poor girl straight off the cliff.

Moral of the story: Privy-ledge only seems great when you need it but don't have it. Once you have it, you realize it isn't all it's cracked up to be. You realize that to benefit from it, you have to actually put in some work. And the next people that come along fighting for it might just kill you.",3 feminists go camping,0

University research psychologists decided not to use white rats in experiments anymore. They opted to use lawyers instead.
First, they're much more plentiful - you can get lawyers anywhere.
Second, sometimes experimenters get a little bit too attached to their white rates and if something nasty happens to them you feel bad. With lawyers you don't have that problem.
Third, they're found out there are some things that white rats just won't do.

But the latest development is they're stopped using lawyers. They're back to using white rats again. The reason is simple. They weren't into it very long before they found out that lawyers aren't very close to human beings.",The lawyer test subject,2

I grant you the gift of life ~ albeit as a limited offer. You have 30 minutes to do whatever your hearts desire.""

And with that command, the two statues came to life. They smiled at each other, slowly moved their limbs about in wonderment, looked all around and then at their own bodies and finally back at each other. Still smiling they then ran to the nearby woods and dived behind a large bush.

The angel smiled to herself as she listened to the giggling, bushes rustling and twigs snapping. After fifteen minutes, the two statues emerged from the bushes, looking extremely satisfied and wearing nothing but even bigger smiles than before.

Puzzled, the angel looked at her watch and said to them, ""You still have fifteen minutes. Wouldn't you like to continue?""

The male statue looked at the female and asked, ""Do you want to do it again?""

""Oh, Yes!"", the female statue replied. ""But this time YOU hold the pigeon down and 'I'll crap on it's head!"" ",The two statues,98

In three months, the man was back at his dentist. The dentist looked in his mouth, and the plate he had just put in was so deteriorated it was beyond repair.

But again in about three months the patient was back, and the stainless steel plate was corroded and failing.

This time he had the plate made with titanium, but once more it only lasted a matter of months before deteriorating beyond repair.

Totally baffled, he sent the patient to a dental professor known to be an expert in the construction of dental plates to see if he could solve this puzzle.

The professor examined his mouth and quizzed the man about his dental hygiene and diet. ""There must be something very acidic that you eat a lot of."" The dentist said.

""To tell the truth,"" the man replied, ""My wife makes the absolute best hollandaise sauce in the world. I put it on everything.""

He tells them that the tribe was a cannibal tribe and that he was about to let the tribe eat the four men alive.

One of the men pleaded if there was any way that they would go free.

The elder pondered for a while and said:

""There is a way. Our tribe's rules state that any prisoners shall be set free if they complete 'the trial'""

""Follow me.""

The men were led to a massive orchard. The elder then told them:

""The first step is to choose a fruit. Then pick ten of them from this orchard.""

Three of the men returned with the fruits. The fourth one was running late. The elder decided to continue without him.

""The second step is to push all 10 of the fruits you picked up your asses without laughing, crying, or screaming. If you do, you'll be eaten.""


The first man had apples.

They were enormous apples and he barely got one in before he groaned in pain. He was eaten then and there.

The fourth man returned and he was told of the next step and the trial continued.

The second man had cherries. He got 2 in and he laughed and got eaten.

The third man picked grapes. He got 9 of them in and for some reason, he too laughed and got eaten.


The three men met in the afterlife.

Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to play with his unit.

post,31idfa,2qh72,jokes,false,1428231308,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/31idfa/a_cannibalistic_protest_text/,self.jokes,,"No one seems to understand why kids have been shooting up school. I think even the kids that do it couldn't tell you afterward in a way that makes any sort of sense. If you think it’s utterly senseless then you were either brainwashed or you've chosen to forget.

It’s not about killing classmates and teachers because you hate them, to put what school shootings is into a single phrase they are a ‘cannibalistic protest.’ How do I know this? Because I experienced many dimensions of hating school. In elementary I was a nerd who was respected and I didn't get picked on, I still hated school. In middle school I grew into a cool kid who girls liked with a lot of friends I was in advanced classes and I still hated school. In high-school I moved to a new city for 9th grade, I was awkward, I didn't know anyone and I didn't want to make friends; I was a loser who used to be a winner and guess what, I still hated school. I moved back home and the rest of high-school I was a pot-head and guess what? I kinda started to like school, maybe it was the pot maybe it was maturity….

So what does the ‘cannibalistic protest’ hope to accomplish?? It’s domestic terrorism pure and simple… But also like the subject of this essay it’s not so simple and it is another phrase that needs defining. Everyone knows what terrorism is but what inspires terrorism is a lot different. And then there’s the domestic part, so what it’s like a house cat compared to a stray cat or a wild tiger? In every case terrorism results from decades, perhaps centuries of corruption and mistreatment of the lower classes by the ruling classes…

There really is no more complete of a way to ‘nut-shell’ what causes terrorism. Whether it’s suicide bombing, school shootings, or witch burning it’s all terrorist activity. Suicide bombing because war has changed and there is no honor to it anymore, school shootings because schools wont change and there is not enough room for sanity anymore, and witch burning which represents the horror resulting out of the ignorance of culture…

So a cannibalistic protest is a form of terrorism… Okay? dot dot dot

Lets try a thought experiment… Pretend you’re a kid who shot up your school, daamn, I thought being a loser was the worst thing you could be… Now rewind a year or so before you actually went through with the shooting. What kind of thoughts do you have while at school? Exactly, you have thoughts like a cannibal who wants to protest but there’s no one to protest with because cannibalism is as taboo as taboo gets…You’re starting to get it.... Now think… What country has the most school shootings… America, where the first amendment to our sacred text declares that speech is free with? That’s right, Guns! So a gun has become a tool of protest for the non-democratic prison-like education daycare that our youth must endure as a form of un-paid military training to prepare them for a life of overworking underpaid or overpaid under-fulfilled bullshit…

When you are an army of one or just a few but everyone else is armed with pencils, a gun can make a loud noise….

Seriously though… Everyday you have to go to school (unpaid work) for 8 hours listening to underpaid ‘adults’ many of which have failed at their first second or maybe 3rd career choice, you’re judged constantly put in social situations where sick cliques develop, people take on roles, the friends you grow up with change, move away, or just turn on you… Your parents don’t understand because they spent the last decade trying to forget their entire childhood and young adulthood (basically all the events leading up to them getting married and your being born). Their marriage failed and you’re unsure when the heavy drinking began… Before or after the marriage was over… Before or after you became depressed… [You think about shooting up the school not because you hate the other people but because you love them but you’re so full of hate everyday in the same cycle year after year that you can only feel the hatred… That’s why you have to blow holes in them to let the love leak out (did I make the subject funny yet). In all seriousness, there’s so much confusion, so many emotions in a brain still so young and underdeveloped.]

Why don’t we focus more on actually making students smarter instead of cramming useless information in with the same cheap strategies giving tests and grades as if studying actually makes you better at anything other than studying… I’m not going to die a skeptic because I haven’t lived as a skeptic because my whole fucking life is sapped by the exhaustive feelings of hatred I have towards this undemocratic system which in a nut shell REALLY hasn't changed in two-hundred years… I hate what humanity becomes while a part of it I hate what we think we are as a result of it like no one is real like nothing is real we’re just personalities which are a product of how often we’re prodded by other personalities well I have a personality too and a prod I call Glock… Run pencil dat!",A Cannibalistic Protest [text],0

john was confused and asked again. 

""Almer, E-L-M-E-R."" 

John: "" Ohhhhh elmer! Ok. 

He asks elmer the wife's name. 

""Allen"" he says. 

John: ""allen? well that's a weird name for a girl."" 

Elmer: ""Allen, E-L-L-E-N"" 

john: "" ohhhh, Ellen! Ok."" 

At that moment, Ellen stands up, the boards creaking under her wait. She had to go sideways through the door. 

John leans over and whispers to elmer, ""boy, she's so big she could play with green Bay's packers."" 

Elmer got real mad and said, ""I don't care how big she is the only packer she's playing with is mine!""",A census man comes to the Appalachia mountains,1
