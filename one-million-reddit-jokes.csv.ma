Little Johnny goes up to his parents bedroom and takes a  $100 bill from his Dad's secret stash in his sock drawer. Shoving it down deep in his pocket, he heads out the door. As he crosses the threshold, he bends down and picks up a string. The string has a dead frog tied to the end of it. Little Johnny slings the dead frog over his shoulder and he starts walking in the direction of his school. Also in this direction is the house that everyone in town knows is a well-used bordello.

Without missing a beat as he approaches the whorehouse, he turns and walks up the front door and right inside.

Immediately inside the door is a large desk, and right behind the desk is an older lady, the Madame of the house. 

No hesitation. Little Johnny walks up to the desk, looking the Madame in the eye, and slaps down the $100 bill and says ""I need a hooker with crabs"".

The Madame slides the money back toward Johnny and says ""We don't service anyone under 18 here, take your money and get out"". 

Little Johnny slides it back to her and replies ""No, but you do have lots of politicians come in here, and I'm sure they don't want anyone to know. Now... I want a hooker with crabs, and I want one NOW.""

The Madame thinks about it for a second. She avoids scandal and makes money from a girl she normally wouldn't?  The Madame says to Little Johnny, ""Okay, you little shit. You have yourself a deal. $100 and you get a hooker with  crabs.... IF you tell me two things... Why a hooker with crabs?.... And what the hell is up with that dead frog on that string?""

Little Johnny answers her. ""Look. I go upstairs. I have sex with that hooker, and she gives me crabs. I go to school. I come home from school and my babysitter is there. I have sex with her, too, and give her crabs. My dad comes home, and gives the babysitter a ride home. On the way, they'll have sex and she'll give crabs to my dad. Later, my mom will come home and my dad will have sex with her, giving her crabs. Finally, the next day, the mailman will come by with a 'special delivery' and my mom will have sex with him, giving him crabs. AND THAT'S THE MOTHERFUCKER THAT RAN OVER MY FROG!""

His name was Nao, and he was a very nice kid, although he was a little unsure of what to do with himself. I decided to show him the sport of baseball, as I played on the school's baseball team. Let me tell you, he was a natural. After one year of practicing and throwing around with me, he tried out for the team in 8th grade, and made it.

I remember how excited he was eager to play. Halfway through the season that year, he had made some incredible plays, ranging from diving catches at shortstop to clutch home runs that won us the game. So naturally, when the all-star team was announced for the region-wide league, Nao was selected to be on the team!

I brought him over to the list and said ""Look at that! Hey, Nao! You're an All Star!""",7th grade Asian exchange student,0

After a few minutes, a particularly spunky recruit walked over to him and asked him, ""Why do we have to tie down the whole ship, while you're sitting here doing Jack shit?!"" The captain slowly stood up, towering over the seaman. ""Because that's my job."" Defiantly, the sailor responded, ""Oh yeah?"" The captain replied, ""Yeah. I shit, you knot.""",No kidding,17

He tells the bartender ""I bet you $200 I can bite my eyeball."" The bartender quickly agrees as he sees this as easy money. The man then pops out his glass eye and bites it. 

""Damn it that's not fair!"" the bartender exclaims. 
""Ok"" says the man, ""I'll give you a chance to make your money back. I'll bet you another 200 I can bite my ear."" The bartender carefully looks at both of his ears, and they are both very real. He agrees to the bet but is dismayed when the man takes out his dentures and bites his own ear. 

""You've got to be kidding me! Give me one more chance to make my money back!"" 
""Alright"" says the man, ""but give me a couple minutes and I'll be back with your chance.""
The man looks around and then walks over and starts talking to a guy in a suit. They have a few laughs and then shake hands, and the man walks back down to the bartender. 

""Ok, I'll bet you 400 dollars that I can pee into a pint glass 8 feet away on the bar and not spill a drop.""
The bartender takes a moment to think about it, making sure there's no way to cheat into winning the bet, and finally he agrees. The man hops up on the bar, the bartender sets up the glass 8 feet away and quickly steps back. The man starts pissing everywhere, not even coming close to the pint glass. The bartender cracks a smile, happy he no longer owes the man any money. He looks over at the guy in the suit, who is furious and is covering his face with his hands.

""Why is he so mad?"" Asked the bartender. 
Smiling, the man says ""I just bet him $3000 I could piss all over the bar and you would just stand there and smile.""",A man walks into a bar... (kinda long),1545

gently in the other.

She looks very closely and says, ""There's nothing wrong with them,
Sir. They look fine.""

The man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says

When they arrived, they knocked on the door and an old greyed hair farmer opened the door and stared blank. 

All three friends frantically explained their predicament. 

‘You’s can stay for the night as long as you don’t touch me daughter, I’ll see what I can do about yer car in the morning’ said the farmer. 

All three friends looked at each other, shrugged and agreed to not touch his daughter. 

That night, the three friends sat down at dinner awaiting for the arrival of the farmers daughter. Sure enough, when she finally arrived, she was the most gorgeous women they had all ever laid eyes on. 

And of course, sure enough, all three friends got invited to have sex by the farmers daughter. Breaking the only rule the farmer had set. 

The next morning, the farmer burst into the room the three friends had been sharing. 

‘Get down dem stairs boys! You’ve got farm work to do because you gone and disgraced my daughter!’ Screamed the farmer. 

The three friends ran downstairs and lined up outside the porch, nervously fidgeting. 

‘I want you’s each to go out in dem fields and pick 100 of your favourite fruit or vegetable and return to me when you’re done’ ordered the farmer. 

So.. off the friends went into the fields. 

The first friend returned with a basket full to the brim with grapes. He looked up at the farmer with an enquiring look. 

‘Drop your pants.. take all 100 and... shove em up your arse’ he said smiling menacingly. 

So the friend did just that. 

As the other friend approached, after just seeing what happened, the farmer noticed he had a smug grin on his face.

Upon further investigation, the partner tells the seasoned detective it’s a blood-stained box, to which the detective only nods slightly.

The next day, another call comes in. The two detectives head to a different location and sure enough, laying in the middle of a gore filled room is a dead woman lying in a pool of her own blood. Suspecting a possible serial killer, they both search the room for clues. Once again, the new partner points out a blood-spattered box in the corner, to which the seasoned detective only barely acknowledges.   

Only a day later, the detectives get yet another call, this time they arrive as quickly as possible to the scene. What they see is a gore filled room with a dead woman lying in a pool of her own blood, both detectives know it must be a serial killer and case the room for clues. Once again, the partner looks in the corner of the room and finds a blood-spattered box and points it out to the seasoned detective who, this time, doesn’t even acknowledge him.

Infuriated, the new partner finally yells, “I think this box is the key to stopping this murder's rampage, and all all you do is ignore me!”

It has been 40 days and 40 nights since he last rested or had a meal and he is exhausted.

Just as he thinks he can't take it any more, he sees a figure on the distant horizon. He manages to summon up the energy to stumble closer and gradually gets nearer to what he realises is an old man. What's more, this old man has long white hair, a white beard, and is dressed in flowing robes.

Finally Jesus gets within speaking distance and shouts out excitedly: ""Father, father, finally I have found you!""

The old man turns to look at Jesus and says: ""Well, this is strange. It's true that I seem to have lost my son and I am in fact out here in the desert looking for him, but to be honest young man, he looks nothing like you.""

Jesus is dumbfounded. But then he thinks this is yet another test and so he says: ""Come on father, don't you think this is too much of a coincidence? What are the odds of us both being in this huge desert, at the same time, me looking for my father and you looking for your son? 40 days and 40 nights have I been searching and never have I felt surer, you truly are my father and I truly am your son.""

The old man says: ""You're right, that is a bit odd. But the thing is, my son was very distinctive looking"".

""What do you mean"" says Jesus.

""Well"" says the old man, ""for one thing he had holes in both his hands"".

Jesus slowly raises his hands: ""Father, see the wounds in my hands where I was crucified?""

""Hmm"" says the old man, ""he also had holes in both his feet"".

Jesus sorrowfully raises first one foot, then the other: ""Father, they also nailed my feet to the cross. See my wounds have still not healed.""

The old man stands in silence, but Jesus can see that this has shaken him to the core. Finally, Jesus can't take it any longer. Weeping, he rushes over to the old man and throws his arms around him with the last of his strength. The old man embraces Jesus and he too is sobbing uncontrollably.

""At last we are reunited father"" says Jesus, ""I cannot believe it took this long, but we are together again and no-one can part us now.""

""You are right"" says the old man through his tears. ""I'm so glad you're back Pinnochio"".",Jesus is wandering through the desert,9

She is a dream!  

But there is something that bothers me! 

This something is her little sister… This is my future 20 years old sister-in-law , wearing a super skinny, mini skirts and short blouses. 

Always lean ahead and I was often lucky to see her underwear.  

She never did that in front of someone else! 

One day she calls me and asks me to go home to see the wedding invitations.  

When I arrived she was alone.  

She whispered that soon I get married and that she has feelings for me for long time and that she thinks she cann’t overcome them.  

She also said that she desperately wanted to have sex with me just once before I marry her sister. 

I was shocked and could not say a word… 

She said to me that she goes to bed and asked if I wanted to go up with her.

 I froze and looked at her going up the stairs. 

Going up, she took her panties off and threw it at me. 

I stayed there for a moment and then ran to the door.  

I opened it and I walked to the car.

 My future father-in-law was standing outside with tears in his eyes, hugged me and said: ""I’m glad you passed this little test and I am sure that my daughter could not find a better man. Welcome to the family, my son!""

Moral Lesson: Always keep your condoms in your car!",We are already 2 years together with my girlfriend and decided to get married.,193

Floor 3 - These men have jobs, love kids, and are extremely good looking. ""Wow,"" she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. She goes to the fourth floor and sign reads: 

Floor 4 - These men have jobs, love kids, are drop-dead good looking and help with the housework. ""Oh, mercy me!"" she exclaims, ""I can hardly stand it!"" Still, she goes to the fifth floor and sign reads: 

Floor 5 - These men have jobs, love kids, are drop-dead gorgeous, help with the housework, and have a strong romantic streak. She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor and the sign reads:

Unfortunately the baby was born with no ears. When they arrived home from the hospital, the new parents invited Little Johnny's family over to see the new baby.


Little Johnny's parents were very afraid their son would have a wise crack to say about the baby. So, Little Johnny's dad had a long talk with Little Johnny before going to the neighbors. He said, ""Now son, that poor baby was born without any ears. I want you to be on your best behavior and not say one word about his ears, or I'm really going to spank your butt when we get back home."" ""I promise not to mention his ears at all,"" said Little Johnny.


At the neighbors home Little Johnny leaned over the crib and touched the baby's hand. He looked at it's mother and said, ""Oh what a beautiful little baby!"" The mother, who had braced herself for Johnny's comment, was pleasantly surprised and said, ""Thank you very much Little Johnny.""
He then said, ""This baby has perfect little hands, and perfect little feet. Why just look at his pretty little eyes...Did the doctor say he can see good?"" The mother said a bit bewildered, ""Why yes...the doctor said he has 20/20 vision, why do you ask?"" Little Johnny said, ""Well, it's a damn good thing, 'cause he sure as hell can't wear glasses!!",Old but still good,70

post,77rs3i,2qh72,jokes,false,1508565653,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/77rs3i/2_jokes/,self.jokes,,"I had a couple short jokes so I’ll just throw them together. 

***********

Three construction workers are sitting around a site in break after a couple days’ rain. To pass the time they each bet they can throw a brick the highest. They decide whoever gets their brick to sink the farthest into a deep mud puddle will win. So the first guy rears back, throws his brick, and it sinks 6 inches into the mud. The second guy takes aim, throws his brick up, and it sinks a full foot into the mud. Then the third guy takes his shot, throws his brick up... and it doesn’t come down.

***********
The second joke is thus:
A woman decides she wants to visit her mother in the hospital after a recent surgery. She decides she will take her pet parrot too, since her mother loves seeing him. Unfortunately, her mother lives several states away and the only viable travel option is on a no pets, no smoking flight the next day (this is, of course, before no smoking on any flight). So she decides she will smuggle her parrot in under a jacket.

So the next day, the woman packs her bag, dons a jacket and takes her parrot to the airport. Once there, she gives the parrot a treat and hides him in her jacket. Once the plane takes off, the captain comes out into the cabin to speak with the passengers. In his mouth is the biggest cigar anyone in this flight has ever seen. As he reaches the woman, he asks her how she is enjoying the flight. “Just fine,” she responds. “Well great, we should be there in time, so please enjoy the flight.”

As he is just about to walk away, the pilot hears *Arw, Polly want a cracker.*
“What was that?” the pilot asks.
“Oh, nothing!”
*ARW, POLLY WANT A CRACKER!*
“You have a parrot!” The pilot exclaims.
“Well you have a cigar!” The woman responds, equally enraged.

The captain reaches over, opens the woman’s jacket, and pulls out the parrot. “You’re not allowed to have a parrot on this plane,” the pilot says. The woman snatches the cigar out of the pilot’s mouth and retorts, “Well you’re not allowed to have a cigar on this plane!”

At this point, the pilot has had enough, so he opens a window and throws the parrot out the window. Furious, the woman throws the pilot’s cigar out the window before he has a chance to close it. As the pilot storms back to the cockpit, the lady sits down fuming over the loss of her beloved pet parrot.

After the pilot has had a chance to calm down, and has put the entire event from his mind, he hears a tapping, *tap tap tap*, at his window. He looks over and what should he see but the parrot. And it has something in its beak. 

Now you might think the parrot grabbed the pilot’s cigar, but no. In its beak is...




The brick.

Through the miracle of modern medicine, the procedures were successful, and the mother and her children survived. However, due to the locations of the bullets in the womb, the doctors determined the best course of action was to leave the bullets in place. 

The woman delivered all three healthy babies, two beautiful girls and one handsome boy. She went home and proceeded to raise her children happily and uneventfully. 

Fourteen years later, the mother is sitting on the couch when one of her daughters runs up to her crying. 

""Darling, what happened?! Why are you crying?""

""Mommy, I was peeing in the bathroom, and felt a weird pain, when all of a sudden a bullet popped out!""

The mother calmed her daughter, and told her the story of shooting. The daughter left her mother comforted to know that it wouldn't happen again. 

A week later, the mother is outside, when her other daughter comes up yelling and crying. 

""Darling, what happened?! Why are you crying?""

""Oh Mommy, I was in the bathroom peeing, felt a sharp pain, and a bullet popped out! I don't know what to do!""

The mother, surprised it happened again, explained to the story of the shooting to this daughter as well. The daughter relaxed and went on her way. 

Two days later, the mother is laying in bed, when her son runs into her room crying and looking scared. Before the son said anything, the mother quickly said, ""Let me guess, you were peeing, felt a sharp pain, and a bullet came out!""

The son, confused, yelled,""No! I was wanking in my bedroom, and shot the dog!""

She read books about how safe it was and listened to the stewardess demonstrate all the safety features. But she still worried herself silly every time a visit was coming up.  

Finally, the family decided that maybe if she saw the statistics she'd be convinced. So they sent her to a friend of the family who was an actuary.  

""Tell me,"" she said suspiciously, ""what are the chances that someone will have a bomb on a plane?""  

The actuary looked through his tables and said, ""A very small chance. Maybe one in five hundred thousand.""  

She nodded, then thought for a moment. ""So what are the odds of two people having a bomb on the same plane?""  

Again he went through his tables.  

""Extremely remote,"" he said. ""About one in a billion.""  

Aunt Bessie nodded and left his office.

Ving and his sister Ling were quiet to start off with, but eventually I made good friends with Ving. After talking to him for a few weeks he revealed to me that he absolutely abhorred his name, and that he'd do almost anything to figure out how to get it changed. 
I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said
""Lee, like Bruce Lee or something.""
I was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework.
Ling overheard us and chimed in,
""If you do that, father will disown you as our child. That name has been in our family line for generations.""
Ving never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan. 

The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall. After we arrived, he had gotten the name-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change. I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice. Tears began to stream down his face. He finally decided that he was gonna have to cancel his request, and Ling looked relieved.

The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancellation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her. 

Suddenly, a short Asian man with neon shorts, ray-bans, and an American flag t-shirt bursted into the room. Ving turned in awe and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks.

""D-Dad?""

With a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son.

""Don't stop, be Lee, Ving.

Hold on to that fee, Ling""

penis in the pickle slicer.  

The shrink calms him down and asks him a little more about himself, trying to talk him out of it.  He suggests he take a different route to work, and sets up another appointment for the next week.

The guy comes back the next week and tells the doctor that he took the new route, but he keeps getting this picture in his mind.  He keeps seeing this pickle slicer going away at it in the window and he still wants to go over and put his penis in the pickle slicer.  

The psychiatrist suggests he go farther away, take a cab to work, the idea being that the cabbie will keep his mind off of this.  He then makes another appointment for the following week.  

The next week it's the same thing.  This time the shrink tries hypnosis, prescribes valium, but the problem persists.  

Finally, one week, the guy comes in and says, 

""I did it, Doc!  I put my penis in the pickle slicer!"" 

The psychiatrist is horrified.  He calms himself down and asks, 

""Did it hurt much?"" 

The guy says, 

""No.  Matter of fact, she liked it, too.""

At around one o'clock, the first guy thought 'What the hell,' and decided to check out the daughter. He slipped out of the bed, and headed upstairs- the stairs, however, creaked as walked up. The first guy heard the sound of a shotgun being loaded and a gruff voice - 

""Who the hellizat?!"" 

The first guy had to think fast! 

""Meow- Meow""

""A whew, just the cat"" the farmer said. The first guy went
back to bed.

out the daughter- He did what the first guy did, the farmer
pulled out his shotgun-

We weren't particularly funny and we didn't really have any friends apart from each other. We would spend our weekends often just walking around our neighborhood doing stupid stuff. Ben was a nice guy, really really dumb but he had the best of intentions. I didn't have a stable family growing up though and I was constantly getting angry at him because he was the one person I could vent my frustration at and he'd never get angry at me. He sort of understood in his own way. 

Anyway, one weekend we're walking and we reached a shopping centre. We walk past an alley around the back and see a cat. We sort of laughed at it and called it stupid names like ""Idiot"" and ""Stupid Cat 2000"". We grew tired and walked away. 

But it followed us.

We kept walking but eventually we decided to pick it up and take it home. I know it was a stupid thing to do but we just assumed it was a stray. Ben named it ""Ugly Cat the idiot"" and we both found it funny for some reason. 

We often took Ugly Cat the idiot for walks. He liked walks and didn't mind the leash either. Ben grew really attached to it. They always played together every day. One day we took him for a walk around our neighbourhood like usual and he started moewing. Me and Ben stopped and turned around. We realised it was right outside the alleyway where we found him. A door opens in the alley and a big man with a beard and an apron quickly looks at us. 
""What the hell you have my cat???"" The man pulled up his apron to reveal a gun.

Ben saw the writing on the wall but didn't give up: ""He's our cat now! His name is Ugly Cat the idiot!!""

""What the hell??!! You walking around with my cat calling it ugly?! His name is Love you think headed kid get out of here."" The man pulled for his gun. Ben reached down to pick up the cat.

I was both sad and angry at Ben. I yelled ""No Ben stop!"" A gunshot. Blood everywhere. I'd been shot through the chest.

The man runs away with the cat, Ben leans down to try and stop the bleeding. I mumble something. He leans in closer to hear my final words...

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.
""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""
Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.
""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.
""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

The 3 poor pigs were irresponsible and often dirtied the house, they didn't bother cleaning up after themselves and their houses were often a mess. One day, word goes around that the king of the forest was having an event! He was going around and judging every house in the forest. The house that had been cared for and cherished the most would have its residents moved into a huge mansion in the royal park. The judging would be held in 3 days.


  As soon as the pigs heard this news, they all were filled with visions of themselves having wealth beyond their wildest dreams. But the three of them soon realized that their house was far too dirty and three days would not be enough to clean it. The pigs were moping around and walking around in the forest sadly.


  Suddenly, one of the pigs found a magical lamp which would grant his wish. He immedietly ran to his friends and showed the lamp to his friends. They were all astonished. The youngest pig made his wish first, he wished for all of the junk on the floor to be arranged properly. As soon as he made his wish, a young baby whale arrived and started arranging everything he had. Astonished as he was, he was happy to exploit this poor child.


  The next pig grabbed the lamp and wished for something that would clean every corner of the house as clean as can be, another young whale came in and started cleaning the whole house using a powerful vaccuum cleaner. Lastly, the eldest pig wished for a pig that would decorate the entire house beautifully. His wish came true as a baby whale came in with cans of paint and other decorations.



  The three pigs were happy, and they relaxed and slept the whole 3 days and beat the whales whenever they went out of line. Until judgement day came. When the three pigs woke up, they realized that the three whales had grown into full adult size! The ginormous beasts had broke open the ceiling and destroyed everything!


  The three pigs panicked and tried their best to salvage their house. The whales refused to help them because of the mistreatment they had to endure. It becomes clear to the pigs that they had done wrong. They had no time to clean anything up!


  The king came in and took one look at the wrecked house and was so dissapointed in the pigs. He said, ""Whale,whale,whale. What do we have here"".",Three Poor Pigs,1
