After a night of heavy boozing a man stumbles out of a bar. To sober up a bit he decides to walk home instead of taking a taxi. Soon he finds himself in a dodgy part of town, where he has never been before. Then a homeless person gets in front of him and asks the man for some change.
The man looks at the bum and says: “I bet you’re gonna get beers for that money, aren’t you?”
– Oh no sir, the bum replies with the face of an angel.
“Hmmm, no beers. So you’re gonna get wine then, ey?!”
– No sir, certainly not. I never drink wine.
“Aha, so you’re gonna get hard liquor right?!
– Absolutely not sir. In fact I never touched a drop of alcohol in my entire life.
“In that case, why don’t you come with me to my place”, the man says.
– Oh sir, that would be too much hospitality. I really couldn’t.
The man looks at the bum and replies: “Hospitality? I’m not offering you anything. I just want you to come with me, so I can show my nagging wife what happens to people who don’t drink.”",The drunkard and the bum,1

After some waiting the boss comes through and says to the Irishman: ""I'm sorry but on this occasion we've decided to hire the Norwegian""
The Irishman angered by this says ""Surely, me being Irish would mean you would give the job to me instead of a foreigner"". He went on a rant about looking after the locals etc.
When he was done the boss replied. He said:
""Well it's like this. We didnt make the decision based on how many answers you got right but more on the answers you got wrong""
So the Irishman still angry says, ""but we both got one wrong answer""
Again the boss replies calmly saying, ""it's not how many wrong answers you got but the answer you gave. On question 7 the Norwegian wrote 'I don't know' as his answer.
Your answer was 'Neither do I'"".

""All of our secret formulas are in the vault in the center of the plant.
They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the engine company that brings them out intact.""

The fire chief ordered his men to strengthen their attack on the blaze. 
After two hours of fighting the fire another fire department was called in and the president of the chemical company offered $100,000 to the firefighters who could bring out the company's secret files.

From the distance, a long siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. 
It was the local volunteer fire company composed entirely of men over the age of 65. 
To everyone's amazement, the little fire engine raced passed everyone and drove straight into the middle of the inferno.
Outside the other firemen watched as the old timers jumped off their rig and began to fight the fire with a performance and effort never seen before. 
Within a short time, the old timers had extinguished the fire and saved the secret formulas.

The grateful chemical company president joyfully announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, 
and walked over to personally thank each of the brave, though elderly, fire fighters.

The local TV news reporters rushed in after capturing the event on film asking, ""What are you going to do with all that money?""

Not quite sure how to approach her, he called the family Doctor to discuss the problem.

The Doctor told him there is a simple informal test the husband could perform to give the Doctor a better idea about her hearing loss.

""Here's what you do,"" said the Doctor. ""Stand about 40 feet away from her, and in a normal conversational speaking tone see if she hears you. 
If not, go to 30 feet, then 20 feet, and so on until you get a response.""

That evening, the wife is in the kitchen cooking dinner, and he was in the den.
He says to himself, ""I'm about 40 feet away, let's see what happens."" Then in a normal tone he asks, ""Honey, what's for dinner?""

No response.

So the husband moves closer to the kitchen, about 30 feet from his wife and repeats, ""Rhonda, what's for dinner?"" Still no response.

Next he moves into the dining room where he is about 20 feet from his wife and asks, ""Honey, what's for dinner?""

Again he gets no response.

So, he walks up to the kitchen door, about 10 feet away. ""Honey, what's for dinner?""

Again there is no response..

So he walks right up behind her. ""Rhonda, what's for dinner?""

The rivalry between each group was quite intense, and unlike other situations, the two weaker groups at the time did not join together to fight the strongest. Instead, this conflict involved three opposing sides, each one of them desperately wanting victory.


However, as the war meandered on, it became evident to the vikings and French that the Anglos were in the better position. The leaders of both sides decided to set aside their differences and unite against the Anglos. However, English spies determined that the two other sides were making a treaty and notified Anglo government. This led the Anglo king to make a decision to send one his best officers to supervise the signing of the treaty. Not wanting the French and Vikings to catch on to his actions, he decided to have the officer pose as a Germanic feudal king.

On November 11th 1069 (this date has been debated by historians, due to the conversion to the Gregorian calendar), the French and Vikings signed the historic peace treaty in an undisclosed location in France (most historical evidence from this date is lost; documents were presumed to be destroyed by Mongol invaders). Unbeknownst to the French and Vikings, the Anglo officer would be in the room during the official signing of the treaty.

Some say it was his charisma, others say it was his disguise, but historians have verified that the Anglo spy (named Trigon O'Metry) somehow convinced his enemies to permit to sign below their names as a witness. Thus, the era of British espionage began, and the two opposing sides conducted business as usual, neither of their leaders being none the wiser.

Early war industries in France and Sweden worked in overdrive, producing twice the weapons and military supplies than they had earlier, due to the cooperation between the nations. In a poor decision on both sides' part (which ultimately led to the end of the war), both the French and the Vikings decided to pool their resources, sending fleets of vessels into the middle of the sea. The whole fleet would contain all of the resources each empire produced, which if you remember, was twice the normal output. In addition, the French and Vikings each sent their best squire, in preparation for their invasion of the Anglo empire. However, the Anglos knew that they were coming (mostly due to the effectiveness of their spies) so they had sent their best squire, whom they had trained for months. This squire swam all the way across the English channel to the coast of France, where he would single-handedly conquer the French empire.

Not everything went so well for the British. Suspicion by the French general Al-Titude led to the discovery of the British spy. So, O'Metry was then sent to board the vanguard of the Viking-French fleet (or the French-Viking fleet, depending where you're from). However, this fleet was virtually unguarded, which allowed the British to capture them easily.

So began the course of the final battle of the war. The British, having captured the Viking-French fleet and holding it in the French port city of Paris, possessed nearly all of the firepower of the opposing sides. In addition to this, the British rescued their POW spy. The only thing left to defeat was the French and Viking squire, who were stationed in Bordeaux with a new mission to repel the incoming British invasion. Little is known about the battle, but the following is certain:

The squire of the side opposite the Anglo is equivalent to the sum of the squires of the two opposite sides minus twice the products of the opposite sides and the cosign of the Anglo.

Britain was one of the nations that really felt the effects of the so called ""total war"", as civilians played a greater role in the military than ever before. Even though they were geographically separated from the rest of Europe, they were hit hard by the war. German shipping blockades cut off foreign supply, which meant that supplies had to be rationed, and many raw materials went towards the war effort, used in industrial production. This led to a shortage of some fabrics such as silk and cotton.Additionally, the British government demanded food rations be given to its people. As a result, many nutritional foods were scarce.

In response to the scarcity of fabric for clothing production, a British sheep farmer named Calvin Broadus invented a new type of fabric, which he called ""tweed"". This fabric was made of wool, but the British military found no practical use for it in the war effort. Due to the abundance of sheep in the United Kingdom, farmers everywhere started producing tweed, as Broadus' method was circulated rapidly by the British government.

As with the military, British civilians found few practical uses of the new ""wonder material"". It had poor insulation, was rough to wear, and it shrunk easily when washed, and most importantly didn't look fashionable. It seemed as though the war drained British creativity too, as fashion designers could find no suitable design with tweed. They settled with creating plaid designs with a few dull colors, since these could be produced more efficiently.

As the war moved on, Germany's control of mainland Europe and the water around Britain decreased. With the Americans now in the war, Britain's military centered industry (some would say a precursor the military industrial complex) had a break. The United States, with its large amount of resources, picked up some of the slack, reducing Britain's quota of war production. This meant good news for the British textile industry, which was reduced to producing for the war. Upper class British people could afford to buy expensive fabrics that were not available to them, such as the cotton and silk mentioned above. However, since the war was still going on, these materials were extremely expensive, so only British aristocrats could buy them.

In addition, excess tweed manufacturing gave Britain a surplus- they were left with more of this useless fabric than ever. British families were given large amounts of tweed. Some people tried making the tweed into useful items, like blankets, but due to its poor ductility, it took a long time to manufacture them. With British men in the military, women took up manufacturing jobs, in addition to their duties at home, which meant they were left with little time to deal with their surplus of tweed at home.

Women in London first discovered a useful application of tweed. By sheer luck, historians claim, these women discovered that burning a strand of tweed for a long time over a fire would produce a fibrous strand that was edible and nutritious. Scientists today found out that this product was nutritious due to ammonium nitrate in the sheeps' grazing land. The process of creating this fibrous food was still long, and it took about 12 hours. In order to increase efficiency (we see a pattern here), various women would prepare this in bulk amounts in city parks. During this time period, you would see bonfires throughout open spaces in the city, since British women were burning fabric. However, historians have discovered no pictures of these events, since the British government forbade photography (or destroyed photos) of this process as not to reveal secrets to the enemy.

The British military saw a problem in the post-tweed manufacturing process. German planes would be able to spot cities since there were large ""tweed bonfires"" as the process of making the fibrous food extended past daytime. So, the British government mandated that tweed production into food would only occur during the day, as not to assist the nighttime German blitzkriegs. This was seen as only a mild inconvenience to city-dwelling British people, but it still took all day, from sunrise to sunset, to produce this food.

In 1945, this process died out, since the war ended. This is why you do not see people doing this today. Due to the effectiveness of British intelligence, this process had been relatively unknown to foreigners. This changed, when in 1996 a man named Cordozar Broadus was walking his dog in a park in Manchester. They reached a heavily wooded section of the park, and his curious, but nosy dog unearthed a series of tools that were used in the tweed refining process. Broadus remembered seeing his father's war notes after snooping around in the attic. His father's extremely detailed notes described the procedure of tweed production. The inspired Broadus decided to do more research into the subject, but he was shut down by the British government. In 1998, Broadus, now a musical artist, decided to slowly reveal this secret, in an album, but under an alias (so the government wouldn't suspect him).

To credit his mischievous mutt, he used the pseudonym ""Snoop Dogg"", and released his single, ""Smoke Tweed Everyday.""

His thoughts drifted back to the fine April day in nineteen sixty-three when he first saw the car sitting on the showroom floor.

The dazzling mid-day sun glistened off of the chrome as his wavy black hair blew in the breeze. Within a few months, his bright world would be drastically altered. His older brother started dating a very eerie young woman, and soon after his behavior had also become disturbing. He awakened one night to a pain in his neck, and the two of them standing over him, laughing. He stared into the night sky and a wave of melancholy swept over him, as he reflected that one of the things he dreaded most about being a vampire, was not being able to drive with the top down on bright sunny days. He resumed his polishing, and when it was done he put the top up and drove the car into the garage. The sun would be rising soon and he needed to get to bed.

When he opened the door between the garage and the kitchen, he was greeted with his brother’s sarcasm.

“You just can’t seem to get it through your head that you’re dead, can you?”

“You’ve been a vampire for as long as I have.” Boris leaned on the back of a chair, and continued in a low deliberate voice, “You should know by now that we’re neither alive nor dead. We’re undead.”

“A technicality, but it still doesn’t justify spending all your time with that mechanical icon of the living world. Look, dummy. You can turn into a bat and fly. You don’t need a car anymore. When will you ever get that through your thick skull?”

“I’m scared of bats and even more afraid of heights, and, besides, you’re a good one to talk about hanging on to the living world. I see you’re stuffing that big gut of yours full of Oreo cookies again. When you fly, you show up on the radar screens as big as the space shuttle. Now if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed, and hopefully you haven’t turned down the heat on my waterbed again.”

Boris started to leave the room as his brother replied. “It seems to me that I’ve reminded you before that vampires can’t cross water, and if you had any self respect you’d sleep in a proper coffin.”

He spoke over his shoulder. “I’m not crossing water. I’m sleeping on it. Besides coffins are for dead people. When I’m dead I’ll sleep in a coffin. Good night.”

Boris slowly climbed the steps to his room and wearily opened the door. He checked the thermostat on the waterbed to insure that it hadn’t been disturbed, and then climbed into the bed. After drawing the shades and securing all light sources, he snuggled into the heap of blankets and was soon asleep.
He awakened feeling rested, and rose slowly from the comfort of his bed.

Only a few wispy clouds obscured an otherwise clear sky as he sat on the front porch gazing at the stars. He rested his elbows on his knees and his chin in the palms of his hands, and thought out loud, “All I want is to be able to drive my convertible on a nice sunny day. Is that too much to ask?”
“No.” A soft, but unexpected voice spoke from behind him.
Boris turned around to see who spoke it. Standing on the porch was a spectacularly beautiful woman with extremely fair skin, dressed in a flowing white gown with small wings gently fluttering in the peaceful evening breezes.
“Who are you?” As soon as he said it, he realized that it wasn’t one of his best opening lines.
“I’m Desiree, a Fairy, and I’ve come to grant you a wish.”
“I thought Fairies only collected teeth.”
“The boss likes us to keep busy, so on slow days we do other things. I understand that you have something that you wish dearly for.”
“What I want nobody can give me.”
“Don’t be so sure. If you don’t ask, you’ll never know.” She brushed past him as she slowly walked over to the car.
“You’ve already heard what I want, so why do I have to ask?”
“Humor me.” A sly smile, displaying tantalizing dimples, graced her face while her hands gently caressed the shiny black paint.
Boris thought for a minute, and then spoke slowly. “I want to drive my car on a nice warm sunny morning without the fear of dying. Can you do that?”
“It’s done. Your wish is granted. Tomorrow morning you can drive your car without worrying about dying. I do have one request though.”
“I knew there had to be a catch. What is it?”
“I want to go along.”
“Is that all?”
“I love this car, and I’ve never had the opportunity to ride in a convertible.”
Boris smiled sheepishly and held his hand out to her. “Meet me here at five-thirty. I want to watch the sunrise while we drive.”
Desiree took his hand and rubbed it to her cheek, and then fluttered off.

After she left, Boris picked up a rag and commenced polishing the finish to remove her hand prints. She may be cute, but he had his limits.

Desiree returned right on time. Boris opened the door for her, then walked around the car and took his position at the steering wheel. The sun was not up yet, but beams of light turned the clouds that were visible to varied shades of pink and purple. He drove to a park where he’d spent much of his youth. It was the first time he’d seen it in daylight in many years. He drove slowly and took time to enjoy the reflections off the water in the pond, and the way the light played through the trees, creating eerie shadows on the ground. These were sights he hadn’t seen in years, and he wanted to relish each and every one of them. He emerged from the cover of the trees just as the sun made its entrance. Immediately the skin on his hands began to bubble, and his breathing became labored.

He shrieked in horror, “You lied to me. You told me I’d be able to live when the sun came up.”
Desiree smiled and calmly replied, “No, I didn’t. I only promised you that you could drive without worrying about dying. That’s exactly what you asked for.”
Boris staggered from the car in an attempt to find cover, and amid screams of agonizing pain, he burned to a cinder in the middle of the road. Desiree slowly slid across the red vinyl bench seat, placed her hands on the steering wheel, and took some time to admire her new car. After a few moments she turned around and spoke in disgust to the smoldering clump “A basic Impala! 
You could have at least had enough class to buy a Super Sport.” She turned back, put the car in gear, and drove off into the sunrise.

In the middle of the night he hears a beautiful noise that wakes him up, even from the amazing bed he is laying on. He realises that the noise is coming from a door in the corner of his room. He decides not to get up and goes back to sleep.

The next morning he asks a nearby monk what the noise was. ""I'm sorry I can't tell you,"" he replies, ""you're not a monk."" So the man asks the monk, ""What will it take to become a monk?"" To which the monk replies, ""We will give you tasks. Each will give you a lesson in patience and equilibrium within yourself."" 

His first task was to go to the nearby beach and count every grain of sand individually. For the next five years the man wanders the beach, being careful not to lose count or double count any grains. After the trial is done he returns and asks if he can see what is behind the door. The monk replies ""I'm sorry I can't tell you. You're not a monk.""

""Your next task is to go to the meadow and count every blade of grass."" This time, with more patience he treks to the great field and begins his count. The wind being a huge obstacle for him, he counts the blades of grass for the next ten years. Upon his return he asks to see what is behind the door. ""I'm sorry I can't tell you, you are not yet a monk. You have but one more task.""

The man is then sent to a forest, spreading over three acres. As he arrives he sees a ladder and a note which reads ""You know what you must do."" So he begins to count every leaf on every tree. His practice with the monks for the past years of his life have greatly improved his physique, his spirituality, and his intellect. With these traits he is able to climb up and down this ladder and count every leaf with ease. For the next fifteen years he calmly and happily counts, by this time forgetting all about the door.

The youngest monk before he, now the Elder Monk, is the last of his predecessors to still be alive when he returns from his journey. The Elder monk immediately hands him a key ring and says, ""You have proven yourself worthy. When i die you will become the Elder Monk. Here are the keys required to open the inner sanctum. You may find the first door in the room you layed in on your first say with us."" The memory of the beautiful noise, and the sight of the key to open in made him break down and begin to cry right then and there. 

He goes to the door, and examines the keyes on the ring. There is a plain metal key, a stone, a very large key, and a Crystal shard. The first door in front of him seems to be a fairly modern door, so he opens it with the plain metal key. After walking down the hall and down the stairs he comes across a stone wall which seems to be a dead end. As he begins to lose hope, he sees a small gap in the stone wall. He pulls out his key ring and places the stone into the wall. The wall decends into the floor, revealing a path ahead of him. 

The path is a mile long and direct, no turns, no lights, and no stairs. As he progresses through the straight pitch black corridor, he begins to see a light. As he gets closer he sees that he is going into a cave, a very large cave. The cave is filled with colorful crystals and marvelous stones. There is a small hole above him which seems to small for any animal to fit through. After about ten minutes wandering through the cave he hears a faint ringing. The hole above him is shining light through various crystals, causing them to vibrate and ring. The refractions of the light end up pointing to a crystal cluster that seems to have a missing crystal. He places the Crystal from his pocket into the cluser, and all the crystals in the cave disintegrate.

He is immediately filled with sorrow. He believes he just destroyed the source of the beautiful noise he worked so hard to behold. As the tears fall, he lifts his head remembering that he has one more key. He looks around to find that a very large door, previously hidden by the crystals, had been exposed. So he takes the final key from his pocket and opens the door. The second the door flies open, he sees the most amazing wonder he has ever seen in his entire life. It beats the beautiful views he has seen during his time as a monk. It overpowers every beautiful song he had ever heard. Upon seeing this treasure he realises that his life is now complete and understands what it is to not fear death, as he can now die happily.

Would you like to know what he saw?

""If I don't find my shoes, the events of 1958 would repeat itself today!""

This did not go down well with other passengers and they did not like his tone or threat. The man was unfazed by their disapproval and repeated himself louder.

""If I don't find my shoes, what happened in 1958 would happen here again. You've all been warned!""

""Well, that seems only fair,"" said the cop, laughing. ""OK. Good luck! Oh, by the way, what's in the other bag?""

He sits down and enjoys a few drinks, making conversation with the bartender.  As the night goes on and the bar begins to empty out, he notices that he's hearing some really exceptional piano music.  Looking around the bar, there are no speakers, no juke box, nothing that he can see that would be creating the music.

Guy:  ""Hey, bartender, where's this music coming from?  It's some of the best piano music I've ever heard.""

Bartender:  ""Look on top of the bar over there.""


As the man looks down, at the end of the bar, well ON the bar really, there's a little man playing a grand piano roughly the size of a laptop.  The player himself can't be more than 1-2 feet tall, and the man is absolutely baffled.

Guy: ""Woah, where did you find such a small person who can play a piano THAT well?""

Bartender:  ""I wished for him with my genie!  Here, give it a try.""


Placing a lamp in front of the man, the bartender goes back to washing some dishes and serving a few other regulars.  At first, the man is just in awe that the bartender would be such an ass as to suggest a genie gave him a piano player for the bar.  But, just for shits and giggles, he rubs the lamp.

A genie pops out, and scares the guy half to death.  The genie says ""I will grant you any 1 wish.""

The man thinks it over, and then says ""I would like you to fill up this bar with money, so that everyone here can go home rich.""  The genie looks at the man, looks around the bar, and claps his hands, saying ""Your wish is my command.""


The man excitedly spins around, and to his dismay the entire bar is filled with honey.  Sticky.  Fucking.  Honey.

Guy:  ""Really?  What the hell!?  I get one wish and the damn genie doesn't even take the time to listen to what I say?!?""

Bartender""  ""Yeah, I'm sorry, I really should have said something. The genie is actually a little hard of hearing.  I mean, do you really think that I wished for a 12 inch pianist?""",A joke for those who like story-jokes,2

He'd drink one, then go the next one, and then the last one.

Since the dude did this day after day, the bartender couldn't help but notice, and decided to ask the man what was the deal with the three bears.

""You know"" the bartender said, trying to be as casual as possible, to conceal his curiosity. ""You take a little while to get from one beer to another, the next ones will be warm and washed-out. Why don't you order the first one beer at a time?""

The man listened to the question silently, gazing into one of the beers. He looks up and answers with a deep nostalgic voice tone:

""We used to be unseparable. My friends and I. When we were single, we would every night go to a bar, have our beers and chat. But destiny has it's own reasons, right? We had to drift apart for several reasons: marriage, work... but we swore that we would always keep the good old times alive by going to a bar, and ordering three beers.. knowing the others would be doing it too, wherever they are. My name is Peter, by the way.""

The bartender was speechless. It was a damn good reason to do such a silly ritual. So he left the guy alone with his beers.

And every night, Peter would appear, order his three beers and chug them quietly in his little corner, without exchanging words with anyone except for the bartender, sometimes about life, sometimes tales about his friendship and the crazy shit they did together. Newman was a smooth ladies-man. Joshua was the one who did everyone laugh. Night after night, three beers in their honour. Then one night, Peter ordered only two beers.
The bartender looked to the man with a concerned look - Peter was visibly not alright, and with one beer less, this could only mean one thing: one of his friends had passed. Would it be Newman and his glorious dick? Would it be Joshua? Once again, his curiosity got the best of him.

""I'm very sorry, Peter. Which one? And.. what happened?""

""Nah, they're just fine, I just quit drinking.""

An old Chinese man answers who looks like he was alive when the dinosours ruled the earth.

The young man who was lost explained his situation and begged for food and water.

The old man agreed on the condition that the young man didn't make a move on his sister or he would face the three worst Chinese tortures. Looking at how old the man was the you man agreed and was let in. He was taken to a spare room and stayed there until dinner.

When he came down for dinner there was this gorgeous specimen an 11/10 girl and the young man couldn't keep his eyes off her but remembering the old mans threat he did his best not to look. However, the entire meal the girl was obviously flirting with him and so the young man ran to his room.

Hours passed but the man couldn't sleep he could only think about the girl. Eventually he said fuck it and would risk the old mans wrath. So he snuck into the girls room and proceeded to have the best sex he had ever had and the crept back to his room.

The next morning the man woke to find a heavy rock on his chest with a note that said ""Chinese torture #1 rock on chest"". The rock was painful but if this was the best the old man had then the young man could survive.

At that moment the old man came into the room picked up the rock and threw it out the window and pointed to a sign under the window. "" Chinese totrure #2 rock tied to left testicle"". 

The young man without thinking jumped out the window after the rock thinking a few broken bones was better than losing a nut. 

It was as he was falling to the ground that the young man saw the third sign ""Chinese torture #3 right testicle tied to bed post"",",So there was this guy,75

post,30k967,2qh72,jokes,false,1427509792,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/30k967/good_golf_bad_sex/,self.jokes,,"Four men were playing a round of gold while in Ireland. One of them sliced, and his ball sailed into a tangle of brush. As he was digging around through the bushes searching for his ball, he surprised a leprechaun.

""Seein' that you found me, I'm bound to grant you a wish"", the leprechaun tells him.

After thinking for a minute, the man starts to answer, but the leprechaun cuts him off. ""I have to warn you though. Leprechaun wishes are tricky things, 'cause every wish comes with a curse too. Say you be wishin' for a billion dollars. I'd give you the money, but I'd also be making you weak and sickly so you wouldn't be enjoying it. So be prepared that I'll give you your wish, but I'll curse you too.""

The man says, ""I love golf, but I've never been very good.  If I wished to be the best golfer in the world, what would your curse be?""

The leprechaun replies, ""I can make you the best golfer the world's ever seen, but if I do I'll make your sex life as bad as your golf game is good.""

After just a moment, the man tells the leprechaun, ""I'll take that deal."" ""So be it"", says the leprechaun, and then he vanishes into the bushes.

From that moment on the man cannot hit a bad shot. His drives are long and straight. His putts are perfect. He hits at least one hole in one in every round he plays. Before long he has the PGA begging him to join the tour, which he does.

Almost a year to the day after his encounter with the leprechaun, he is back in Ireland and at the same course. Overcome with curiosity, he hits a ball into the brush exactly where he'd lost his ball the year before.

Sure enough, when he goes into the bushes he finds the same leprechaun. 

""I'll not be granting you a wish this time"", the leprechaun says. ""The code only requires me to grant you one wish no matter how many times you find me.""  ""That's ok"", the man replies. ""This wish has been more wonderful than I could ever have imagined! Since we met, I've not lost a round and I've set course records at every course I've played. I've even won three PGA majors already.""

The leprechaun smiles, ""Well, that's mighty fine, but how's your sex life been?""  ""Not bad"", the man answers. The leprechaun is incredulous. ""How many times have you had sex this past year?""  ""About 5 or 6 times"",  is the man's answer. ""And you call that not bad?!?"" The leprechaun shouts. The man responds, ""Well, not for a priest from a small parish.""

the road hitchhiking on a very dark night and in the midst of a
big storm.
The night was rolling on and no car went by. The storm was so
strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him.
Suddenly, he saw a car slowly coming towards him and it stopped.
John, desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, got into
the car and closed the door.... Only to realize there was nobody
behind the wheel and the engine wasn't on. 

The car started moving
slowly. John looked at the road ahead and saw a curve approaching.
Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. Then, just before
the car hit the curve, a hand appeared out of nowhere through the
window, and turned the wheel. John, paralyzed with terror, watched
as the hand came through the window, but never touched or harmed him.
Shortly thereafter, John saw the lights of a pub appear down the road,
so, gathering strength, he jumped out of the car and ran to it.. Wet
and out of breath, he rushed inside and started telling everybody about
the horrible experience he had just had.

A silence enveloped the pub when everybody realized he was crying...
And wasn't drunk.
Suddenly, the door opened, and two other people walked in from the dark
and stormy night. They, like John, were also soaked and out of breath.
Looking around, and seeing John Bradford sobbing at the bar, one said to
the other....

The priest again shakes his head. ""No, I have faith that the lord will save me. Find those more in need.""

Adam and Eve said, ""Lord, when we were in the garden, you walked with us every day. Now we do not see you any more. We are lonesome here, and it is difficult for us to remember how much you love us."" 

And God said, ""No problem! I will create a companion for you that will be with you forever and who will be a reflection of my love for you, so that you will love me even when you cannot see me. Regardless of how selfish or childish or unlovable you may be, this new companion will accept you as you are and will love you as I do, in spite of yourselves."" 

And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam and Eve. 

And it was a good animal. 

And God was pleased. 

And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and Eve and he wagged his tail. 

And Adam said, ""Lord, I have already named all the animals in the Kingdom and I cannot think of a name for this new animal."" 

And God said, ""No problem. Because I have created this new animal to be a reflection of my love for you, his name will be a reflection of my own name, and you will call him DOG."" 

And Dog lived with Adam and Eve and was a companion to them and loved them. 

And they were comforted. 

And God was pleased. 

And Dog was content and wagged his tail. 

After a while, it came to pass that an angel came to the Lord and said, ""Lord, Adam and Eve have become filled with pride. They strut and preen like peacocks and they believe they are worthy of adoration. Dog has indeed taught them that they are loved, but perhaps too well."" 

And God said, ""No problem! I will create for them a companion who will be with them forever and who will see them as they are. The companion will remind them of their limitations, so they will know that they are not always worthy of adoration."" 

And God created CAT to be a companion to Adam and Eve. 

And Cat would not obey them. And when Adam and Eve gazed into Cat's eyes, they were reminded that they were not the supreme beings. 

And Adam and Eve learned humility. 

And they were greatly improved.

The man was a respected elder in the community. He was still healthy and strong, but his skin was dark and leathery from years in the sun and his hair was white like wool and also wild. The wife wore colorful moo-moo style dresses and wore her hair short and curly like most grandmothers her age. She liked to attend church regularly and would help with various church functions. This was back in the 60's and the country was still developing and although it was largely Americanized, there were still bits of native culture that hung around. Most of the time their world was modern though, save for a few ceremonies or festivals. One day the wife headed to a church function to help the women prepare food ahead of time. The husband decided to join her later when the event would actually start. The event starts and people start going through line to get food. Eventually, after people had been sitting, eating, and talking for a few minutes, the old man walks in. The room falls silent. His presence instantly catches their eye. The food practically falls out of their mouth as they see what he is wearing. He was wearing a traditional red loincloth on bottom and, of all things, a big wool sweater on top! The loincloth leaves hardly anything to the imagination and the people sitting down to eat tried not to burst out laughing as this elderly man, with most of his butt cheeks exposed, shuffles through the food line filling his plate. When he has a full plate, he walks over to sit next to wife who is glaring at him. When he sits down she gets right up to his ear and hisses at him, ""Why on earth are you wearing that?!"" He takes a bite and with a mouth full of rice replies, ""What? I was cold.""",Culture shock- True story,2

""Come in,"" says the podiatrist, ""What's the problem?""


The moth drops down into the nearest chair and says ""What's the problem? I don't even know where to start. First of all, my boss is a vicious tyrant who gets off on the petty torments he puts me through day in and day out, and I'm too spineless to stand up to him, so I just take it and I've gradually come to hate myself for it. Also, every morning I wake up to the same prune-face old crone to whom I pledged my vows so many years ago. I used to love her, but that love has become like some sun-festering beached whale trying to die. We lost our daughter last year to one of the bitterest, coldest winters we've ever had to face in this region. Isn't it funny, doc, how all the prayer circles and charity drives in the world amount to pretty much nothing in the face of that cold, impartial face of winter, that bleak, pounding, harsh fist of a callous environment, carrying on with its machinations without regard to our lives, loves, hopes and dreams? Isn't that hysterical, Doc? Oh and then there's my son. Doc, I don't love him anymore. I don't know what it is but I look in his eyes and I see that same harried look of gutless cowardice that I see when I stare at my own face in the mirror. If I wasn't such a coward, Doc, I know I'd be able to scrape together enough pride to grab that cocked and loaded shotgun I keep by the bedside table, and just run amok and put an end to this grim facade once and for all. I start with the wife, then the boy of course before putting the barrell in my own mouth. Believe you me, Doc, I'd be doing the world a favor. I have nothing to look forward to but a continuation of this spiraling black hole that is my life, this existential cesspool that is the perpetuation of my lingering skid-mark on society. I despise people yet I crave their approval. I'm judgemental yet I care about nothing. I'm bitter, hateful and afraid. I'm alive yet I feel like the walking dead. This is it, Doc: I am a living, breathing, disease.""



The doctor stares at him for a while then finally says ""Jeez, Moth, you definitely have some problems. But I'm a podiatrist. You need a psychiatrist. Why'd you come in here?""


The moth says,""Your light was on.""",The Moth Joke,87
