They wash your neck and comb your hair and clean your fingernails,

And put you in a padded box away from life's travails.

The box and you goes in a hole that's been dug in the ground.

Reincarnation starts in when you're planted neath that mound.

Them clods melt down, just like the box, and you who is inside.
And that's when you begin your transformation ride.

And in a while the grass will grow upon your rendered mound,

Until some day, upon that spot, a lonely flower is found.

And then a horse may wander by and graze upon that flower

That once was you, and now has become your vegetated bower.

Now, the flower that the horse done eat, along with his other feed,
Makes bone and fat and muscle essential to the steed.

But there's a part that he can't use and so it passes through.

And there it lies upon the ground, this thing that once was you.

And if perchance, I should pass by and see this on the ground,

I'll stop awhile and ponder at this object that I've found.

I'll think about Reincarnation and life and death and such,

And come away concludin', why, you ain't changed all that much.",What is reincarnation? A cowboy asks his friend.,13

""I'm going to put this ladder up against the roof, then I'm going to go up there and I’ll knock the bear off the roof with this baseball bat.  When the bear falls 
off the roof, the pit bull is trained to grab his testicles and not let go. The bear will then be subdued enough for me to put him in the cage in the back of the van.""

He then hands the shotgun to the homeowner.

One day in conversation with a friend, the Mrs. mentioned her husbands snoring problem. Her friend responded that the same thing had happened to her husband and the Mrs should do the same thing. She told the Mrs. that when he - the friends husband - was sleeping she tied a red ribbon around his private parts. It stopped the snoring immediately. The Mrs. was willing to try anything and told her friend she was going to try it. 

That night the Mrs. gently tied the only red ribbon she had around her sleeping husbands privates. The snoring almost completely stopped but continued at a level that made sleep uncomfortable. She scoured the house looking for another red ribbon but to no avail. At last she found a small blue ribbon, and not thinking there was a difference, tied it on, too. 

In the morning when the Mr. went to the bathroom, he looked down and noticed the peculiar ribbons tied around his privates. Chuckling to himself he said, “I don’t know what we did when we were sleeping, little fella, but I think we took first and second place!”",An elderly couple had been struggling to find a way for the Mr. to stop snoring.

One day, the factory catches on fire, and once all of the factory workers regroup, they do accountability. Two people are missing, one of them being our beloved Bill. 

Days go by and nobody has seen Bill, but the coroner has only been able to identify one of the two bodies found in the ash of the burned factory. Since everyone knew that Jacob &amp; Mark had been close friends with Bill for over eight years, the coroner called each of them in to identify the unknown body. 

The coroner first called Jacob in. Jacob looked over the body, and sighed with relief, “phew, nope. Not Bill”. 

The coroner then called Mark in. Mark looked long and hard over the burned body, and said with certainly “no, that ain’t Bill!”. 

The next day, the coroner called Jacob and Mark back in, and informed them that he got the dental records back and that the charred body was indeed Bill. The coroner said “you two have known this man for the better part of a decade, what made you so sure this wasn’t him?”  

Jacob replied, “well every time we would go somewhere, everyone would yell ‘oh shit there’s Bill and those two assholes’. And when we looked over the body we only saw one asshole!”",Three best friends have known eachother since high school...,5

Whilst browsing the plentiful market the old farmer couldn’t help but notice a busty blonde lady and he stared at her longingly. 

“Corrr!” Whispered the old farmer to his pal. “I’ll pay a pretty penny to get me hosepipe drained by that lass” he chortled.

The old farmer’s close and trusted friend glanced over and laughed abruptly. “oh i wouldn’t be doing that” he responded “That there lass is Farmer Derry’s gal, and the last bloke to try it on with her got his ere finger sawn off!”

“Alrite, alryte” mumbled the old farmer and he and his mate plodded on to the next stall.

The old farmer had all but forgotten about the blonde, when suddenly he clocked a beautiful brunette.

“Corrrrrrrr hell!” Barked the old farmer to his mate. “Check out that there bird! I‘ll pay an ‘andsome fee to have that there beautie set off me sprinkler proper like!”

The old farmer’s pal took a good look but then shook his head.
“Nah me ol’ boy, i don’t much think you should be doin’ that.” “That’s Farmer Skinner’s lil un, and the last poor sod to even touch the lass had his noggin’ near blown off! 

The disheartened old farmer sighed and glumly continued to wander around the market stalls. At this point he only had one thing on his mind. 

Nearing the end of market the old farmer spotted a raunchy looking red head.
“Coooorrrrrrr blimey! Bugger me!!” the old farmer squealed. “Would ya look at this ere sweethart!!? I would ‘appily surrender every last penny to have this ere lass polish off me front-end loader!!”

The old farmer’s mate took a long look and paused, before finally he shrugged and said “i think you’re goin’ daft on me mate.” “but if you’re real serious bout’ all this then why don’t you try yer luck and see what ‘appens?”

The old farmer’s eyes lit up and to his pal’s surprise the old farmer marched on over to the redhead and emptied his pockets in a desperate bid for a moment of unrivalled glory. The old farmer’s mate stood stunned and watched as the old farmer and the redhead agreed terms and hurried out the back of the market.

Less than 15 minutes had passed when finally the old farmer skipped gleefully back over to his mate. Grinning like a young school boy the old farmer exclaimed “that there was the best ere money i ever will spend in me whole bleddy life!!!” 
The old farmer’s mate stood in silence. 

The old farmer jestfully rolled up his sleeves and chuckled assuredly “Go on then me ol’ mate, i know you’re hankering to tell me!” “whose the poor ol’ da i should be on the lookie-out for now then?”

The old farmer’s mate looked pale but there was deep concern in his voice as he spoke “Well” he stammered, “I wouldn’t want to upset ye”....

So agreeing, he starts his ascent.

On the second level, he is met by a less ugly naked woman, still saggy boobs but more teeth and less ear hair. 

On level three he sees in front of him an attractive woman, but sees her stretch marks and decides to keep going

Level 4 and before him, laying on a bed of pure silk is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen, she tells him, “there is only one more level, you decide, either stay here with me and make love for eternity or continue on on the ladder of success.

The man had a business trip the next morning so he figured he had a way to kill two birds with one stone: win the argument and make sure he was on time for his flight. He wrote his wife a note and left it on her beside table. It read, 'Wake me up at 5:30 for my flight'.

Feeling rather pleased with his cunning, the man climbed in bed beside his sleeping wife. He awoke some hours later feeling very refreshed. He glanced at the clock and it read 7:14. In a panic, he jumped out of bed. That's when the piece of paper fell off his chest. There, in his wife's elegant script lay a note that read:

Dear Vincent,
 I am feeling pretty sad, because it looks like I won’t be able to plant my tomato garden this year. I’m just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. I know if you were here my troubles would be over.. I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me, like in the old days.

Dear Pop,
 Don’t dig up that garden. That’s where the bodies are buried.

 Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now. That’s the best I could do under the circumstances.

''Oh, is that bad? How can I get rid of it?'' asked the man. ''Come in tomorrow and bring a hard boiled egg and a oreo cookie,'' said the doctor. When he saw a puzzled look cross the man's face, the doctor said, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor! ''

So, the next day the man brings in the hard boiled egg and the oreo cookie. ''Drop your pants, and bend over,'' says the doctor. ''What?'' says the man. ''Trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. So, the man drops his pants and bends over. SWOOSH! The doctor shoves the egg up his rear. ''Whoa! Hold on a minute, Jack!'' screams the man. ''Hold still and trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. 

About a minute later, WOOSH! up goes the oreo cookie. ''Now pull up your pants and come back tomorrow with a hard boiled egg and a oreo cookie,'' says the doctor. As the infuriated man starts to protest the doctor says, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.'' So, the man comes in the next day and he brings the hard boiled egg and the oreo cookie. ''Drop your pants and bend over,'' says the doctor. ''This again?'' yells the man. ''Trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. 

So, the man drops his pants and bends over. WOOSH! The doctor shoves the egg up his rear. ''Oh! I can't believe I'm doing this!'' says the man. ''Hold still now and trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. About a minute later, WOOSH! up goes the oreo cookie. ''Now pull up your pants and come back tomorrow with another hard boiled egg and another oreo cookie,'' says the doctor. As the man starts to shake his head the doctor says, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.'' So, this goes on all week until one day, after the man pulls up his pants, the doctor says, ''Now come in tomorrow and bring a hard boiled egg and a frying pan.'' As the man turns pale the doctor says, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.'' 

The man gets no sleep that night worried to death about what the frying pan is going to feel like when it gets shoved up in him. He almost stays home, but he still feels sick. So far the treatments haven't helped and he's afraid he'll have to start over if he goes to a new doctor. The man comes in the next day and he brings the hard boiled egg and the pan. ''Drop your pants and bend over,'' says the doctor. ''But, why do we need a frying pan?'' asks the man nervously. ''Trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. 

The man drops his pants and bends over. WOOSH! The doctor shoves the egg up his rear. ''Hold still and trust me.'' says the doctor. About a minute later, the man is about to pass out from terror and he is involuntarily clenching his rear as tight as he can. Then nothing happens. Several more minutes pass and he starts to relax. The man is about to straighten up and ask the doctor what happened when the tapeworm sticks its head out his rear and yells, ''Where's my oreo cookie?!'' And SMACK! Down comes the frying pan.

Next St. Peter takes him up to heaven to look around. Everything is white and pristine. People are speaking softly about philosophy and mathematical formulas. Others are simply contemplative and serene. He's bored in about five minutes. 

St. Peter then says to the apartment manager, ""I want you to sleep on it and meet me back here in the morning to let me know your decision."" 

The next morning he comes back and says to St. Peter, ""Heaven is very nice and all, but hell looks great, so I've decided that I want to go to hell"". 

So St. Peter puts him on the escalator down to hell. When he gets there he sees Satan whipping people and there's fire everywhere and everyone is screaming in pain. 

So he goes over to Satan and says ""Hey, what gives here? Yesterday I came here to check the place out and everyone had me partying and it looked like a great time. What happened?""

The man stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes, with the officer quietly observing. 

After what seemed an eternity, in which he tried his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his car and fall into it. 
He sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off. 

Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off; it was a fine, dry summer night, flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked the horn and then switched on the lights. 
He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little, and then remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patrons' vehicles left. 

At last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out and drove slowly down the road. 

The police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, and promptly pulled the man over and administered a breathalyser test. 
To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence that the 
man had consumed any alcohol at all! 
Dumbfounded, the officer said, ""I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyser equipment must be broken.""

""I doubt it,"" said the truly proud Redneck. ""Tonight I'm the designated decoy.""

He's a bit anxious about mixing business and pleasure, but it turns out - mostly - fine. Phyllida helps him with party shirts and a warm jumper for hill walking and chats to Roberta. But when Hugo mentions maybe needing a suit, Phyllida freezes up. ""Formalwear's closed"", she says, though the siblings can plainly see other customers trying things on.

Hugo lets it go and doesn't think about it again until six months later, when Roberta is getting married and he needs a suit for the wedding. Again he and Roberta go to Phyllida's shop, and again she helps with shirts and ties, but comes up with complicated lies to avoid the formalwear department. In the end, Hugo gives up, and gets a suit the following week in another shop. 

Soon after, it's the wedding, and Roberta chooses Phyllida as her maid of honour, so friendly have they become. But later, Roberta pulls Hugo aside.

The victim will usually be a male on his own and will usually be distracted  by navigating the car park with shopping.

He will usually be approached by an attractive female in her early 20s as he enters his car. She  will offer sexual favours for a ride to the next town and will even offer to pay her end before you leave the car park.

If you agree to this she will enter the passenger side door and remove your trousers before engaging in felatio. 

In a coordinated attack a co-conspirator will at this point open a door and steal your wallet from your trousers before making off. If you are not careful and try to give chase, the first girl will likely disappear in the other direction. Leaving you alone, semi naked and penniless.

As stated earlier, this is an on going issue across most major supermarkets and many men have already fallen victim to this new and innovative scam. 

I myself fell prey to the scourge last week. It happened on Thursday, Friday, Sunday, Monday and again today. 

From my experience it seems to occour most often at Tesco stores. Whether this is related to the fact they sell wallets for £1.99 is still undetermined.

Now we begin our story, there was once a young whole grain Cheerio who came across an illegal tattoo parlor able to make you look like another level in the caste.

So he goes in and gets this tattoo. He feels good about himself now. He enjoys life now, he has a high paying job but his ultimate goal is to reach the Honey nut Cheerio. That tattoo is $1000.

Sitting with him in the waiting area are two other much younger men, fidgeting and looking nervous.

The first one is called in. He comes out literally two minutes later, devastated and close to tears. He exits without saying a word. 

Exactly the same happens to the next guy. As he goes out the door the man approaches the receptionist and asks, in barely contained panic.

“ What’s going on? They were in there for barely two minutes!”

“Think outside the box”, came the curt reply. “You’re next”.

The man knocked on the door and tentatively walked into the interview room. Sitting behind a large mahogany desk were two middle aged men, both casually dressed and each with an eye-patch over one eye.

The man with his left eye patch spoke up. “Mr Davids?”

“That’s correct”, replied the man.

“We like your CV”, they both said in unison, “it appears you’ve been round the block a bit, so to speak?”

“Erm..yes…I have been in the industry for a while, now..I…eh…have quite a lot of experience in the field”

“Ahhh”, said the man with the right eye patch, “but can you think outside the box?”

“Yes, yes!” replied Davids, much too eagerly “I always think outside the box!”

Left eye-patch: “Really…you always think outside the box?”

Right eye-patch: “Because, you know, when we work, we like our team to think outside the box”

“Yes, yes, I always think outside the box” he replied

“That’s exactly what the other two said, that no matter what, they always thought outside the box” said left eye patch, “so we showed them both the door!”

“So,” they said, “we will ask you one last time - do you ALWAYS think outside the box?

Silence.

“Mr Davids?”

After isolating the only male monkey, Bobo, into his own cage, the zookeeper believes the matter to be settled. A few weeks later he sees a few more female monkeys getting pregnant. Perplexed, the zookeeper waits outside Bobo's cage at night, and sees that Bobo picks the lock and sneaks off into the female monkey enclosure, sneaking back after a few minutes and placing the lock back on.

The next day, the zookeeper places two heavy duty padlocks on Bobo's cage, and waits again at night to see what happens.  This time, Bobo struggles a lot with the padlocks and it takes the monkey nearly 10 minutes before he gets the first one off and then another 10 minutes to get the other one off. He sneaks off into the female monkey enclosure, and sneaks back a few minutes later, placing both locks back on.

The zookeeper, frustrated beyond measure at all the pregnant female monkeys, finally decides the weld Bobo's cage completely shut so that there is no way he could possibly escape. He waits outside the cage at night, but this time sees a group of female monkeys leaving their enclosure, moving close to Bobo's cage, rubbing their faces and their genitals, and then moving away.

They do this one-by-one, all night, until the zookeeper cannot contain his curiosity any more and finally marches up to Bobo and rattles his cage. ""Listen here matey,  I know for a fact that you've been somehow knocking up these female monkeys. How on earth are you doing it from inside there?""

The fairy says: ""Oh noble knight, you're the first human being to find me in 300 years. So as a reward, I'll grant you three wishes.""

The knight takes some time to think, he already has a castle, money and a beautiful wife. Then he says: ""Make me invulnerable, so I can never lose any battle.""
The fairy snaps her fingers, and it is done. Then the knight says, ""Make my horse invulnerable too, so we both can fearlessly charge into enemy lines.""

The knight needs some time to think again, because he already has everything he could need. After a while, he says, ""Make my genitals as big as my horse's.""
The fairy snaps her fingers again, and it is done.

Proud and excited he leaves the forest and rides back to his castle, where he finds his squire. The knight hands his sword to the squire and orders him to behead his horse. At first, the squire refuses, saying ""I cannot kill your horse, it is the best horse you have ever had, my Lord."" When the knight urges him to, the squire swings the sword with all his might and hits the horse on the neck. Nothing happens.
""Now hit me"", the knight orders and takes off his armor. The squire refuses again, scared, but the knight orders him to. So he hits the knight with the sword on the chest, but again, nothing happens.
The squire cannot believe his eyes as all of his attacks have no effect on either horse or knight.

The poor man replied: “God will provide”

My wife and I decided to visit her hometown near Madrid. 

While we were traveling the countryside via a rented car, we stumbled upon what appeared to be an overturned cart on the side of the road.

Curious, we slowed down and opened the windows to see better. Getting closer, we heard someone shouting for help. 

I got out of the car, while my wife called 112 (their version of 911) to report the incident. Suddenly, I felt very dizzy. The last thing I remembered before blacking out was a maniacal laugh.

When I came to, I was bound, trapped in a dark room with a man (or was it a woman) wearing a mask and a cloak. I tried to scream but I realized my mouth was taped shut. I noticed my wife sitting right next to me, also tied up.

""They call me Tim. Listen here, you two,"" he said in a croaking voice, ""I'm going to enjoy savoring you so much."" 

He walked towards us and tore the tape off my wife's mouth. 

""But I am a good sport. I'll give you a chance. Miss, I'm going to think of a number from 1 to 100. You have one chance to guess and if you get it, I'll set both of you guys free. If not... well I'll be a well-fed man for the next two weeks.""

She was shaking. I was shaking. I knew this guy was probably lying but we had no other option anyway.

""F-forty s-seven!"" she shouted, her voice stuttering.

""...""

""...""

""Wow, holy shit. You actually got it. I didn't expect that at all. That's some intuition you got there. Should've asked the husband instead.""

I felt the dizziness come back, and when I came to, I was back in the car, along with my wife. The overturned cart was no longer to be found.

""W-was that real? I-I can't believe it..."" I muttered weakly.

""I can't believe it too. Though I suppose it was natural,"" my wife replied, ""Nobody expects the Spanish intuition!""",Do not leave your car if you're traveling through the countryside in Spain. [PART 1],3

The genie eyes all three of the awestruck men and nods regally.

""I am a Jinn of the Somali. As you have allowed me to see the outside world once again, I shall grant each of you three wishes.""

The first man recovers quickly, and blurts out ""I wish to be rich!""

The genie snaps his fingers and tens of thousands of hundred-dollar bills appear, stacked neatly in crates, next to them. ""These belong exclusively to you.""

The second dude speaks. ""I've always been a disappointment to my family. No more! Genie, I wish for talents greater than any man in the world!""

The genie snaps his fingers. ""Done. Your stamina is unlimited - you can win any sporting event. And all text that once appeared as gobbledygook will click in your mind the moment you read it. You can become anything you wish.""

The third guy thinks carefully. ""Genie, my life sucks. I've lost my job, my wife, my house, and most of my friends. Only these guys are nice enough to hang around me. So, please...can you make my head rotate parallel to the rotation of the earth around the sun?""

Everybody is surprised by this, including the genie. ""Are you sure?"" he asks.

The third guy nods. ""Certain.""

The genie shrugs. ""So be it."" He snaps his fingers, and there' s no immediate visible change, though the guy does begin to feel a little dizzy. Just a little.

The first man thinks about his second wish. ""Wow, with what you guys said, I think I shouldn't have wasted my wish on something so trivial. Genie, can you please give me the ability to heal anyone with a single touch? With that money and that ability, I can help people across the world!""

The genie snaps his fingers. ""Done.""

The second dude speaks up right away. ""I'd like acceptance letters to every major university in the country, please, so that I can start using my gifts right away!""

The genie snaps his fingers and hundreds of letters appear around his feet. The genie turns to the third guy. ""And you?""

""I'd like my limbs to turn the same way my head does. Same time, too.""

The genie eyes his worn-out clothes balefully and nods. he snaps his fingers, and turns to the first man. ""And what is your final wish?""

""I think I'd like the power to teleport whatever I want wherever I want. That should make it easy to reach any patient in the world, and to bring them whatever they need to keep their lives up.""

The genie snaps his fingers. ""Truly, you have chosen your wishes for the good of humanity.""

The second dude speaks up. ""For my final wish, I want a body that never ages and a mind that can never fill. I'll become a living testament to the greatness of humanity, and will spread my wisdom across the planet for eons.""

The genie snaps his fingers. ""That's dangerously close to two wishes, but I'll allow it, provided you use your newfound abilities to bring humanity farther than it has veer gone before. I have no doubts that you will do that very thing.""

The dude nods eagerly.

The third guy steps forward. ""And finally, Genie, I'd like my torso to do the same as my limbs and head.""

The Genie shakes his head. ""Even I, in all my wisdom, cannot fathom what positive effect this will have on your life. But you clearly understand what you are wishing for, and so I will grant it."" He snaps his fingers.

""If that is all, I will once more return to my lamp."" The genie begins to shrink down and enters his lamp once more.

The three stare at each other, barely believing what has just happened.

""Our lives have changed so much in the last minute,"" the first man says.

""Yeah,"" the second dude replies. ""Hey, what do you say we take our wishes and use them, each on our own paths? Some months from now, we'll all return here and see what we've made of ourselves!""

""Sounds great!"" the third guy answers. ""How about six months?""

They all agree and part ways.

Six months later, they all find themselves at the same spot, facing each other.

The first man is dressed in a robe of white and is clean-shaven. He tells the others ""I know I don't look very different, but I've eliminated illness throughout the whole of Africa and South America, and have left them with cures for nearly every known disease in case it springs up again. I'm known as the White Healer.""

The second man is dressed smartly, as he always was. ""I know I don't look very different, but I'm the President's head consultant, and have invented six new major philosophies and rewrote the boundaries of scientific law. Soon I'll be sending a team of men to Mars - to live permanently. Humanity is advancing leaps and bounds.

The third guy is still in his old, raggy coat and unkempt appearance, and faces them normally. He smiles like the heavens themselves have opened up for him. ""I know I don't look very different, but trust me...my life has done a complete 180.""",Three best friends stumble upon a genie lamp.,5
