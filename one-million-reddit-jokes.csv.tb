I went without breakfast and hurried out to the car, just to realize that I'd locked the house with both house and car keys inside and had to break a window to get my keys. 
 Then, driving a little too fast, I got a speeding ticket. Later, when I was about three blocks from the store, I had a flat tire. 
When I finally got to the store a bunch of people were waiting for me to open up. I got the store opened and started waiting on these people, all the time the darn phone was ringing.""
 He continued, ""Then I had to break a roll of coins against the cash register drawer to make change, and they spilled all over the floor. I had to get down on my hands and knees to pick up the coins and the phone was still ringing. When I came up I cracked my head on the open cash drawer, which made me stagger back against a showcase with a bunch of perfume bottles on it. Half of them hit the floor and broke.
 Meanwhile, the phone is still ringing with no let up, and I finally got back to answer it. It was your wife. She wanted to know how to use a rectal thermometer.""

The priest thought nothing of the hunter and presumed he was using the graveyard as a shortcut to reach the local Tavern. While the Priest was watching, he witnessed the hunter pull down his trousers and take a shit behind one of the gravestones. The hunter finished shitting pulled up his trousers and carried on his way toward the Tavern. The priest being completely shocked at what he had just witnessed did not come to his senses until the hunter had left the area.

The next day the Priest was again tending to the church grounds when he spotted the Hunter walking through the graveyard once again stopping half way to take a shit then carry on towards the Tavern. The Priest hurried after the Hunter into the tavern and found him sat at the bar drinking, the Priest approached the Hunter and asked to purchase one of his freshly caught rabbits for his evening supper. The hunter obliged and carried on with his drinking.

On the third day the Priest hid behind a bush close to the Hunters shitting spot and sure enough the Hunter came wondering by, dropped his trousers and began to shit. The Priest crept up behind the Hunter and placed the butchered rabbits entrails from his previous nights supper underneath the Hunter and scurried away to the Tavern without the shitting Hunter noticing.

Just as the Priest had settled himself at the bar the Hunter came bursting through the Tavern doors demanding the strongest drink in the house.

""Hunter, whats wrong?"" asked the priest with a wry smile on his face. ""It was awful Father"" gasped the Hunter, ""I was taking a shit and looked round to see my guts had come out!"" The Hunter slammed his drink down, demanded another and continued ""It's alright though, I think I got them all back in!""

Rabbi:

***""Tell me: so you're a priest now. Is that it?""***

Priest:

***""Well, what do you mean? I could technically become a Bishop if I devote my whole life to god and the Pope. So there's that.""***

The rabbi thinks for a second and then goes: 

***""Hmmm... alright, so when you become a Bishop. Is that it?""***

The priest is a little bewildered. Nonetheless he answers:

***""Well, theoretically, really, just theoretically, if I meet all the criteria, devote myself even stronger to my faith and get the approval of all my peers I COULD... I COULD theoretically become a Cardinal.""***

The rabbi nods in agreement. After a moment of silence he again asks:

***""Ok, and after you become Cardinal. Is that it?""***

The priest is getting a bit pissy at this point and says:

***""Oh, come on... this is getting ridiculous. Ok, if I am among the most devoted christians on earth, have the right connections, my peers all think highly of me and I never do anything that goes against gods will I could technically... maybe... at some point eventually even become Pope.""***

Again, the rabbi nods in acknowledgement. But again, after a few seconds of thinking, he asks the priest:

***""So then you're the Pope. Is that it?***

The priest has finally had it and he shouts angrily at the rabbi:

***""WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ""IS THAT IT""????"" DO YOU WANT ME TO BECOME GOD???""***

The rabbi keeps his calm, looks smugly the priest and says:

***""Well, you see: one of us managed.""***

For the first experiment, they cut one of the dog's legs off, then they told the dog to walk. The dog got up and walked, so they they learned that a dog could walk with just three legs. 

For the second experiment, they cut off a second leg from the dog, then they told the dog once more to walk. The dog was still able to walk with only two legs. 

For the third experiment, they cut off yet another leg from the dog and once more they told the dog to walk. However, the dog wasn't able to walk with only one leg. 

As a result of these three experiments, the scientists wrote in their final report that the dog had lost it's hearing after having three legs cut off.

post,4mrrow,2qh72,jokes,false,1465197432,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4mrrow/in_the_land_of_cheerios/,self.jokes,,"In the land of Cheerios there is a cast system. At the top there are the king and queen Cheerios, next come the noble Cheerios, then the night Cheerios who are responsible for law enforcement in the land, then come the peasant Cheerios who are somewhat oppressed but work hard and get by, and then there are the gangster Cheerios who break the rules and steal from other hard working Cheerios. Some gangster Cheerios however were born into the gangster Cheerios cast, and want nothing more than to live an honest life, unfortunately, everyone, even the peasant Cheerios look down on them.
One day, a young gangster cheerio who wanted to escape his cast, decided he wanted a friend who was not a gangster cheerio to hang out with. So he went to the peasant Cheerios, and knocked on the door. A peasant cheerio answered, and said ""hello gangster cheerio, how can I help you?"" The gangster cheerio responded ""hi peasant cheerio, I was wondering if you wanted to be friends with me"" the peasant cheerio said ""look, I'm sorry gangster cheerio, but if the knight Cheerios found out that I was friends with a gangster cheerio, they would have me locked up."" The gangster cheerio responds ""that's okay, I understand"" and walks home, a little put out.

The next day, he wakes up, puts on his brave face, and goes out into the country in search of a knight cheerio. He sees one a little ways off and goes over to talk to him. Excuse me, knight cheerio? I was wondering if you wanted tone friends with me"" he said in a hopeful voice. The knight cheerio turned around, looked him up and down, and, with his nose in the air, said ""Gangster cheerio, I should really arrest you right now, but I'll let you off easy, get out of my line of sight, and I won't have to cuff you."" So gangster cheerio walked on home, a little dejected.

The next day, gangster cheerio decided to venture up to the nobles mansion, he hiked up to the front doors, and looked at how fancy it all was, then he wrong the bell. A nobleman cheerio answered, took one look at the gangster cheerio, and slammed the door in his face. Gangster cheerio went home really depressed that night.

The next day gangster cheerio was nervous, today was when he would visit the king, and this was his last chance to make a friend. He trekked on up to the royal palace, and knocked on the door. He was shown in and asked to wait in the sitting room. A few moments later, the king cheerio entered the room. ""King cheerio"" said the gangster cheerio ""will you be friends with me?"" ""Of course I'll be friends with you"" responded the king cheerio. The gangster cheerio was elated.
""So"" said the king cheerio ""what do you want to do now that we are friends, we could either go to the circus, or go to the fair""
""I would like to go to the circus"" said the gangster cheerio. The king pulls out his iPhone and checks four square.
""Well"" he says ""there are a thousand people at the circus, but only dive hundred at the fair""
Alright then, let's go to the fair"" says the gangster cheerio
So they went to the fair and decide they want to go on a ride, there is a roller coaster and a Ferris wheel.
""Do you want to go on the roller coaster, or the Ferris wheel?"" Asks the king
""I would like to go on the Ferris wheel"" says the gangster cheerio
So the king checks four square
""There are four hundred people in line at the Ferris wheel, but only two hundred in line at the roller coaster"" he says
""Alright then, let's do the roller coaster"" says the gangster cheerio
They ride the roller coaster, get off, and decide they are kind of hungry. There are two kinds of food available, hamburgers, and hot diggitty-dogs [do not ask me why they are called that, they just are].
""Do you want hamburgers or hot diggitty-dogs?"" Asks the king
""I would like hamburgers"" says the gangster cheerio
The king checks four square, and says
""There are twenty people in line for hamburgers, but only ten in line for hot diggitty-dogs""
""Alright then, let's get hot diggitty-dogs"" says the gangster cheerio
They finish their hot diggitty-dogs, and realize they are thirsty. There is root beer and punch available.
""Do you want root beer or punch!"" Asks the king
""I would like root beer"" says the gangster cheerio
So the king pulls out his phone, checks four square and sees that there are five people in line for the root beer,

The Shit List:   
The Ghost Shit  The kind where you feel shit come out, see shit on the toilet paper, but there's no shit in the bowl.   

The Clean Shit  The kind where you feel shit come out, see shit in the bowl, but there's no shit on the toilet paper. 

The Wet Shit  You wipe your ass fifty times and it still feels unwiped. So you end up putting toilet paper between your ass and your underwear so you don't ruin them with those dreadful skid marks.   

The Second Wave Shit  This shit happens when you've finished, your pants are up to your knees, and you suddenly realize you have to shit some more.   

The Brain Hemorrahage Through Your Nose Shit  Also known as ""Pop a Vein in Your Forehead Shit"". You have to strain so much to get it out that you turn purple and practically have a stroke.

The Corn Shit  No explanation necessary.   

The Lincoln Log Shit  The kind of shit that's so enormous you're afraid to flush it down without first breaking it up into little pieces with the toilet brush.   

The Nororius Drinker Shit  The kind of shit you have the morning after a long night of drinking. It's most noticeable trait is the tread mark left on the bottom of the toilet bowl after you flush.   

The ""Gee, I Really Wish I Could Shit"" Shit  The kind where you want to shit, but even after straining your guts out, all you can do is sit on the toilet, cramped and farting.   

The Wet Cheeks Shit  Also known as the ""Power Dump"". That's the kind that comes out of your ass so fast that your butt cheeks get splashed with the toilet water.   

The Liquid Shit  That's the kind where yellowish-brown liquid shoots out of your butt, splashes all over the side of the toilet bowl and, at the same time, chronically burns your tender poop-chute.   

The Mexican Food Shit  A class all on its own.   

The Crowd Pleaser  This shit is so intriguing in size and/or appearance that you have to show it to someone before flushing.   

The Mood Enhancer  This shit occurs after a lengthy period of constipation, thereby allowing you to be your old self again.   

The Ritual  This shit occurs at the same time each day and is accomplished with the aid of a newspaper.   

The Guinness Book Of Records Shit  A shit so noteworthy it should be recorded for future generations.   

The Aftershock Shit  This shit has an odour so powerful than anyone entering the vicinity within the next seven hours is affected.   

The ""Honeymoon's Over"" Shit  This is any shit created in the presence of another person.   

The Groaner  A shit so huge it cannot exit without vocal assistance.   

The Floater  Characterized by its floatability, this shit has been known to resurface after many flushings.   

The Ranger  A shit which refuses to let go. It is usually necessary to engage in a rocking or bouncing motion, but quite often the only solution is to push it away with a small piece of toilet paper.   

The Phantom Shit  This appears in the toilet mysteriously and no one will admit to putting it there.   

The Peek-A-Boo Shit  Now you see it, now you don't. This shit is playing games with you. Requires patience and muscle control.   

The Bombshell  A shit that comes as a complete surprise at a time that is either inappropriate to shit (i.e. during lovemaking or a root canal) or you are nowhere near shitting facilities.   

The Snake Charmer  A long skinny shit which has managed to coil itself into a frightening position - usually harmless.   

The Olympic Shit  This shit occurs exactly one hour prior to the start of any competitive event in which you are entered and bears a close resemblance to the Drinker's Shit.   

The Back-To-Nature Shit  This shit may be of any variety but is always deposited either in the woods or while hiding behind the passenger side of your car.   

The Pebbles-From-Heaven Shit  An adorable collection of small turds in a cluster, often a gift from God when you actually can't shit.   

Premeditated Shit  Laxative induced. Doesn't count.   

Shitzopherenia  Fear of shitting - can be fatal!   

Energizer Vs. Duracell Shit  Also known as a ""Still Going"" shit.   

The Power Dump Shit  The kind that comes out so fast, you barely get your pants down when you're done.   

The Liquid Plumber Shit  This kind of shit is so big it plugs up the toilet and it overflows all over the floor. (You should have followed the advice from the Lincoln Log Shit.)   

The Spinal Tap Shit  The kind of shit that hurts so much coming out, you'd swear it's got to be coming out sideways.   

The ""I Think I'm Giving Birth Through My Asshole"" Shit  Similar to the Lincoln Log and The Spinal Tap Shits. The shape and size of the turd resembles a tall boy beer can. Vacuous air space remains in the rectum for some time afterwards.   

The Porridge Shit  The type that comes out like toothpaste, and just keeps on coming. You have two choices: a) flush and keep going, or B) risk it piling up to your butt while you sit there helpless.   

The ""I'm Going To Chew My Food Better"" Shit  When the bag of Doritos you ate last night lacerates the insides of your rectum on the way out in the morning.   

The ""I Think I'm Turning Into A Bunny"" Shit  When you drop lots of cute, little round ones that look like marbles and make tiny splashing sounds when they hit the water.   

The ""What The Hell Died In Here?"" Shit  Also sometimes referred to as ""The Toxic Dump"". Of course you don't warn anyone of the poisonous bathroom odor. Instead, you stand innocently near the door and enjoy the show as they run out gagging and gasping for air.   


The ""I Just Know There's A Turd Still Dangling There"" Shit  Where you just sit there patiently and wait for the last cling-on to drop off because if you wipe now, it's going to smear all over the place.",THE SHIT LIST,0

Well, what do you know, there's a celebrity in the restaurant: reality TV star, real estate mogul, and Presidential hopeful, Donald Trump. The young woman, who happens to be attractive, boldly walks up to his table and says,

""Mr Trump, I know this is very forward of me, but I'm a huge admirer. My family has donated to your campaign and we've all turned out for your rallies. I'm having an interview in this restaurant in a few minutes and it would make such a good impression if you dropped by my table and said hello.""

Trump, mellow with good food and drink, and charmed by her appearance and enthusiasm agrees to do her this favour. Soon the young woman is chatting with her potential boss and mentor over their meals. On his way out, Trump stops by and greets the young woman like an old friend. She rolls her eyes, gives an exasperated sigh, and says, ""Fuck off, Don, we're trying to eat.""",A graduate has an interview at a fancy restaurant,13

Benny was a simple man with simple talents and simple desires. He was a quiet fellow who loved to walk the beach when he had some time to spare. He was the kind of guy you wouldn't mind having a drink with, but anything more might be tedious. One day, as Benny was walking the beach, he stumbled over a small black jar-shaped object. Benny curiously picked it up and began to brush off the sand.

*Woosh*

Benny winced as sand flew into his eyes, blinding him temporarily. By the time he opened his eyes, a shadow had been cast over him.

**""I AM KHALROG, GENIE OF THE URN, YOU HAVE AWOKEN ME FROM MY SLUMBER. WHAT IS YOUR ONE TRUE DESIRE?""** the genie bellowed.

Stunned, Benny could hardly believe what he was seeing. Benny thought for a moment as he regained his senses. Then he began to speak, ""Well, I've always wanted a magnificent beard. I've always had a hard time with the ladies and I hear great beards are a wonderful attraction.""

**""VERY WELL,""** replied the genie, **""YOU MAY HAVE YOUR BEARD. HOWEVER, I MUST WARN YOU THAT THIS BEARD COMES AT A PRICE: YOU MUST NEVER SHAVE IT OFF.""**

Benny thought for a moment, then agreed to the genie's conditions. A brilliant beard protruded from Benny's chin and grew and grew until finally it reached his belly. This was fantastic! Surely he would be a ladies' man now!

Years passed by as Benny became an icon of beard lovers everywhere. He won contest after contest and seducing women had never been easier. Then one day, he met the woman of his dreams. They went on several dates together before she revealed to him that she would love nothing else than to see him without his beard. Benny loved his beard, but he loved this woman much more. Reluctantly, he agreed to shave it off in the morning.

The next morning, Benny grabbed his razor and started to shave his beard.


*POOF*


Suddenly, Benny was teleported into a round, black room!

""Egad!"" Benny cried. ""Where am I!?""

**""YOU HAVE DISOBEYED THE ONE RULE, BENNY,""** a voice behind him roared.

Benny stammered, ""But I... I... it's only a beard! Why are you doing this to me?""

The genie replied, **""I AM THE GENIE OF THE URN, BENNY. I HAVE RULES. WHEN THOSE RULES ARE BROKEN, YOU MUST BE PUNISHED.""**

""So... so... what's my... my punishment then?"" Benny stuttered.

**""YOU WILL REMAIN HERE IN MY URN FOR ALL ETERNITY AND THE WORLD WILL KNOW YOUR FAULTS.""** the genie exclaimed.


And from that day forth, Benny has taught all Bennys everywhere the most important lesson of all:

A man's car breaks down on a winding road far from anything. He notices a gate going up a hill leading to a small bar. He follows the gate, gets inside the bar and asks the bartender if he can phone a tow truck. The bartender let's him.

After he calls the tow truck the man takes a seat at the bar, and says ""Thanks, the tow truck is gonna be a while"" then orders a guinness.

After a bit of silence the bartender says ""Hey, did you notice that nice long gate outside the bar? I built it by hand, pretty nice gate, wouldn't you say?""

Being a helpful guy, John tells him there's a new robot in a store down the road that, if you pour your urine into it and insert a dollar bill, it will diagnose any illness that you may have. Hardly believing what he was told, Bob pees into the cup and goes to the store to check it out for himself. Sure enough, there was this robot all new and shiny. So he inserts a dollar bill, and pours his urine into a special receptacle. The robot starts beeping, and seconds later prints out a piece of paper that reads. 

""You have a simple sprain. Put a cold compress on your arm and avoid heavy lifting, and your arm will get better in a week"" 

Bob is amazed at how advanced technology has become, and immediately starts thinking about ways to beat the robot. When he gets home, he shares the news with his wife and daughter and asks them to pee into the cup, to which they happily oblige. He then walks over to the kitty litter box, picks up the poop and places it into the cup with the urine. He then mixes the concoction with tap water and for good measure, beats one off right into the cup. The next day he returns to the store, inserts a dollar bill, and pours his entire concoction into the receptacle. After the customary beeps, the robot prints out an even longer piece of paper. It reads: 

"" 1.Your tap water has too much iron. Buy a filter. 

  2.Your cat has worms. Take it to a vet. 

 3.Your daughter shoots up heroin. Take her to rehab ASAP.

Thinking for a while, James turns to John and says, ""Hey, man, if we lie and say we're Muslim, they'll be sure to let us in!"" John replies, ""Look, you can do that if you want. But I don't want to be dishonest.""

So they finally approach the mosque and a worshipper exits. He smiles at them and says, ""You must be very tired. Tell me, what are your names?"" John truthfully says his name, but James thinks for a bit and says, ""My name is Muhammad.""

The worshipper turns to John and says, ""Hello, John. I'll get some food and water for you right away."" Then he turns to James and says, ""Hello, Muhammad. Ramadan murabak!""

He had tractor models, tractor wallpaper, remote control miniature tractors, tractor board games, even some tractor porn(which is not easy to find mind you). The only thing that even came close to his love for tractors, was the love he felt for his wife. His high school sweetheart, who didn't mind his infatuation with tractors one bit. She didn't even mind the role play where she would dress as a tractor, he would dress as a farmer, and he would take her for a ""ride"". Sadly his wife was struck one day, a tractor fell off the back of a transport truck. She didn't die until he was at her side in the hospital. Her dying words ""don't blame the tractor honey"" and with that she headed to the big farm in the sky. Sadly, he did blame the tractor, he hated them now with all his mind, body, and soul. He went home and destroyed ALL his tractor related items, the toys, his wifes tractor suit, and even his collection of tractor porn. He put it all in a pile and burned it in the yard. What ever didn't burn enough to his liking was thrown into a woodchipper. He then went inside, rarely leaving his home, for 8 years. Finally on the 8th anniversary of his darling wifes death he decided it was time to get back out in the dating world, plus the cute cashier at the grocery store had been asking him out for a while now, he called her out to dinner. The restaurant he choose ended up being quite nice, good food, good service, great decor. But there was one problem, it was EXTREMELY smoky. So smoky that his date, being an asthmatic, was having some trouble breathing. After noticing her displeasure, and trouble breathing, he started breathing in. I mean REALLY breathing in. Inhaling with such force that all the smoke quickly left the dining room, and went into his lungs. When the room was void of smoke he stepped outside and released it all into the night. When he rejoined his date she asked ""how on earth did you do that?"" to which he replied, ""I'm an extractor fan.""",The man who loved tractors.,11

The second man jumps back out the window and the first man walks to it and watches as he stops just before hitting the ground, and like being pushed be a rush of air, flies back up and into the window.
""That looks amazing! I have to try it!"" The second man moves over and the first jumps out the window. He feels amazing as he's free falling, completely sure he's going to pop back up before the fatal landing. Then he splatters everywhere when he hits the ground.

Sluts can be white, black, brown, pink, or almond
They can be skinny with big tits or be skinny with small ones
Sluts can be perky, preppy or posh with their brains and their clothes all shrunk from the wash
But other sluts are pretty and funny and smart
These sluts can lift all your thoughts from your dick to your heart
They can talk about science, music, or art
They can put you together or they can pull you apart

Paddy and Maddy decide one day they want to explore the new world. So they get on a boat and travel to America. In New York they get on a train bound for the wild west. Once there, they find themselves having the best of times. But soon they're broke. All they had was either gambled, whored or drunk away.
With their last, they find themselves sitting at the bar in a saloon drinking.
Paddy looks to Maddy and says, ""Maddy we're fook'd. We're fookin' broke... What're we gonna do?""
To which Maddy replies, ""I've got no fookin' idea Paddy.""
No sooner has Maddy replied when the swing-doors of the saloon are flung open and a cowboy walks in. He coolly walks up to the bar, takes a head out of the sack he is carrying and places it on the counter. The barman puts the head under the counter, opens the register, takes some money from it, grabs a bottle from the shelf and hands it all to the cowboy.
Paddy and Maddy see this and curiosity gets the better of them. So Paddy asks the barman, ""What the fook was that all about?""
""My parents were killed by a bunch of indians. So anytime someone brings me an indian's head I give them a hundred bucks and a bottle of Jack's finest.""
With this seeming like the end to their troubles, they storm out and jump on some horses. They travel over hills and through valleys untill they find themselves on a ridge. Down in the valley, they spot a lone shaman by a river. Before Maddy could say anything Paddy is chasing the man down, knife in hand, tackles him from his horse and starts hacking at the poor soul's neck.
As all this is happening Maddy spots movement on the ridge, where thousands and thousands of indians come over the ridge, bows and arrows in hand, looking down at the spectacle below.
Maddy shouts: ""Paddy, are ya seein' this?!""
And Paddy shouts back, ""Not now Maddy, can't ya see I'm busy?!""
""Paddy, ya gotta look up and see this!""
""Fook off Maddy, I'm busy!""
""For fook sake! Look up man!""
Paddy finally looks up, sees the horde and still cutting, shouts to Maddy, ""Ya know what this means?!""
To which Maddy replies, ""Aye... We're gonna be fookin' millionaires!!!""

He was the cause of a large number of groaners. Even Ferdinand Feghoot could be outpunned on occasion – but he always rose to the challenge.

He conducted a crew of new S.A.R.H. (Society for the Aesthetic Rearrangement of History) recruits – all from late twentieth-century Terra – on a training study of Carter’s World, a newly established agricultural colony attempting to support itself by the export of edible nuts. Barely into their second generation, and having yet to show a profit, the colonists were technologically backward. Nevertheless, they showed a surprising ingenuity in the use of their few advantages. It was this resourcefulness that Feghoot was demonstrating to his rookies.

“Look at the perfection with which these streets are graded”, exclaimed one student. “Earth-moving machinery on this scale is strictly high technology stuff. How can they do it?”

“A new alleyway is being constructed, nearby”, said Feghoot. “Let us walk that way while I explain.” As they strolled, he told his students that countless centuries before, the Carter’s World system had been inhabited by a now-vanished race of giants. This very planet had served them for a nursery, and among the many artifacts they had left were thousands of childrens blocks, immense and precision-cut. You simply jack one up onto logs, bring it where you want it, put collapsible jacks underneath, snake out the logs, spread soil more or less evenly beneath, and collapse the jacks.

“I see”, said the student. “It’s not graded road at all; its a simple hammered-earth base.”

“That’s right,” Feghoot went on smoothly. “You just hit the road jack and don’t come back no mo.”

His students registered dismay and anguish.

“Isn’t that right, old-timer?,” Feghoot demanded of an ancient Carterian standing by the mouth of the newly completed alley they had just reached.

“Ahm afraid not, suh”, said the senior citizen, and the students giggled at Feghoots discomfiture. “Oh, we used to do it that way, but it was far too much trouble. It’s the soil heah. You see, the very same soil which produced our famous cashews is so high in clay content that a child could roll out a road of it. Then, we simply use a system of lenses to bake it into hardness. Ahve just completed this alley mahself, and ahm just a retired professor of Sports History, much too old and feeble to handle hydraulic jacks.

“So you see,” he finished, eyes twinkling, “Mah hammered alley is really cashews clay.”

Howls of agony rose from the students, but Feghoot never hesitated. “And he”, he said, turning to his students, “is clearly the gradist.”",Remembering the legend..,0

He spotted an adult store and decided to check it out. Walking around the store, he saw all sorts of toys and  gadgets of pleasure. Dildos and vibrators of all shapes and sizes filled the aisles,  almost overwhelming him. 

The store's clerk spotted him and asked if he was looking for anything in particular. 

""Uh, I'm looking for something that can keep my wife happy for two weeks.  You know,  something special"" replied the man. 

""Ah,  I have just the thing. The new Bolto should do just fine.  10 inches of pure power,  it's sure to satisfy any lady"",  said the clerk. 

""Nah,  that's not impressive enough. I need something really unusual to pleasure her.""

""How about the Rumble Rod?  My customers tell me stories of them orgasming within seconds of using this product?""

""Look, my wife and I have the best sex in the world,  and I need a product that can match that.  Surely you have something?"" said the man. 

After deliberating for a minute,  the clerk goes into the store room and comes out with an ornate ebony box.  

""This my friend,  is the Voodoo Dick."" said the clerk. 

""Okay,  what's so special about it?"" said the man. 

""Allow me to demonstrate. 'Voodoo Dick!  The door!!!'""

Suddenly,  a massive black wooden phallus shoots out of the box and heads straight for the door,  pummelling it until it's reduced to splinters. 

""And to return it to the box,  you just say 'Voodoo Dick!  The box!!! ""

Immediately,  the Voodoo Dick returns to the box. 

""Wow!"" says the man. ""I gotta get this"". 

""I'm sorry,  but it's not for sale"", replies the clerk. 

""Come on,  I need to have it.  Tell you what,  I'll pay you $50,000 for that."" 

""Well, I guess I can do that.  It's a deal."" says the clerk. 

The man,  satisfied with his purchase,  returns home to his wife.  He presents the box to her and tells her how to use it.  

""You see, all you have to do to use it is to say 'Voodoo Dick', then say the location of where you want it to go. Understand?""

""Oh wow"", says the wife.  ""I can't wait to try it.""

The next day,  the man leaves for his business trip.  After a hew hours,  the wife starts feeling horny. She decides that it's time to take out the Voodoo Dick. 

After taking off her underwear,  she says ""Voodoo Dick!  My pussy!!"" 

Immediately,  the Voodoo Dick shoots out and starts hammering her pussy.  The lady is in awe,  it's the best sensation she's ever had,  even better than sex with her husband.  She orgasms several times and decides that she's had enough. She tries to pull the Voodoo Dick out but it won't budge. 

In panic,  she takes a pair of pliers and tries grabbing on to it,  but it keeps on hammering her. 

Apparently,  in his excitement,  her husband had forgotten to tell her how to stop the Voodoo Dick. 

Barely able to stand up,  she gets to her car and starts rushing to the hospital.  She blazes down the highway going 50 over the speed limit.  Within minutes, she spots a police car behind her and pulls over. 

A policeman steps out and walks to her window. ""Ma'am,  do you know how fast you were going?"" he asks. 

The woman,  barely able to keep her composure struggles to speak ""Y-y-y-yes off-f-fficer.  You s-see,  I have this V-v-voodoo Dick in my vagina and I'm rushing to the ho-ho-hospital to get it out? 

""A what you say?"",  replies the officer. 

""A Voodoo Dick"" says the woman.

Naturally, she was very upset. “You are a disrespectful pig!” she cried. “How dare you do this to me! I’m a faithful wife, the mother of your children! I’m leaving you. I want a divorce right away!”
The husband replied, “Hang on just a minute love, so at least I can tell you what happened.”
“Go ahead,” she sobbed, “but they’ll be the last words you’ll say to me!”
So the husband began, “Well, I was getting into the car to drive home, and this young lady here asked me for a lift. She looked so down and out and defenseless that I took pity on her and let her into the car.
I noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty. She told me that she hadn’t eaten for three days. So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night. The ones you wouldn’t eat because you’re afraid you’ll put on weight. The poor thing devoured them in moments!
Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so I threw them away. Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don’t wear because you say they are too tight.
I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don’t wear because I don’t have good taste. I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don’t wear just to annoy her and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don’t wear because someone at work has a pair the same.”
The husband took a quick breath and continued, “She was so grateful for my understanding and help that as I walked her to the door, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said…”

In turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt, and the deeply religious couple produced six children: Holie Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Giva Schitt, Bull Schitt and the twins, Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt.

Against her parents objections, Deep Schitt married Dump Schitt, a high school drop-out. After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced. Noe Schitt later married Mr. Scherlock, and because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name. She was then known as Noe Schitt-Sherlock.

Dip Schitt married Loada Schitt and they produced a nervous son, Chicken Schitt. Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony. The wedding announcement in the newspapers announced the Schitt-Happens wedding. They created a bumper sticker and made millions. You've probably seen it...

The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd and Hoarse. Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world. He recently returned from Italy with his new bride Pisa Schitt.

My wonderful girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. There was only one little thing bothering me—it was her beautiful younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight miniskirts, and generally was bra-less. She would regularly bend down when she was near me, and I always got more than a nice view. It had to be deliberate. Because she never did it when she was near anyone else.

One day her “little” sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn’t overcome. She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. Well, I was in total shock, and couldn’t say a word.

She said, “I’m going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.”

I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door.

I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car. Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!

With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and said, “We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn’t ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.”

First Herman has the lead, then it's Berman, then Herman, then Berman and Herman finally wins. ""Darn, I want a rematch tomorrow"" says Berman, to which Herman agrees.

It is the next day and the horses line up, ready to go. The lunch bell goes off and so do the horses. First Herman has the lead, then it's Berman, then Herman, then Berman and Herman finally wins by a smidgen. This continues to happen every single day. It's always a close race with Herman and Berman boxing it out for first and Herman winning by a smidgen. This becomes a lunch time tradition. It is the highlight of the day to all of the farm animals. The dog, the pigs, the cows, chickens, etc. all love the race, despite the incredibly consistent outcome. 

The farmer soon realizes how incredibly talented the two horses are. He enters them in an actual race and hires rookie jockys. Berman is stokked. ""Today is the day you go down. My jocky is lighter than yours"" says Berman to Herman. ""We'll see about that"" replies Herman. The gun sets the race off. Immediately Herman and Berman smoke the field. The race will clearly be won by either Herman or Berman. They horses get 100m away from the finish in a dead tie. Herman inches ahead. Then comes Berman. Then Herman. Then Berman. Aaand Herman wins.

This continues for every race of the two horse's careers. The two become famous as an unstoppable duo and never place anything but first or second. 

Finally, the two horses retire. They are just too old to race competitively anymore. But they still race around the farm every lunch break to the same result. 

Herman and Berman finally have one last race. All the animals gather to watch. The two horses are way too old to race, but they try their hardest. The bell goes off and the two run off. They are significantly slower than their youth days, but they have some zest to them yet. Herman takes a quick lead over Berman, but Berman catches up as the round the barn. Berman takes a slight lead at the halfway point and the Herman nudges ahead soon thereafter. Then it's Berman. Then Herman. And Berman. And Herman. And Berman and Heman and Berman. AAand BERMIN WINS.

""Ha take that!"" shouts Berman to Herman. ""I won!"". ""No you didn't, I won"" replies Herman. They argue for a little while and then the dog says ""No, Berman definitely won, but only by a little"". At that point, both horses say in unison ""Oh my gosh! A talking dog!""","Once upon a time, two race horses were born...",5

""This here is your ripcord, you pull this when you want the chute to open,"" he says, pointing to a large handle hanging in the front.

""Then, if that don't work, you wait 10 seconds and then pull this emergency chute cord in the rear,"" he says, pointing to a smaller handle on the guy's shoulder.

""OK,"" says the guy, ""what if the chute still doesn't open?""

The instructor rolls his eyes (in his mind), and says, ""If the chute still doesn't open, just shout 'Buddha, Buddha, Buddha' and a giant hand will swoop out of the sky and release you safely on the ground.""

So the guy gets in the airplane, they reach jumping altitude, and away he jumps.

When it's time, he pulls the ripcord, and as luck would have it, his parachute doesn't open. He waits 10 seconds --more like panics for 10 seconds -- and pulls the emergency cord. The chute still doesn't open.

He opens his mouth and yells ""Buddha Buddha Buddha!"" and instantly a giant hand appears out of nowhere, scoops him up in the sky, and deposits him safely on the ground.

The day was really quite beautiful, 
and the drink facilitated some deep thinking on various topics.

Finally I thought about the age old question:
Is giving birth more painful than getting kicked in the nuts?

Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful 
than a guy getting kicked in the nuts.


Well, after another soda, and some heavy deductive thinking, 
I have come up with the answer to that question.

Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby; 
and here is the reason for my conclusion.

A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, 
""It might be nice to have another child.""

On the other hand, you never hear a guy say, 
""You know, I think I would like another kick in the nuts.""

The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. 

Again, there was no response.

Annoyed by what he perceived to be the pump’s haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said impatiently, ""Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Do not ignore us this way! Take us to your leader or I will fire!""

Half an hour passed. 
When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.

1. You must first learn to pronounce the city name, Atlana. Old-timers are still allowed to call it Alana.
2. The morning rush hour is from 5:00 am to noon. The evening rush hour is from noon to 7:00 pm. Friday's rush hour starts on Thursday morning.
3. The minimum acceptable speed on I-285 is 80 mph. On I-75 and I-85, your speed is expected to at least match the highway number. Anything less is considered 'Wussy'.
4. Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere. Atlanta has its own version of traffic rules. For example, Ferraris and Lamborghinis owned by sports stars go first at a four-way stop. Cars/trucks with the loudest muffler go second. The trucks with the biggest tires go third. The HOV lanes are really designed just for the slow Floridians passing through who are used to hogging the left lane everywhere.
5. If you actually stop at a yellow light or stop sign, you will be rear ended, cussed out, and possibly shot. Unless there is a police car nearby.
6. Never honk at anyone. Ever. Seriously. It's another offense that can get you shot.
7. Road construction is permanent and continuous. Detour barrels are moved around for your entertainment pleasure during the middle of the night to make the next day's driving a bit more exciting. Generally, city roads other than the main streets have more potholes and bumps (usually speed bumps) than most dirt roads in the countryside.
8. Watch carefully for road hazards such as drunks, possums, skunks, dogs, barrels, cones, furniture, cats, mattresses, shredded tires, squirrels, rabbits, and crows.
9. Be aware that spelling of street names may change from block to block, e.g., Clairmont, Claremont, Clairmonte.
10. If someone actually has their turn signal on, wave them to the shoulder immediately to let them know it has been “accidentally activated”.
11. If you are in the left lane and only driving 75 in a 55-65 mph zone, k, e.g., you are considered a road hazard and will be “flipped off” accordingly. If you return the flip, you'll be shot.
12. For summer driving, it is advisable to wear potholders on your hands.",HOW TO DRIVE IN ATLANTA,40

post,4mbyky,2qh72,jokes,false,1464942974,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4mbyky/the_bronze_statues/,self.jokes,,"A tourist wanders into a back-alley antique shop in San Francisco's Chinatown. Picking through the objects on display he discovers a detailed, life-sized bronze sculpture of a rat. The sculpture is so interesting and unique that he picks it up and asks the shop owner what it costs. 

""Twelve dollars for the rat, sir,"" says the shop owner, ""and a thousand dollars more for the story behind it.""

""You can keep the story, old man,"" he replies, ""but I'll take the rat.""

The transaction complete, the tourist leaves the store with the bronze rat under his arm. As he crosses the street in front of the store, two live rats emerge from a sewer drain and fall into step behind him. Nervously looking over his shoulder, he begins to walk faster, but every time he passes another sewer drain, more rats come out and follow him. By the time he's walked two blocks, at least a hundred rats are at his heels, and people begin to point and shout. He walks even faster, and soon breaks into a trot as multitudes of rats swarm from sewers, basements, vacant lots, and abandoned cars. Rats by the thousands are at his heels, and as he sees the waterfront at the bottom of the hill, he panics and starts to run full tilt. 

No matter how fast he runs, the rats keep up, squealing hideously, now not just thousands but millions, so that by the time he comes rushing up to the water's edge a trail of rats twelve city blocks long is behind him. Making a mighty leap, he jumps up onto a light post, grasping it with one arm while he hurls the bronze rat into San Francisco Bay with the other, as far as he can heave it. Pulling his legs up and clinging to the light post, he watches in amazement as the seething tide of rats surges over the breakwater into the sea, where they drown. 

Shaken and mumbling, he makes his way back to the antique shop.

""Ah, so you've come back for the rest of the story,"" says the owner.

""No,"" says the tourist, ""I was wondering if you have a bronze politician?"" ",The Bronze Statues,3

The other day Jim and I were walking around town when, out of nowhere, we get run over by a truck and die, and we both go straight to hell.

In hell, I'm greeted by the devil, who tells me that I have two choices: I can either stay in hell being tortured for all of eternity, or I can have sex with the ugliest women there, and if I'm able to finish, I'll be free to go.

I think this over, and figure how ugly could she be? And I agree to give it a try.

So Satan leads me to this little bedroom, and tells me to make myself comfortable. So I strip down to my socks and sit on the bed to wait for my partner to arrive.

Soon, I hear on a booming knock on the door, and in comes the ugliest woman in Hell. Trust me when I tell you: whatever you're picturing, this woman is infinitely worse.

Her face (if you can call it a face) was covered in oozing sores, eyes so sunken back in her head I wondered if they had fallen out, her mouth half filled with the jagged remains of teeth, and a mess of thick wirey hairs poked out from her chin. Even from across the room her breath hit me harder than the truck that sent me there in the first place.

Her body was hunched and lumpy - I honestly couldn't tell which lumps were which parts of her anatomy, even after she had removed her clothes. It was just a heap of flesh and lard that looked like it had never been washed in the hundred and fifty or so years that it looked like she'd been alive.

She walked to the bed, grunting something that I took to mean that it was time to get started.

My penis had shot back into my body like a turtle head, but I knew that my only chance of escaping an eternity of torment was to finish this deed.

So, I closed my eyes, held my breath, and with intense concentration, I was able to get half an erection, and the she-beast climbed on top.

Let me tell you, even with my eyes closed and breath held, there was no escaping the texture. The thick, pungent, sticky... stuff down there made it difficult to keep from vomiting. But I just went into a zen state, imagined it was just a congealed and rotting cheese sandwich, and after a while, I had the most unwilling orgasm of my life (or afterlife).

The thing left the room, and the devil walked in, amazed that I was able to complete the task, as many had tried, but none had yet succeeded. But he agreed to keep his end of the bargain, and led me out the door.

As we were walking toward the exit, we passed another bedroom door, and through it I saw Jim, having sex with Jennifer Lawrence.

""Whoah, Satan,"" I said, ""What the heck? I had to have sex with that creature, but
