Hillary Clinton steals three pastries and puts them in her pocket.
She says to Donald Trump ""See how clever I am? The owner didn't see anything and I don't even need to lie.‚Äù I will definitely win the election.

Donald Trump: ""That's the typical dishonesty you have displayed throughout your entire life, trickery and deceit. I am going to show you an honest way to get the same result.""

Donald Trump goes to the owner of the bakery and says, ""Give me a pastry and I will show you a magic trick."" Intrigued, the owner accepts and gives him a pastry. Trump swallows it and asks for another one. The owner gives him another one. Then Donald asks for a third pastry and eats that, too.

The owner is starting to wonder where the magic trick is and asks, ""What did you do with the pastries?"" Donald Trump replies, ""Look in Hillary's pocket"".",How did Trump win?,431

They get drunk and wake up in jail, only to find that they are to be executed in the morning ‚Äì though none of them can remember what they did the night before.

The first one, a redhead, is strapped in the electric chair and is asked if she has any last words. 
She says, ‚ÄúI just graduated from Trinity Bible College and believe in the almighty power of God to intervene on the behalf of the innocent.‚Äù 
They throw the switch and nothing happens. 
They all immediately fall to the floor on their knees, beg for forgiveness, and release her.

The second one, a brunette, is strapped in and gives her last words. 
‚ÄúI just graduated from the Harvard School of Law and I believe in the power of justice to intervene on the part of the innocent.‚Äù 
They throw the switch and again, nothing happens. 
Again they all immediately fall to their knees, beg for forgiveness and release her.

post,5c3gul,2qh72,jokes,false,1478723018,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5c3gul/to_the_citizens_of_the_united_states_of_america/,self.jokes,,"To the citizens of the United States of America, in light of your failure to elect a competent President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today.

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II resumes monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy.

Your new prime minister (The Right Honourable Theresa May, MP for the 97.8% of you who have, until now, been unaware there's a world outside your borders) will appoint a Minister for America. Congress and the Senate are disbanded. A questionnaire circulated next year will determine whether any of you noticed.

To aid your transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:

1. Look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Check ""aluminium"" in the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you pronounce it. The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'favour' and 'neighbour'. Likewise you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up ""vocabulary.""

Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up ""interspersed."" There will be no more 'bleeps' in the Jerry Springer show. If you're not old enough to cope with bad language then you should not have chat shows.

2. There is no such thing as ""U.S. English."" We'll let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take account of the reinstated letter 'u'.

3. You should learn to distinguish English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard. English accents are not limited to cockney, upper-class twit or Mancunian (Daphne in Frasier). Scottish dramas such as 'Taggart' will no longer be broadcast with subtitles.You must learn that there is no such place as Devonshire in England. The name of the county is ""Devon."" If you persist in calling it Devonshire, all American States will become ""shires"" e.g. Texasshire Floridashire, Louisianashire.

4. You should relearn your original national anthem, ""God Save The Queen"", but only after fully carrying out task 1.

5. You should stop playing American ""football."" There's only one kind of football. What you call American ""football"" is not a very good game. The 2.1% of you aware there is a world outside your borders may have noticed no one else plays ""American"" football. You should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls.

Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American ""football"", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies).

You should stop playing baseball. It's not reasonable to host an event called the 'World Series' for a game which is not played outside of America. Instead of baseball, you will be allowed to play a girls' game called ""rounders,"" which is baseball without fancy team stripe, oversized gloves, collector cards or hotdogs.

6. You will no longer be allowed to own or carry guns, or anything more dangerous in public than a vegetable peeler. Because you are not sensible enough to handle potentially dangerous items, you need a permit to carry a vegetable peeler.

7. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 2nd will be a new national holiday. It will be called ""Indecisive Day.""

8. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. All road intersections will be replaced with roundabouts, and you will start driving on the left. At the same time, you will go metric without the benefit of conversion tables. Roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour.

9. Learn to make real chips. Those things you call French fries are not real chips. Fries aren't French, they're Belgian though 97.8% of you (including the guy who discovered fries while in Europe) are not aware of a country called Belgium. Potato chips are properly called ""crisps."" Real chips are thick cut and fried in animal fat. The traditional accompaniment to chips is beer which should be served warm and flat.

10. The cold tasteless stuff you call beer is actually lager. Only proper British Bitter will be referred to as ""beer."" Substances once known as ""American Beer"" will henceforth be referred to as ""Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine,"" except for the product of the American Budweiser company which will be called ""Weak Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine."" This will allow true Budweiser (as manufactured for the last 1000 years in Pilsen, Czech Republic) to be sold without risk of confusion.

11. The UK will harmonise petrol prices (or ""Gasoline,"" as you will be permitted to keep calling it) for those of the former USA, adopting UK petrol prices (roughly $6/US gallon, get used to it).

12. Learn to resolve personal issues without guns, lawyers or therapists. That you need many lawyers and therapists shows you're not adult enough to be independent. If you're not adult enough to sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist, you're not grown up enough to handle a gun.

13. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.

14. Tax collectors from Her Majesty's Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all revenues due (backdated to 1776).

Thank you for your co-operation. ","To the citizens of the United States of America, in light of your failure to elect a competent President of the USA",0

They're swinging on the Pearly Gates, my horn is missing, and they are wearing T-shirts instead of their robes; there's barbecue sauce and picante sauce all over everything, especially their T-shirts; their dogs are riding in the chariots and chasing the sheep; they are wearing baseball caps and cowboy hats instead of their halos. They refuse to keep the stairway to Heaven clean, and their boots are marking and scuffing up the halls of Wisdom. There are watermelon seeds and
tortilla chip crumbs all over the place. Some of them are walking around with just one wing; and they insist on bringing their horses with them.""

The Lord said, ""Texans are Texans, Gabriel. Heaven is home to all of my children.  If you want to know about real problems, call the Devil.""

So Gabriel calls the Devil who answers the phone and says, ""Hello--- hold on a minute."" When he returns to the phone the Devil says, "" O.K., I'm back. What can I do for you? ""

Gabriel replied, ""I just want to know what kinds of problems you are having down there with the Texans.""

The Devil said, ""Hold on again. I need to check on something."" After about 5 minutes the Devil returned to the phone and said. ""I'm back. Now what was the question?""

Gabriel said, ""What kind of problems are you having down there with the Texans?""

The Devil said, ""Man, I don't believe this...hold on.""

This time the Devil was gone 15 minutes and when he returns he says, ""I'm sorry Gabriel, I can't talk right now. Red Adair has put out the fire and Brown and Root is installing air conditioning"".

The agent says, ‚ÄúSorry, family acts aren‚Äôt the thing right now, I‚Äôm going to have to pass.‚Äù   

The mother says ‚ÄúSir, if you see our act, we‚Äôre sure you will want to represent us.‚Äù   

The agent says ‚ÄúOk, i guess it couldn‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù   


The muscular father makes off his belt and hands it to his wife, before he starts to strip his young daughter naked. He and his boyish son take their clothes off, and his son lays on the floor. He pushes his daughter on top of his son and starts to suck his son‚Äôs dick while fingering his daughter vigorously. He then hocks a large amount of phlegm into his mouth and spits it on his daughters groin allowing him to being to finger her asshole with his three of his fingers. He does this for a while before grabbing his son‚Äôs erect penis and thrusting it into his daughters asshole. He then thrusts his own penis into her vagina allowing them to simultaneously fuck her. The mother then takes her husbands belt and hold it in a loop in order to repeatedly whip the face of her daughter while she is being fucked so brutally. The daughter blacks out from the pain and then the wife starts to choke her husband with the belt until he is blue in the face, which only makes his dick harder. The entire time a young toddler was sitting, smiling and laughing as the shenanigans ensued.   

The wife then grabs the dog by the collar and leads him over to her husband. She rubs her genitals violently until she is very wet and then starts to finger her husband using the lubrication produced by her arousal to facilitate the anal penetration of her entire fist. Then she begins to give the dog a hand job while still fisting her husband before instructing the dog to mount the husband, grabbing the massive penis of the family dog and forcing it into the fathers rectum. She then balances herself on top of the father‚Äôs back allowing the dog to lick her vagina while it is happily fucking her husband who is still double penetrating his daughter with his son.   

The mother then lays on her back with her ass arched in the air. The daughter fills the mothers rectum with ghost pepper salsa, picks up the baby, and inserts the baby‚Äôs head into the mother‚Äôs rectum. Then the son crawls under the baby and begins to sodomize it, promptly being accompanied by his father in order to perform double anal on the baby. While this is happening, the mother performs oral sex on the daughter who is so tickled that she begins to urinate into her mother‚Äôs mouth. The mother drinks the urine happily while the father and son work together to move the baby‚Äôs skull in and out of it‚Äôs mother‚Äôs rectum repeatedly in order to allow it to breathe a bit.   

The mother releases the baby from her rectum and excretes the remaining salsa onto the face or her son who was positioned under her. The father lays down on his back still fucking the baby, and the daughter brings a hammer over and breaks the jaw of the crying baby enough to unhinge it. She then defecates solid healthy feces into the baby‚Äôs mouth before the son then uses his penis to force the feces down the baby‚Äôs throat. The daughter forces fist into the dog‚Äôs rectum and withdraws ample amounts of worm infested feces. Her brother takes his penis out of the baby‚Äôs mouth for a second to allow his sister to load more feces into the limp mouth of the choking baby before using his penis to force the new load of feces down the baby‚Äôs throat.   

The boy then withdraws his penis to allow his sister to begin french kissing the baby before starting to perform the Heimlich maneuver on the baby, forcing the feces out of it‚Äôs throat and into the mouth of his sister who starts slowly swallowing some of the feces. The son begins to fuck his sister doggy style while his mother lays down arching her back to position her vagina in front of the girls mouth, allowing the daughter to deposit much of the gifted feces mixed with some vomit into her mothers vagina. When satisfied with the deposit, the mother crab walks over to her husband and sits on his face, allowing him to happily eat the mixture of feces and vomit extruding from his wife‚Äôs vagina.   

The daughter takes a hatchet and begins chopping at the now dead baby‚Äôs neck, taking a healthy number of blows before her childlike strength was able to sever the head and neck at the shoulder blades. The daughter then inserts the severed baby‚Äôs head into her fathers rectum before the son is able to penetrate the decapitated esophagus of the baby‚Äôs skull with his penis, just barely narrow enough to fit into the tight hole. After this, the daughter takes the hatchet and with her mother holding the headless baby still she begins to sever the limbs of the baby. It takes a few whacks for each one, but eventually both arms and both legs are removed. The daughter then takes the torso of the baby and gives it to her father who begins to fuck the esophagus of the headless and limbless baby.    

The daughter takes zip ties and tightly binds the two legs of the baby together tightly, the two arms of the baby together tightly, and then zip ties these two sets together by the protruding bones. She then takes one zip tie around her waist and strings this through the tie connecting the two sets of limbs, and with a final tie strung between this same spot she runs it through her asscheeks and zips it around the belt she had fastened. With these four limbs dangling from her waist she begins to fuck her mother with her handmade strap on. She simultaneously penetrates her mothers anus and vagina with the baby‚Äôs stiff limbs, performing the legendary double vaginal double anal with her homemade strap-on made from the limbs of a baby and begins to fuck her mother rigorously vigorously.   

The boy then withdraws the baby‚Äôs skull from his father‚Äôs rectum while still fucking it, walks over to his mother and pulls the baby‚Äôs esophagus to the base of his dick, allowing the tip of his penis to exit the baby‚Äôs mouth as he ejaculates into his mother‚Äôs moaning mouth. The boy then goes over to the dog and begins to suck on it‚Äôs penis vicariously until it also ejaculates. The father then flips the limbless baby torso around and begins to penetrate the baby‚Äôs rectum violently. He ejeculates inside of the baby‚Äôs rectum and brings the torso over to his wife who suck‚Äôs her husbands ejaculate out of the baby‚Äôs rectum. After this, the boy walks over to his mother with his mouth full of a massive amount of the dog‚Äôs semen and spits it into his mother‚Äôs mouth. She then starts to ride her daughter cowgirl, bouncing enthusiastically on all 4 baby limbs still penetrating her deeply. She then makes out with her daughter allowing them both to savor the semen of the dog, the boy, and his father before allowing her daughter to swallow the load.   

The smiling family all look at the agent with hope in their eyes. He smiles, a bit awestruck, and says ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one hell of an act. What do you call it?‚Äù   

The four of them say to him in unison ‚ÄúThe Aristocrats!‚Äù

It was either too long, too short, too neat or too disheveled.  There was the beginnings of a bald spot, I swear.  So I went to the barber to ask him what I should do.  
He was an old-timey barber, complete with the waxed handlebar mustache.  He took one look at me and stroked his manly face fur and said: ""Son, you need something on your upper lip.""  He recommended various products to me, but kept an odd look about him.  

I disregarded it and thanked him for his advice.  I tried all the products, but none of them worked.  I grew only a wispy thing.  So I asked him again, and he gave me the same odd look.  I had to know his secret, so I followed him back to his home, a large property left to him by his ancestors.  

It was a moonless night.  He drew a circle in the ground and placed a clipping from a nearby plant in it next to a picture of a fine handlebar mustache.  He repeated some magic words, which I shall not divulge here (for the risk is too great) and his magnificent hair grew before my very eyes.  

When he went back to his home, I emerged into the clearing and took another clipping from a nearby plant.  I placed it into the circle next to the picture and repeated the magic words.  But Oh!  My skin started smelling of skunks and my mustache grew magnificently, but the hair was green and wild!  

The barber came running out of his house to find me confused and in despair next to his ritual apparatus: a circle, a picture, and the wrong plant!  Marijuana!

The lonely guy is amazed. He can't believe his eyes. Then, the suave guy strolls up to another young lady and does the same thing. Minutes later they are walking out of the private room looking like they had amazing sex.

Now the lonely guy has moved on to his second drink and the suave gentleman saddles up to the bar next to him for a drink of his own. The lonely guy leans over and says, ""I have noticed you getting all kinds of action tonight, would you please share your secrets with a lonely guy such as myself?""

The suave gentlemen looks at the poor lonely guy, feels bad for him and says, ""Okay, just this once I will share my greatest getting laid secret.

The lonely guy is amazed. It couldn't be this easy. Then he watches as the suave gentleman goes on to get yet another young lady upstairs to the private room for sexy time.

The lonely guy thinks, I can do this, I just need a few more drinks to get brave enough. So he switches to the hard stuff and downs a few more to build up his courage.

An hour later, the lonely guy is lit and feeling confident. He scans the room to find a nice looking lady that looks to be in his league and stumbles over to her.

Every time one broke down or became hopelessly out of date, he refused to sell it, instead keeping it in a large barn. He even bought used tractors from other farmers. He worked on them and polished them, treating them like museum exhibits.
Eventually it came time for him to retire, and, since he had grown tired of tractors, he decided to sell off his massive collection. So he put advertisements in local and national papers and waited.
He didn't have long to wait. A few days later, he received a letter from a businessman whose company had built many of the tractors mentioned in the ad and who had an interest in old vehicles himself.
After a couple more letters the two arranged to meet in the farmer's local tavern.
The businessman arrived on the appointed date and went into the tavern. He soon located the farmer, despite the very heavy clouds of pipe smoke in the air. An hour passed in most pleasant conversation, as the pair turned out to have much in common.
""Well,"" sighed the farmer eventually, ""I haven't had such a good yak for a long time, but I suppose it's about time we got down to business, eh?""
""Sure,"" replied the businessman, ""but maybe we could go somewhere else. I find it very hard to concentrate with this much smoke in the air.""
""There's no need for that,"" said the farmer, ""watch this.""
He proceeded to take an amazingly deep, deep breath, sucking in every last particle of smoke in the room. Then he leaned over to the partially open window behind him and blew all the smoke out into the night.
""Hey, how did you manage that?"" gasped the businessman.
""Oh, it was nothing,"" replied the farmer. ""You see now I'm an ex-tractor fan.""",An old farmer had spent his life,7

First briefing by the CIA, Pentagon, FBI:

Trump: We must destroy ISIS immediately. No delays.

CIA: We cannot do that, sir. We created them along with Turkey, Saudi, Qatar and others.

Trump: The Democrats created them.

CIA: We created ISIS, sir. You need them or else you would lose funding from the natural gas lobby.

Trump: Stop funding Pakistan. Let India deal with them.

CIA: We can't do that.

Trump: Why is that?

CIA: India will cut Balochistan out of Pak.

Trump: I don't care.

CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to fund Pakistan to keep India busy in Kashmir.

Trump: But you have to destroy the Taliban.

CIA: Sir, we can't do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia in check during the 80s. Now they are keeping Pakistan busy and away from their nukes.

Trump: We have to destroy terror sponsoring regimes in the Middle East. Let us start with the Saudis.

Pentagon: Sir, we can't do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it.

Trump: Then, let us invade Iran.

Pentagon: We cannot do that either, sir.

Trump: Why not?

CIA: We are talking to them, sir.

Trump: What? Why?

CIA: We want our Stealth Drones back. If we attack them, Russia will obliterate us as they did to our buddy ISIS in Syria. Besides we need Iran to keep Israel in check.

Trump: Then let us invade Iraq again.

CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) are already occupying 1/3rd of Iraq.

Trump: Why not the whole of Iraq?

CIA: We need the Shi'ite govt of Iraq to keep ISIS in check.

Trump: I am banning Muslims from entering US.

FBI: We can't do that.

Trump: Why not?

FBI: Then our own population will become fearless.

Trump: I am deporting all illegal immigrants to south of the border.

Border patrol: You can't do that, sir.

Trump: Why not?

Border patrol: If they're gone, who will build the wall?

Trump: I am banning H1B visas.

USCIS: You cannot do that.

Trump: Why?

Chief of Staff: If you do so, we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. Which is in India.

Trump (sweating profusely by now): What the hell should I do as President???

CIA: Enjoy the White House, sir! We will take care of the rest!",Trump's first day at Oval office.....,11
