They played little league together, they had home room together all through high school, they even double dated to prom and shared a limo. As time went on, though, they slowly lost touch. During university they slowly lost touch with each other. Summer break hangouts, regular texting and online gaming slowly became infrequent emails and Facebook likes. Produce drifts apart, these things happen.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, though, they get to talking again and decide they need to get back together. That after all this time, they're not only going to celebrate their friendship but renew their commitment to stay best friends. No other friends, no ladies, just the two of them. They both plan time off work, travel back to their hometown and go to their favourite bar. They even arranged with the owner to reserve their favourite booth. And it's like they never lost touch. Over multiple pitchers of beer they tell all the old stories and share new laughs. Just having a great time of things. Over the course of the night, though, the first tomato see's this tasty piece of celery eyeing him from the bar. And she is just gorgeous, a real crisp hottie if you get my meaning. And even though he keeps finding her checking him out, he keeps puts her out of his mind as best he can. Tonight is just about best tomatoes forever.

&amp;#x200B;

As the night wears one, the second tomato gets up to let out some of the beer they've been drinking. And he's gone maybe 30 seconds when that celery shakes her stalk across the bar and slides into the empty seat to chat up the first tomato. The first tomato is so blinded with flirting with her that he doesn't see second tomato come back. And he is pissed. 'Dude, tonight was supposed to be about us', he says, 'And the second I'm gone you ditch me for a bar tramp?'

&amp;#x200B;

The first tomato tries explaining it isn't like that, that she's hitting on him. He tries begging the second tomato to understand, that he'd never have another shot in a million years with someone as hot as her on any other night. He tries suggesting he go home with and that they reschedule their tomatoes night out for another night. The second tomato doesn't like this. Furious, he says that if the one night they were going to celebrate all the years they were friends, the one night they were pledging to making an effort to staying as close as they've been, that he's going to ditch him for a girl he won't remember in a week ... then their friendship never really meant anything.

&amp;#x200B;

The first tomato lets the second go, figuring that they'll both cool down and talk tomorrow. He goes back to chatting up the celery up as the night starts to wind down. Meanwhile, the second tomato storms off to the other side of the bar and starts doing shots with group of rowdy beefsteak tomatoes, telling them about how his friend betrayed him over a girl. Well, you better believe they don't like hearing about their tomato brother getting stabbed in the back like that and decide to do something about it.

&amp;#x200B;

As the first tomato is waiting outside for the celery to finish powdering her leaves, the table of rowdy tomatoes jump him. They pull him down and lay into him, beating him up and down, screaming and berating him the entire time before leaving him in he gutter to die. It's about this time that the second tomato realizes almost everyone's left and decides to head out himself. When he gets outside, though, he sees his best friend laying beaten on the sidewalk, tomato juice running in the gutter. I mean, he's practically ketchup at this point. He hurriedly calls 911 before cradling his friend, crying and praying to god. He holds his friend the entire ambulance ride. At the hospital he spends three hours pacing back and fourth in the waiting room.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, the doctor comes out. And for synchronicity's sake we'll say the doctor is a carrot. The carrot doctor comes up to the tomato and asks if he wants to hear the good news or the bad news.

&amp;#x200B;

The tomato gets really quite for a moment, before whispering through chapped lips that he needs to hear the good news. The doctor says 'Well, it was touch and go for a while, and he's not out of the garden yet, but I think he'll live.' The tomato cries out in relief, thanking the doctor profusely. All that matters is that his friend is gonna live, he can take the bad news so long as he'll live. 'What's the bad news, doc?'

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor says 'Well, the beating was quite severe. So, he'll live but he'll be a vegetable for the rest of his life.'","So, there's these two tomatoes who are best friends ...",22

I woke Michael up and we started running to school wearing only what we had on the night before. It wasn't long until Michael started lagging and I had to tell him repeatedly to hurry up. As a result, it was *way* past 1:00 by the time we got to the school.

A man goes to the circus and sees a line of people. It extends far into the distance. The man walks up to a person in the line and asks him,

""Sir, what is this line for?""

The person replies,

""Go to the front.""

So the man walks up the line. and he keeps walking, and walking, but the line never ends.. He gets tired of this and decides to ask another person what it's for. So he goes to the nearest person and asks him,

""Sir, what is this line for?""

The person replies,

""Go to the front.""

The man thinks about this for a moment, he wants to go back, but he is already quite far down the line.

""Shurley,"" he thinks to himself, ""The front must be just around one more bend.""

So he continues to walk down the line in search of the front. After following it to the exit of the circus, he stops again. Seeing how it leaves the place he paid money to get into he gets frustrated. So he asks another person,

""Sir, could you please tell me what this line is for?""

The person replies,

""Go to the front.""

This gets the man very frustrated and he yells,

""Well where is the front!?!""

The person replies,

""Far out in the desert, many many miles away.""

The man implores further,

""Can I get there at all?""

The person replies,

""You can get there three days time on foot, but by vehicle it would be impossible.""

So the man sets off into the dessert, determined to find the front and what it's for. He hikes for many miles, over boulders, thru forrest, up and down canyon walls, warding off wolves and bears with nothing but his hands. Finally, after three days time he comes to the front of the line. There at the front, is a small booth with a cardboard sign, next to the sign is and old man in a hawaiian t-shirt and sunglasses. The people in the line walk up to him, give him a wad of cash, he punches them, and then they start walking back towards the beginning of the line. The man walks up to the Old man and aks him,

""Sir, what is this line for?""

The Old Man turns soberly to him and says,

""Son, after a long time in life you'll learn something.""

""What?"" says the man.

The old man replies,

""Every joke needs a punch line.""",A man goes to the circus and sees a line of people.,3

Rico would mount every animal after being introduced to them one by one, a total of 20 animals. The farm animals didn’t seem to mind, seeing that the farm has been very boring in the last few years.

Farmer Ted ran over to Rico laying on his back, chest covered in dirt, and said, “Damn it Rico, I paid good money for you, now you’re dead, and I will never see a return on my investment!” Rico turned his head to Farmer Ted, opened his eyes and whispered, “shhhhh, there are buzzards above us!”","Hi, my name is Rico the Rooster, and I’m a sex addict.",4

Every able lad within a few hundred miles wanted to play football for Central Catholic Fighting Knights.

Those who were familiar with the program, knew that the true heart and soul of the Knights football program was Sister Mary Margaret, an aged nun who would, in full habit, get out on the practice field and work on routes with the receivers, give pointers to the quarterbacks on their stances and releases, but most of all, love them like the second mother that she became to all of the boys in that program.

One year, on the eve of the state championship game, some evil malefactors broke into the convent and kidnapped Sister Mary Margaret. Everyone was stunned by the news, but none more so than the Knights of Central Catholic. They were devastated at the loss of their mentor.

As you might guess, the state championship game didn't go very well. For the first time in the history of the football program, the Knights were shut out. The Spartans beat them 42-0.

Dihydrogen monoxide is colorless,  odorless, tasteless, and kills uncounted thousands of people every year.  Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but  the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure  to its solid form causes severe tissue damage. Symptoms of DHMO  ingestion can include excessive sweating and urination, and possibly a  bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. For  those who have become dependent, DHMO withdrawal means certain death.   


Dihydrogen monoxide:   


is also known as hydroxl acid, and is the major component of acid rain.  
contributes to the ""greenhouse effect.""   
may cause severe burns.   
contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.   
accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.   
may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes.   
has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.   
Contamination is reaching epidemic proportions!   


Quantities  of dihydrogen monoxide have been found in almost every stream, lake,  and reservoir in America today. But the pollution is global, and the  contaminant has even been found in Antarctic ice. DHMO has caused  millions of dollars of property damage in the midwest, and recently  California.   


Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:   
as an industrial solvent and coolant.   
in nuclear power plants.   
in the production of styrofoam.   
as a fire retardant.   
in many forms of cruel animal research.   
in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.   
as an additive in certain ""junk-foods"" and other food products.   
Companies  dump waste DHMO into rivers and the ocean, and nothing can be done to  stop them because this practice is still legal. The impact on wildlife  is extreme, and we cannot afford to ignore it any longer!   


The  American government has refused to ban the production, distribution, or  use of this damaging chemical due to its ""importance to the economic  health of this nation."" In fact, the navy and other military  organizations are conducting experiments with DHMO, and designing  multi-billion dollar devices to control and utilize it during warfare  situations. Hundreds of military research facilities receive tons of it  through a highly sophisticated underground distribution network. Many  store large quantities for later use.",BAN DIHYDROGEN MONOXIDE!,0

So the man walks up the line. and he keeps walking, and walking, but the line never ends.. He gets tired of this and decides to ask another person what it's for. So he goes to the nearest person and asks him,

""Sir, what is this line for?""

The person replies,

""Go to the front.""

The man thinks about this for a moment, he wants to go back, but he is already quite far down the line. 

""Shurley,"" he thinks to himself, ""The front must be just around one more bend."" 

So he continues to walk down the line in search of the front. After following it to the exit of the circus, he stops again. Seeing how it leaves the place he paid money to get into he gets frustrated. So he asks another person, 

""Sir, could you please tell me what this line is for?"" 

The person replies,

""Go to the front.""

This gets the man very frustrated and he yells,

""Well where is the front!?!""

The person replies,

""Far out in the desert, many many miles away.""

The man implores further,

""Can I get there at all?""

The person replies,

""You can get there  three days time on foot, but by vehicle it would be impossible.""

So the man sets off into the dessert, determined to find the front and what it's for. He hikes for many miles, over boulders, thru forrest, up and down canyon walls, warding off wolves and bears with nothing but his hands. Finally, after three days time he comes to the front of the line. There at the front, is a small booth with a cardboard sign, next to the sign is and old man in a hawaiian t-shirt and sunglasses. The people in the line walk up to him, give him a wad of cash, he punches them, and then they start walking back towards the beginning of the line. The man walks up to the Old man and aks him,

""Sir, what is this line for?""

The Old Man turns soberly to him and says,

""Son, after a long time in life you'll learn something.""

""What?"" says the man.

The man says, ""damn, I forgot"". But then the genie showers him with cash and he forgets about his x-wife.

The genie crosses his arms and bows his head then suddenly they and the cash are swept away to a giant mansion.
 
The man starts running around his new house with joy and then goes out to the balcony and sees his x-wife and her 2 mansions behind his house and he was mad.

post,bzrtl5,2qh72,jokes,false,1560349250,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bzrtl5/i_fucked_up_by_trusting_my_husband/,self.jokes,,"So I've been married to my husband for about six years now ( but we've been partners for eight years ) and we have two wonderful kids at the age five and seven. I couldn't have asked for a better life or a happier family, but recently something has been really bothering me.

&amp;#x200B;

Here comes the problem;

I've been wondering for months now, because none of the kids look like my husband. So I asked him very discreetly if he's been cheating on me any time during our eight years of partnership. And he keeps holdning on to the claim that ""I haven't and will never cheat on you darling"".

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I know he must be lying, because why else would our kids not look anything like him?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Basically I have come to the conclusion that even though my husband denies it, he must've been cheating on me because none of our kids looks like him!!",I fucked up by trusting my husband!!,3

Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.

One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving.

As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.

With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.

This gives two possibilities:

1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.

2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

So which is it?

If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, ""it will be a cold day in Hell before I go out with you"", and take into account the fact that I went out with her last night, then number 2 must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over.

The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore extinct . . . leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being, which explains why last night Teresa kept shouting ""Oh, my God!""

 In the greatest days of the British Empire, a new Commanding Officer was  sent to an African jungle outpost to relieve the retiring Colonel.  

After welcoming his replacement and showing the courtesies (gin and  tonic, cucumber sandwiches) that protocol decrees, the retiring Colonel  said, 

""You must meet Captain Smithers, my right-hand man, God, he's really the  strength of this office. His talent is simply boundless.""

Smithers was summoned and introduced to the new CO who was surprised to  meet a crooked, toothless, scabbed and pockmarked specimen of humanity,  with three strands of hair on his head - a particularly unattractive man  of less than three foot tall.

He finds and alchemist's medicine shop at the market and tells him about his mother's illness.

""Ah, but of course!"" says the alchemist, ""It's clearly a case of Sakiara Fever. It's not very common at all, but I've got just the thing.""

The alchemist rummages through his wares for a moment and pulls out a bottle with blue liquid in it, sealed by a cork.

""Pandoria Solution, this should do the trick just fine. Have her take a sip with every meal for a day and the day after she should be healthy. That'll be 600 Crowns.""
The orc, with a smile on his face, searches the small field pouch tied to his belt to pull out his money. He counts, 100 Crowns... 200 Crowns... 300 Crowns... 400 Crowns... 500 Crowns...

His smile quickly goes away when he realizes he's 100 Crowns short. He looks at the alchemist, to which the alchemist says ""Sorry, youngster. It's as low as it goes. I can't operate at a loss.""

Defeated, he starts waking away when a man grabs his shoulder. It was a large man clad in shining armor, and an ornate helmet that was too beautiful for words. The knight pulls out a nugget of ore from his pocket, probably worth around 150 Crowns, and hands it to the ugly orc, saying ""Take it, you need it more than I do"". In the shock of the moment, the orc couldn't think what to say to the generous man...

&amp;nbsp;
  
One morning, he awoke to the sounds of a thunderstorm and rushing water. Quickly getting dressed and stumbling outside, he saw the river had flooded.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
Overflowing its banks, the waters swelled and flowed past, getting ever so closer to the hunter's abode. It would not reach the house, the hunter observed, for it had the higher ground. But there was no hope for the vegetable garden -- it was only a matter of minutes before the floodwaters would wash over it, ruining his harvest for that season.
 
&amp;nbsp;
  
_""Goddammit,""_ the hunter muttered.
  
&amp;nbsp;
 
Right before the hunter's eyes, a bolt of lightning struck the bank at the other side of the river, followed by a deafening clap of thunder and a massive explosion. Trees, rocks and chunks of dirt flew hundreds of feet into the air! 
  
&amp;nbsp;
 
No sooner had the debris started falling back to the ground when a monstrous tornado blew in from parts unknown and scooped them right up again. The tornado headed straight towards the river, uprooting more trees and rocks in its path, carving a deep gouge into the earth.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
As soon as the tornado blew across the river, there was another flash of lightning and deafening clap of thunder. The tornado disappeared as quickly as it had materialised. The uprooted trees, rocks and dirt crashed into the river, diverting its waters into the deep gouge in the earth. The floodwaters receded, having come within inches of the hunter's vegetable garden.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
Having witnessed the whole extravaganza from start to finish, the hunter could only stare, wide eyed, his legs shaking and mouth hanging stupidly open. It was a while before he finally managed to speak.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
_""Whoa.""_
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
From above him a voice boomed:
  
&amp;nbsp;
 
**_”YOU'RE WELCOME.""_**

Our sex life is out of control and you are just too kinky for me. Goodbye.”

To drown his sorrows, the man finds his way to the local bar for some stiff drinks. After his third drink he takes off the wedding ring he wore on his finger and starts to spin it around in his hands, contemplating his marriage and where he had went wrong. Deep in thought, he was interrupted by a sly and sexy voice that came from a tall blonde woman in a gorgeous red dress, “I was hoping you were single, but now I see you playing with that ring, so I will leave you alone” she said. 

The man was caught off guard by her beauty, but managed to come up with a response, “Actually,” the man said “My wife just left me today. She left me a letter saying I was to sexually kinky for her.”

“You must be joking,” the woman replied “My boyfriend just dumped me for the exact same reason. He said that I was too much to handle in bed”.

They locked eyes and felt an instant connection. The two ordered many more drinks for they both knew where the night would end up. 

Later that evening, they found themselves stumbling into the woman’s apartment and started making out on the couch. The woman stopped before anything went too far and said, “Why don’t I slip into something more appropriate for the moment and you just make yourself comfortable”.

The woman then took a few minutes to prepare for their kinky evening by putting on some lingerie, spraying some extra perfume and getting out her fuzzy handcuffs from the closet. As she came back out expecting to see the man waiting on the couch, she instead found him halfway out of the door.

“Where are you going? I thought we were going to get kinky tonight...” she asked.

Being a professional, the archaeologist took the book back to his prestigious university, which was home to several leaders of certain fields. To research the book's power in a controlled manner, the archaeologist rounds up three of the university's brightest minds. A researcher of Astrophysics, who had led the field for many years and had produced many papers theorising cosmic events was first. The archaeologist told him to ask the book one question, and to document whether the response was accurate.

The astrophysicist thought for a moment and asked the book ""What was existence like before the Big Bang?""

The archaeologist opened the book and showed the physicist, and he instantly went insane and began scrawling equations on the nearest pad of paper, mumbling distressed words to himself.

Shocked and uneasy, but willing to see his research through, the archaeologist moved on to the next researcher, a leading professor of Mathematics. She had produced many papers and interpretations on numbers themselves, and the human interpretations behind ever-growing sequences. The archaeologist asked the mathematician to ask the book a question.

The mathematician barely thought for a second. ""How can a human being best visualise infinity?""

The archaeologist once again opened the book and showed it to the mathematician. Her eyes widened in shock and confusion and she, too, went insane immediately. She ran out of the room yelling, back to her notes to make sense of what she'd seen.

Shaken but persistent, the archaeologist turned to the final volunteer. He was one of the world's most highly regarded philosophers, and had spent his whole life researching different views and interpretations of a variety of philosophical debates. The philosopher knew the process by now, and confidently asked:

""What is the meaning of life?""

The archaeologist opened the book and showed the philosopher. Confused at first, the philosopher let out a sigh.

Surprised to find her husband in a very drunken state. During the next few minutes, he explained that his employer was going through a process of corporate downsizing, and he had been let go.

It was unlikely that, at the age of 59, he'd be able to find another position that paid anywhere near what he'd been earning, and therefore, they were financially ruined.

Calmly, his wife handed him a bank book which
Showed more than forty years of steady deposits and interest totaling nearly $1 million. Then she showed him certificates of deposits issued by the
bank which was worth over $2 million, and informed him that they were one of the largest depositors in the bank.

Ahe explained that for the more than three decades she had 'charged' him for sex, these holdings had multiplied and these were the results of her savings and investments.

Faced with evidence of cash and investments
Worth over $3 million, her husband was so astounded he could barely speak. Finally he found his voice and blurted out,
'If I'd had any idea what you were doing,
I would have given you all my business!'","On their wedding night, a young bride asked her new husband to pay her $20 for their first lovemaking encounter.",49

Printer not ready.

Could be a fatal error.

Lazy programmers.

 

This site has been moved.

We'd tell you where, but then we'd

The Web site you seek

cannot be located but

endless others exist

 

First snow, then silence.

This thousand dollar screen dies

so beautifully.

 

With searching comes loss

and the presence of absence:

""My Novel"" not found.

 

Stay the patient course

Of little worth is your ire

The network is down

 

A crash reduces

your expensive computer

to a simple stone.

 

There is a chasm

of carbon and silicon

the software can't bridge

 

Yesterday it worked

Today it is not working

Windows is like that

 

To have no errors

Would be life without meaning

No struggle, no joy

 

No keyboard present

Hit F1 to continue

Zen engineering?

 

Out of memory.

We wish to hold the whole sky,

But we never will.

Rich, Dave and Johnny are three contractors who are bidding to fix a broken fence at the White House. All three go with a White House official to examine the fence.

Rich first takes out a tape measure and does some measuring, then works some figures with a pencil. “Well,” he says, “I figure the job will run you about $900. $400 for materials, $400 for my crew, and $100 profit for me.”

Dave also does some measuring and figuring, then says, “I can do this job for $700. $300 for materials, $300 for my crew, and $100 profit for me.”

Johnny doesn’t measure or figure, but leans over to the White House official and whispers, “$2,700.”

The official, incredulous, says, “You didn’t even measure like the other guys! How did you come up with such a high figure?”

Johnny whispers back, “$1000 for me, $1000 for you, and we hire the other guy to fix the fence for $700.”","Rich, Dave, and Johnny",10

She was the only customer in the store. As she was looking through the clothes on the racks, a clerk hurriedly approached her and very abruptly asked if he could help her. 

Ivanka was used to this bad treatment by now and she politely declined his help. She continued to look at the clothes. Then she noticed that two more clerks in the store were staring at her. Defiantly, she continued to look through the racks. When she could take this treatment no longer, she turned on her heels, with her head held high, and left the shop. 

As she left, she noticed that the sign on the store read ""Nettoyeur à sec."" Definitely Tweeting my friends on Facebook to never go shopping there if they come to Paris, she thought.

When she met up with her staff she told them her story.  ""What shop was that?"" one of them asked.  She pointed it out, and wondered what the name meant. So one of them pulled out their phone and typed the name into Google Translator.

The female whale nods in agreement. 

So the male whale continues, ""How bout we teach those whalers lesson then?""

 ""Let's swim deep down under the sea where they can't see us. Then we'll emerge right under their ship and use our blow holes to capsize it. ""

The female whale agrees, and they immediately spring into action. They both dive down deeper into the ocean and go completely unnoticed by the whalers.  Then, slowly and meticulously, they emerge right under the ship. They then both blow as hard as they can out of their blow holes the combined air pressure topples the ship. 

The whales both swim away, elated and laughing at their success with both whales yelling ""yeah that'll teach them a lesson about killing whales!""

As the male whale looks back to admire the chaos they created, he notices the ship's crew swimming back to shore.  This gives him an idea and a devilish smile runs across his face as he turns to ask the female whale, 

""Do you know what would really teach those whalers a lesson about killing whales?  Why don't we swim right up to them and gobble them all up?

After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office.

The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'.

The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money . The elderly woman replied that she made bets.

The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?'

The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.'

The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.

The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?'

'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.'

'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.'

'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently.

That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that way, up and down, turned it around, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.

The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square

The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.

The president was happy to oblige.

The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.'

The elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the \*lawyer was banging his head against the wall.\*

Usually every night plays out the same way. Her husband comes home drunk as a skunk, walks directly to the bathroom to take a shit after which he makes his way to the bedroom, collapses on the bed and starts snoring like a freight train.

The woman is counting on this night to play out the same way. Earlier in the day she visited the local butcher where she bought pig intestines. Once she got home she placed the intestines in the toilet bowl.

At ten past midnight her husband stumbles through the front door, reeking of booze. Without so much as a “Hi” to acknowledge the existence of his wife he makes his way to the bathroom.  
Ten minutes go by. Twenty, thirty, forty. The woman actually starts to become a little worried but decides to wait her husband out.  
 After almost an hour her husband finally emerges from the bathroom. His face is bright red and dripping with sweat.

\- *“You will NOT believe what just happened to me! I shat out my intestines!!”*, says the husband.

Playing along the woman answers:

\- *“Shat out your intestines?!? How is that even possible?”*

\- *“You tell me!”*, responds the husband. *“And shitting them out was not even the worst part. The worst part was pushing them back in!!!”*",A woman is tired of her husband coming home drunk every night…,184

He used to excel in bull markets. Blue on the other hand, was a little bit more traditional, always the voice of reason. Put together the couple dominated the stock market both nationally and internationally. 

Together they traded for years to create a vast amount of fortune. Red used to trade super agressively on penny stocks, expensive stocks, stocks no one heard about, stocks already months into all time highs - you name it. And blue was always there to pull the assets out at the right moment. Red was a great talker &amp; people's person and Blue was Red's greatest friend and assistant. Red used to invest in real estate company on Qatar, and Logging company in South America and Tourism Industry in the Europes and each and every kind of stocks from all over the nooks and crannies of the world and he always came out on top.  

However, as with all the good things, it must come to an end. Blue was always aware of this fact. As time passed, Red and Blue were deep into trading the most long run bull economoy of their lives. It had been years since folks saw a market crash. This only made Red more and more confident, as Blue became more and more paranoid trying to find the indicators of financial crash.

Soon enough, Blue realized they were on the brink of an implending market crash and talked to Red about the possibility of a bear market. ""Bear market? No bear market can affect me, you worry too much my friend!"" said Red. ""Here to put your mind at ease- I am putting a 60% of our liquid savings into these two companies as backup. These will be our fallbacks."" said Red without blinking an eye. 

""Key Holdings Enterprise in the Switzerland and Olive &amp; Wine Exports LLC from California? This is your backup? How is this a backup, I have never heard of these names, nor of these companies. We do not even know who runs these companies. Red you are nuts!"" Blue screamed agitated. Days turn into weeks, but Blue never got answer about this wierd investment from Red.

As weeks turned into months, soon enough - the market did start to crash. Everyone was at panic. Used to trading in the bear market, the best friends' entire net worth crashed by 55% in almost a day one Friday. Blue was restless the entire weekend, praying for a miracle reversal on Monday when the markets opened.  The most outrageous thing in this event of things was, most of their assets was tied up in two random companies which had to do with Keys &amp; Olives- A Key holding Enterprise and one Olive &amp; Wine Exports LLC.


""Key &amp; Olive, Key &amp; Olive - what the hell was Red thinking when he put assets on these companies?"" Blue thought all weekend.  

Soon enough Monday came by and he logged into the markets to see the status of their net worth. Blue looks at his screen with disbelief just as Red starts a video call with him. 


""So, whats the status of our portfolio partner?"" asks Red.

Blue looks directly into the screen and says:  ""red,it seems to be up-but in only key and olives.""

Red: ""What did you just say?""

Blue: ""Reddit seems to be upvoting only Keanu Reeves.""",Red &amp; Blue were widely known as the legendary traders of the stock market and best friends since they graduated from college.,5

Since they were in the middle of nowhere, and since he was going to be here a while, he decided to get to know some of the monks there. Apparently he hadn't been the first one to come to the monastery, since a lot of the priests had taken on Anglicized names. There was Tom, Richard, Harry, and a few others, but by far the most interesting was Sam. He had taken a vow of silence ever since he had come years ago. In all that time, they had only heard a sound out of his mouth once, reported to be the most beautiful singing they had ever heard. 

Dave, wanting to hear this sound, decided to keep a ear out for any singing they heard over the next few months. Sure enough, once Dave had spent a couple weeks there, he heard the most beautiful sound: a single clear vocal pitch.

""Holy crap, I gotta get someone on this, so we don't lose the beauty of his voice,"" he thought. So when the next batch of post went out, he sent a letter to his friends back in the city, along with enough funds for travel, so they could hear the beauty of Sam's singing.

Sure enough, once Dave's friends had arrived and stayed a few nights, they heard another clear note. It managed to be even more beautiful than the last, as if somehow Sam was containing all he had observed in the last few years just in that sound. Luckily, Dave had a recording device on him, and managed to capture the moment to put on the internet.

The video went viral. Soon, everybody had heard of Sam's wonderful singing. To catch the next notes, the media began to show up at the once quiet monastery. The fourth, fifth and sixth notes all came and went, and people started piecing the notes together, making the most beautiful sound. When Sam was asked to name the composition so they could better refer to it, he simply scratched the word ""galaxy"" on a piece of paper. Sure enough, it did seem to encapsulate all the wonder of the galaxy.

At this point, it seemed the whole world, and indeed, the whole galaxy, longed for each note to come and go. Livestreams to see if they could catch the next brief moment of singing were commonplace, and each clip of Sam singing was more popular than the last. One day, Sam sung another note... only for the crowd to be horrified by seeing Sam explode.

""What happened?"" Dave asked the monk next to him.

The monk only had one line.

""Sam sung galaxy note seven.""",[Long] A man goes to a monastery in the middle of the Himalayas.,22

“Sounds marvellous,” says the ringmaster, handing over his business card. “Get him to give me a call.” So the next day when the duck comes into the pub the barman says, “Hey Mr. Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money.” “I’m always looking for the next job,” Says the duck. “Where is it?” “At the circus,” Says the barman. “The circus?” Repeats the duck. “That’s right,” replies the barman. “The circus?” The duck asks again, “with the big tent?” “Yeah,” the barman replies. “With all the animals who live in cages, and performers who live in caravans?” says the duck.

“Of course,” the barman replies. “And the tent has canvas sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?” persists the duck. “That’s right!” says the barman.
