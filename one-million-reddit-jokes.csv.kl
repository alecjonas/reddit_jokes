Geoff answers ""I know it's ridiculous, but all my life I've been afraid of there being monsters under my bed. It started when I was 5 but I just never got over it. I'm 40 years old, and I've just had enough of the nightmares, please help me"" 

The psychiatrist recommends a 12 month treatment plan meeting once a week, and is sure this will be sufficient to overcome the nightmares.

Geoff says he will have to think about it, as he can't afford such an extensive treatment policy.

The next day he phones the psychiatrist and says he won't need treatment after all, he's cured.

The psychiatrist asks how he was cured so quickly, he responds ""well, I really couldn't afford your treatment plan, so I went to a bar to drown my sorrows. I got chatting to the barman, and explained my problem, he recommended I cut the legs off my bed. There's definitely no monsters under there now!""",Geoff went to the psychiatrist,34

When Little Johnny got home that day, he went up to his dad and ask his what the government was.

His dad thought for a while and answered, ”Look at it this way: I’m the president, your mom is Congress, your maid is the work force, you are the people and your baby brother is the future.”

”I still don’t get it” responded the Little Johnny.

”Why don’t you sleep on it then? Maybe you’ll understand it better,” said the dad.

”Okay then…good night” said Little Jonny went off to bed. In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother’s crying. He went to his baby brother’s crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper. So Little Johnny went to his parent’s room to get help. When he got to his parent’s bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep. Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, but his dad wasn’t there. So he went to the maid’s room. When he looked through the maid’s room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid. Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud, ”OH!! Now I understand the government! The President is screwing the work force, Congress is fast asleep, nobody cares about the people, and the future is full of shit!”",The way it is.,55

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,58

Of course, the wife promptly hacked her first shot right through the window of the biggest house adjacent to the course. 

The husband shouted , ""I warned you to be careful! Now we'll have apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us."" 

So the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. 

A warm voice said, ""Come on in."" When they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the broken window. 

A man reclining on the couch asked, ""Are you the people that broke my window?"" 

""Uh...yeah, sir. We're sure sorry about that,"" the husband replied. 

""Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you. You see, I'm a ghost, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll Give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for myself."" 

""Wow, that's great!"" the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, ""I'd like a million dollars a year for! the rest of my life.""

""No problem,"" said the ghost. ""You've got it, it's the least I can do. And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!"" 

""And now you, young lady, what do you want?"" the ghost asked. ""I'd like to own a gorgeous home complete with servants in every country in the world,"" she said. 
""Consider it done,"" the ghost said. ""And your homes will always be safe from fire,burglary and natural disasters!"" 

""And now,"" the couple asked in unison, ""what's your wish, ghost?"" 

"" Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have your wife."" 

The husband looked at his wife and said, ""honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?"" 

She mulled it over for a few moments and said, ""You know, you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?"" 

""You know I love you sweetheart,"" said the husband. 

""I'd do the same for you!"" So the ghost and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon. The ghost was insatiable. 
After about three hours of non-stop fun, the ghost  looked directly into her eyes and asked, ""How old are you and your husband?"" 

""Why, we're both 35,"" she responded breathlessly.

post,80t8ym,2qh72,jokes,false,1519792275,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/80t8ym/mom_dad_having_sex/,self.jokes,," Two boys are in the school yard, during recess.

One boy notices that the other boy is wearing a really nice wrist watch, and not the usual dime store one like one he himself is wearing. 

&amp;nbsp;

“How did you get such a nice watch” he asks ?

&amp;nbsp;

All you gotta do is wait till after your parents put you to bed, wait for the house to get real quiet. Then later when you hear moaning and groaning and what sounds like furniture being moved go to your Mom and Dads room. Your dad will give you anything you want to get you to go back to bed.

&amp;nbsp;



So that night after dinner, after home work, after the usual TV show, it’s time for the kids to go to bed, but he waits quietly like his friend said. And sure enough there is this moaning and groaning that he had never heard before, and then sure enough it sounds like furniture being bumped against the wall and being moved, so he goes into his Mom and Dads room, and there is Dad, and there is Mom , and they are naked....

&amp;nbsp;


Dad looks over and says “What do you want” ?

&amp;nbsp;

The boy thinks to himself “just like Johnny said”. “ this is too easy” 

He says to his dad, ""I want a Watch !”

&amp;nbsp;


And Dad says “sit in the chair over there and shut up”.",Mom &amp; Dad having sex....,44

A little further down the bar from him he spies a Frenchman.  There have only been people from France in town once or twice before, and so Joe rarely sees them and has never spoken with them.  Joe's curiousity gets the best of him, and he hops down several stools to sit next to the man from France.

The man looks up from his drink, clearly surprised to see that Joe has plopped down next to him.  

""Hello,"" said Joe.
""Bonjour, monsieur,"" replied the Frenchman.

""I've never seen you around before, are you new here in town?"" queried Joe.

The Frenchman took a moment to mull over the sentence before replying,
""Oui monsieur.  I have only recently moved from France to the United States.  Pardon me, for my English is not much good yet.""

""It doesn't matter,"" responded Joe.  He took a sip of his beer. ""What occupation do you currently perpetrate in order to secure provisions for a proper way of life for yourself in this pantheon of opportunities?""

The Frenchman looked confused before he responded, ""Sorry monsieur, I do not understand.""

Joe thought of how he could rephrase it.  ""What industry are you employed in here?"" he asked.

The Frenchman looked befuddled once again before replying, ""I am sorry monsieur, I do not know what you say.""

Joe tried to recall his high school French to make the conversation easier on his foreign companion.  ""Un grand orignal est dans le lustre de votre grand-mère?"" he ventured.

The Frenchman gave a confused grin.  ""You make little sense monsieur,"" he responded.

Joe leaned back before saying, rather dejectedly, ""I give up.""

A wide smile spread across the Frenchman's face as he clapped Joe on the back. ""OUI! Now you speak my language!""",Joe walks into a bar (Long),3

For a second, a solemn look crosses his father’s face, but it quickly passes for excitement equal to that of his wife. Later that evening, the couple is invited to stay the night over, as snow had gradually begun to fall throughout the evening, making the roads less than safe. 

That night, the son awoke suddenly from his sleep, unsure of what woke him up. First, he tried to lift his head to see what was going on, but for some reason, he could only raise it a bit. Confused, he tried lifting his arm up to check if something was on him, but it wouldn’t move as well. Panicking now, the man strained against whatever was holding him down, but to no avail. Suddenly, bright lights flared up, temporarily blinding him from the sudden glare. Blinking a few times, the man could finally make out the room, recognizing it as his parents’ basement. 

Craning his neck, he turned to the left and was shocked to see his father standing to the wall, a slightly sad look on his face. Seeing that he has finally been seen by his son, he says, choking back tears, “I’m sorry, son, we have to do this. Just think of it like a... rite of passage.” Before the son could respond or even think up any response to this sentence, a man’s voice, which had a distinct German accent, began to speak. Craning his neck again, he tried to see who the person speaking was, but his neck couldn’t turn far enough to look back. As he stopped struggling, he finally noticed what the man with the German accent had been saying. He was sort of chanting some kind of mantra, made up of multiple random words. The man didn’t know what it was, but he knew he didn’t like it. Closing his eyes, he tried to block out the words, but they somehow dug past his defense and straight into his mind. Soon, the man began to slip into a daze, until finally, he was unconscious. Closing the book he had been reading the words out of, the man with the German accent turned to the man’s father, who was still choking back tears, and with his thick German accent said, “I shall now begin.”

*Seven Years Later*

It has been seven years since that night, and the man had no recollection of it. Although, with Christmas right around the corner, he had other things to occupy his thoughts. His son was halfway through his first year of preschool, and he was very much excited for the Holiday season. In fact, the first thing he said when he got home from preschool was asking about if he would get any presents that year. The wife of the man had smiled, saying, “Don’t worry, Santa will get you presents as long as you’re good.” Now beaming, the child replied, “Don’t worry, I’m good,” he then turned to his father, the man, for agreement, “Right?”

As soon as he had said this phrase, a blank look passed over the man’s face. From that phrase alone, a memory was dug up. No, it wasn’t *just* a memory, it was a *command*. Those random words that had been read to him had been mentally programmed into him for protocols like these. This entire thought process passed through his mind in the blink of an eye, and that blank look on his face turned back into a smile, as he responded to his son:

Once there, he spots Frank with not one, but two very attractive women. He shakes his head in disbelief and spends the reset of the night drinking and flirting with women, only to strike out each time. Hours later, Mike gives up and heads home to sleep.

The next morning, Mike leaves his apartment to retrieve his newspaper, only to see the very same two women leaving Frank's apartment. ""This is unbelievable..."" He mutters. After they leave, Mike knocks on Frank's door, and he answers. ""Frank, I know we don't talk much, but I have to know: How the hell does a guy like you go home with two beautiful women?"" Frank smiles and says ""It's my cologne. It contains pheromones that are guaranteed to attract women."" ""No kidding."" Mike says. ""Could I get some of that? Frank nods. ""Sure. But this is very valuable stuff. It's gonna cost you $2000 for a bottle."" Mike is reluctant at first, as he had been saving money for a new car, but he figures it would be with it and agrees.

Later that day, Mike decides to go to the club again while wearing the cologne he bought. On his way out, he runs into his other neighbor Phil. Phil says to Mike ""Why do you smell like a wet dog?"" Mike says ""It must be the cologne I bought from Frank."" ""It must have been awfully cheap then."" Phil Replies. Mike tells him ""No. In fact, it cost me $2000.""

Suddenly, an armed man with a huge knife comes around the corner, locks eyes with you and screaming something that sounds like obscenities, raises the knife and lunges at you.


You are carrying your truncheon ( A large stick) and are an expert in using it. However, you have only a split second to react before he reaches you What do you do?

ANSWERS:

Canadian Police  Officer: 

Firstly, the Officer must consider the man's human rights.

1) Does the man look poor and/or oppressed?

2) Is he newly arrived in this country and does not yet understand the law?

3) Is this really a knife or a ceremonial dagger?

4) Have I ever done anything to him that would inspire him to attack?

5) Am I dressed provocatively?

6) Could I run away?

7) Could I possibly swing my truncheon and knock the knife out of his hand?

8) Should I try and negotiate with him to discuss his wrong-doings?

9)  Why am I carrying a truncheon anyway and what kind of message does this send to society?

10) Does he definitely want to kill me or would he be content just to wound me?

11) If I were to grab his knees and hold on, would he still want to stab and kill me?

12) If I raise my truncheon and he turns and runs away, do I get blamed if he falls over, knocks his head and kills himself?

13) If I hurt him and lose the subsequent court case, does he have the opportunity to sue me, cost me my job, my credibility and the loss of my family home?

A man lost an arm when his golf cart rolled over on him on a downward slope.  He became very depressed because he loved to play golf so one day in his despair, he decided to commit  suicide and end it all.

 

He got on an elevator and went to the top of a building to jump off. He was standing on the ledge looking down and saw this man down on the sidewalk skipping along, whooping and kicking  up his heels. He looked closer and saw that this man didn't have any arms at all.

 

He started thinking, ""What am I doing up here feeling sorry for myself? I still have one good arm to do things with.""

 

He thought, ""There goes a man with no arms skipping down the sidewalk so happy, and going on with his life.""

 

So he hurried down to the sidewalk and caught up with the man with no arms. He told him how glad he was to see  him because he had lost one of his arms and felt useless and was going to kill himself. He thanked him  for saving his life and said he knew he could make it with one arm if the guy could go on with no arms.

 

The man with no arms began dancing and whooping and kicking up his heels again.

 

The guy asked, ""Why are you so  happy anyway?""

 

He said, ""I'm NOT happy. My balls itch.""",The one-armed golfer,19

“Oh, we could never do that! We’d be too embarrassed!” responded Mary. “But after you go, will you please tell me how it went?”

Several weeks passed and the two friends met for lunch again.

“So how did the sex therapy work out, Linda?” Mary asked.

“Things couldn’t be better!” Linda exclaimed. “We began with a physical exam and afterward, the doctor said he was certain he could help us. He told us to stop at the grocery store on the way home and buy a bunch of grapes and a dozen donuts. He told us to sit on the floor nude and toss the grapes and donuts at each other. Every a grape went into my vagina, John had to get it out with his tongue. Every donut that I ringed his penis with, I had to eat. Our sex life is wonderful, in fact it’s better than it’s ever been!”

With that endorsement, Mary talked her husband into an appointment with the same sex therapist.

After the physical exams were completed, the doctor called Mary and Tom into his office.

“I’m afraid there is nothing I can do for you.” he said.

“But doctor!” Mary complained. “You did such good for Linda and John, surely you must have a suggestion for us! Please, please, can’t you give us some help? Any help at all?”

“Well, OK.” the doctor answered. “On your way home, I want you to stop at the grocery store and buy a sack of apples and a box of Cheerios.”","Two women had been having a friendly lunch, when the subject turned to sex. “You know, John and I have been having some sexual problems.""

One by one, the kingpin pulls the hoods off the chemists, armed goons leering them from the door.

""Listen up,"" the kingpin orders menacingly, ""this is the largest clandestine drug lab in the country, but the *tragic* loss of my last head chemist has ground production to a standstill. One of you is going to be his replacement. As for the other two? I can't have any witnesses.""

The chemists frantically glance at each other.

""I'm going to hold a little competition. From the time you're untied, each of you will have 48 hours to produce the most valuable batch of drugs you can manage. I don't care what you make, as long as it sells. Whoever produces the highest street value wins the distinction of running this lab for me. I don't have to tell you what happens to the losers.""

The chemists silently nod, and the goons step forward to untie them. Leaping out of their seats, the chemists frantically begin collecting supplies.

Two days later, the now exhausted chemists present their work.

The first rolls a rack filled with trays of glass-like crystals to the front of the room.

""I made 25 kilograms of methamphetamine sulfate. At $100 per gram, this rack is worth a total of $2.5 million.""

The second chemist steps forward, and presents a small metal canister. Curious as to why the second produced so little, the kingpin leans in.

""I made 100 grams of pure LSD. At a street value of $3 per 100 micrograms, this canister is worth $3 million.""

The third chemist - not to be outdone - steps forward and clears his throat, handing the kingpin a tiny bag filled with a white powder.

""What is this?"" the kingpin asks, astonished, ""this can't be more than a single gram. How can you possibly expect to win?""

The third chemist smiles with smug satisfaction. ""I made a gram of thalidomide. I don't know what the exact street value is, but I'm told it costs an arm and a leg.""

He gets out his car and starts walking down the road to see if he can find anyone to help him. About 5 minutes down the road he finds a monastery with some monks in. They invite him in and offer him some food which he gladly accepts. They let him stay the night in one of the rooms till the mechanic can come and help him. 

While he is sleeping at about one in the morning he wakes up to a seductive noise. It’s a very strange noise and he’s not sure what could be making it but he thinks about the sirens that charmed sea men to their deaths. After about 30 long minutes it stops and he decides to go back to sleep again but it is still on his mind. The next morning he wakes up and the mechanic calls and says he’s able to come down and help him fix his car. He thanks the monks for their hospitality but before he leaves he has to ask them. “What’s begins that door? I heard a strange scratching sound coming from inside.” 
The monks reply “I’m sorry we cannot tell you that you are not a monk” he accepts this answer and carries on his way. 

About a year later he is traveling down the same road and as it happens his car breaks down again. He calls up the mechanic but alas he cannot be there till the next day. So he heads down the road and asks the monks if they would allow him to stay the night again. They of course let him in, feed him and let him stay the night. He is in the same room as last time and at around 1 in the morning he wakes up to the strange seductive sound. And once again after 30 minutes it stops. He tries to fall asleep but cannot. He can’t get this sound out of his head, he tosses and turns all night. The next morning he asks the monks again. 
“What is that sound I must know?”
“I’m sorry we cannot tell you. You are not a monk”
“Then how can I become a monk I will do whatever is takes?”
“You must travel the earth and count every blade of grass and every grain of sand. Then you will become a monk”
The man does this. He spends years traveling counting, sleepless nights thinking about the sound. His whole life is now dedicated to this. 

He comes back to the monastery many years later. He is old, grey and fragile. He then tells the monks. 

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

“Well done. You have completed your task and you are now a monk. Now we can show you what is behind this mystery door.”

They lead him outside the wooden door and give him a key. He opens the door and behind it is yet another door. Made of bronze, then a silver door, gold, amethyst, ruby, emerald, topaz, sapphire, opal and finally the last door. It stands taller than the rest, it is made of pure diamond and is the most magnificent thing the man has ever seen. The monks warn him that this is the last door and if he is certain he wants to see what is behind it. He tells them he is certain and they give him the final key. He puts the key in. He turns it and hears a click. He lays his hands on the door and pushes it open. 

Falling to his knees he starts weeping as he is utterly amazed at the source of the sound that he has spent his life working to see.

She called the pharmacy the ""chemist."" But my favorite was the ""post."" It was a noun and a verb. The mail I brought home was called the ""post,"" and when she wanted me to mail something, I was ""posting"" it.

We were not wealthy by any means, but after we had been married for a while, her rich grandmother died. My wife was the only beneficiary, and we inherited a small fortune. 

Alas, we were young, and we did not handle it like we should. She bought jewelry and fancy clothes. I quit my job and got a boat. I guess we thought the money would last forever. Of course, it did not. In a few years, we were even worse off than we'd been before.

We had to start selling everything just to survive. The one thing we simply could not get rid of was the damn boat. We listed it in the classifieds, and my wife corresponded with potential buyers while I looked for work. Every afternoon, I'd come home to find a little pile of letters just waiting to be ""posted.""

The mail system in our area was extremely unreliable, and often, my wife had to re-send exact copies of letters she had already sent, just to make sure they went through. I started to notice that the copies were always in worse condition than the originals, sort of stiff and wrinkly. 

I soon found out why. I stayed home late one day, and saw her in the bathroom with a stack of copies, already sealed and ready to be re-sent. She was taking them, one by one, dunking them in the bathtub and holding them underwater for a few minutes at a time. Then, she would lay them out to dry.

I didn't say anything for a few days. Frankly, I was worried that my wife had gone off the deep end. We were both very stressed, our financial situation being what it was, and she must have just snapped. I didn't know what to do. 

Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. I confronted her and demanded to know why she was exhibiting such bizarre behavior. She was indignant.

""Why, my dear,"" she said. ""I always drown boat re-posts.""

Edit: wording",My first wife was a Brit. I loved her accent and the different words she had for things.,21

bird mad and he swears more than ever.

Then the guy gets mad and says, ""OK for you"", and locks the bird in a
kitchen cabinet.

This really aggravates the bird and he claws and scratches, and when the
guy finally lets him out, the bird cuts loose with a stream of invective
that would make a veteran sailor blush.

At that point, the guy is so mad that he throws the bird into the freezer.

For the first few seconds there is terrible din.  The bird kicks and
claws and thrashes.  Then suddenly gets very quiet.

At first the guy just waits, but then the starts to think the bird may
be hurt.  After a couple of minutes of silence, he's so worried that he
opens up the freezer door.

The bird calmly climbs onto the man's out-stretched arm and says,
""Awfully sorry about the trouble I gave you.  I'll do my best to improve
my vocabulary from now on.""

The man is astounded.  He can't understand the transformation that has
come over the parrot.

Then the parrot says, ""By the way, what did the chicken do?""",Parrots and Chickens,5

''I still don't get it'' responded the Little Johnny.

''Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,'' said the dad.

''Okay then...good night'' said Little Jonny went off to bed. In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying. He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper. So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help. When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep. Through the keyhole, he saw his mom loudly snoring, but his dad wasn't there. So he went to the maid's room. When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid. Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud, ''OH!! Now I understand the government!

He got so nervous since he's the new guy around and the possiblity of him being male raped by these tribesman keeps on haunting him each day. So one night he mustered all the courage he had and asked one of the tribesman, ""Where are the women in your tribe? How do you sexually relieve yourselves?"" he asked. ""Tonight you sleep, Tomorrow I show you"" the villager told him.

So morning came, the villager woke him up and brought him to a nearby river, ""There, my friend"" pointing to a female rhino bathing in the river. ""This?"" he asked. The villager nodded with a malicious smile in his face, ""You go first, my friend"", said the villager.

He was quite hesitant but the eager face of the tribesman pressured him so much. So the guy pulled down his pants and started banging the female rhino while the tribesman is watching. Half an hour passed and the tribesman went down and asked him ""are you about to finish?"",""Yes, I'm quite there"" said the guy, ""Great. We can't ride this rhino and go the women's village if you're banging it like that"".

""...Once every 100 years a human is brought here and this time it was you."" - Old Dog Bob continued.

""But how? Why?"" - I said, clearly confused

""Look, we don't know why you appear, it simply happen. It's weird for us too, and it gets very awkward later.""

""Why? What happens later?""

""Three days after the human appears there's a big poll, where we have two options: the first is allowing the human return home...""

""So.. That means I can go back!""

""Well, maybe. But the second option is a giant pile of cookies. So big it can last for 100 years, until the next human appears. That may sound selfish, but those cookies are really, really great too. Listen, you're gonna adapt well here. We can share the cookies with you too if you want to.""

""That can't be. Do all dogs prefer voting for the cookies?""

""Well, not really. For some reason the puppies don't care about those cookies. But they also never want to join in the poll anyway.""

""They don't mind the cookies and can vote?""

""Yeah, so what?""

""There seems to be a lot of puppies around!""

""So...?"" - Old Dog Bob genuinely didn't seem to follow

""Well, I can just convince them to choose me instead of the cookies!""

""That won't happen! I just told you, the puppies never end up participating.""

""Until now! But maybe I can convince them to! This is my only way home!""

""No way!"" - said Old Dog Bob - ""The puppies never cared for voting and that won't change now!""

Old Dog Bob could have a point. But hope is very motivating. At that point in my mind I had nothing but a single question:

&amp;nbsp;

How many pupvotes can I get?",I suddenly woke up in a world populated by dogs,88

The next day, he held a competition. Any man that could bring his daughter an object that would not melt would marry her and inherit the king's wealth.

Three young princes took up the challenge.

The first brought a sword of the finest steel. 
But alas, when the princess touched it, it melted. 
The prince went away sadly . 
The second prince brought diamonds. 
He thought diamonds are the hardest substance in the world and would not melt. 
But alas, once the princess touched them, they melted. 
He too was sent away disappointed. 
The third prince approached. He told the princess, 
""Put your hand in my pocket and feel what is in there."" 
The princess did as she was told, though she turned red . 
She felt something hard. She held it in her hand. 
And it did not melt!!! 
The king was overjoyed. Everybody in the kingdom was overjoyed. 

The third prince married the princess and they both lived happily ever after. 

Question: What was in the prince's pants? 






M&amp;M's of course. 
They melt in your mouth, not in your hand. 
What were you thinking?? ",Three young princes,63

The problem is that every boy wants to ask this girl out to prom and because the boy was nervous, he ended up being the last one in line to ask her. So he waited and waited and waited on line for what felt like forever until finally it was his turn to ask her. 

She said yes. 

So the boy wants to get prepared for prom, he wants to look sharp so as not to embarrass his new love interest. So he decides to go an buy a tux. When he was at the store there was another long line he had to wait through, this time it was at the register. So he waited and waited and waited on line until finally he could pay for his tux. 

He bought the tux and luckily this time there was a sale, buy one tux get two ties for free. 

So the boy decides to look around the store for the two free ties. He finds them and waits again on the long line to check out of he store because he needed the cashier to remove their security tags. So he waited and waited and waited on line until it was his turn. 

He got his ties. 

The day before the prom the girl he asked out to prom starts texting him. “Are you ready for prom? I am so excited!” she says. “Yes! I am totally ready for prom! How about you?” The boy responds. He sees that she had read his text but she did not respond. He also did not want to go offline Incase she says something important. So he waits and waits and waits online until she responds “I would like a corsage to complete my outfit.”

The boy goes to a floral shop the same day. In his town there is only one floral shop and it looks like everyone else from his school are also there buying bouquets of flowers, corsages, and cards and such. The boy manages to find what he was looking for and yet again, there was another line. So he waited and waited and waited on line until it turned night and the store was just about to close. 

Luckily the boy got the corsage. 

The day of the prom arrives and he has a wonderful time with his date. They dance and they talk and they have so much fun together. It almost felt like the world was absent except for the two of them. The boy wants to kiss her but as he was about to lean in, she requests a drink because all the dancing made her thirsty. “Would you like some punch?” He asks. “That would be great right now!” she smiled. So eagerly the boy goes over to the punch bowl because he knows that after she has her drink, she will kiss him. And once he got to where the punch bowl was, he didn’t have to wait on line to get the drinks. 

That is because, there was no punch line.",A boy falls in love with a girl in high school,0
