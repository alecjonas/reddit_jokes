    James ran to get some water and splashed it on the man's face. He sat up a little and gasped
   ""THE TRAX! FIND IT! PLEASE! IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE!"" the man said, using every drop of energy he had. He slipped off into a very deep sleep that he could not be woken from.
    James knew this was a message from god. He gathered his things, and set off to find the Trax, whatever it was. It took him a full month to find anyone who knew what he was talking about. 
     ""It's at the top of this mountain old man, but you'll never make it there. And even if you did you'd never get a piece of its fruit. It's guarded you know. You'll die first."" 
       James did not like this man, he thought he was a pessimist that lacked faith. James wanted to be gone from this small town and get the Trax, so he set off up the mountain 
       It was a hard climb that took James nearly a week to complete. He could've made it sooner but, he was no young man anymore. He crested the last hill and saw what he was looking for. A massive tree bearing large blue and purple fruit, with bright red stems. He saw perfection in those fruit. This tree had been sent from God himself, he knew it.
     As James approached the tree a harsh laugh echoed in the valley around him. A large troll walked out from behind the tree brandishing a long heavy club. He looked at James and declared: ""YOU CAN NOT HAVE ANY OF THESE FRUIT PUNY HUMAN! HA HA HA!""
    "" I've spent the last part of my life searching for this Tree. Why can I not have a piece?"" James asked desperately:

2.2 Details

We discovered one or more bugs in your app when reviewed on iPhone running iOS 9 on both Wi-Fi and cellular networks.

Specifically, no action takes place when we tapped the Share button on each picture.

Next Steps

Please run your app on a device to identify the issue(s), then revise and resubmit your app for review. 

---------------

September 23, 2015 at 12:50 PM
Me :
The device requires that the user have Instragram installed on their device, If Instagram is not installed on the device then they can not share to instagram . Is Instagram installed on your test devices? Their should be prompt that appears detailing this , I will double check , but in the meanwhile I hope this helps to track down the issue.

Hello,

Thank you for providing this information. Upon further review, we found your app to be in violation of the following guideline:

10.6 Details

We were required to install Instagram before we could use your app. Apps should be able to run on launch, without requiring additional applications to be installed.

Next Steps

Please revise your app so that a user can use it upon launch. If your app requires authentication before use, please use methods that can authenticate users from within your app.

We look forward to reviewing your revised app.

Best regards,

App Store Review

September 23, 2015 at 3:52 PM
Me :
LOL Technically you can still use the app (just not the share to IG part), I presume users would be clever enough to know that they should probably have Instagram installed to share to Instagram no? Re: Please revise your app so that a user can use it upon launch. If your app requires authentication before use, please use methods that can authenticate users from within your app. Authentication can only take place if the user has Instagram installed . If a user has the Instagram app installed but is not authenticated then upon clicking the sharing button they would be redirected to the Instagram in-app login screen where they would login and then be able to share their newly found quote.

September 23, 2015 at 6:45 PM
From Apple
2.2 - Apps that exhibit bugs will be rejected
Hello,

Thank you for your response. For your app to become compliant with guideline 10.6 it would be appropriate to update the app to not require the Instagram app.

We look forward to reviewing your revised app.

Best regards,

App Store Review

Over the past few years we have seen an enormous increase in population and to deal with that we have had to expand our walls a great deal. Since the increase in size, we have received a large number of complaints about the traveling distances. To solve the issue, we have decided to hand out a set of wheels to each new member who passes through our gates! But unfortunately since this is a new program, we don't have a lot of rides in stock. This means we have had to come up with a system of determining what kind of wheels each individual shall receive. We have decided that the quality of wheels will be determined by the individuals faithfulness to their spouse in the previous life. Sound fair?"" The three guys all nodded in agreement. St. Peter turned to guy number one and asked, ""Tell me sir, how faithful were you to your spouse?"" guy number one answered, ""I was married to my beautiful wife for 55 years. I fell in love with her the very second I met her and my love only grew stronger every day after. I never once in my life thought about any other woman. Not once. We had a wonderful life together and my heart leaps with joy when I imagine the day she will arrive at these same gates to spend an eternity here with me."" St. Peter wiped a tear from his eye. ""That was the sweetest thing I have ever heard. You have definitely earned a quality set of wheels."" The gates opened and a Bentley drove out to meet him. Guy number one danced his way to the vehicle and took off pedal to the metal through the gates and out of sight. St. Peter turned to guy number two, ""You're turn now."" Guy number two stepped forward, ""Well, I've been married for about 25 years, and for the most part things have been alright. We've had our ups and downs like most married couples do. There was one time that we got into a pretty big fight and I phoned a lady from work and well, you know... Some things ended up happening that I'm not too proud of... But I came clean to my wife about it all and she forgave me. Things had gone pretty smooth since."" ""Not good not good..."" Peter responded. ""But not the worst I've heard either. Here is your ride."" The gates opened up and a Jeep drove through to meet him. He shook Peter's hand and made his way over to his new ride. As he cruised off into the distance Peter turned to guy number three, but before he could say anything, guy number three started up, ""Okay I'm just going to come out and be completely honest... I've never been faithful to my wife. We've been married for like 10 years or something, and truthfully I believe I stopped loving her right after our first night alone together. Every week I was sleeping with someone else behind her back and to be honest I don't regret any of it. I hate the dumb slut."" St. Peter couldn't believe his ears. ""You sir are possibly the most disgusting human being I have ever laid eyes on. Here, take your ride."" He turned and walked away as a moped puttered along through the gates to meet guy number three.
A considerable amount of time passed and guys number two and three were enjoying a nice ride around the block together when the spotted guy number one in his Bentley parked up on one of the hills outside of their town. They rode up to say hey but when they pulled up beside him they realized he was crying. ""What the heck is wrong with you?"" asked guy number two. ""My wife arrived today."" Guy number one answered.

An old man was sitting outside on his porch enjoying the last moments of summer. He was smoking a cigar and drinking a glass of whiskey. His grandson wandered outside and saw him out relaxing by himself. 

The young boy asked, ""Hey Grandpa, may I try your cigar?""

His grandfather looked up and asked, ""Well, are you old enough?""

The grandson wondered out loud, ""How do I know if I'm old enough?""

His grandfather asked, ""Well, can you pull your wiener down so it touches your bum?""

The young boy, confused, said no... 

His grandfather replied, ""Well, you're just not old enough, bud"".

Frustrated, the kid spun around and stomped inside. A couple minutes later, the determined boy wandered outside again and asked his grandfather...

""Hey Grandpa, may I at least try some of your whiskey?""

The grandfather replied, ""Well, are you old enough?"" 

The grandson asked, ""How do I know if I'm old enough?""

The grandfather replied, ""Well, can you pull your wiener down so it touches your bum?""

The frustrated boy yelled no, then turned inside.

A couple minutes later the boy walked outside again, but this time with a cookie in hand.

Seeing this, his grandfather asked, ""Hey bud, could your grandfather get some of that cookie?""

The boy looked up and asked, ""Well, can you pull your wiener down so it touches your bum?""

Excited, the grandfather perked up and said ""Yeah, I can do that.""

The yellow lab then turned to the black lab and asked, ""Why are you at the vet's office?"" 


""I'm a humper,"" the black lab said. ""I'll hump anything. I'll hump the cat, a pillow, the table, fire hydrants, whatever. I want to hump everything I see. Yesterday, my owner had just got out of the shower and was bending down to dry her toes, and I just couldn't help myself. I hopped on her back and started humping away.""

'Nithe horth.' says the dwarf, 'Can I thee her eyeth?'
So the owner picks up the dwarf to show him the horses eyes.
'Nithe eyeth.', says the dwarf, 'Can I thee her teeth?'
Again the owner picks up the dwarf to show him the horses teeth.
Nithe teeth.... Can I see her eerth?' the dwarf says.
The owner is getting fed up but again picks up the dwarf to show him the horses ears.
'Nithe eerth.' He says, 'Now...can I see her twot?'
The owner, not sure if he heard correctly, replies 'Her what?'
'Twot, can I see her twot,' the dwarf says.
The owner losing his patience picks the dwarf up by the scruff of his neck and shoves his head deep inside the horse's vagina. He holds him there for a couple of seconds before pulling him out and putting him down.

The dwarf shakes his head and says:
'Perhaps I should weefwaze that. Can I see her wun awound?'

 His bookkeeper is deaf. That was the reason he got the job in the first place. It was assumed that Guido would hear nothing so he would not have to testify in court.
When the Godfather goes to confront Guido about his missing $10 million, he takes along his lawyer who knows sign language. The Godfather tells the lawyer, ""Ask him where the money is!""


The lawyer, using sign language, asks Guido, ""Where's the money?"" Guido signs back, ""I don't know what you are talking about."" The lawyer tells the Godfather, ""He says he doesn't know what you are talking about"". 
The Godfather pulls out a pistol, puts it to Guido's head and says, ""Ask him again and tell him if he doesn't answer I'll kill him!""
The lawyer signs to Guido, ""He'll kill you if you don't tell him.""


Guido trembles and signs back, ""OK! You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed at my cousin Bruno's house.""

The sign says ""moderated by bartender, any offense will not be tolerated"" along with a long list of strict rules demanding that you show respect and sensitivity or else you will be thrown out of the bar. He goes in, sits down and orders a drink. The bartender brings him his drink. He's really down and frustrated but hopes that some drinking will cheer him up. So he starts drinking.

As he drinks he gets a bit relaxed and notices an odd thing. The bar is FULL of people of different ages. You have kids, teens, young adults, middle aged and all other ages around. Then there are also people from different races. Lots of races. In fact some of which he doesn't even recognize (aliens?). Amazed at this cultural diversity he figures that the group, as a whole, might be quite knowledgeable. If only he could just share some of his troubles with them maybe their collective wisdom could help solve his problems and ease-up his life.

So he starts pouring out his thoughts, and troubles to people around. And as he speaks he tries to start a discussion with the people around him.

He starts, **""I woke up early today... because today was going to be a very special day.. You see I fucking love bacon and I-""**

""I fucking LOVE bacon!"" echoes the guy sitting next to him loudly. 

At this the woman in the next table shouts ""Well, I fucking love BACON (BAKING) bacon"", starting a pun train.

Another guy immediately shouts ""oh I love your baking, Frankenswine"".

A guy from the opposite corner chimes-in ""This is why I bring home the bacon!"". And by this time people have randomly begun to join in - each creating a pun train.

""I love you too HAMLET""

""Watch out she's a PIGpocket""

""Waiter! I would like to order a really Jurassic PORK""

""Guys! guys! Let's not HAM Bush this pooor man. He was saying something! Let's hear him out!""

Silence. Our man is surprised and annoyed by this sudden insensitive outburst but decides to ignore it and give it another go. This time he decides to skip the topic of bacon altogether and starts with a different one. By this time about half of the people around ignore him and go busy into their own work.

**“My mama today really hates chocolate. You see my papa has a chocolate factory and this is causing a problem in the family. Ever since he -”** Interrupted.

*Slow clap*

“Am I the only one here to think there's nothing wrong in hating chocolates?” shouts a guy right next to his ear. This starts a commotion again and everyone pitches in their thoughts.

“I don’t know whether he’s a human or a troll” 

“Dad has a chocolate factory - Nothing wrong with it.”

“Break off the relationship with both your mom and dad. You have given them enough chances”

“This sounds so fake you karma whore”

“Grow up you fucking piece of shit”

“Yo mama so dirty she makes mud look clean.”

And this again starts a whole battalion of Yo Mama insults and puns.

Now our man gets really annoyed. By this time another remaining half of the people have stopped listening to him. He shouts loudly at the top of his lungs, **“FUCK IT! YOU ALL MISSED IT AGAIN!”**

And the bartender instantly retorts back “THAT’S WHAT SHE SAID!”",When I need some advice and I make a post on reddit to discuss a problem hoping that I'll get some good advice.. (an analogy),1

So, the next day, the priest and ex-convict went to the local prison, and asked to see the prisoner that performed the miracle.

The warden allowed the priest and ex-con to enter his cell under strict supervision.

The monks immediately take him in, nursing him back to health. When he finally gains the strength to speak again, he thanks them, and proceeds to tell them his story - how he's a failed businessman, how his wife divorced him, how he got drunk and decided, in drunken stupor, to drive as far away as he could and get lost in the mountains. As he tells his story, he realizes that he has nothing to go back to, and decides, seeing the kind-heartedness of the monks and how they seem to be happy with the little that they have, to become one of them. The monks happily tell him to pick one of the empty beds in the bedroom, assign him a place at their dining table, and hand him three simple brown robes. 

Then, they send him to study, as he knows little of the monks' religion, and so he spends an entire day and an entire night in the monastery's library, out of pure curiosity at first, and then inable to quench his thirst for wisdom. The next morning, the monks arrive to find their new brother passed out. They wake him up, and, seeing that he's truly worthy of becoming one of them, send him to the chapel, along with brother Bergus.

As they make their way to the chapel through the monastery's many corridors, Bergus explains to the newcomer that he's ready for his first ritual, that it would be hard and potentially painful, but ultimately, worth it. The man simply nods.

The pair sits down on a wooden bench in the chapel, and Bergus continues his explanation: ""You'll now have, if you're strong enough, an experience which will be unlike anything else you've ever had. Try to sit still and focus"". As he says these last words, a choir starts singing, in a language strange and unknown to the man, it's sounds echoing from the chapel's walls. He closes his eyes and tries to let go.  
For two hours, nothing happens. The man, however, has learned to deeply trust the monks, and decides to keep on waiting - and suddenly, carried by the voices, his eyes still closed, he finds himself slowly, but surely losing the bench's touch. 

A strange, floating sensation overcomes him, and he feels like what he imagines drifting through space must be. As he excitedly opens his eyes, he drops to the floor - but finds himself in the middle of nowhere, not recognizing a single detail of the landscape around him. In fact, it's not even an actual landscape - it seems that the place he's in is just a giant, grey plateau made out of stone, extending seemingly forever to his left, right, and front. Behind him, however, the man sees nothing but a black abyss, so dark that it swallows the plateau's wall within a few meters of depth.

The man turns around again and decides to explore his surroundings. He walks into the same direction for hours, while his environment seemingly doesn't change in the slightest - until he sees something that seems to be a tiny, grey speck of dust on the grey horizon. As he draws closer, he realizes that it's a small mountain, no more than 1'000 feet in height, with a rocky path gently spiraling upwards around it, leading to the mountain's tip.

The man, now curious, decides to go up.

As he, after hours, finally arrives at the top, he sees nothing but another plateau, though this time a lot smaller, round and not more than a couple of meters in diameter. In its middle is a white sphere of light, slowly and invitingly floating up, down, and back up again. The man decides to touch the sphere, but instead finds his hand gliding through it, entering something warm and incredible. Within seconds, he decides to enter the sphere - and from the very moment he steps in, he finds something that he later could only describe as ""molten happiness"" surrounding him in a soft cocoon, slowly spinning around him and making him truly feel the best he's ever felt.

As he finally fully embraces the sensation, it suddenly slowly starts fading away, and within moments, he finds himself sitting on the chapel's cold floor again. His mouth agape, he turns around, and sees brother Bergus still sitting on the bench nearby, with a kind smile on his lips. Seeing that the man seems to have finished his journey, Bergus gets up, slowly and with soft steps approaches the man, and, as he leans down and brings his mouth towards the still stunned man's ear, whispers: ""420 praise it"".",A man arrives in a monastery in the middle of nowhere...,0

a few days after she noticed that each time the number 42 bus went by, the doors would shake and almost fall off...

When he got to the apartment he notices that nothing happens on the number 41 bus and neither on the number 87, but when the number 42 bus went by, everything shook.



he then decided he will go inside and see what is causing the doors to shake so much but as soon as he got inside and closed the doors, it become very very hot, so he took off his shirt... then his pants..... and last his socks and underwear.

in the meantime the husband got home and went to the bedroom, opened the closet and finds a naked, sweaty guy just standing there. 

the husband of course thinks the wife is cheating on him so he asks the guy ""dont you have any shame? you better start explaining yourself""


the guy replies: "" Would you believe me if i said i am waiting for the number 42 bus?""

He applies for a janitor's job at a large firm and easily passes an aptitude test. The human resources manager tells him, ""You will be hired at minimum wage of $5.35 an hour. Let me have your e-mail address so that we can get you in the loop. Our system will automatically e-mail you all the forms and advise you when to start and where to report on your first day.""

Taken back, the man protests that he is poor and has neither a computer nor an e-mail address.

To this the manager replies, ""You must understand that to a company like ours that means that you virtually do not exist. Without an e-mail address you can hardly expect to be employed by a high-tech firm Good day.""

Stunned, the man leaves. Not knowing where to turn and having $10 in his wallet, he walks past a farmers' market and sees a stand selling 25 lb. crates of beautiful red tomatoes. He buys a crate, carries it to a busy corner and displays the tomatoes. In less than 2 hours he sells all the tomatoes and makes 100% profit. Repeating the process several times more that day, he ends up with almost $100 and arrives home that night with several bags of groceries for his family.

During the night he decides to repeat the tomato business the next day. By the end of the week he is getting up early every day and working into the night. He multiplies his profits quickly.
Early in the second week he acquires a cart to transport several boxes of tomatoes at a time, but before a month is up he sells the cart to buy a broken-down pickup truck At the end of a year he owns three old trucks. His two sons have left their neighborhood gangs to help him with the tomato business, his wife is buying the tomatoes, and his daughter is taking night courses at the community college so she can keep books for him.

By the end of the second year he has a dozen very nice used trucks and employs fifteen previously unemployed people, all selling tomatoes. He continues to work hard.

Time passes and at the end of the fifth year he owns a fleet of nice trucks and a warehouse that his wife supervises, plus two tomato farms that the boys manage. The tomato company's payroll has put hundreds of homeless and jobless people to work. His daughter reports that the business grossed over one million dollars.

Planning for the future, he decides to buy some life insurance.
Consulting with an insurance adviser, he picks an insurance plan to fit his new circumstances. Then the adviser asks him for his e-mail address in order to send the final documents electronically.

When the man replies that he doesn't have time to mess with a computer and has no e-mail address, the insurance man is stunned, ""What, you don't have e-mail? No computer? No Internet? Just think where you would be today if you'd had all of that five years ago!""

""Ha!"" snorts the man. ""If I'd had e-mail five years ago I would be sweeping floors at Microsoft and making $5.35 an hour."" Which brings us to the moral of the story:

Since you got this story by e-mail, you're probably closer to being a janitor than a millionaire.

A Trid is kinda like a Smurf, but it's all punked out and psychedelic looking. You know, multi-colored hair, tats and piercings, and dresses like it's constantly at a rave. The only thing in the world a Trid gives a damn about is having fun. That's it. If it's not fun, a Trid simply isn't interested.

Well, one day a Trid happens to be walking through the forest, trying to figure out something fun to do. He was bored, and boredom is worse than hard labor to a Trid. As he's walking along, he spots a rabbit a little ways ahead of him.

""Hmm, it might be fun to chase that rabbit."" the little Trid thought to himself, so he took off running towards the rabbit. The rabbit takes one look at the Trid running towards him, and bolts away at top speed. The Trid starts laughing and pours on the speed, trying as hard as he can to catch up to the rabbit. 

""Oh, what fun!"" The little Trid exclaimed, as he dashed after the rabbit around trees, and over rocks. Suddenly the rabbit hooked a mad turn and started up a tall hill, running like the wind. At the top of this hill, a goblin happened to be dozing in the warm sunshine. The rabbit was moving so fast, he ran over the goblin without even seeing him. Waking up startled, the goblin looks down the hill to see the Trid coming at him at full steam. So, he waits until the Trid reaches the top of the hill...and he kicks him!

Down the hill the Trid went rolling and bouncing, head over heels, to land in a heap at the bottom. Picking himself up, he squeals with delight. Being kicked down the hill was the most fun he had ever had, and he went running back up the hill, where the goblin once again kicked him back down. Over a dozen times the Trid ran up the hill, and over a dozen times he was kicked back down, each time being more fun than the last.

He was getting ready to run up again, when a sudden thought occurred to him; this would be even more fun with more Trids! So he high-tailed it back to Trid village to let everyone know about the hill and the goblin.

Soon, there were dozens of Trids at the hill. They would run up one side of the hill, and the goblin would kick them down the other side.

Meanwhile, the rabbit that the first Trid had been chasing was wondering what had happened to his playmate. He had been enjoying the chase as much as the Trid had, and he went to see what had happened. He came back to the hill and saw the line of Trids and the goblin kicking them. Shrugging he shoulders, he got in line and followed the Trids up the side of the hill. When he got to the top however, the goblin just stood there staring at him.

 ""What's wrong?"" the rabbit asked, ""Why won't you kick me down the hill?""

The goblin shook his head and said ""Silly rabbit, kicks are for Trids!""",This one's a bit long....,0

Chuck didn't think much about it and figured maybe he had a cold or something. But after Rodger hadn't shown up for a week or so, Chuck really got worried.

However, since the only time they ever got together was at the park Chuck didn't know where Rodger lived, so he was unable to find out what had happened to him.

A month had passed, and Chuck figured he had seen the last of Rodger. But one day, Chuck approached the park and lo and behold there sat Rodger!

Chuck was very excited and happy to see him and told him so.

Then he said, ""For crying out loud Rodger, what in the world happened to you?""

Rodger replied, ""I have been in jail.""

""Jail?"" cried Chuck. ""What in the world for?""

""Well,"" Rodger said, ""You know Judy, that cute little waitress at the coffee shop?""

A librarian is working away at her desk when she notices that a chicken has come into the library and is patiently waiting in front of the desk. When the chicken sees that it has the librarian's attention, it squawks, ""Book, book, book, BOOK!""      

The librarian complies, putting a couple of books down in front of the chicken. The chicken quickly grabs them and disappears.       

The next day, the librarian is again disturbed by the same chicken, who puts the previous day's pile of books down on the desk and again squawks, ""Book, book, book, BOOK!""       

The librarian shakes her head, wondering what the chicken is doing with these books, but eventually finds some more books for the chicken. The chicken disappears.      

The next day, the librarian is once again disturbed by the chicken, who squawks (in a rather irritated fashioon, it seems), ""Book, book, book, BOOK!"" By now, the librarian's curiosity has gotten the better of her, so she gets a pile of books for the chicken, and follows the bird when it leaves the library. She follows it through the parking lot, down the street for several blocks, and finally into a large park. The chicken disappears into a small grove of trees, and the librarian follows. On the other side of the trees is a small marsh. The chicken has stopped on the side of the marsh. The librarian, now really curious, hurries over and sees that there is a small frog next to the chicken, examining each book, one at a time. The librarian comes within earshot just in time to hear the frog saying, ""Read it, read it, read it...""","A chicken walks into a library and squawks, ""Book, book, book, BOOK!""",1

First, there’s this guy who likes to think he’s the boss of us, which is like, so ridiculous. He makes out like *I’m* dumb, but he’s so gullible sometimes, it’s almost pathetic. Ok, yeah, I’ll admit he is easy on the eye, but someone needs to tell him that there are clothing options that don’t involve blue jeans. I can’t really complain too much about him though, as he is the one in charge of our transport.



Next, there’s a girl who has to be one of the smartest people I’ve ever met. I think she’s like a genius or something. Her career could be on the up &amp; up, and yet, she chooses to stay in this job with us. Now, I don’t want to be bitchy or anything, but I have to say that unfortunately she is not blessed in the beauty stakes. Ordinarily this wouldn’t bother me, but sometimes I'm not sure she even showers, (much less shaves or waxes) &amp; the smell of body odour after a long day on the job is just too much to bear. She dresses like she got lost in an 80's jumble sale &amp; I think she might be a lesbian, because the other day I caught her twitching over a picture of Megan Fox when she thought no one was looking. She also has a cat named Ellen.



But the icing on the cake has got to be the fucking stoner guy. I honestly don’t know how he holds this job down. Now, this chap is more than just your casual toker. Honestly, he is *always* fricking baked; he gets his buzz on before he even comes to work &amp; I know he’s definitely tooting during work, so I'm pretty sure after work is no exception either. He fell off the wagon around ten years ago seems like, and he's only 22. He dresses like a reject wannabe from the 60's, with this ridiculous bushy hair that looks as though it’s not seen water, let alone a brush, in months, and to make matters worse, he always brings his big, weird fucking dog to work. This has got to be against a law of some sort *surely*, but yet nobody ever stops him.



So every fucking day between dealing with the bossy guy, the stoner &amp; the body odour chick, I have to look at this huge, dumb Great Dane walking around half-stoned from the idiot's second-hand smoke. Sometimes I even think it's trying to talk to us with its constant whining. 

To top it off, both of them are always constantly hungry, which then requires multiple stops for fast-food snacks &amp; sweets, every single fucking day. Like I said, it's fucking unbelievable.



Anyway, about my actual job, we drive around in the blue-jean-guy’s flowery van, and we solve mysteries and shit like that.

**TL;DR: Daphne  Blake from Scooby-Doo**

Sock it to Me

On the first night of their honeymoon, the husband isn’t sure how to tell his bride about his stinky feet and smelly socks, while the wife is wondering how to break the news to him about her awful breath, which so far, she’s been able to cover up. After some soul-searching, the husband gathers his nerve and says, “I have a confession.”

She draws closer, peers into his eyes, and says, “Darling, so do I.”

Recoiling, he says, “Don’t tell me—you’ve eaten my sock""",Sock it to me - funny joke about marriage,2

The Farmer says, 'I am a farmer and my son will also farm. I want my land to be forever fertile'
POOF! With the blink of the Genie's eye, the land was forever fertile for farming.

Osama was amazed, so he said, 'I want a wall around Afghanistan, Palestine, Iraq and Iran so that no infidels, Americans or Australians can come into our precious land.'
POOF! Again, with the blink of the Genie's eye, there was a huge wall around those countries.

The Biker says,'I am very curious. Please tell me more about this wall.'

The Genie explains, 'Well, it's about 5,000 feet high, 5oo feet thick and completely surrounds the country. Nothing can get in or out; it's virtually impenetrable.'

The Biker sits down on his Harley, cracks a beer, lights a cigar,
smiles and says,
'Fill it with water.'

America says that's too bad. The Zen master says we'll see.

Come the following spring, the Bills have, by one game, the worst record in the league and hence the first pick in the draft, which they use to draft Heisman winner OJ Simpson, who goes on to break rushing records for them. America says that's wonderful! The Zen master says we'll see.

In 1977, OJ breaks his leg, missing several games. America says that's too bad. The Zen master says we'll see.

He gets traded to the 49ers and moves to Brentwood, where he meets a young waitress named Nicole Brown. The two later marry, and OJ goes on to become a charismatic actor and TV personality. America says that's wonderful! The Zen master says we'll see.

In 1994 Nicole is murdered and OJ is charged with the crime. America says that's horrible. The Zen master says we'll see.

Thanks to a successful defense in OJ's highly publicized trial, OJ's lawyers become somewhat famous, including Robert Kardashian. America's pretty divided on this one, but the Zen master still says we'll see.

Robert's daughter Kim grows up to be quite attractive and gains further fame, or notoriety, through the release of a sex tape. America says that's wonderful! The Zen master says we'll see.

Kim Kardashian and her family go on to star in a vapid reality show and become incessant tabloid news fodder. America says that's too bad.

Claude.

The excited chatter dropped to silence as Claude carefully withdrew
from his waistcoat pocket; a beautiful antique gold pocket watch and chain.

""I want you to keep your eyes on this watch"" said Claude,
holding the watch high for all to see.

""It is a very special and valuable watch that has been in my family
for six generations"" said Claude.
 
He began to swing the watch gently back and forth while quietly chanting:
""Watch the watch --- Watch the watch ----Watch the watch.""
The audience became mesmerized as the watch swayed back and forth. The lights were twinkling as they were reflected from its gleaming surfaces.
One hundred fifty pairs of eyes followed the movements of the gently swaying watch.

They were hypnotized.
 
And then, suddenly, the chain broke!!! The beautiful watch fell to

A lady cashier walked up to him and said, ""Your barracks door is open."" Not a phrase that men normally use, he went on his way looking a bit puzzled.

When he was about done shopping, a man came up and said, ""Your fly is open."" He zipped up and finished his shopping.

Sales pick back up soon after, however after a few more months the manager's department loses most of their major clients to a foreign competitor and many salespeople resign.

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is forever fixing her hair or putting on more make-up. She is extremely self-centred and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I constantly find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe unaided.

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet, here she is with us. However, on the hotness scale, she is unfortunately, a zero out of 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts &amp; she dresses like she got lost in an 80's charity sale. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel in the crown has got to be the fucking stoner guy. And this chap is more than just your average pothead. He is *always* baked; before he comes to work, definitely during work, and I'm pretty sure after work too. He probably hasn't been sober any time in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 60's, with this ridiculous hair that surely hasn't been brushed in months, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work.

Every fucking day I have to look at this huge, dumb Great Dane walking around half-stoned from the toker's second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are always constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops for fast-food snacks, every single fucking day. Like i said, it's fucking unbelievable.

Anyway, about my actual job, I drive these fucktards around in my flowery van and we solve mysteries and shit.

The man is surprised to hear the robot contradict him, but he shrugs and takes the offered club. Sure enough, his drive flies true and lands neatly on the green. He continues for the putt and lines up a little to the left, thinking the green would break right. The robot interrupts and says, ""Excuse me sir, this green is a little tricky. It actually breaks to the left."" The man adjusts his shot and the ball goes straight into the hole. 

The whole day goes like this, and the man plays the best game of his life. When he returns to the clubhouse, he says, ""That was amazing! I would take these robot caddies out any time!""

A couple of weeks later, he returns to the golf course and says, ""I'd like to play the front 9 this time, and I'd like to take out one of those robot caddies please.""

The employee at the counter says, ""I'm sorry sir, we had to get rid of them; we had too many complaints.""

The man exclaims, ""Complaints?! They were amazing! What was there to complain about?""

The employee responds, ""The light reflected off their shiny metal bodies and blinded the other golfers.""

""Well why didn't you just paint them black?""

""We did, but the next day two of them didn't show up, two of them filed for welfare, and four of them robbed the pro-shop."" ",Robot Caddies,6
