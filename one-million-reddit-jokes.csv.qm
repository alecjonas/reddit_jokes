Stumpy looks to Martha and says, ""Martha, I think I really should try that.""  

Martha replies, ""I know you want to Stumpy, but we have a lot of bills, and you know the money is tight, and $10 is $10."" 

So Stumpy goes without. 

Over the next few years they return every year, and the same thing, Stumpy wants to ride, but Martha says no money.

Finally, when Stumpy and Martha are both about 70 years old, Stumpy looks to Martha, and says, ""Martha, I'm 70 now, and I don't know if I'll ever get the chance again, so I just have to have a ride in that there airplane.""  

Martha replies in the same old fashion, and Stumpy kind of slumps down.  

The pilot is standing near by and overhears the conversation...

The pilot pipes up, ""Excuse me folks, I couldn't help but hear your situation, and I have a deal for you.  I'll take both of you up together, and if you can both make the entire trip without saying a word, or even making the slightest sound, I'll give the ride for free.  But if either of you make a sound, its $10 each."" 

Well, Martha and Stumpy look at each other, and agree to take the ride.

The pilot takes them up, and starts to do loop de loops, twists, dives, climbs and spins.  

No sound. 

The pilot lands the plane, looks back at Stumpy and says, ""Sir, I have to hand it to ya, you didn't make even the slightest sound and that was my best stuff.""  

Stumpy looks back at the pilot and says, ""Well, I was gonna say something when Martha fell out, but $10 is $10...""

Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one, ""Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what's your story?"" 

So the first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony."" 

""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. 

The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. 

""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here."" 

Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. 

The third man came to the front of the line, and again Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story.

Trump walks in with a long cage and opens it to reveal a 7ft long weiner dog. Putin and the other russians with him begin to laugh as the war is almost assuredly in their favor. Trump just nods as the two dogs enter the fighting areana. 

In a matter of seconds Trump's weiner dog has absolutely shredded Putin's Shepard. There's almost nothing left. Trump just nods his head and begins to leave. Putin in a fit of hysteria grabs Trump by the collar and asks HOW!

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. 
I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

**Doctor**: '___' for a few minutes.

Okay Mr. Smith lemme tell you a story.

**Mr Smith**: Mmmmkay.

**Doctor**: I once knew an old man, just like you. He loved hunting more than anything in the world. He simply wouldn't miss a single season. 
One day he was setting off to go hunting. In a hurry he accidentally picked up his walking cane instead of his hunting rifle. 
He neared the lake and then stumbled upon a lovely deer drinking at the edge. He realized he'd left his gun at home and so he couldn't shoot the magnificent creature. Out of habit he raised his cane, aimed at the animal and as if it were his hunting rifle it went 'BANG' 'BANG'.    
He couldn't believe it ! Two shots rang out and the deer fell to the ground. 
Now Mr. Smith tell me what do you think about it?

**Mr Smith**: Well logically speaking, I think someone else pumped a couple of rounds into the deer.

**Doctor**: That's my point.

""Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time?"" 

Says the man, ""Well, several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. 

The first wish I asked was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.""

The waitress said ""That's brilliant! Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live. How smart of you!''

""That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact amount of money is always there"" says the man proudly.

The waitress asks, ""But, what's that ostrich all about?""

The man sighs, pauses and answers with a heavy heart, ""My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who accompanies me wherever I go and agrees with everything I say"".",A man walks into a bar with a full-grown ostrich bird behind him.,239

The black man thinks for a long moment before saying, ""I wish all Black people could live together in peace and love in Mother Africa.""

*POOF* the black man gets his wish. 

The Mexican thinks for a long moment before saying, ""I wish all Mexicans could live together in Mexico free from violence, corruption, and poverty.""

The genie looks at the white man expectantly and the white man says, ""Hold on, you mean to tell me that all the blacks are in Africa?""  

""Yes"" the genie says.

The schoolchildren were learning vocabulary, specifically the word ‘tragedy’, when the famous businessman stormed into the classroom.

Trump decided to help the children learn the word ‘tragedy’, and asked the following question to them:

“What would be a tragedy, kids?”

A bespectacled boy nervously answers:

“If my best friend died of pneumonia, that would be a tragedy.”

“No, that would be a great loss,” Trump corrects him.

Another shy young child answers:

“If my uncle got hit by a train, that would be a tragedy.”

“No, no, that would be an accident,” Trump replies.

A young girl raises her hand. The wealthy businessman asks her if she’d like to give an example of a tragedy. The girl nods, and says:

“If Mr. Trump was in his private jet, and a missile hit the jet, that would be a tragedy.”

“Yes, that would be a tragedy for sure. Can you tell me why?” The businessman asks.

Once you have arrived head out to the wilderness. Find a nice open location over water. Keep an eye out for some cover. You'll want to hide somewhere to mask your scent. 
1)Using your saw, cut a hole in the ice slightly larger than bear size. 

2)Open the bag of peas and place them, evenly spaced, around the edge of the hole. 

3) Get behind your cover. It's a little known fact that polar bears love peas. But you'll want to be sure that they don't see you.

4) Finally, when your bear comes out to the ice, it's gonna head straight to those peas. And when the bear goes to take a pea run up a kick it in the ice hole!",How to Catch a Polar Bear,0

Everything was good until I woke up this morning and started to feel really sick.  Like really sick.  I started throwing up everywhere, it was getting all over the walls, running down my shirt, just all over the place.

Now I just feel weak all over, and I've got clammy hands and a fever.  I want to tell my mom that I'm too sick to go to school, but in order to do that I would have to tell her the spaghetti was bad, and I really don't want to hurt her feelings.  But I know what I have to do, so, as worried as I am, I'm going to put on a brave face and calmly tell her that her cooking made me sick.

Fortunately, a large deposit of gold was found by his miners. The king ordered his subjects to make the gold into a massive throne, with inlaid jewels and a massive headrest.

So the chief ruled for years and years, almost a decade, on his great golden throne, but he grew tired of its splendour and decided to bring back his old wooden seat, storing the throne in the attic of his grass mansion.

That night, there was an almighty crash from the chieftain's house. It turned out that the throne has broken through the ceiling, squashing the chief, killing him.

The moral of the story? People who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.","Once, in a far away Amazonian tribe,",8

She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

One day, while Micheal was out with his friends. Micheal Sr, bought and installed a hoop in the backyard for Micheal to use. Not a full-fledged court mind you, just a NBA-height hoop.

It wasn't easy though. The kit that Micheal Sr had bought was missing the net. I mean sure, his son could still play, but there would be no satisfying swish.

So, Micheal Sr looked all over for anything he could use for a net, but alas he found nothing. Then, as he was walking down the street, he saw a garbage truck pass, and in the back of the truck, there it was. A net, a mesh of gray string that no doubt he could use.

He waited until the truck stopped and discreetly took the net from the back. 

When Micheal Jr came back home. He saw a note from his father on the front door saying: *Micheal, Go to the backyard*.

No sooner did Micheal step onto the patio did his father pass him a ball. Micheal looked at the ball, then his father, then at the hoop behind him.

Donald began to scream very loudly. ""WHY!"" He then, struggled to calm himself. Donald Jr. patted his back. ""Okay...okay."" He said calmy and then slumped over to tell more of his story. ""I just had to say something. They were losing so badly, I just had to say something."" He shook his head and grasped his hair and strained his roots by pulling! He was mad! He was in despair! ""When, I saw those Kenyans losing so badly. I just had to rub it in! I went down before the game was finished and it was before the final play... Oh God! Why!? Why had God forsaken me!?"" Donald got up and walked back and forth. Laughing hysterically. He managed to calm down and was trembling. ""Did you know what I said on that stage!? I-I-"" Trump's eyes darted rapidly as if he were about to faint, he was sweating heavily and breathing deeply. ""I went on the stage and told everyone, the whole world...""

Tired of the situation she comes up with a plan.  She goes to the local butcher and asks  for 2 pounds of pig intestines to play a prank on him.  The following day she quietly puts the pig intestines right next to his ass, and goes to make the morning coffee, waiting for the morning fart with a smile on her face.

She comes back to the room and finds her husband shaking, in a panic. ""What happened,"" shes says. ""Why the big scream?!?""

As the weeks went by Richard became more and more lonely and also extremely curious about how this man always managed to pick up all those women. One evening after having a few more pints than usual Richard decided that he needed to know this man's secret to success with women, so he finished his drink and clumsily walked over and introduced himself to the man. After a short conversation Richard finally asked the to the man how he leaves every night with a different gorgeous woman. The man laughed an said ""thats easy! All you have to do is walk up to a woman and whisper one thing into her ear. Just say, tickle my ass with a feather? Then watch her reaction if she smiles then your work is pretty much done, but if she reels back in disgust and says WHAT? Then just repeat, typical nasty weather...... and she will feel silly for thinking you said something nasty and let you buy her a drink anyways. It's a win win.""  Richard didn't know whether to believe the guy or not. It couldn't be that easy could it? But Richard was a little drunk and really lonely so he looked around the bar and found a stunning Burnette woman and pointed her out to the man and said ""I'm going to to try it on her"". The man cautioned Richard by telling him that he was probably a little too drunk to do it correctly and that he should consider waiting for another time. However Richard couldn't be persuaded so he thanked the man and headed over towards the woman. As he reached her he realized she was even more beautiful than he had initially thought. The woman turned to him with a smile and asked ""can I help you?"" Then Richard looked the woman right in the eyes and said ""LOOKS LIKE RAIN WANNA FUCK?!""
EDIT: spelling.",Typical nasty weather,1

They were all getting married within a short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt.

The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding. The card said nothing but ""Nescafe."" Mom was puzzled at first, but then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter.

The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, and the card read: ""Benson&amp;Hedges"". Mom now knew to go straight to her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson&amp;Hedges pack: ""Extra Long King Size."" She was again slightly embarrassed but still happy for her daughter.

The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean. Mom waited for a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing. Then after a whole month, a card finally arrived. Written on it with shaky handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"". Mom took out her latest Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, and finally found the ad for the airline. The ad said: ""Three times a day, seven days a week, both ways.""",3 virgin daughters,1867

They flew for a couple of hours, and the kid was having the time of his life, taking selfies with all of them and singing all the Bieber songs he knew.


DiCaprio came out of the cockpit sweating, ""Our plane has lost both the Engines, we need to jump out of the plane, but we only have 4 parachutes."" He continued after a pause  ""As this is my plane, and I'm doing a lot of great work for the planet, I need to live"". He took the first parachute and jumped out of the plane.


JB stood up immediately and said ""I've millions of fans, and I can't let them down. I've a job to entertain those millions."" He jumped with the 2nd parachute.


Donald Trump already wore the parachute saying ""This all might be the crooked Hillary's plan! I'm the President elect of The United States. If anyone deserves to be alive among all of us, that is me. I'll be the greatest President our country has ever seen. I need to make America great again!"". He jumped without any remorse.


The pope, still seated, looked at the boy and started telling ""I'm old and fragile. I might not live much longer..""

The boy interrupted the Pope, ""No need of all that your Holiness, *the greatest President ever* jumped with my backpack. We have parachutes for both of us!"".

The pope took both the parachutes and threw them out of the flight. The boy looked stunned, ""Your Holiness, do you have any magic trick to save us? why did you throw out the chutes?""

John said, ""Well, I doubt it, but I'll write her a letter just to be sure.""

The bunny rabbit wakes up one Sunday morning with an extreme craving to eat pancakes. This desire cannot wait and the forest diner is closed on Sundays, so he decides to hop all the way to the grocery store (25 min away). He gets there and buys everything he needs: cooking oil, pancake batter, four types of jam, Canadian maple syrup, butter, the works. As soon as he gets home though, he realizes he had forgotten that his frying pan was very old and ended up getting completely ruined last time he used it, and thinks to himself:

""Damn it! I really don't want to hop all that way and back again, it's almost an hour. Wait! the bear lives only 5 minutes away, he eats tons of food, and I know he has a bunch of frying pans, surely he won't mind lending me one!""

So he heads out to the bear's place. On the way, he starts thinking:

""You know, maybe the bear will want some of the pancakes since he's lending me a frying pan. Well, I guess that's fair, I mean, I couldn't make the pancakes without his frying pan. Out of the 15 pancakes I can make with the stuff I bought, I guess I can give him 5. Yeah, 10 will be more than enough for me.

""Hmm... well, the bear is much bigger than me, so what if he wants more than 5 pancakes? Well... I don't know, I guess that's all right. I don't usually eat much and I'll probably be fine if I eat just a few... So if he wants 10, well, 5 should be enough for me! I really only have this craving, and if I eat only a couple, it will probably go away (as they say, a lot more exciting at first...)

""Hmm... well... what if he wants more than 10? I mean, he's much bigger than me, it's not like I can do anything if he decides to just have them. If he says he wants to help out because he wants to eat some too, I can't really say no, after all, he is lending me a frying pan. But then he can come back with me and while we make them, he could just eat pancake after pancake and I can be left with nothing! I mean, what's the big deal, why can't he just lend me a damn frying pan for 20 damn minutes, he's got tons of them?? I always try to help him out if he asks for something, why can't he do the same?!""

Just about this time he gets to the bear's place. Knocks on the door, bear opens.

""You know what, bear? Fuck you, and fuck your frying pan!""",Great Romanian joke,274
