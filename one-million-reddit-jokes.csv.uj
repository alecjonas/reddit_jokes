His crops weren't yelding like they use to, cattle prices had hit an all time low, and he was really strapped for cash. After discussing it with Mrs. Farmer John, they decided to salvage what they had, sell the farm, and move to greener pastures. He kissed his crying wife goodbye and saddled up his horse to make the trip into town.

On the way to the bank to begin drawing up the documents, he came upon his long time neighbor, Farmer Fred, with his two sons pushing overloaded wheelbarrows of eggs into town. There were so many eggs that they were toppling over themselves and breaking on the ground, forming a trail of yolky badder behind them. The family didn't seem to care how many dropped as they walk, and almost seemed to be in a daze upon looking at them.

Now, farmer John was amazed by this; he had never seen so many eggs in one place in his entire life. He reigned in his horse and stopped Farmer Fred and his boys in their tracks.

""Hey there Farmer Fred. I have to ask - how in the world did you get so many eggs?!""

""Well Farmer John,"" Farmer Fred replied, ""I went down to the market the other day and got me one of those new breeds of roosters they just made! They Call them Rooty Roosters and by gummit, this thing has made our hens lay eggs damn near nonstop for the last week! This load we've got here is our fifth haul today alone!""

Farmer John was shocked. he bid Farmer Fred and his boys a good day and hightailed it into town, pulled out a small loan from the bank, and bought himself a brand new Rooty Rooster, which he unceremoniously named Rooty. He cinched up his horse, rode all night back home, and explained to Mrs. Farmer John what had happened. She grab Rooty by his neck, hicked up her skirt and trudged out to the hen house. 

""Now Rooty, you go get in there and earn your keep!"" Mrs. Farmer John shouted. She flung the coop door open, threw Rooty in, and slammed the door shut. She and Farmer John went back inside and went to sleep.

The next day, Farmer John leapt out of bed, ran to the hen house, and flung the door open. He couldn't believe his eyes! The hen house was damn near overflowing with fresh eggs! He ran back inside, got his wife, and they both jumped for joy. However, when they went to look for Rooty, he wasn't in the hen house - he was found trying to hump the pigs! Farmer John went over and grab Rooty.

""Rooty, Rooty, Rooty, you're gonna fuck yourself to death!"" Farmer John said, tossing Rooty back in the hen house and closing the door. They gathered all the eggs they could, went to the market, and sold each and every last one of them.

The next day, Farmer John ran right on back out to the hen house. He couldn't believe his eyes! The coop itself was chock full of eggs to the point the hens were wedged against the wire sides! He and Mr.s Farmer John jumped for joy but when they went to look for Rooty, he was nowhere near the hen house - they found him trying to hump the cows! After moving the hens into the barn, Farmer John went to collect Rooty. 

""Rooty, Rooty, Rooty, you're gonna fuck yourself to death!"" Farmer John said as he thew Rooty into the barn with the hens. He and Mrs. Farmer John collected all the eggs they could, went to market and sold each and every last one of them. 

The next day, Farmer John went out to the barn, which appeared to have crumbled overnight. Hens were mounted atop cartoonishly large piles of eggs, which were still popping out of them as he watched in horrific amazement. As usual, he looked for Rooty but was nowhere near the hens - they found him trying to hump the horses! They decided to avoid any further damage to their property and allowed the hens to walk freely around the farm.

""Rooty, Rooty, Rooty, you're gonna fuck yourself to death!"" Farmer John decried as he shoveled egg load after egg load into the back of his newly bought trailer. He and Mrs. Farmer John went to market, and sold each and every last egg they had. 

The next day, Farmer John sprung out of bed but with dismay, not a single egg was found anywhere on the farm. The hens were all accounted for, but Rooty was nowhere to be seen. Farmer John went out to look for Rooty. He spent hours looking for him but had no luck. Right as he was about to turn back, he noticed several buzzards circling something out in the pasture. He walked out there to find Rooty's lifeless body laying in the grass.

""Rooty, Rooty, Rooty, I *TOLD* you that you'd fuck yourself to death!"" Farmer John said, wiping off his brow.

To which Rooty replied, ""Shh, they're about to land.""",Rooty the Rooster [NSFW],7

""Each of them trees is dirty now. So, it's dirty tree, and dirty tree, plus dirty tree. Dat makes 99.""

The surgeon explains that it's really minor surgery she is asking for and she should rather explore some practical alternatives to surgery and avoid the possible risks and side effects that go along with it. He suggests she take a prune pip and fold it into the back of her scalp so as to collectively gather the skin around her body. That way, he explains each day she feels low, she can just turn it a bit and lift everything around her body, evenly. She can hide the ever increasing knot of skin under a bun or hairpiece, too.

The cowboy replies, ""Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in Arizona , the other is in Colorado . When we all left our home in Texas , we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank together. So I'm drinking one beer for each of my brothers and one for myself.""

I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.

Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.

I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).

Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.

My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.

After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.

My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.

Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.

But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.

A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised. But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.

It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.

When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help.

After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who solved the problem. ""The good news is I can cure your headaches; the bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.""

Joe was shocked and depressed, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. After the operation, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, ""That's what I need, a new suit.""

He entered the shop and told the salesman, ""I'd like a new suit."" The salesman eyed him briefly and said, ""Let's see, size 44 long?"" Joe laughed, ""That's right, how did you know?"". ""It's my job."" replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit, and it fit him perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about a new shirt?"" Joe thought for a moment and then said, ""Sure!"". The salesman eyed Joe, then said, ""Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16 and a half neck."". Joe was surprised, ""That's right, how did you know?"". ""It's my job."" came the familiar reply. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly, as well. The salesman asked, ""How about new shoes?"". Joe was on a roll and agreed. The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, ""Let's see, nine-and-a-half?"" Joe was astonished, ""That's right, how did you know?"". ""It's my job."" said the salesman, again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly, again. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, ""How about some new underwear?"" Joe thought for a second and said, ""Sure, why not."" The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, ""Let's see, size 36."" Joe laughed smugly, ""No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old.""

Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while looking out of the window onto to the pasture, she saw that the family's only cow was lying dead in the field. The situation looked hopeless to her -- how could she possibly continue to feed her family now?

In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself. When the husband awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head.

Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself.

When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank. She said, ""I've seen all and know the reason for your despair. But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, I will restore your parents to you.""

The son agreed to try, but after three times, he was simply unable to satisfy her again. So the mermaid drowned him in the river.

Next the second oldest son woke up. After discovering what had happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river.

The mermaid said to him, ""If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, I will make everything right."" And while the son tried his best (seven times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him in the river.

The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone. He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in.

And there he also met the mermaid. ""I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row.""

The young son replied, ""Is that all? Why not twenty times in a row?""

The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request. Then he said, ""Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?"" And even as she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said, ""Why not THIRTY times in a row?""

Finally, she said, ""Enough!! Okay, if you will have sex with me thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody and the cow back to perfect health."" 

Just before the young son starts, he hesitated and asked, ""Wait a minute!! How do I know that thirty times in a row won't kill you like it did the cow?""",Dead Cow and the Mermaid (a bit long but worth the ride),110

post,3yyhyq,2qh72,jokes,false,1451599424,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3yyhyq/biker_kisses/,self.jokes,,"Back on September 9th, a group of Peking, Illinois bikers were riding west on I-74 when they saw a girl about to jump off the Murray Baker Bridge. So they stopped.

George, their leader, a big burly man of 53, gets off his Harley, walks through a group of gawkers, past the State Trooper who was trying to talk her down off the railing, and says, ""Hey Baby, whatcha doin' up there on that railin'?""

She says tearfully, ""I'm going to commit suicide!!""
While he didn't want to appear 'sensitive', George also didn't want to miss this 'be-a-legend' opportunity either so he asked, ""Well, before you jump, Honey-Babe, why don't you give ole George here your best last kiss?""

So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that. And it was a long, deep, lingering kiss followed immediately by another even better one.

After they breathlessly finished, George gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, ""Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had, Honey! That's a real talent you're wasting, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why the hell are you committing suicide?""

""My parents don't like me dressing up like a girl.""

It's still unclear whether she fell, jumped or was pushed.

The hooker says, ""Honey, a hand job is $500.00""

For example, he inserted his FINGER in the dead body's ANUS &amp; put the finger in his own mouth &amp; TASTED it. Then he told the students to do what he did. The students hesitated for several minutes, but eventually everyone inserted their fingers in the body's ANUS &amp; tasted it. When everyone finished tasting their fingers, they were all frowning.

A: Because they rely on “the invisible hand”.



And of course, there are the economist variants of the lightbulb joke, originating in a 1994 Wharton Journal, as later recapped in Forbes:

Q: How many economists does it take to change a light bulb?

A1: None. The darkness will cause the light bulb to change by itself.

A2: None. If it really needed changing, market forces would have caused it to happen.

A3: None. If the government would just leave it alone, it would screw itself in.

A4: None. There is no need to change the light bulb. All the conditions for illumination are in place.

A5: None. Because, look! It’s getting brighter! It’s definitely getting brighter!!!

A6: None. They’re all waiting for the unseen hand of the market to correct the lighting disequilibrium.",Q: Why are economists so rarely called out for being the wankers they are?,0

As you know, some of us have been known to have brushes with the authorities from time to time, often on the way home after a ""social session"" with family or friends. Well, two days ago, this happened to me. I was out for an evening with friends and had more than several beers followed by some whiskey. Although relaxed, I still had the common sense to know I was slightly over the limit.
That's when I did something I've never done before - I took a taxi home.
Sure enough on the way there was a police roadblock, but since it was a taxi they waved it past and I arrived home safely without incident.
This was a real surprise to me, because I had never driven a taxi before. I don't know where I got it, and now that it's in my garage I don't know what to do with it..
So, anyway, if you want to borrow it give me a call.","As we go into New Years, here's something a little more serious.",28

""Listen, Daedalus,"" Hades began. ""You know how the population of the dead here increase every year? The Underworld would not be able to sustain so many souls.""

""Well,"" Daedalus replied. ""What would you want me to do about it?""

""You are the great builder who designed the Labyrinth for King Minos himself, and I want you to do the same for me as well. But not just any Labyrinth. We need a Labyrinth that is economical and efficient. We need a Labyrinth that will suit our needs and adapt to any situation that may arise in the future. We need a Labyrinth that can think for itself.""

Daedalus pondered for a moment, then finally said ""I'll see what I can do.""

The great architect spent 4 years planning and building his first prototype of his new Labyrinth. He showed the prototype, Labyrinth Beta, to Hades.

""This looks really good, Daedalus,"" Hades said. ""The design is economical and efficient. But, I want an intelligent Labyrinth. Now, you just need to add some form of Artificial Intelligence to it. We have a few new souls here, so maybe they could help you with that.""

So Daedalus, along with a group of Computer Science students, programmed a complex AI for the Labyrinth in 3 months. They presented the AI to Hades.

""Now, this seems like a very complicated AI indeed! However, we need the AI to be user friendly. Maybe if it could communicate with us via speech, for example?""

And so Daedalus and his team designed a user interface for their Labyrinth, and after 2 weeks, they were finished. Daedalus decided to see for himself the intelligence of his design.
""This is Daedalus, your creator. Can you hear me?"" he said to the complex machine.

""Hello, Daedalus,"" replied the Labyrinth in a robotic voice. ""I am Labyrinth Alpha, at your command.""

""Labyrinth Alpha, could you enumerate your functions?""

""I am able to sustain up to 5 billion souls at any time, and I can adapt if ever more souls arrive in the Underworld. Also, I can adjust my climate in certain parts of me so that I could suit the needs of different souls from different parts of the world. Lastly, I have many features that will make even the newer souls more comfortable in the Underworld. I have 1.5 TB/s WiFi, all the latest video games, all the latest albums and mixtapes, and all the popular TV shows and Movies. And all of this was possible because of your sophisticated AI, Creator.""

""Wow,"" Daedalus said. ""I have to say, I'm impressed. I'm sure Hades will be impressed with you, too.""

""Well,"" Labyrinth Alpha replied. ""I, for one, am certainly a maze.""",Daedalus and the Labyrinth,4

He figured if he hurried and played very fast, he could get in nine holes before he had to head home. Just as he was about to tee off an old gentleman shuffled onto the tee and asked if he could accompany the young man as he was golfing alone. Not being able to say no, he allowed the old gent to join him.

 To his surprise the old man played fairly quickly. He didn't hit the ball far, but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time. Finally, they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough shot. There was a large pine tree right in front of his ball - and directly between his ball and the green.

 After several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said, ""You know, when I was your age I'd hit the ball right over that tree.""

 With that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard, hit the ball up, right smack into the top of the tree trunk and it thudded back on the ground not a foot from where it had originally lay.

 The old man offered one more comment, ""Of course, when I was your age that pine tree was only three feet tall.""",The Old Golfer,129

The doctor does a routine exam and can't figure out the source, so they decide to do a CAT scan and MRI. After the procedures, the doctor finds the route of the headaches seem to stem, for some reason, from his penis. 

The doctor tries a few alternative procedures, to try and relieve the pain from the headaches, but they never go away. He then claims that the only way that he is sure the headaches would go away is if the man had his penis removed. 

The man thinks it over very carefully, but being middle aged with no wife, and having used it quite extensively up to this point, he just absolutely cannot live with the headaches, so he decides to go through with the procedure and has his penis removed. The headaches stop immediately. 

A few day later the man needs to buy a new suit for a party he is going to, so he goes to the store and sees the tailor. The tailor takes all of the usual measurements, then asks what side the man's penis hangs on. The man asks if it matters, to which the tailor replies, ""Oh yes, sir, if it hangs on the wrong side you get these massive headaches.""",Headaches,8

The Rabbi informs them of an old spiritual remedy in situations like this. ""While you are making love to your wife"", the Rabbi says, ""I will stand at the end of the bed naked, shaking a towel in the air over the both of you."" The couple is very confused but reluctantly agree as the Rabbi further reassures it will help her achieve sexual bliss.

The couple go home with their Rabbi that same night and begin making love as he stands at the end of the bed shaking a towel in the air over them both. But nothing happens. No orgasm, no fireworks. The couple's frustration grows.

The man turns to the naked Rabbi angrily. ""Rabbi! It's not working! What kind of mumbo jumbo advice are you giving me here?"" 

""Calm down, calm down"", says the Rabbi. ""Sometimes it works better if one stands at the side of the bed. This towel stuff is all about technique."" 

The frustrated couple get back to making love, this time the Rabbi begins shaking the towel from the side of the bed. Again, no orgasm. The wife is pissed, the husband is livid. 

""For fuck's sake Rabbi, are you sure you're doing it right? Put your back into it or something!""

The Rabbi calmly replies ""Maybe you would like to try it yourself then? We could switch"" The husband springs out of bed and grabs the towel, accepting the challenge to upstage him. The Rabbi slides into bed with the wife, they make love and the wife has the most earth-shattering, mind-blowing orgasm she has ever experienced. All the while, the husband is at the side of the bed, shaking the towel like there's no tomorrow.

As his wife and the Rabbi lie in bed panting, the husband stands there triumphantly. ""You see, old man!"" he exclaims, ""now THAT'S how you shake a fucking towel!"" ",An old Jewish couple go to their Rabbi because they're having problems in the sack,1

Mixing the Renault 'Clio' and the Ford 'Taurus' they have designed the ‘Clitaurus'. 

It comes in pink, and the average male car thief won't be able to find it - let alone turn it on - even if someone tells him where it is and how to do it.

Rumor has it though, it can be a real bitch to start in the morning!
Some have reported that on cold winter mornings, when you really need it, you can't get it to turn over.

New models are initially fun to own, but very costly to maintain, and horribly expensive to get rid of. 

Used models may initially appear to have curb appeal and a low price, but eventually have an increased appetite for fuel, and the curb weight typically increases with age. 

Manufacturers are baffled as to how the size of the trunk increases, but say that the paint may just make it LOOK bigger. 

This model is not expected to reach collector status. Most owners find it is best to lease one, and replace it when it becomes troublesome. ",The New 2016 Clitaurus,0

They become weaker over time as they skip meals, and when the boys are aged 12, their parents succumb to the common cold.

""Why, oh why did my parents have to suffer this way? Is wealth all that is the way of the world?"" One of them wailed. The noblemen who owned his home made their profit off of the work of those who lived on their land. Those who lived on the land were treated like dirt by the noblemen - no, they were treated like machines.

One day, his younger twin left. ""In this world, one must work hard to succeed. I will succeed and return to help you.""

He felt alone, sad, and betrayed. His parents were killed by the horrible systems of the manor, and his precious last relation, his brother, mind corrupted by the world, left to make his own fortune, leaving him alone.

He spent his days in despair, until one day, a voice called upon him. The ethereal, disembodied speech tantalized him. ""I can bring you equality for all."" The voice said. ""None will see difference from anyone else if you supply me with but one thing."" It spoke.

""Name your price, O savior! What is it you ask of me?"" The eager boy cried eloquently in his joy. He finally found a way to right the wronged world.

""All I ask of you is the blood of the rich."" The voice spoke, and it faded away.

""What does this mean?"" The boy asked, confused. Panicked he was as he went several minutes without an answer. ""Ah, I see it now!"" He finally cried. ""I must sacrifice the evil wealthy individuals to this figure for him to grant me my desires!"" He laughed. It was an unstable, shifting laugh, a dangerous light shining in his eyes.

Outside of the ramshackle cabin's door, the younger twin wept. ""Upon this day, I have lost my brother, for he has been corrupted by hate. After the mistake of abandoning him, I cannot bear to face him now."" He held his head in his hands as he spoke to himself, and he left.

Years passed. Those were not stagnant years, no. The younger of the two twins had built an empire of traders traveling between manors, peddling. It was so grand, in fact, that by taking just 1% of the profit, he had earned enough to found his own kingdom.

On the other hand, the elder twin had built up an army of dissatisfied serfs. They stormed manor after manor, taking captive all of the highest class individuals and raiding their homes. Always the loot was distributed among the people, so never was anyone in want, and never was anyone satisfied.

One day, the elder twin rounded up all of the noblemen and around them made a ring of kindling and tinder. His brother had become aware of this and came before his brother, shouting. ""I will not stand by as you commit this senseless slaughter!"" He spoke as he ran.

The elder, wide-eyed, finally managed to catch a spark, beginning the chaotic fire. ""This is not senseless slaughter."" He spoke, his voice shaky, his sanity lost.

The year was 1948; the war was over, most people were well off and the only things society deemed worth worrying about was the content of particular domicile under ownership of a particular ‘Mr. Jones’ and the proximity of Old Joe Stalin’s hand in relation to a very scary red button. Unfortunately the Johnsons didn’t get to live the life that most people associate with that era. Little Bobby Johnson was the seventh of seven child that had the misfortune to pass through Ms. Johnson’s birth canal. He grew up in the mean streets of Motor City, USA. It was the sorta place where the obituaries were filled with stupid young men, hearts filled with passion, each of whom died long before his time. Bobby was the school punching bag. Everyone beat the shit outta Bobby. That’s just how it was. It was just a thing young boys did to other young boys. Always has and always will be. There was one exception of course, and that was Brett Anders, a wall of muscle topped with a blonde flattop. Brett took sadistic pleasure in making the lives of those around him hell, a specially Bobby. He beat the poor boy to a pulp every day and stole his lunch money, which he didn’t even need for any particular reason. Bobby’s own home served as no place of refuge. His father took offense to Bobby’s love of literature and playing the guitar his father had inherited from a distant cousin, seeing them as ‘tell-tale signs of a faggot’ and no son of his was going to be a faggot. He saw it as his mission with Bobby to beat the faggotry of him with a belt. He never told Bobby this to his face. In the darkest corner of his mind he knew it was a way to make the pain go away; the pain of waking up too early on a shitty bed to go to a shitty job only to come back home to a shitty house and a cold woman that don’t love you no more. The pain of having to watch a the life leave the eyes of a Jap soldier whose bleeding out in a ditch, knowing that you threw the grenade that put him in his current state of hellish agony. The pain of having to watch Connor Murphy, your best friend from high school get gunned down by a Jap who had just surrendered, only to pull out a Nambu the moment you took your eyes off him. Brock Johnson was a man with many demons, but none of them excuse every time he took his fists and belt to Bobby’s flesh. If you didn’t already guess it, he was an unpleasant man, whose only friends where Jack Daniels and Captain Morgan, who were frequently present during Bobby’s many beatings; not to mention those of his other children and his wife.
    Bobby’s life changed one day at school when he experienced what he at first believed to be an act the divine as for a moment he had wholeheartedly believe that a bona-fide angel had descended from the heavens to take the seat to his left on the first day of 6th grade english. Her face was water to a dying man, her flawless skin glistened in the morning sun, and her eyes were two magnificent sapphires behind which lay a fire that burned bright enough to illuminate even the darkest recesses of space. She played with her light brown hair as Bobby looked at her the same way a man would look at a priceless Monet in a museum, though only for a few moments as he had to eventually come back to his senses. For Bobby, however, those few moments might have well been centuries. Her name was Heather Patterson. They became friends, having similar interests such as the works of H.G. Wells, Lucille Ball, Joltin’ Joe DiMaggio, and of course The King. They would spend hours every day listening to the King, drinking Coca Cola, and reading all those good old comics from every nerd's two best friends; Stan and Jack. She became Bobby’s sanctuary from the big scary thing that was his life. One day near the end of the eighth grade Bobby found Heather getting all felt up by Brett and his boys in an alley. Nobody in that alley was aware of him a moment he could walk away and let everything that was about to happen happen. There would be no consequences for Brett. Few women even reported rapes in those days and even if Heather did, there was nothing that Brett’s money couldn’t fix. He could walk away, but Bobby knew that the decision that he made here was going to be decide what kind of man he was going to be. He stepped into that alley and fought like a wild animal, giving Brett and his posse a beating they would remember till the end of their days. He sent Brett and his gang running in fear and pain. Afterward he leaned up against the hard brick wall, bleeding like nobody’s business and looking at Heather, not sure what to say. Heather asked him why he dared to go against Brett. In his dazed state he confessed his love for her and she confessed her love for him. After she patched up his wounds they made sweet, sweet love in the backseat of his car. Their hearts were pounding in excitement as they removed each other's clothes and he planted an amorous kiss on the left side her supple neck. Then, as soon as they were both fully naked, he took his erect penis and entered her. It lasted for about three minutes, but they were three minutes of pure ecstasy for all parties involved.
    Bobby and Heather continued their relationship through high school. They were happy and her parents always liked Bobby.The only thing they didn’t see eye to eye on was their future. Heather would never leave Detroit and Bobby wanted to leave the moment he turned 18. He hated the city. On his 18th birthday the choice was made for him when he was drafted to fight in Vietnam or at least that’s what he believed. He loved Heather, but he couldn’t stand Detroit. Heather cried for days when he told her the news and for days when she left. Bobby’s last view of her was on a train platform, tears dripping down from those sapphire eyes.
    Bobby trained for a little while with the marines before being shipped out to a little Vietnamese town called Khe Sanh on January 28th, 1968. Two days later it was attacked as a part of Tet offensive. Bobby watched as men were ripped apart by artillery and Kalashnikov fire. For months he fought bravely against the NVA while witnessing the horrors of war. Near the end of the battle he was shot in the leg and sent to recuperate on a nearby aircraft carrier. Once healed he received the medal of valor and an honorable discharge.
    A few months later Bobby found himself in Los Angeles, debating on whether or not to board a plane back to Detroit. He decided to think that decision through and went to a small, obscure nightclub with a friend of his. That night mother of the musician that was supposed to perform had a stroke, leaving the club without any entertainment. His friend, who had listened to him sing and play guitar during the war, convinced him to take the stage and Bobby did. He ended up impressing everyone who was present. After playing for a few hours Bobby took a break and was approached by a man in a suit. The man introduced himself as Werner Faust and said he worked for a record company and that he would like to offer Bobby an album deal. Bobby accepted the deal and within a few years he became wildly successful. He was an international sensation and made a lot of money, which was nice, because he needed it to finance the heroin addiction he picked up in ‘Nam. Eventually he moved was asked to star in films. First it was just bit parts so that people could say “Hey, it’s Bobby Johnson!”, but all that changed when he was asked to star in a low-budget spaghetti western titled ‘Single Action Fury’. There his previously unknown acting talent shined and he began to be taken seriously as an actor, landing him bigger and bigger roles, all while his music career was still going strong. Eventually his life changed again while staring in an Oscar-award winning drama titled ‘Five Nights in Azerbaijan’, where he co starred with a woman named Ramona Thachett. She was the queen bee of Hollywood. Blonde hair, blue eyes, and a body most people can’t even dream of; she was Helen of Troy reincarnated. They started dating and eventually married on a beach in Southern California. They lived happily for a long time, Ramona and Bobby gave birth to two beautiful daughters, Jackie and Marilyn, and continued to act. Bobby even published a novel and kicked his heroin addiction (the later for his children), though both are easier said than done and Bobby was more than content to live his life never having to do either again. In 1987, at 38 years old he decided to run for state senate. He was popular and resonated with the voters. Some pundits even went so far as to say that he was the next Ronald Reagan. During his campaign he was offered money and ‘friendship’ by a the local mafia. He rejected it, and as a result was made an example of. One night the police arrived at his house and arrested him in full view of his wife and children. He was charged with the murder of an underage prostitute that he had never seen before. The judge, the jury, even his own lawyer, were bought and paid for by the mob. The decision was swift: 25 years in prison. During those long two and a half decades Ramona filed for divorce and his daughters seldom visited him. Ramona ended up dumping almost all of their money down the crapper during the Dot-com bubble in the late nineties, leaving the family broke. The last he heard of Ramona, she and the girls were living with her sister in Charleston, South Carolina. In prison Bobby’s fortune continued to be bleak. He was sodomized and sexually enslaved by a gang of neo-nazies. His torment continued for many years, until he was released in 2012, at age 64. Bobby’s freedom was unfortunately, paired with some bad news: in his last days of imprisonment he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He had six months to live. On his way out of prison he was greeted by a man named Nick O’Malley. Nick said he was a private investigator hired by his old high school to track him down and invite him to a reunion party they were having. Bobby used a good chunk of his remaining money to fly back to Detroit to attend the party, having nothing else to do with himself. He sat down at a table, all alone. On the other side of the room, he saw an old woman, with eyes like sapphires sitting alone. He had to talk to her, but his mouth was parched. He decided to get something to drink first, something without alcohol, as he had dumped that along with the heroin, so many years ago. He went to the punch bowl, and to his surprise nobody wanted any punch. There was no punch-line.","Hey Reddit, I wrote this joke for you all of you. I hope you like it.",0

The little girl said, ""I don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do.""

The father thought it was a strange coincidence.

A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this,

""Holy crap"" thought the father, ""this kid is in contact with the other side.""

He practically went into shock. He couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office.

He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

When he got home his wife said, 
""I've never seen you work so late. What's the matter?""

He said, ""I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of my life.""

&gt;One evening as the sun went down and the jungle fire was burning

&gt;Down the track came a hobo hiking and he said boys I'm not turning

&gt;I'm headin for a land that's far away beside the crystal fountains

&gt;So come with me we'll go and see the Big Rock Candy Mountains

-

&gt;In the Big Rock Candy Mountains there's a land that's fair and bright

&gt;Where the handouts grow on bushes and you sleep out every night

&gt;Where the boxcars are all empty and the sun shines every day

&gt;On the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees

&gt;Where the lemonade springs where the bluebird sings

&gt;In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

-

&gt;In the Big Rock Candy Mountains all the cops have wooden legs

&gt;And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth and the hens lay soft boiled eggs

&gt;The farmer's trees are full of fruit and the barns are full of hay

&gt;Oh, I'm bound to go where there ain't no snow

&gt;Where the rain don't fall and the wind don't blow

&gt;In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

-

&gt;In the Big Rock Candy Mountains you never change your socks,

&gt;And the little streams of alcohol come a-trickling down the rocks,

&gt;The brakemen have to tip their hats and the railroad bulls are blind,

&gt;There's a lake of stew and of whiskey too,

&gt;You can paddle all around 'em in a big canoe,

&gt;In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,

-

&gt;In the Big Rock Candy Mountains the jails are made of tin,

&gt;And you can walk right out again as soon as you are in,

&gt;There ain't no short handled shovels, no axes saws or picks,

&gt;I'm a goin to stay where you sleep all day,

post,3yiadi,2qh72,jokes,false,1451296702,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3yiadi/hunting_overload/,self.jokes,,"Two hunters got a pilot to fly them into the far north for elk hunting. 


They were quite successful in their venture, and bagged six big bulls. 

The pilot came back as arranged to pick them up.

 They started loading their gear into the plane, including the six elk, But the pilot objected he said, 

""The plane can take out only four of your elk. You will have to leave two behind."" 


One of the hunters pushed forward, ""Hey, last year our pilot let us take out six elk. It was the same model plane, same weather conditions, and everything. What's with this? We want you to allow us to fly out just like last year.


 Reluctantly the pilot finally permitted them to put all six elk aboard and the men all climbed in with their gear. But when they attempted to take off and fly out of the valley, the little plane could not make it.

 They crashed in the wilderness. Climbing out of the wreckage, one hunter said to the other, ""Do you know where we are?"" ""I think so,"" replied the other Hunter.


""Yep! I think this is about 100 yards further along than where we crashed last year!""
