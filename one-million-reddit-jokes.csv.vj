He knew this could mean his death if he was caught. As he was walking into his apartment building, he noticed that a door that was usually closed was left ajar. As the man stepped inside the room, he saw three gunmen holding hostage a woman and two children. 

They said ""we have your family, tell us your bank account information or we will start shooting one by one."" The man thought for a moment but refused. Without hesitation, the man holding the woman shot her once in the head. The men again demanded that he hand over the information and he again refused. The man shot the little girl. Finally, they grabbed the son and pleaded ""this here is your son, your pride and joy, surely you cannot let him die."" The man just looked away silently. The men pulled the trigger and the little boy was dead. 

After the third shot, the door slammed open and the police rushed in. They immediately  arrested the three gunmen and let the former mobster go. As they were dragging out the gunmen, the ringleader turned around and asked how the man could watch his whole family be killed just for a bank account?

The man replied - ""oh, my family is down the hall.""

The man ignores this request and just orders a couple of more tequila shots.

Shot after a shot, the man starts getting a bit drunk and decides to go ahead with putting 100 pesos in the jar to see what it is all about. The barman comes close to the man and tells him that in order to get all the money in the jar, he must do three things.

Firstly, he must drink a full bottle of tequila in one go without flinching. Secondly, he must remove an aching tooth from the pitbull in the backyard. Thirdly, he must go upstairs and shag an 85 year old woman. The man asked the barman to hand him the tequila bottle and thus, the challenge was accepted.

The man downed the whole bottle without flinching once. As soon as he was done, he was fully knackered. He asked the barman where he needs to go to pull out the tooth off the dog. The barman points him toward the direction and off the man goes. All of a sudden, the barman starts hearing barking, shouting, yelling, swearing, growling and whimpering. After about 20 minutes or so, the man walks in, with his clothes all torn up and bloody, with scratches and bites all over his body.

Jesus calls for order and says humanity must pick one person to represent them all. Everyone writes down their choice on a card.


Jesus tallies the votes and tells everyone a choice has been made ""Hitler? Adolf Hitler?.... Hitler?"" Jesus has a look of confusion on his face so he pulls out his iPad and quickly scans a page, the audience is in utter shock, people are looking at each other and accusing family of voting for hitler, everyone denying it , fathers beating sons for thinking voting for hitler is a joke, others shouting ""see, jesus uses apple, I knew it"" and for the first time, complete silence from he Android community aftermost of them committed suicide after seeing the Lord's chosen brand.


""ok so your attorney ,hitler,he's dead - thats weird but no problem. looks like he was a great man, the ruler of an entire democracy"" Jesus whistles to show the audience he's impressed with their choice, now everyone is very confused.


""Hitler, what do you say about humanity"" Hitler starts shouting in german and Jesus is nodding, scratching his bears to show his deep contemplation, he suddenly stops hitler mid speech as the bears let out a mighty growl.


""ok hitler well just tell me this, have you done any of the bad sins, like the one about not worshiping those other gods? Now I know my english must be confusing for you. Hitler is still really pissed about a jew interrupting him so all he can shout now is a word Jesus did understand ""Nin, Nin Nin!""


""Ok, trials over - the verdict is...... Not guilty! You chose a nobel peace prize nominee, that shows bears, Imean.. balls - sometimes it's the guys who almost win who are the real winners - it shows you mean well. Ok I'm out of here!""


The entire world is relieved, but now more confused than ever. King Obama (he figured the world was coming to an end and changed his title) walks up to the front of the crowd and demands answers. ""Dubya? what the.. I thought I exiled you""


""Nope, Everyone actually voted for you. Knew they would, but I just assumed jesus might be racist""


""You rigged this for Hitler to win just because him and Jesus are racist? you thought Jesus would identify with him?""


""Oh, no that's not what I meant. Well Mr. Obama, Hitler is an incoherent man, he speaks German, you think Christ has time to learn German? Do you think he wants anyone to know that he's not fluent in German?""


""That's... a terrible assumption George""


""Sorry, yeah that's not what happened. Force of habit. I know of his wikipedia page, take a look""


""it says he's a Madman..genocidal - yeah, his wikipedia page isn't very compelling, and it says here the nobel nomination  was a joke. Come on Dubya tell me whats going on I'd tell you if I were in your shoes""


""okay, now look on my ipad""


""This thing, it looks all old and has vaseline and residue old lines of coke all over it... eew Gross bro ...it's too old to even display wikipedia properly and it won't play flash.Look at all these porn unclosed porn tabs - you realize we track this stuff right also let me get a bump, just like in my autobiography""
 

""Oh I know, i had to the old tablet just for today, those lines are older than your promise to stop doing cocaine and smoking cigarettes but you're licking my ipad clean as we speak as if it was a dog dish or a mcDonalds sunday at the Clinton house. But back to the point - you see, that iPad jesus had, I recognized it, I got one too - it's from Steve Jobs himself - he told me it was no orfinary ipad and I asked him what the fuck is an ipad, everyone will thinkit's a tampon and it will fail I told him - a gift from the only dead man more universally loved than Jesus himself""""


""Jesus George, this coke is amazing... but keep explaining - what is the significance of this clearly amazing device?""


""I never said that was coke. Mr President, Well, that's not a real iPad and like I said it's not real coke - it's an ipad for world leaders, it came out an entire 7 years before the first iPhone was released to you people. I remember the exclusive event, it was fucking amazing, and even Jobs was having a good time,muttering things about moon dust and science, but there were hookers and blow everywhere and they were no ordinary hookers if you catch my drift, that was Tim's idea. I mean I always felt like I got raped at that event but it wasn't until 5 years later that I truly realized. when I couldn't figure out how to create a new electronic message on my secure godaddy email, one of the tech guys said there was a problem with it, something about DNS. Turns out some of the websites you go to are real, but some aren't - he then admitted he's only ever worked at a burger king, I told the kid to cook up a big whopper and put it in the Clinton account, I think they hired him for some odd jobs""


""wikipedia? you defeated Jesus using wikipedia?""


""yes Mr. Obama, wikipedia. I ruled the united states for 5 years thinking I had been given a magical iPad that let me see past the web of lies and look uber cool because it was super pre release... of course, this was clearly a gray's almanac situation, I couldn't tell anyone, not even Cheney. Unlike Biff's stolen copy, my almanac was WRONG and I kept trying to double down based on advice from this page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)."" I had been relying on wikipedia for all of my info,everything from waterboarding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planking_(fad) to water gate. I used pages like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2001 to refer to official statistics and make big decisions""


""Okay, this is all starting to make more sense now, so you must have gone to hitler's wikipedia page at some point and saw what was there, and you knew Jesus would see the same. Ok. Ok I think we're good. So I guess Jesus is no better at verifying sources than your average redditor and he never heard of the third reich""


""I guess not Mr. Obama... haha I guessss not""


""Why did you say it like that? Fine then, the world will never know you had actually saved it - you're not as bad as I thought. But - tell me one last thing - you knew the ipad was a fake a long time ago""


""Right, right - that was an embarrassing day - I will never try to learn anything new again, I was techshamed - it's like the male version of being slut shamed. Why are you rubbing it in What's your point?""


""Well, George... I'm not one to Judge, but - if you knew it was fake, and you could read the real wikipedia on any other computer - then why... you know, why do you still deny.. I mean why deny all that awful stuff""

post,3j4g3f,2qh72,jokes,false,1441049766,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3j4g3f/lost_in_the_desert/,self.jokes,,"So, there's a man crawling through the desert.

He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.

He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out
and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.

He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon
how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,
he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication
later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give
him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle
in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the
direction he thinks is right.

He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's
been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and
whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.

He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.

By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the
town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.

As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,
he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.

Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back
up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.

He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.

He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.

He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in
his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't
find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.

Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.

Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.

As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.

He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait
any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large
rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly
swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry
and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes
another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.
He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to
make some difference and keep himself from passing out.

He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,
it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty
sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.

He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,
dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.
Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.

After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat
stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.

After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He
knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing
donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy
enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if
he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,
trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.

He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.

He walks through the sand.

After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't
remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he
doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.

But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures
that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from
there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.

Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third
time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll
just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.

While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally
gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through
the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert
in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any
rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -
shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.

He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,
he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees
is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he
sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more
dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.

Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper
fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the
cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from
here. He's going to have to go down there and look.

He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.
After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.

He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough
energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When
he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot
in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.

So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins
to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to
have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages
of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't
have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last
chance.

He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the
dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting
his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just
keeps crawling.

Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,
where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone
area.

His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark
stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun
overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying
down on the nice cool surface.

Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's
probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and
dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the
beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him
a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.

He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here
in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the
center before he goes. He keeps crawling.

It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's
hearing. He would swear that someone just said, ""Greetings, traveler. You do
not look well. Do you hear me?""

He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and
knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something
different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few
seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and
tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands
and tries again. Better this time.

Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse
of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or
pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet
out of the stone, at an angle.

And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and
seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long
desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.

He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and
run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his
final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to
move from this spot.

Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than
dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a
little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves
it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a
moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.

Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -
that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.

He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here
because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was
likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was
now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had
actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white
post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe
they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake
was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.

He tries to clear his throat to say, ""Hello,"" but his throat is too dry. All
that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going
to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the
bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,
almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't
good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes
out.

He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,
and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then
swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk
now.

He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to
spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, ""Hello? Is there anyone here?""

He hears, from his side, ""Greetings. What is it that you want?""

He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed
to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a
speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides
to try asking for help.

""Please,"" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, ""I'd love to not be
thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?""

Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was
coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its
mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he
falls forward, face first on the stone, ""Very well. Coming up.""

A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits
up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily
disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the
sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped
around the tilted white post, still looking at him.

He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.
He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder
again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -
they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been
bitten. By the snake.

""It'll feel better in a minute."" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He
hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more
importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!

""Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the
afterlife?""

""Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,"" says the snake. ""That's the way I
work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.""

""You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a
drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be
thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for
the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?
Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?""

""No,"" says the snake, ""I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I
didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I
bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just
sitting around here.""

The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the
desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a
snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not
great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no
longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt
hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool
stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer
dying of thirst.

""I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your
system with the next request,"" continued the snake. ""I can guess why you
drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left
in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or
two, if you drank enough of it.""

""Ummm, n-next request?"" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting
shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.

""That's the way it works. If you like, that is,"" explained the snake. ""You
get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish."" The snake grinned at his
own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.

""But there are rules,"" the snake continued. ""The first request is free. The
second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of
responsibility."" The snake looks at the man seriously.

""By the way,"" the snake says suddenly, ""my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,
Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound
used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand
for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into
names. You can call me Nate, if you wish."" Again, the snake grinned. ""Sorry
if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds
somewhat threatening."" The snake give his rattle a little shake.

""Umm, my name is Jack,"" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. ""Jack
Samson.

""Can I ask you a question?"" Jack says suddenly. ""What happened to the
poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?
What do you mean by that's how you work?""

""That's more than one question,"" grins Nate. ""But I'll still try to answer
all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question."" The snake's grin gets
wider. ""Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need
to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not
be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make
it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at
all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to
get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.
You've been changed.

""For the third question,"" Nate continues, ""you are still dying. Besides the
effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.
In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.
Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is."" Nate seemed vastly
amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.

""As for the fourth question,"" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack
could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read
talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, ""first you have to agree
to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell
you.""

""Wait,"" joked Jack, ""isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd
have to kill me?""

""I thought that was implied."" Nate continued to look serious.

""Ummm...yeah."" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was
talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a
nasty temper. ""So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really
stop the effects of the methanol?"" Jack thought for a second. ""And, what do
you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper
fluid, and just denature it?""

""They may, I don't really know,"" said Nate. ""I haven't gotten out in a
while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and
on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you
pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume
that they still color wiper fluid blue?""

""Yeah, they do,"" said Jack.

""I figured,"" replied Nate. ""As for being bound by secrecy - with the
fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,
this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you
decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,
write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will
lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of
course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm
guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding
anyway, so you won't notice."" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.

Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a
little nervous at this. ""Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know
that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?""

Well, Jack,"" said Nate sadly, ""I can't tell you that, unless you make the
second request."" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.

""Umm, well, ok,"" said Jack, ""what is this about a second request? What can I
ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?""

""Sure!"" said Nate, brightening. ""You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes
to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and
before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or
omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous
and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and
sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be
omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very
useful, at least in my opinion."" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was
staring at him.

""Well, anyway,"" continued Nate, ""I'd probably suggest giving you permanent
good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be
immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long
time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to
recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a
request to me.""

""Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?"" said Jack. ""And keep me healthy for a
long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request
about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not
really a change to me?""

""Right,"" nodded Nate.

""Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?"" Jack asked, hopefully.

""That takes two requests, Jack.""

""Yeah, I figured so,"" said Jack. ""But I could ask to be a genius? I could
become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?""

""Well, I could make you very smart,"" admitted Nate, ""but that wouldn't
necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you
very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.
You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some
truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It
all depends on what you decide to do with it.""

""Hmmm,"" said Jack. ""Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,
after this one?""

""Maybe,"" said Nate, ""it depends on what you decide then. There are more
rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second
request. You know how it goes."" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had
shoulders.

""Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent
health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.
Do I need to sign in blood or something?""

""No,"" said Nate. ""Just hold out your hand. Or heel."" Nate grinned. ""Or
whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,
that's how it works - the poison, you know,"" Nate said apologetically.

Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it
didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better
about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot
snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to
be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack
tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it
wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.

""Hey, Jack,"" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind
him, ""is that someone else coming up over there?""

Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of
nowhere? And did they bring food?

Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...

Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through
his jeans...

Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. ""I would have
decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to
hoodwink me like that.""

""I've been doing this a long time, Jack,"" said Nate, confidently. ""You
humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -
especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of
minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the
health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.""

""Yeah, well, still,"" said Jack, ""it's the principle of the thing. And nobody
likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or
something instead?""

""More meat in the typical human butt,"" replied Nate. ""And less chance you
accidentally kick me or move at the last second.""

""Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify
to hear,"" answered Jack.

""Ok,"" said Nate. ""Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to
just start talking?""

""Just talk,"" said Jack. ""I'll sit here and try to not think about food.""

""We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,""
answered Nate.

""Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!"" Jack jumped up.
""What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically
whip up food along with your other powers?"" Jack was almost shouting with
excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.

""I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite
it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,
that is,"" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.

""Ugh,"" said Jack, sitting back down. ""I think I'll pass. I can last a little
longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it
is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.
No thanks. Just talk.""

""Ok,"" replied Nate, still grinning. ""But I'd better hurry, before you start
looking at me as food.

Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.
""You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.""

Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate
sceptically.

""Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,"" said Nate. ""Stand up
and look at the symbol on the rock here."" Nate gestured around the dark
stone they were both sitting on with his nose.

Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a
representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around
was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches
left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it
looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and
embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.

Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the
setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the
sky.

Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another
night out here! Arrrgh!

Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and
stood next to Nate. ""In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,"" said
Jack. ""Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to
have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw
desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.""

""It's about 30 miles that way."" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail
this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to
the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. ""But that's 30 miles by
the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be
able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head
out early tomorrow, Jack.""

Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and
then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading
out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting
stuff. ""Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?""

""Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,"" said Nate. ""He
figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a
'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he
could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from
across the ocean. He worried about that for a while.""

""Garden of Eden, hunh?"" said Jack. ""How long have you been here, Nate?""

""No idea, really,"" replied Nate. ""A long time. It never occurred to me to
count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I
do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands
of years, at least.""

""So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?"" said Jack.

""Beats me,"" said Nate. ""Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your
kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it
could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant
requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.""

""Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out
of the stone there?"" asked Jack.

""Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much
bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember
if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But
one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do
something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've
been here ever since.

""What is this place?"" said Jack. ""And what did he ask you to do?""

""Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?"" Nate loosened his
coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into
the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to
enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned
over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as
Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but
Nate was suddenly there in the way.

""You can't touch that yet, Jack,"" said Nate.

""Why not?"" asked Jack.

""I haven't explained it to you yet,"" replied Nate.

""Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,"" said Jack. ""You'd push it
that way, and it would move in the slot.""

""Yep, that's what it is,"" replied Nate.

""What does it do?"" asked Jack. ""End the world?""

""Oh, no,"" said Nate. ""Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it
'The Lever of Doom'."" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing
voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and
grinned.

Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned
Jack laughed. ""Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it
really do?""

""Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,"" smirked Nate. ""I just thought
the voice I used was funny, didn't you?""

Nate continued to grin.

""A lever to end humanity?"" asked Jack. ""What in the world is that for? Why
would anyone need to end humanity?""

""Well,"" replied Nate, ""I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.
Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really
bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are
the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I
didn't think to ask back when I started here.""

""Rules? What rules?"" asked Jack.

""The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it
unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human
can be bound in that way at a time. That's it."" explained Nate.

Jack looked somewhat shocked. ""You mean that I could pull the lever now?
You'd let me end humanity?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""if you want to."" Nate looked at Jack carefully. ""Do
you want to, Jack?""

""Umm, no."" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. ""Why in
the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want
that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,
wouldn't it?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""being as he'd be human too.""

""Has anyone ever seriously considered it?"" asked Nate. ""Any of those bound
to secrecy, that is?""

""Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or
another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and
think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get
disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.
But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here."" Nate grinned some more.

Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at
the same time. After a bit, he said, ""So this makes me the Judge of
humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?""

""That seems to be it,"" agreed Nate.

""What kind of criteria do I use to decide?"" said Jack. ""How do I make this
decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are
bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?""

""Nope,"" replied Nate. ""You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's
up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed
to know.""

""But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel
horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?""
protested Jack.

Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. ""You don't. You just have to
try your best, Jack.""

Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly
getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.

Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. ""Nate, was Samuel the
one bound to this before me?""

""Yep,"" replied Nate. ""He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to
read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried
in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months
ago.""

""Sounds like a good guy,"" agreed Jack. ""How did he handle this, when you
first told him. What did he do?""

""Well,"" said Nate, ""he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and
then asked me some questions, much like you're doing.""

""What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?"" asked Jack.

""He asked me about the third request,"" replied Nate.

""Aha!"" It was Jack's turn to grin. ""And what did you tell him?""

""I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request
you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point
that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here
and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out."" Nate looked serious
again. ""And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.""

""Hmmm."" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.

Nate watched him, waiting.

""Nate,"" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. ""What did Samuel ask for with
his third request?""

Nate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly,
""Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him.""

""Ok,"" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, ""give it
to me.

Nate looked at Jack's backside. ""Give you what, Jack?""

""Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped
him, maybe it'll help me too."" Jack turned his head to look back over his
shoulder at Nate. ""It did help him, right?""

""He said it did,"" replied Nate. ""But he seemed a little quieter afterward.
Like he had a lot to think about.""

""Well, yeah, I can see that,"" said Jack. ""So, give it to me."" Jack turned to
face away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.

Nate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now,
Jack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.

""You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like
it needs it, right Jack?"" asked Nate, shifting position.

""Yeah, yeah, I got that,"" replied Jack, eyes squeezed tightly shut and body
tense, not noticing the change in direction of Nate's voice.

""And,"" continued Nate, from his new position, ""do you remember that you'll
turn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?""

Finally, the big day arrives on her 47th birthday. It costs 5,000 dollars, but she feels like it was worth it. Her face is extremely beautiful and young again.

She wants to test it, though, so she goes for a walk in the city centre. She stops at the post office and asks the employee:

""Don't take this the wrong way, but how old do you think I am?""

""Let's say 32"" comes the answer.

""I'm exactly 47!"" says the woman with a happy smile.

A little later she goes to McDonald's and asks the same thing at the cashier. 

""I'd say around 29.""

""No, no. I'm 47!""

She progressively feels better and better about herself. She goes to the bank, where she has some things to clear up, but can't stop herself from asking the employee:

""How old do you think I am?""

""Around 30.""

""I'm 47, but it's really nice of you"" says the woman proudly.

At the bus stop, she's waiting with an elderly man. She asks the ominous question yet again. The old man answers:

""Dear lady, I'm 78 and my sight is not what it used to be. However, when I was young, there was a technique thanks to which I immediately knew the exact age of the woman in question. This will sound cheeky, but I need you to let me grab your breasts. That's how I'll be able to tell your exact age!""

The woman looks around. The street is entirely empty and she's really curious about the old man's answer, so she says:

""What the hell, go for it!""

The old man puts both hands under the woman's blouse and grabs her breasts. He squeezes softly. After a few minutes, the woman loses her patience and says:

""Soooo? Can you tell how old I am?""

""Of course. You're exactly 47.""

""Unbelievable! How the hell did you know?"" asks the woman completely abashed.

 You can smoke shit, buy shit, sell shit, lose shit, find shit,  forget shit, and tell others to eat shit and die. Some people know  their shit, while others can't tell the difference between shit and  Shinola.

 There are lucky shits, dumb shits, crazy shits and sweet shits. 
 There is bull shit, horse shit and chicken shit. You can throw  shit, sling shit, catch shit, shoot the shit, or duck when shit  hits the fan.

 You can give a shit or serve shit on a shingle. You can find  yourself in deep shit or be happier than a pig in shit. Some days  are colder than shit, some days are hotter than shit and some days  are just plain shitty.

 Some music sounds like shit, things can look like shit, and there  are times when you feel like shit. You can have too much shit, not  enough shit, the right shit, the wrong shit or a lot of weird shit.

 You can carry shit, have a mountain of shit, or find yourself up  shit creek without a paddle. Sometimes everything you touch turns  to shit and other times you fall in a bucket of shit and come out  smelling like a rose.

She says there's a lot of money to talk about, so the employees reluctantly allow the lady to meet with the president. When they meet, he asks the old lady how much money she wants to put in the bank.

""165,000 dollars"" she answers and empties her bag on the president's table.

The president is intrigued about the origin of such money and asks:

""Dear lady, may I ask where this money comes from?""

""Bets"" she answers.

""Bets? What kind of bets?""

""For example, I bet 25,000 dollars your balls are rectangular!""

""Hahaha, that's a stupid bet, you cannot hope to win that!""

""So you accept, do you?""

""Of course! I'll bet you 25,000 dollars that my balls aren't rectangular.""

""Perfect. Since we're talking about a large amount of money, let's meet tomorrow morning at 10 in the presence of my lawyer as witness, shall we?""

""Okay, works for me"" says the president smugly.

That night, the president gets nervous. He's sure he'll win, there is no way his balls are rectangular, but he still observes them in the mirror over and over again before going to sleep.

Next morning, at 10, the old lady is back at the bank with her lawyer. She introduces the lawyer to the president and repeats the bet:

""25,000 dollars that the president's balls are rectangular!""

The president accepts the bet again. The old lady asks the president to take his pants off, then if she may touch the president's balls.

""Since we're talking about 25,000 dollars, you may. I want you to be sure about your observations"" he says.

At this point, the president sees that the old lady's lawyer is banging his head into the wall.

""What the hell is your lawyer doing?"" he asks the old lady.

The Mexican replied, ‚ÄúOnly a little while.‚Äù The American then asked, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you stay out longer and catch more fish?‚Äù The Mexican said, ‚ÄúWith this I have more than enough to support my family‚Äôs needs.‚Äù The American then asked, ‚ÄúBut what do you do with the rest of your time?‚Äù The Mexican fisherman said, ‚ÄúI sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos, I have a full and busy life.‚Äù The American scoffed, ‚ÄúI am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing; and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat: With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor; eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles and eventually New York where you will run your ever-expanding enterprise.‚Äù The Mexican fisherman asked, ‚ÄúBut, how long will this all take?‚Äù To which the American replied, ‚Äú15 to 20 years.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut what then?‚Äù asked the Mexican.

It's a tall, sharp-beaked bird with beautiful jet black plumage; a condor, to be precise.  Upon, further inspection, however, the man notices that the condor is unusually thin.  Sickly, even.

More than a little troubled, the man gets the shopkeeper's attention and asks him about the bird.  ""What's wrong with your bird?  It looks like she hasn't eaten in weeks.  Don't you feed your animals?""

The shopkeeper sighs and shakes his head.  ""That one's a special case,"" he says.  ""We've tried giving her all different kinds of bird feed, but she just won't eat.  It's like she has a compulsion to stay skinny or something.""

""Like anorexia?"" asks the man.

""Yeah, I guess you could call it that,"" the shopkeeper says.  ""At this rate, she's gonna be gone in a couple weeks.""

The man gasps in horror.  ""I can't let that happen!"" he exclaims.  ""Let me take her off your hands, I beg you.""

The shopkeeper shrugs, undoes the cage and hands him the condor.  ""If you want her, she's yours.  But it's going to be hard to get her to eat.  God knows I couldn't do it.""

The man thanks the shopkeeper, pays him and leaves.  As he's driving home, he struggles to process what he just heard.  *An anorexic bird?  Who ever heard of such a thing?*

For the next few days, the man stops at every single pet shop in the city in search of anything that his condor would eat.  He samples every variety of bird feed in every store, but the condor refuses to touch any of them.  After a few days, he starts to lose hope that he can ever save the bird.

One day, he comes home with a takeout box from his favorite Dim Sum restaurant.  ""I suppose she won't want any of *this* food, either,"" he mutters to himself.

But as he's at the dinner table eating, he notices the condor eying his meal hungrily.  The man's face immediately lights up.

*What could she be hungry for, I wonder?*

He offers her some of the lo ma gai, but she turns her heard away.  He tries a spring roll, next, but she rejects this as well.  But when he presents her a steaming pork bun, she tears into it savagely.

""I've found it!"" the man cries.  ""Hallelujah, I've found it!""

From then on, the man would take his condor to the Dim Sum restaurant once or twice a week, and order an extra serving of pork buns for her.  Unfortunately, it would be a while before she would start looking healthy again, but the man was content knowing that he had found a way to feed her.

Then, one night at Dim Sum, the man finds that, to his horror, the restaurant has taken pork buns off the menu.

""But why?!"" he demands.

The waitress shrugs.  ""The manager decided that they weren't selling well enough,"" he says.  ""But there are plenty of other delicious dishes on our menu.""

""You don't understand!"" cries the man.  ""My condor is anorexic!  Those pork buns were the only thing I could get her to eat!""

The waitress eyes him skeptically.  ""That's preposterous,"" she says.  ""I'm sure there's something else on the menu that your bird will eat.""

""You're welcome to try,"" the man says forlornly.  ""Don't say I didn't warn you.""

For the next hour, the waitress runs back and forth between the kitchen and the dining area, bringing out dish after dish after dish.  Spring rolls, spare ribs, fried rice, fried squid, taro cake... but the condor refuses every one.

After a while, the man orders her to stop.  ""It's no use, miss,"" he sighs.

""My ana condor don't want none unless you got buns, hon.""",A man walks into a pet shop.,1

the 3 men; A Physicist, a Philosopher and a Local town idiot stand before the gates of heaven. Between them and the gates stands St. Peter. St. Peter tells the three men ""Sorry boys, but it seems heaven is getting jam-packed. To let you in, you have to beat me intellectually, either through a form of a question or a challenge.""

The first to come forward is the Physicist, and he tells St. Peter with great confidence ""Show me the entire mathematical markup of the Higgs Boson."" To which St. Peter merely snaps his finger and produces a dozen large whiteboards and proceeds to write up the whole markup from memory. After careful examination, the Physicist reluctantly agrees that he is correct, and with one snap of the finger, St. Peter sends him to the fiery gates of hell.

The next to come forward is the Philosopher. Thinking that the Physicist made a grave mistake of challenging St. Peter with an empirical question, he decides to give a less-than-empirical challenge of his own. He tells St. Peter ""Show me all of the works of Socrates."" he says with a smirk, knowing Socrates never wrote down his teachings, St. Peter would be hard pressed on producing an answer. But despite this, St. Peter produces a stack of papers, and the Philosopher reads it with great criticism. There are things there he had never even heard of, and questioned the paper's authenticity, to which St. Peter remarked ""Me and Socrates have chatted a lot ever since he got here."" And with a snap of a finger, the Philosopher was gone.

Last to come forward is the Local town idiot. The idiot asks St. Peter, ""Could I give you a riddle instead?"" and St. Peter replies ""Of course! I love riddles!"" and the idiot proceeds. ""What comes up a hill with six legs and comes down with four, comes back up with two legs and back down with no more?""

St. Peter ponders on it for a good five minutes and arrives at no answer, and tells the idiot ""Well, congratulations, you have left me dumbfounded."" and with a snap of a finger, the gates of heaven opens up. The idiot proceeds to enter heaven, but right before he does so, he feels St. Peter tapping on his shoulder, he turns around. ""So,"" St. Peter asks ""What's the answer to your riddle?""

The Idiot just shrugs his shoulders and says ""How the hell should I know?""",3 men die and meet outside the pearly white gates of heaven.,59

Little Red Riding Hood was sitting upstairs in her room listening to music, when her mum calls her down into the kitchen, so she heads downstairs.  When Red enters the kitchen, her mum asks, ""Little Red would you mind taking this basket of goodies to your ill grandmother in the morning?""

Little Red immediately reaches for her cloak and puts it on and says, ""It's no problem, I'll go now.""

Her mum gets all wide-eyed and exclaims, ""But, it's late and the Big Bad Wolf is about!  You know what he's going to do...  He's capture you, strip you naked and fuck the living daylights out of you!""

Little Red then grabs the shotgun from the wall holder and says, ""I'm eleven, and I have the family's shotgun, I'll be fine!""  So with that, she sets off into the Woods.

As she is walking through the woods, she runs into the Three Little Pigs.  One of the Pigs asks, ""Little Red what are you doing in the Woods so late at night?""

Red responds, ""I'm taking this basket of goodies to my ill grandmother.""

Pig says, ""But, it's late, and the Big Bad Wolf is about!  You know what he's going to do!  He's going to capture you, strip you naked and fuck the living daylights out of you!""

Little Red replies same as before, ""It's no problem!  I'm eleven, and have the family's eight gauge, I'll be fine!""

Red then gets to her grandmother's cottage, and goes into her bedroom.  She then shuts the door behind her and gasps, ""My Grandmother, you're not looking well at all!""

All of a sudden the Big Bad Wolf pops out of the bed and exclaims, ""HA!  I've been waiting a very long time for this!  You know what I am going to do?  I'm going to capture you, strip you naked and fuck the living daylights out of you!""

This is when Little Red calmly sets the basket down, strips naked, cocks the shotgun, points it at him and says, ""No, you're going to eat me like the book says!""",Like the Book...,23

Each church and the synagogue had a problem with squirrels.The Presbyterian church called a meeting to decide what to do about their squirrels. After much prayer and consideration they determined the squirrels were predestined to be there and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will.

At the Baptist church the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a water slide on the baptistery and let the squirrels drown themselves. The squirrels liked the slide and, unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.

The Methodist church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creatures. So, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the Baptist Church. Two weeks later the squirrels were back when the Baptists took down the water slide.

But the Catholic Church came up with a very creative strategy. They baptized all the squirrels and consecrated them as members of the church. Now they only see them on Christmas and Easter.

Not much was heard from the Jewish synagogue, but it's rumored that they took one squirrel and circumcised him. They haven't seen a squirrel on their property since.",Religion and squirrels,251

After much debate and getting nowhere they decided to settle the matter by invoking a miracle. They all agreed that walking on water would be a good challenge, so they go to a local pond.  
  
   
Pentecostal goes first. He invites his followers to shout out prayers, speak in tongues and dance before the Lord. After 1 hour of worship he steps onto the water and, slowly but surely, makes it to the other side.  
  
Next is the Methodist's turn. He turns to his followers and says to them. We must be very solemn. We'll collect offering and then the Lord will respond. So after collection the man begins to step onto the water. Slowly, but surely, he makes it to the other side.  
  
At last, is the turn for the southern Baptist. He tells his congregation to play loud instruments and testify before the Lord God. They begin to play their instruments and testify in song what the Lord has done for them. After 30 minutes of singing and testifying the man steps onto the water. He successfully begins to walk, but after a few steps he starts to sink. Concerned, he goes back to his congregation and urges them to worship and give more testimony of the Lord's mighty hand. After another half an hour he decides to try walking on the water. Again, he successfully gives a few steps, but starts to sink again. Even more concerned this time he goes back to his people to ask them for louder worship and more testimony. So they all being to sing and testify once again.

The locals, fearful that resources won't be able to accommodate this influx of people, complain to their local cardinal who agrees to settle the matter.  He accepts a challenge to a theological debate with the wisest of the population's rabbis in order to decide whether the Jews will be allowed to set up a permanent encampment in the area.  Since neither the cardinal nor the rabbi speak each others' language they agree to conduct the debate using sign language.  
  
The two meet at dawn atop a large hill near the edge of town with their population waiting nearby to hear the results.  
  
The cardinal begins by raising both hands in the air above his head and shaking them once, firmly, palms raised.  
The rabbi responds by nodding once slowly and folding his arms in front of him.  
  
Next, the cardinal holds up 3 fingers.  
The rabbi replies by holding up a single finger.  
  
The cardinal then produces the Eucharist and extends first the bread, then the cup before him.  
The rabbi calmly pulls an apple from his tunic, takes a bite from it, and raises an eyebrow as he holds it up in the air.  
  
After this, the cardinal smiles, shakes the rabbi's hand, and both men walk back to their people.  
  
  
As the cardinal descends the hill, the local Catholics surround him and ask excitedly what happened.  
  
""The Jewish people are very wise,"" he responds, ""They are welcome in our town.""  

""First, I told him, 'Our God is an awesome God!' to which he responded, 'But we are his people.'""  

""Next, I said, 'Our God is 3 Gods!' to which he replied, 'Are not the 3 part of the One True God?'""  

""Finally, I presented the Eucharist and said, 'Our God is a God of forgiveness!', but he retaliated by presenting an apple and pointed out, 'Not one among us is without sin.'""  
  
The Catholics nodded to one another and agreed that these were indeed wise remarks and accepted the cardinal's decision to let the Jews remain in their village.  
  
  
On the other side of the hill, the rabbi was surrounded by his people who also wanted to know what happened.  
  
""I'm not really sure,"" said the rabbi, ""but I think they're going to let us stay.""  

""First, he started shaking his hands to say, 'Get out of my town!', so I told him, 'We're not leaving!'""  
  
""Next, he says, 'You've got 3 days to get out of here!', so I replied, 'Not one of us is moving!'""

This was a forum thread:
Title: ""My boss asked for my store's computer's IP today""
OP:
""And I'm not going to lie, I'm woefully ignorant of the workings of the internet and what is possible...especially for somebody my age, so I'm sorry if this is a stupid question. I'm curious/slightly nervous about why he would ask for such information. It's basically just me who uses the computer, and another person who is there on my days off, so one of my biggest questions/concerns is can he see my browsing history remotely with access to the IP? If he can, I'm sure that stretches to things viewed in a private browser mode, like incognito mode on google chrome. Basically my biggest concern is he might find out that I've viewed some less than safe for work sites while at work. ""

Lots of stupid replies and here's the winner:

Keep in mind OP I have masturbated at work more times than I can count. In peoples homes. When I use to mow lawns one of our clients was a hot milf who always laid in her pool virtually naked. So I'd run into her bathroom after edging her driveway and pound one out. This woman had cameras everywhere but I knew the bathroom was safe. Fuck, if you did a DNA test now 8 years later there's no way her maid cleaned all that shit up.

Then petsmart. When sexy little sluts would come in with their shorts hiked up to their butt crack I'd run to the hamster cage and immediately pound 1 out right into the bedding. Then I'd mix it around so it looked like 10 hamsters peed in the same area. Then my female coworker who was also hot as fuck would go clean the bedding at night and it would come out like a brick of concrete. I also tried to fuck her in the break room one day when she was sitting on my lap but she turned me down. So I ejaculated in her sandwich when she went to the bathroom and went back to work.

The point is, things like this are VERY NORMAL OP.

There is nothing wrong with jerking off at work and smearing your load all over his store and cameras. It's how men claim their territory.

In the same token.... the fact you sound so paranoid makes me think you were in fact torrenting some child porn. Which I simply can not condone. Torrenting costs the directors lots of money. Your IP was probably flagged and I'm sure he's working with the FBI now to get you throw in prison.

Only solution I see right now is for you to confess to exactly what you did. That's the only way the forum can help you right now otherwise we're just shooting blanks so to speak.

Just let it all out..... :)""",Jerking Off Is Not An Option - It's a Necessity,1

The barman finds this rather interesting as do the rest of the punters in the pub. They all come round the duck and watch it for ages, and while doing so, buy more and more drink. By the end of the night the bar is full of people watching this amazing duck, still dancing and giving the odd quack now and again. The barman realizes that he hasn't had business this good in a long  time. It is so good that he offers to buy the duck from the man to which the man agrees to sell for 500 pounds. The barman thinks it is a bit expensive but agrees to buy it anyhow. On selling the duck, the man goes home leaving a crowded pub watching his dancing duck. At the end of the night the barman is locking up and the duck is still dancing. The barman thinks oh well time for bed the duck will stop dancing when he wants and the barman goes to bed. 

In the morning the barman comes down to open up to see the duck still dancing away on the biscuit tin. The barman thinks to himself, he must really like dancing I'll leave him be. People flock far and wide to look at this dancing duck and with that buying drinks. Throughout the day the barman has taken more money then he normally takes in a whole month. The barman is just locking up at the end of the night and the duck is still dancing away. The barman is concerned that his 'investment' might wear himself out as he's been dancing for the past 24 hours.

 Later that night, the man gets a telephone call; it is the barman  and he exclaims that the duck is a great success and that he has never taking so much money in the last 24 hours, but he says -  ""There is one thing... How do you get the duck to stop dancing?""  to which the man replies -- ""Oh simple - just take the lid of the  biscuit box and blow out the candle.""",A man walks into a bar with a duck and a biscuit box.,27
