There stands the Hindu man. He says, ""I mean not to bother you and I have nothing against your barn. You do however own a cow and in my religion, cows are holy. I do not care what you have to say about holy cows. To me, they are nothing to joke about. CouId please trade places with the Rabbi?""

A few months later, on my birthday, my car broke down. Called him to let him know I was coming later. Suddenly I smelled baked beans from a nearby restaurant and couldn't help myself. I figured I'd have plenty of time to get through the consequences by the time I get home.

So I went in the restaurant and devoured three servings of baked beans. On my way home I was doing my best to get rid of any excess gases.

When I got home, my man was already visibly excited. He declared he has a huge surprise for me. He blindfolded me and led me to my chair in the dining room. As he was about to remove the blindfolds, the phone rang. I had to promise not to peek while he was on the phone, so I did.

So I sat there blindfolded, with more gas trembling in my gut. The pressure was getting unbearable and since he wasn't there, I took my chance, leaned on one side and let it rip.

It was understandably loud and smelled like a murder scene so I tried to fan it away with the napkin on my lap while letting out some more cannon fire.

I could hear him ending the phone call so after a few more quick fanning motions I put the napkin back to my lap. All the pressure was gone, I was happy and I put on my best innocent face.

He came back, apologized for taking so long and asked if I peeked. I of course didn't and as I replied, he took my blindfold off.

That's when 12 people started singing ""Happy Birthday"" to me.",I fell in love with an amazing man,18

He was a young man then and they all knew that he would likely be long dead by the time they reached their destination. They said their tearful goodbyes and drifted off to sleep.

In the years he spent alone on the ship, he became adept at building small robots to help him complete his tasks. He formed relationships with the little bots, but he found he missed the companionship of real humans. He would take small stints in the cryogenic chambers in order to prolong his life, so as to complete his mission of getting his friends and family to their new home. He didn't want to wake anyone to take over his duties and suffer the loneliness of space travel. But a long life with no one real to talk to is lacking.

With his knowledge of robotics, he took it upon himself to build an artificial human. Something that looked real. Something that felt real. Something that would make the unbearable loneliness go away.
He didn’t feel right copying the likeness of any members of the sleeping crew, so he modeled the robot on himself. By the time he was done, there “he” was, a perfect replica of Jacques himself. He named the robot Jacques 2.0, because who else was there to get confused? And as he grew older, it would be easier to remember his own name, he figured.

Well, years passed as they are wont to do. He grew old and frail on the journey, but Jacques 2.0 remained young and spry, helping his creator to complete the tasks the old man’s bones could no longer handle.

As the old man lay dying, he asked his robotic companion to do him a favor. He wanted his remains to be scattered among the stars, the asteroids, and the comets they passed. He did not want to be buried on a planet he would never see, but instead live on in the vastness of space that had become his home. So when the day finally came, Jacques 2.0 sent his creator’s ashes out of the airlock and into the universe.

But the journey was not over. Jacques 2.0 carried on his creator’s duties for years and helped the crew arrive on their new home. As the ship grew close to the planet, the crew began to wake up. One by one they woke from their long sleep and travelled to the observation deck to see their new home. When they arrived, though, they found themselves in complete shock. There was Jacques, as lively and youthful as ever, waiting for them.

“How can this be?” They asked. “Surely, you would at the very least be an old, old man by now. It has been so long since we left Earth.”
Jacques 2.0 raised his hands slightly in a calming gesture and said, “Do not worry. I am here to send you a message of love and care from Jacques. I was created to help him complete his mission. I may look like him, but in truth, I am not him. For you see,” and with this he gestured towards the stars and space above their heads, “the real Jacques is in the comets.”",The caretaker of a generation ship was on his death bed,76

post,fbahe1,2qh72,jokes,false,1582970478,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fbahe1/farting_in_bed/,self.jokes,," This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years, the only friction in their marriage was the husbands habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke the noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, Honey you were right all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you. What do you mean? asked his wife. Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened, but by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers. I think I got most of them back in.........",Farting in bed,59

My Dad Told Me This One, You Might Know It

3 men are on top of a cliff.  A mystical deity approaches them.  

""I will grant you one wish, you just have to jump off the cliff!"" His voice booms.

The first man,  being power hungry,  wished to be a lion,  king of the jungle.  He jumps off and screams ""Lion!"" And becomes one at the bottom of the cliff. 

The second man, only wished to know the secrets of the world. He jumps off,  and screams ""CROW!"" And takes off into the sky. 

The third man,  he wanted to protect anyone he could.  He runs to jump off, but trips and screams ""SHHIIITTT!"" The deity, never one to argue,  grants his wish.

Okay now back to the spin-off

A man and his girlfriend are on top of a cliff. A mystical deity approches them.

""I will grant you one wish, no matter what!"" the deity's voice booms. 

The man turns to his girlfriend and says ""Quick! Wish for anything you'd want, I'll take it from there.""

The girlfriend, skeptical, simply wishes for the world's largest diamond. Sure enough, right behind her a massive diamond appears. 

The man kisses his girlfriend on the cheek and says ""I wish to be with the person I'll truly love most for the rest of my life.""

His girlfriend blushes and they begin to kiss…

He didn't want to ruin their moment but also wanted to make sure nothing bad happened to them, so he decided to keep half an eye on them from a distance.

But the officer could not have prepared himself for what he was about to see. The elderly man dropped his khakis as his wife lifted her dress and propped herself up against the chain link fence. The twisting, the turning, the acrobatics! They elderly couple were as spry and agile as any young couple in their 20's.

""Beg your pardon. I couldn't help overhearing your conversation in the diner and wanted to make sure you were ok ... but please tell me your secret!

The devil, none too pleased with their enthusiasm heads down to the boiler room and ups the temperature in their room to 35°.

Later on, the devil goes to check on the two Canadians. Much to his dismay, he finds that they have thrown a party in their room. He storms back down to the boiler room and sets the temperature to 45°. This kills the mood pretty quickly and the party soon clears out. But the two men are still enjoying the warmest climate they've ever experienced. The devil, now furious, marches back down to the boiler room with one last trick up his sleeve: he shuts the heat down completely.

When he returns a little while later, he finds the two men in their natural habitat, bundled up in a few layers sharing their favourite hockey stories with some fellow Canadians they met at the party.

Then, everyone goes silent. The devil excitedly presses his ear to the door and peeps in. One of the men points to the centre of the floor and says ""look!"": frost was starting to form. It spread up the walls and across the ceiling, soon the floor was covered in a layer of sheet ice. The two men jump up and start celebrating like children.

He tells the man that the book is actually a sacred relic which was uncovered during an expedition of some old ruins. The manager says that the book is priced at $1000 as to purposely ward of potential buyers.

The man insistently wants to buy the book although the manager warns him otherwise. At last, the manager agrees to sell him the book, but he warns the man of a curse that will befall him if the last page of the book were to ever be opened.

The man agrees and pays the $1000 then leaves with the book.

When he got home, he decides to leave the book opened on the table of his apartment while he goes and washes up. When he is done, he sees the pages of the book turning towards the end at a fast speed, it was at that point that he realized he forgot to close the windows.

He rushed over to the book in an attempt to close it but it was too late: The book flipped to the last page and the man moved back in shock...

""I did a bad thing mommy. I was in the bathroom and I passed a bullet in the toilet."" She told her mother.

Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.  When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.""  He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""

As the bus stopped and it was her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step of the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg.

Again, she tried to make the step only to discover she still couldn't. 

So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more. 

For the second time, attempted the step, and, once again, much to her chagrin, she could not raise her leg. 

With little smile to the driver, she again reached behind to unzip a little more and again was unable to make the step. 

About this time, a burly Indian Sardar who was standing behind her picked her up effortlessly by the waist and placed her gently on the steps of the bus. 

She went ballistic and turned to the Good Samaritan and screeched, ""How dare you touch me! I don't even know who you are!""

She insisted that she must speak with the president of the bank to open a savings account because ""it’s a lot of money."" After much hemming and hawing, the bank staff finally ushered her into the president’s office. The bank president then asked how much she would like to deposit.
She replied, ""$165,000.00."" and dumped the cash out of her bag on to his desk. The president was of course curious as to how she had come by all this cash, so he asked her, "" Ma’am, I’m surprised you’re carrying so much cash around, Where did you get this money?"" The old lady replied, "" I make bets."" He then asked, "" Bets? What kind of bets?"" The old woman said, "" well for example, I’ll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square."" ""Ha"", laughed the president, "" that’s a stupid bet. You could never win that kind of bet.""
The old lady challenged, ""So, would you like to take my bet?"" ""Sure,"" said the president, ""I’ll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square.""The little old lady then said, ""Okay, but since there is so much money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 am as a witness?"" ""Sure"" replied the president. That night, he became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror checking his balls, turning form side to side, again and again. He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure that there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet.
The next morning, at precisely 10:00 am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president’s office. She introduced the lawyer and repeated the bet. ""$25,000 says the president’s balls are square."" The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. The president complied. The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them. ""Well, Okay,"" said the president, ""$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.""
Just then he noticed the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall. The president asked the old lady, ""What the hell’s the matter with your lawyer?"" She replied, ""Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that at 10:00 am today, I’d have the bank of Canada’s president’s balls in my hand.",A little old lady walked into the Bank of Canada,18

""Yeah, this is outrageous! We slave away, while he sits on his fat backside doing no work and getting more money!"" Bob replies.

""I'm going to go up and have a word to him!"" says Billy.

Billy climbs out of the trench, marches up to the manager's tent, and bursts through the flaps. ""Boss,"" he cries. ""How come Bob and I have to slave away digging that trench while you laze around here in this lovely air-conditioned tent?!""

The manager says to him, ""Billy, it's like this you see. I am manager material. You and Billy are not.""

""Let me give you an example."" The manager stands up and holds his hand in front of the metal pole holding up the tent. ""Punch my hand as hard as you can.""

Billy draws back his fist and strikes with all his might. At the last second the manager moves his hand and Billy hits the pole with a roar of pain. Chastened, he slumped back down to the trench.

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe. 

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",I hate my job.,3

The lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game of Find the Answer.  The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.  The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun. 

 He explains, ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vice versa.  "" Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep.  The lawyer, now agitated, says, ""Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00.""  This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. 

 The lawyer asks the first question.  ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?""  The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill and hands it to the lawyer. 

 ""Okay"" says the lawyer, ""your turn.""  

She asks the lawyer, ""What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?""  

The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references, no answer.  He searches on the airport wifi, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail.  After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00. 

 The blonde says, ""Thank you,"" and turns back to get some more sleep.  

The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, ""Well, what's the answer?""

I was pleasantly surprised until I saw a man hanging off the edge of the balcony by just his fingers. I went over to him with a hammer and hit his hands until he let go. He fell in some bushes, and was still alive, so I grabbed my fridge and lifted it over the edge so it would fall on him. And after all that heavy lifting, I died of a heart attack.

“Oh that is terrible”, said St Peter as he turned to the next man, “what about you?”

Man 2: well I was on my 25th floor balcony doing some yoga and I fell over the edge! I was hanging on by just my fingers when I saw a man coming over, I was so relieved! But then he started hammering my fingers and I fell in a bush. I was alive but very sore. He then threw a fridge over the edge on to me, and here I am”

Once upon a time, there was a happy little fly buzzing around a barn when she happened upon a large pile of fresh cow manure. Since it had been hours since her last meal and she was feeling hunger pangs, she flew down to the irresistible delicacy and began to pig out. She ate and ate … and then... she ate some more!!! 

Finally, she decided she'd had plenty. She washed her face with her tiny front legs, belched a few times, then attempted to fly away. 

But alas… she had eaten far too much and could not get off the ground.  

Wondering what to do about this unpleasant situation, she looked around and spotted a pitchfork leaning upright against the barn wall. She'd found a solution!! She realized if she could just climb up that handle and jump off to become airborne she'd be able to fly again. 

So, she painstakingly climbed to the top of the handle. Once there, she took a deep breath, spread her tiny wings, and leaped confidently into the air. She dropped like a rock and splattered all over the floor. 

Dead Fly. 

What is the moral of this sad story?

He asks her - why did you say that?
I don't know, I just felt like saying it.
The next day, grandpa drops dead. Wow, thinks dad, that's an odd coincidence.
A month later at bedtime, the daughter says - God bless mommy and daddy. And goodbye grandma.
Sure enough, the next day grandma breathes her last earthly breath.
The dad realizes this is more than a coincidence, but he is not sure what to do. He doesn't want to disturb his wife by telling her (Grandma and grandpa were her parents).
Months go by and one night the man is listening to his daughter saying her prayers at bedtime - God bless mommy....she turns her head and looks straight at him - and goodbye daddy. What!? are you sure honey? She nods. The man's heart begins racing and he breaks out in a sweat. He is so upset, he can't sleep at all that night.
The next day he goes off to work, but locks himself in his office. He takes the phone off the hook, cancels all his meetings and awaits the inevitable.
He stays at work past 5 because he feels secure there. He watches the hours tick by. Finally it is midnight and, drenched in sweat, he realizes he has cheated death. He drives home drenched in sweat and with all his nerves frazzled.
His wife is up and waiting for him - Where the hell were you today??! He replies - Don't shout, I've had an absolutely miserable day.
His wife then says - You had a miserable day? I'm the one who had a miserable day! First, the milkman drops dead on the steps...",Dad is listening to his daughter say her prayers before bedtime,22

There were 4 passengers on board, but only 3 parachutes.  
The 1st passenger said “I am Stephen Curry, the best NBA basketball player. The Warriors and my millions of fans need me, and I can’t afford to die.” So he took the 1st pack and left the plane.

The 2nd passenger, Donald Trump, said, “I am the newly-elected US President, and I am the smartest President in American history, so my people don’t want me to die.” He took the 2nd pack and jumped out of the plane.  
The 3rd passenger, the Pope, said to the 4th passenger, a 10-year-old schoolboy, “My son, I am old and don’t have many years left, you have more years ahead so I will sacrifice my life and let you have the last parachute.”  
The little boy said, “That’s okay, Your Holiness, there’s a parachute left for you.
