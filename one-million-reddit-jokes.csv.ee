‚Ä¢ Me: No problem. The saddle bags were opened; no drugs.

Everything was great and the day couldn't be better. After the evening festivities died down his father approached him.

""Son, are you a virgin?"" He asked, with his gift in hand.

""No, dad! I have made the sex with many women!""

""Son, I realize you're just trying to look cool in front of your father. I know you have, in fact, not. Here, I want you to have this $200 and get yourself a nice night with a local prostitute at the whore house down the street.""

""Great, dad!"" he replied. ""I'll finally become a man in both age and spirit!""

""Whatever you do, son... Don't fornicate with Sandpaper Sally!""

""I won't, father!"" His excitement exuded from his body as he skipped merrily to the brothel.

Along the way, the boy ran into his very good friend.

""Friend! Happy 18th birthday! Wherever are you off to?"" The colleague shouted.

""To the brothel! My father gifted me a romp in the hay to decide my manhood!""

""Alas! That is fantastic."" The peer replied. ""Be sure you're not lulled into the arms of Sandpaper Sally!""

""I have already received that warning, my good Sir! And I thank you!""

Finally the boy arrives at the brothel and confidentially puts all of his money on the counter.

""Your finest courtuson available, Ma'dam!""

""Ah yes, young lad. The finest available is Mistress Sally!""

Torn, the new man contemplates his choices. It would be a waste to forgo this night... A pussy is a pussy, a fuck is a fuck - he'd never know the difference, as it was his first time.

""Please, allow me some alone time with Sally.""

In the room, the young man waited until a hot, perfect, fine woman entered and started her courtship. She danced, stripped, and sang. All was the epitome of empyrean until he started moving his penis inside of her.

It was coarse, rough, unpleasant. After only a minute of agony he had to stop the woman.

""I'm sorry, ma'lady! But you must cease. This is unpleasant, and if this is sex, I think I must abstain for the rest of my years!""

""I am so sorry!"" She is almost in tears. ""Please, allow me a minute alone.""

She runs to the bathroom and stays for only the minute promised and returns. Without a word she begins again on the lad. This time it is divine. Soft - smooth - slippery - other alliterative adjectives. Finally, he has to know...

"" Sally, this is so amazing! What... What did you do in the bathroom?""

""Oh,"" Sally blushes, ""I just picked my scabs.""",[NSFW] Sandpaper Sally,11

post,bvf7q4,2qh72,jokes,false,1559350415,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bvf7q4/there_was_once_a_temple_high_in_the_mountains/,self.jokes,,"In the temple lived a large group of friars who led a very peaceful and quiet existence. The temple had a grand garden with every type of vegetable and fruit imaginable - carrots, tomatoes, peppers, apples, oranges etc. Since the friars were very spiritual they ate very little, so every day they would send friar John with a wagon full of food 20 miles to the nearest town to sell the vegetables and fruits to the poor and starving townspeople. The temple charged low prices for their goods, only taking enough to survive on their own and the townspeople were grateful for their generosity in these troubled times.
Friar John was known around the town for his heroic act of travelling every day provide the people with food, so he often received gifts before he left for the journey home. He would often give these gifts to the other friars, as he had no need for glamour or riches - he was a simple man. Until one night as he was packing his wagon and preparing to climb back up into the mountains, an old woman approached him and gave him a mysterious bag. He thanked her and placed it in the back of the wagon, not thinking much of it. Friar John pulled the wagon all the way up the 20 mile path to the temple, then promptly unpacked the wagon and headed to bed. Before falling asleep, he checked what was in the bag and found that it was full of flowers.
This warmed Friar Johns heart, and it was all the warmth needed to light a fiery passion within him. 
The next morning, Friar John asked the head Friar if he could plant the flowers outside the temple, and he was told it would be done by the time he returned that night. So he travelled to the town and was once again given a bag of flowers from the old lady. 
Upon returning to the temple, he saw how beautiful they looked planted in what small space they had outside high in the mountains. He knew they wouldn't last in the cold, so he hatched a  plan to see the flowers every morning before he left the temple. 

Friar John began storing the flowers in the greenhouse where the grand garden was held, so they could survive the cold for longer. But every day he would receive bigger and bigger bags of flowers form the old lady and was running out of space to put them. Friar John was not going to give up on his dream of seeing the flowers every day, so after receiving a bag that filled his entire empty wagon he was so excited he sprinted the whole way up the mountain. He ran straight to the greenhouse and began uprooting all of the vegetables and fruits to plant his marvellous flowers. He was in such a fit of passion that he didn't even realize he was destroying the very livelihood of the temple he had worked so hard for. 
In the morning the other Friars saw what he had done, and demanded he re-plant all the vegetables and fruits before they rot. They demanded he uproot all of his flowers and throw them down the mountain, but Friar John refused. So all the other Friars spent the whole day re-planting the fruits and vegetables so that they would have a sustainable source of food while Friar John spent the day relaxing, proud of what he had done and happy that he didn't have to travel 20 miles to town. 
That night, Friar John entered the greenhouse and plundered his secret stash of flowers he had kept there since the beginning of the old woman's gifts. He tore every plant out of the soil and planted flowers in their place smiling with joy the whole time. He did this for a whole week.

Every day when the morning came and the others saw what he had done, they had had enough. ""This stupid Friar with his 'beautiful' flowers is ruining our temple,"" the Friars said. ""If we don't do something about him, we and the townspeople are all going to starve."" They had tried everything you can think of to stop John, but nothing would work and they were getting desperate. One brave Friar stepped up and offered to travel to the town and enlist the help of the people there.
Since this wasn't Friar John and he didn't travel this way each day, it took the volunteer 3 days to get to the town and back, compared to Johns 1. When he finally did return he told of the town being stricken with sickness and death as they had no food, but that one healthy man had offered to help at the temple. This man was named Hugh and he was big, scary and intimidating. Hugh approached Friar John and shook him by the shoulders yelling at him to stop what he was doing and to save the town by re-planting the food. John thought about it and said, ""Ok, I'll stop.""
The moral of the story: Only **Hugh** can stop Florist Friars.",There was once a temple high in the mountains.,4

  Anyway, some backstory. 
  They had recently married after a whirlwind romance. Jack had just graduated as a Navy Seal, Lucy worked part time as a teacher's aide at the local grade school. They were quite young, in their early 20s, just starting out. 
  Her doctor had told her about a new experimental procedure where the pain of childbirth can be shared with the father. By taking part in the study, she would be eligible for a $2500 payment.
  She had discussed this with her husband and they decided that this would be something that they wanted to do. The money would really help them out - $2500 was a huge amount of money back then. They signed a binding contract.
  Time passed - too slowly for her, the summer was a brutally hot one. But one sultry August evening the heavens opened. This is when the the baby decided it was time. The doctor was called, and Jack grabbed the bag they had packed ready, got her into the VW Bug, and drove through the torrential rain to the hospital. 
  At the hospital, Lucy and Jack were checked into the same room, and they were both hooked up to various machines to monitor their's and their baby's vital signs. 
  There were the usual nurses and doctors bustling about, but also a couple of suits. Jack enquired of the doctor as to who they were, and was told that they represented the Company who were funding the study. He didn't think anything more about it, they were just sat there quietly reading through some files.
  The contractions had begun, Lucy was in increasing discomfort. 
  A new machine was brought in. This one didn't look like your typical hospital machinery. It was about a meter cube, entirely smooth, except for an antenna protruding from either side and on the front it had three VU meters, a score or more buttons, several dozen blinking lights, and two rather large bakelite knobs that looked like they had been scrounged off another project. It was all labelled using a cyrillic script. Straight out of a mad scientist's lab. The husband read Russian,  but couldn't make any sense of the labels. He paid it no heed. 
  The doctor came back in and clapped his hands together. 
  'Wonderful, are you ready?' he asked the husband. 'We are going to start with just 5% of the pain being transferred to you, let me know if you cannot handle it, yes?'
  'How does it work?' asked the husband.
  'Well,' he said airily, waving his arms around a bit, ' the antenna over on your wife's side picks up the pain she is feeling, it is fed into the Machine and it is put through various complex scientific processes and Fourier Transforms, which you will see registered through these three meters here,  and then the pain is beamed directly into your brain via this antenna on this side here.' He looked at the husband.
  '...OK. I'm not entirely convinced you understand the sciencing behind this, but Lucy is convinced you're a great doctor, so, let's do this.'
  'I can give you the peer reviewed article if you like. You're right, this is more neurosciencing than OB/GYNing. Fascinating, though. Shall we?'
  'It's what I signed up for,' said the husband, somewhat nervously.
  The doctor turned on the power and a distinct hum could be heard. Dials were turned, buttons were pushed and lights started to blink.
  'I'm not feeling anything, yet. Is it working? Lucy seems to be in some distress.'
  One of the nurses had been tending to the wife and came over to the doctor. It was apparent that things were not all well. The doctor looked at the suits. They huddled over into a corner and kept nervously looking over at the husband.
  The doctor came back over and spoke with the parents to be. 'There is a problem. Your child is going to have to be born via a caesarean section. The Company will of course cover the costs. However, we do not know how the pain transfer procedure will work, you will truly be trailblazers. Because of this, we will double the fee. I have to remind you of the binding contract, you have to go through with this either way. We are still at 5% so hopefully, it won't be too bad.'
  They were wheeled into the OR, the husband now quite pale but putting on a brave face for his wife.
  The wife was sedated, the doctor said that during the normal process they liked to have the father conscious so he could give feedback on how much of the pain he could take. The husband agreed. He was, after all, a Navy Seal. The only bad day was yesterday, right?
  The operation began. The OR was rather crowded, all the equipment and personnel necessary to perform a C-Section, along with an extra table for the husband, the nurse taking care of him, this rather ominous-looking machine, and the two suits.
  About 10 minutes in, Jack said he couldn't feel any pain, he was a Navy Seal and so had a high tolerance and that they should turn it up to 20%. The technician looked to the doctor,  who looked to the suits, who nodded in unison. The hum deepened in intensity. Jack gritted his teeth and thought he felt a twinge. He cried out, '40%' and   after that series of looks and nods the hum intensified again. Jack didn't feel anything different this time. 
  'I'm not sure it's working,' said Jack. 
  One of the team who was monitoring the Machine said that the readings were not making any sense. The consensus was that because Lucy was under sedation, she was unable to feel the pain and so it was therefore not being transferred.
  The C-Section took longer and was a little more complicated than usual, the details of which are irrelevant. Suffice to say, about 2 hours later, at 8:48pm, a healthy bouncing baby boy was brought forth into the world. 
  The husband called his mom on the other side of the country, to let her know the happy news, and she promised to let his extended family know, then he called Lucy's dad, ex-Navy, they got on really well, and he explained about the whole procedure. They had a good long chat, and Lucy's dad promised to let the family know the good news. 
  Lucy had lost quite a lot of blood, and received 3 units during the operation. They kept her in for a couple of days, and she made a rapid recovery. 
  The happy family went home on the 4th day, entirely focused on the baby and all that entails...a name...diapers...barf...no sleep...breast feeding woes...diapers...no sleep...barf...diapers...
  It really wasn't until a couple of days later, when the thought occurred that they hadnt received a single 'congratulations on the new rugrat' card in the mail.
  Jack was reading the obituaries in the local newspaper that evening, and he noticed that their mailman had died on the same day that their son had been born. 'That explains why didn't get any mail. Shame, I kinda liked Mick.' He decided he would go to the post office to pick up the mail tomorrow.",A Young Couple are Going to have a Baby....,0

If the bill were paid the way we pay our taxes, the first four would pay nothing; the fifth would pay $1; the sixth would pay $3; the seventh $7; the eighth $12; the ninth $18. The 10th man ‚Äì the richest ‚Äì would pay $59. Although the 10 men didn't share the bill equally, they all seemed content enough with the arrangement ‚Äì until the restaurant owner threw them a curve.

""You're all very good customers,"" the owner said, ""so I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by $20. I'm going to charge you just $80 in total."" The 10 men looked at each other and seemed genuinely surprised, but quite happy about the news.

The first four men, of course, are unaffected because they weren't paying anything for their meals anyway. They'll still eat for free. The big question is how to divvy up the $20 in savings among the remaining six in a way that's fair for each of them. They realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33, but if they subtract that amount from each person's share, then the fifth and sixth men would end up being paid to eat their meals. The restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each person's bill by roughly the same percentage, and he proceeded to work out the amounts that each should pay.

The results? The fifth man paid nothing, the sixth pitched in $2, the seventh paid $5, the eighth paid $9, the ninth paid $14, leaving the 10th man with a bill of $50 instead of $59. Outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings. ""I only got one dollar out of the $20,"" said the sixth man, pointing to the 10th man, ""and he got $9!"" ""Yeah, that's right,"" exclaimed the fifth man. ""I only saved a dollar, too! It's not fair that he got nine times more than me!"" ""That's true,"" shouted the seventh man. ""Why should he get back $9 when I only got $2? The rich get all the breaks!"" ""Wait a minute,"" yelled the first four men in unison. ""We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!""

The nine outraged men surrounded the 10th and brutally assaulted him. The next day, he didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they faced a problem that they hadn't faced before. They were $50 short.","Each and every day, 10 men go to a restaurant for dinner together.",0

  Anyway, some backstory. 
  She and her husband had recently married. They were quite young, in their early 20s, just starting out. 
  Her doctor had told her about a new experimental procedure where the pain of childbirth can be shared with the father. By taking part in the study, she would be eligible for a $2500 payment.
  She had discussed this with her husband and they decided that this would be something that they wanted to do. The money would really help them out - $2500 was a huge amount of money back then. They signed a binding contract.
  Time passed - too slowly for her, the summer was a brutally hot one. But one sultry August evening the heavens opened. This is when the the baby decided it was time. The doctor was called, and her husband grabbed the bag they had packed ready, got her into the VW Bug, and drove through the torrential rain to the hospital. 
  At the hospital, the husband and wife were checked into the same room, and they were both hooked up to various machines to monitor their's  and the baby's vital signs. 
  There were the usual nurses and doctors bustling about, but also a couple of suits. The husband enquired of the doctor as to who they were, and was told that they represented the company who were funding the study. He didn't think anything more about it, they were just sat there quietly reading through some files.
  The contractions had begun, the wife was in increasing discomfort. 
  A new machine was brought in. This one didn't look like your typical hospital machinery. It was about a meter cube, entirely smooth, except for an antenna protruding from either side and on the front it had three VU meters, a score or more buttons, several dozen blinking lights, and two rather large bakelite knobs that looked like they had been scrounged off another project. It was all labelled using a cyrillic script. Straight out of a mad scientist's lab. The husband read Russian,  but couldn't make any sense of the labels. He paid it no heed. 
  The doctor came back in and clapped his hands together. 
  'Wonderful, are you ready?' he asked the husband. 'We are going to start with just 5% of the pain being transferred to you, let me know if you cannot handle it, yes?'
  'How does it work?' asked the husband.
  'Well,' he said airily, waving his arms around a bit, ' the antenna over on you wife's side picks up the pain she is feeling, it is fed into the Machine and it is put through various complex scientific processes and Fourier Transforms, which you will see registered through these three meters here,  and then the pain is beamed directly into your brain via this antenna on this side here.' He looked at the husband.
  '...OK. I'm not entirely convinced you understand the sciencing behind this, but Lucy is convinced you're a great doctor, so, let's do this.'
  'I can give you the peer reviewed article if you like. You're right, this is more neurosciencing than OB/GYNing. Fascinating, though. Shall we?'
  'It's what I signed up for,' said the husband, somewhat nervously.
  The doctor turned on the power and a distinct hum could be heard. Dials were turned I'm not feeling anything, yet. Is it working? Lucy seems to be in some distress.'

These ants had lived in that colony for over three decades. The queen of the colony was one of the most beautiful, regal and humble queen in all of the forest, and the colony flourished under her. The only thing that worried the kingdom was a rival colony housed in a nearby human shed. This colony was filled with fire ants and were known to be very aggressive towards the carpenter ants. They used to kill and eat the young worker ants whenever they had the chance. The human in the shed called them cum ants, because, well...  
Anyway, as long as the carpenter ants made sure that they never went near the shed, they were safe.  


In this colony, there lived a little worker ant named Jock. Jock was a very adventurous and curious ant, and  because of this, he always used to get into trouble. Jock's mother made sure to keep a keen eye on him and made sure he never left the colony. Jock had a friend named Anthony. He and Anthony used to sneak out to the shrubs every night and have a great time eating berries.  


On one such occasion, while they were out in the shrubs, they saw a group of fire ants coming towards them. Frightened, they tried to make their way across the tall grass and toward the their colony in the big oak tree. But the fire ants were pretty fast and blocked their way. Poor Jock and Anthony were very scared, and the fire ants had them surrounded and were closing in on them. Jock motioned towards a small gap and they quickly dashed through it, through the fire ants toward home. But, one of the fire ants caught Jock. Jock told Anthony to run home and call for help, so Anthony rushed to the colony and informed the ants what had happened. Anthony lead a group of 50 ants to where Jock was captured, but by the time they arrived, the ants had already killed and ate poor Jock. The carpenter ants fought bravely with the few but much larger fire ants and killed them.  


Anthony went to Jock's mother that night to give her the sad news. She was devastated. The next day, there was a ceremony and all the ants mourned poor Jock.  


A year passed, and Jock's mother adopted a new baby ant, whom she named Jock too. The new Jock was very dull and lazy, and nowhere as curious as poor old Jock. But it made mother feel better after a very long time. She cared for him and loved him as she did old Jock, but you could still see a little sadness in her eyes. One day, Anthony, now all grown up, came to visit mother. They had a good talk. Finally, Anthony asked mother about how she felt about little new Jock. She said ""Well, I really love little Jock, but...""  


""But what?""

... and to his utter surprise ends up in hell where he's greeted by Satan himself.

Completely shocked he talks to the devil and says: ""Welp, I've been wrong all my life and I guess I'm now to pay the price for my lack of faith""

Satan laughs and replies: ""Awh it's not so bad down here, let me give you the tour so you can see for yourself""

He then proceeds to escort Jack through a beautiful lush green plain with flowers, scattered here and there there's a bunch of houses where other ""damned"" live.

As they pass through each house the inhabitants recognize Satan and invite them inside for a drink and a chat, request that's always granted by the two.

Every time they stop to a house Satan never fails to display how much of a lovely guy he really is by telling amazing stories, singing, cracking jokes and just generally being a great person.

At sunset the devil sees that Jack was very tired and decides to show him the house he'll be spending the rest of eternity into.

As they walk to Jack's new house the two pass close to a huge wall and Jack asks: ""What's behind there?""

Satan: ""Oh, nothing that should concern you, pay it no mind""

Despite his curiosity Jack thought better not to bother Satan with further questions and just followed him to his new house where Satan promised he'd be back the following morning to show him the recreational center before finally bidding him a goodnight after a long day.

That night however Jack kept thinking back at the whole situation he's in and how surreal everything was until his thoughts eventually jumped to the wall he saw earlier in the day.

After a few minutes trying to guess what could there be behind that wall that Satan couldn't even tell him he decided he should investigate, as such he took a deep breath and dived into the night walking back to the place where the wall was.

Once there he searched for some clues until he saw some faint light coming from a spot in the wall; upon closer inspection he saw that there was a hole and the light was coming from behind the wall.

Jack took a deep breath and scrounged up the courage to look into the crack on the wall and what he saw was a spectacle much alike what he always thought hell would be.

On the other side of the wall huge flames were scattered all over a burnt and scalding hot ground and much to his horror he saw other souls inside that nightmare being eternally burned and never consuming, screaming and pleading for help.

Jack rushed back into his place where he just quietly sobbed and cried all night for he was sure now that the Devil was just toying with him to give him a bit of hope right before tossing him into eternal despair.

The following morning Satan showed up once again and told Jack to come with him.

Jack pleaded: ""PLEASE! PLEASE! Don't take me to hell, I'll do anything just let me stay here, I don't wanna burn for all eternity!""

Satan: ""What are you talking about??? I'm just gonna show you the recreational center like I told you yesterday""

Jack: ""Don't lie to me, I saw what was going on behind the giant wall!""

Satan: ""Ooooh you saw that! Don't worry that's not for you, that's the Christian hell""

Jack: ""The christian hell? Why would the christian hell be like that?""

Satan: ""I don't know either man, they just want it that way""","Jack, a renown atheist, dies...",98

For my fortieth birthday this year, my wife (the dear) purchased a week of personal training at the local health club for me.

Although I am still in great shape since playing football 24 yrs ago, I decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and give it a try.

Called the club and made my reservation with a personal trainer named Vanessa, who identified herself as a 26 year old aerobics instructor and model for athletic clothing and swimwear.

My wife seemed pleased with my enthusiasm to get started! The club encouraged me to keep a diary to chart my progress

MONDAY:

Started my day at 6:00am. Tough to get out of bed, but it was well worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Vanessa waiting for me. She was something of a Greek goddess with blonde hair, dancing eyes and a dazzling white smile. Woo Hoo!!!!!

Vanessa gave me a tour and showed me the machines. She took my pulse after 5 minutes on the treadmill. She was alarmed that my pulse was so fast, but I attributed it to standing next to her in her Lycra aerobics outfit. Very inspiring, Vanessa was encouraging as I did my sit-ups, although my gut was already aching from holding it in the whole time she was around. I enjoyed watching the skilful way in which she conducted her aerobics class after my workout today.

This is going to be a FANTASTIC week!!

TUESDAY:

I drank a whole pot of coffee, but I finally made it out of the door. Vanessa made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air, and then she put weights on it! My legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but I made the full mile. Vanessa's rewarding smile made it all worthwhile. I feel GREAT!! It's a whole new life for me.

WEDNESDAY:

The only way that I can brush my teeth is by laying on the toothbrush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. I believe I have a hernia in both breasts. Driving was OK as long as I didn't try to steer or stop. Vanessa was impatient with me, insisting that my screams bothered other club members.

Her voice is a little too perky for early in the morning and when she scolds, she gets this nasally whine that is VERY annoying. My chest hurts when I got on the treadmill, so Vanessa put me on the stair monster. Why the hell would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by elevators?

Vanessa told me it would help me get in shape and enjoy life.

She said some other sh#t too.

THURSDAY:

Vanessa was waiting for me with her vampire-like teeth exposed as her thin, cruel lips were pulled back in a full snarl. I couldn't help being a half an hour late; it took me that long to tie my shoes. Vanessa took me to work out with dumbbells. When she was not looking, I ran and hid in the men's room. She sent Lars to find me, then, as punishment, put me on the rowing machine.

FRIDAY:

I hate that b#tch Vanessa more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world. Stupid, skinny, anaemic little cheerleader. If there were a part of my body I could move without unbearable pain, I would beat her with it. Vanessa wanted me to work on my triceps - I don't have any triceps! And if you don't want dents in the floor, don't hand me the Barbells or anything that weighs more than a sandwich. The treadmill flung me off and I landed on a health and nutrition teacher. Why couldn't it have been someone softer, like the drama coach or the choir director?

SATURDAY:

Vanessa left a message on my answering machine in her grating, shrilly voice wondering why I did not show up today. Just hearing her made me want to smash the machine with my fist. However, I lacked the strength to even use the TV remote and ended up catching eleven straight hours of the Shopping Channel.

SUNDAY:

I'm having the Church van pick me up for services today so I can go and thank GOD that this week is over. I will also pray that next year, my wife (the b#tch), will choose a gift for me that is fun -- like a root canal or a vasectomy.",A week at the gym,13

In a last ditch effort to save his prized possession, he returned to Asia to visit the best urologist he could find.

He walked into the office, showed the doctor his penis and explained that he had seen several doctors  who all explained he had Hong Kong Dong and his penis needs to be removed. 

The Doctor laughed and said ""Relaaax! It Hong Kong Dong! You don't need to have your pee pee removed!""

The man was swept with an overwhelming sense of  relief and asked ""What do I do next?""

The Doctor replied ""just wait about a week. It will have fall off by then!""",A man walks into the doctor's with an awful rash on his penis,21

Commoners, nobility and peasants answered the summons, but Sakya's own monks hesitated.  After all, they had all taken vows of nonviolence, and had not harmed so much as a fly since their initiation.  How could they forsake those vows, even with an enemy at the gates?  Would they not suffer greatly for this in the next life?

They asked the great Sakya for advice.  He counseled them as follows: go into battle with a sword in one hand, and a white Kata scarf, a symbol of hospitality, in the other.  If the Mongols can be persuaded to accept a peaceful resolution, so be it.  But if they come with violence to strike you, defend yourself and strike back, and you will have bettered your situation rather than worsened it.

And that is why it is said among the followers of Sakya: Riposting is the best way to get karma.","In 1240 CE, the Mongols invaded Tibet",11

This train could carry 1,000 passengers and was very expensive to manufacture.

Yet little Timmy had one fatal flaw. He has a very short attention span. 

It just so happened that one day when Timmy was driving the train near a very sharp turn that required him to decrease the trains speed, a butterfly flew across the window. 

Distracted, Timmy forgot to decrease the trains speed and ended up running it off the tracks, killing everybody inside expect for himself. 

In the strange country that Timmy lives in, the punishment for killing a lot of people with a train is death by electric chair. 

So the day comes  when the executioner approaches Timmy in jail and asks what he wants for his last meal.

Timmy thinks for a minute, and then responds to the executioner by asking for a single banana.

The executioner thinks this is a stupid request, but grants Timmy‚Äôs wish anyways. He gives him a single banana, which Timmy eats in 3 bites.

The executioner straps Timmy into the electric chair and pulls down  the lever to start the flow of electricity. 

When the smoke clears, the executioner in shocked to see Timmy still alive, sitting in the electric chair!

Another strange law in the county Timmy lives in is if you survive the execution by electric chair, you get to walk away as a free man.

Timmy was distraught about loosing his job as a train conductor. It just so happened that the same prestigious train company was desperate for a qualified conductor  to operate their new Mega Train. 

They hired Timmy back to his old job. 

Timmy was driving the train in the exact spot where his previous accident occurred, when another butterfly flew across his window...

So Timmy‚Äôs back in the jail cell when the executioner asks for his last meal (again).

Timmy thinks for a minute, and asks for two bananas this time.

A bit suspicious, the executioner brings him his bananas which Timmy eats in 3 bites each. 

Timmy was strapped into the chair, and the lever was pulled, but when the smoke settled, he still wasn‚Äôt dead!

Again, Timmy walks free.

Again, the train company hires him back to drive their new Ultra Train.
 
Again, Timmy is conducting  the train in the spot where the previous accidents had occurred.

Again, a butterfly flew across the window...

So Timmy‚Äôs about to be executed for the third time when the executioner approaches him. He states that Timmy won‚Äôt be given a last meal this time, so there would be no way he could eat his bananas.

Timmy is strapped into the electric chair and the executioner pulls the lever.

The look on the executioners face after he realized Timmy still hadn‚Äôt died was priceless.

‚ÄúHow are you still alive?‚Äù Demanded the executioner, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt give you any bananas this time!‚Äù

Timmy replies, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the bananas. I‚Äôm just a bad conductor.‚Äù","All his life, Timmy wanted to be a train conductor.",161

Not only would that consume a lot of time and energy, but the people would also perhaps harbour some inhibitions criticizing the king in person. 

So, he came up with a brainwave. He organised for a giant billboard, upon which he would put down an idea, or a potential decision, for the public to see. Below the billboard were two arrows - one pointing up, the other pointing down. The citizens, while crossing it on the way to their respective chores, could press either of the buttons - the one pointing up if they agreed with what was written, and the one pointing down if they didn't. Since the king wasn't present, they wouldn't have to be afraid of them being seen; however, unbeknownst to them, the king had instructed two of his guards to hang around in disguise. 

A month into this novel venture, the guards take note of a man who would walk by the billboard everyday, stare at it, scratch his chin, look around and walk away. The guards thought nothing of this for a few days, but when they saw this happen almost daily, they decided to intervene. After all, it could be a threat to this wonderful idea conceptualized by the king! 

So, one fine day, they capture the man, take him to the back of the palace, and sit him down. They offer him some water, even give him a fruit, and then begin to grill him.

All the various people would come to Master Kizal for healing herbs that could be found nowhere except his gardens. The Elves would come to him for rare tree saplings and advice on how to care for ailing trees. Even the dwarves would come to him from time to time for the plants they could grow in their caves beneath the mountains.
 

Once a year, Master Kizal would travel to the great forest. He would bring a special tea he made from the flowers of the seven leaf plant that grew in his secret garden hidden in a clearing a days ride from Bree. 
 

The Tree Fathers of the great forest would sit with him and drink the tea and it put them at their ease as they shared with him the secrets of all growing plants. They would tell him news of all the small green growing things and what they needed to thrive. 

 
In this way, Master Kizal grew his knowledge of horticulture and there was no one in Middle Earth who could match his skill in the garden.

Master Kizal, after a long life, was eventually too weak to continue working in the garden himself, so he took an apprentice, a young Hobbit named Joseph, and called him Junior, as he was called by the same name. Master Kizal swore Joseph to secrecy making him swear to never tell another living soul how he had learned all his secrets. 
 

Eventually, Master Kizal died, and there arose two factions of herb masters who were sure they were the true successors of Master Kizal‚Äôs techniques. Their quiet debates quickly grew more heated as various rare plants and trees in their gardens failed and withered away. The Hobbit everyone knew as Junior was overlooked as unimportant to these powerful herbalists.
 

Soon, the heated debates started becoming violent as rare seeds that could no longer be found in middle earth failed to take root. Rioting in the streets could be heard, accompanied by calls of ‚ÄúITS THE SOIL THAT IS MOST IMPORTANT!‚Äù, and ‚ÄúNO, FOOL, THE WATER IS THE SECRET!‚Äù. 

Joseph the Hobbit knew that he could end this struggle, but he was torn, having sworn to his master that he would never reveal his secrets. Late one night, Joseph received a vision of his Master standing in a green light, wrapped in moss and green leaves and he told the Hobbit, ‚ÄúJunior, I never meant for my secrets to cause violence. That was never the way of my life. I release you from your oath, and charge you to tell these hasty men the secret of my herb knowledge.‚Äù
 

Joseph leapt from his bed and ran to the courtyard where he could see the two factions approaching each other. Torches in hand, and garden tools held to cause injury to each other. They screamed as they approached from opposite ends of the courtyard
‚ÄúTHE WATER IS THE WAY!!!‚Äù
‚ÄúTHE SOIL IS THE WAY!!!‚Äù
Joseph leapt up on stairs between them and yelled

The fish thought to itself: ""If that fly drops six inches, I'm gonna have myself a nice meal."" But, little did the fish know, there was a bear behind it.

The bear thought to himself: ""If that fly drops six inches, the fish will jump up and eat it and I'll jump and I'll have myself a nice meal."" Little did the bear know, there was a hunter eating a sandwich behind him.

The hunter thought to himself: ""If that fly drops six inches, and the fish jumps and the bear pounces, I'm going to have myself a nice meal."" Little did he know, there was a rat underneath him.

The rat thought to himself: ""If that fly drops six inches and the hunter shoots, he'll drop the sandwich and I'll have myself a nice meal. But, little did he know there was a cat behind him.

The cat thought to her self: ""If that fly drops six inches and the rat sneaks away, I'll have myself a nice meal.""

So, the fly dropped six inches, the fish ate it, the bear ate the fish, the hunter shot the bear, the mouse got the sandwich... But the cat missed and jumped in the water.

""Carry on,"" calls the farmer, ""it ain't deep!""

Being in a hurry, the traveller does not concern himself about his shoes and socks, but slightly raises the bottoms of his trousers and charges forward impatiently.

All of a sudden, he finds himself completely submerged, flailing his arms and legs around wildly. His feet don't even reach the bottom. He rises to the surface, spluttering, slapping the surface of the water with his hands. He turns around and hauls himself out of the water, instantly turning the dusty ground into mud, which proceeds to stain his expensive suit. He finds he has slimy weeds wrapped around his limbs and his tie, and entangled in his cufflinks. He's a complete mess.¬†

He stands up and glares at the farmer. ""Hey farmer,"" he says, ""I thought you said that puddle weren't deep!""

When Fred arrives in Las Vegas the voice in his head says ""Go to Caesar's Palace."" Which Fred obeys. The voice says ""Go to the Roulette tables"" and Fred goes there excited with anticipation. Next the voice says ""Place all your money on number 27"" so with excrement he can barely contain Fred places all his money on number 27.

He checked himself for injuries, a few scratches but nothing major; no broken bones, no concussion, not even whiplash from the plane's impact with the ground. For a second he considered himself lucky. Until he looked around. Although he made it out of the plane unscathed, the same could not be said for the provisions he had packed for the journey. Shattered bottles had already emptied their contents into the dry desert sand, leaving it several shades darker where they had landed. Taking further stock of the situation he looked to the horizon. In every direction, as far as the eye could see the undulating dunes of the Sahara stretched out, seemingly forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Brian Blessed is not one to panic. He put all thought of his surely impeding doom to one side and thought hard how best to maximise his chances of survival. Surrounded by desert and with nothing but the clothes on his back he knew that all he could do was pick a direction, walk straight and hope that he stumbled across an oasis or some other travellers before the heat and dehydration finished him off. And so he set off toward the horizon.

&amp;#x200B;

He didn't know if he had been walking for hours or days. Each difficult step through the shifting sand merged into the next as he gradually lost all sense of time. He was just about to give up hope, accept his fate and let the dunes take him when he saw a shimmer on the horizon. It looked like buildings, maybe trees. People! Using the last of his strength he pushed his body forward. It could be a mirage but if not he could be saved.

&amp;#x200B;

When he finally reached it, close to passing out from the heat, exhaustion and dehydration he felt as though he had once again cheated death. Looking around he realised he found himself in a market with three neat stalls manned be three amicable looking merchants. He crawled to the first and gasped ""Water! Do you have water?"" But the merchant shook his head. ""I'm sorry, I only sell jelly (jello for Americans)."" Confused and bewildered Brian made his way to the next stall. ""Water! I must have water or I will die!"" he cried. ""Sorry. I just sell custard here."" His confusion turned to anger and he got to his feet and marched over to the third stall. ""You must give me water! I have been lost in this desert for god knows how long. You MUST give me water!"". But the third merchant shook his head. ""Sorry, I only sell cream here."" Furious, he beat his giant fists on the counter. ""What is the meaning of this! This one only sells jelly. He only sells custard and you only sell cream and none of you have any water to save a man from dying!"" Unfazed the trader shrugged. ""Yes, it is a trifle bazaar.""",Brian Blessed was flying his bi-plane over the Sahara desert when out of nowhere the engine spluttered and stop and he found himself hurtling toward the ground.,3

""We‚Äôre thinking of going to a sex therapist."" said Linda.

‚ÄúOh, we could never do that! We‚Äôd be too embarrassed!‚Äù responded Mary. ‚ÄúBut after you go, will you please tell me how it went?‚Äù

Several weeks passed and the two friends met for lunch again.

‚ÄúSo how did the sex therapy work out, Linda?‚Äù Mary asked.

‚ÄúThings couldn‚Äôt be better!‚Äù Linda exclaimed. ‚ÄúWe began with a physical exam and afterward, the doctor said he was certain he could help us. He told us to stop at the grocery store on the way home and buy a bunch of grapes and a dozen donuts. He told us to sit on the floor nude and toss the grapes and donuts at each other. Every a grape went into my vagina, John had to get it out with his tongue. Every donut that I ringed his penis with, I had to eat. Our sex life is wonderful, in fact it‚Äôs better than it‚Äôs ever been!‚Äù

With that endorsement, Mary talked her husband into an appointment with the same sex therapist.

After the physical exams were completed, the doctor called Mary and Tom into his office.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid there is nothing I can do for you.‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBut doctor!‚Äù Mary complained. ‚ÄúYou did such good for Linda and John, surely you must have a suggestion for us! Please, please, can‚Äôt you give us some help? Any help at all?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, OK.‚Äù the doctor answered. ‚ÄúOn your way home, I want you to stop at the grocery store and buy a sack of apples and a box of Cheerios.‚Äù","Two women had been having a friendly lunch, when the subject turned to sex. ‚ÄúYou know, John and I have been having some sexual problems.""

But Dalton wouldn't quit that easily. He convinced the producers that if he could best his would-be replacement in a sword fight, a challenge that would require speed, strength and dexterity and demonstrate that he still had what it took, then he could reprise the role of 007 one last time.

&amp;#x200B;

And so the day came when the two met in the arena and gave the producers a show they wouldn't soon forget. The young upstart with the vigour and vitality of youth on his side leapt and lunged, thrusting and swinging his sword with impressive force. But the older Dalton had the wisdom of age on his side. Each time the young actor sent his blade toward him he stepped effortlessly out of the way, lightly parrying and deflecting the blow as he went. Though he didn't have the speed and endurance of his opponent, he could conserve his energy, bide his time, play the long game and hope to tire him out, pick his moment and strike when the youngster was worn out and let his guard down. And so the fight went on, the young pretender attacking ferociously and the elder thespian withstanding the assault.

&amp;#x200B;

But although he could dodge the attacks of his opponent, Dalton struggled to break through and land a blow himself. Even worse, the producer's champion didn't tire nearly as quickly as he had hoped. Despite giving it everything he had, utilising every skill and technique he had learned over the course of a long and varied career, try as he might, he couldn't manage to pierce Brosnan.","After completing filming of License to Kill, Timothy Dalton was dismayed when producers told him they wanted him to retire from the James Bond franchise.",8

In order to show how one country was superior in the rivalry every 100 years the 2 countries would hold a cross channel swimming race and this would determine the name of the channel for the next century. 

After a millennium it was 5 a side 5 no clear victor emerging. Around  5 months ago Theresa May met with Emmanuel Macron to discuss the issue, and so she could put it on the Brexit bill. They decided with Britain leaving the EU they needed one more race...

 The scores were tied, this winner would determine the name of the channel for generations to  come. The standard format of having athletes racing had grown stale, they needed something interesting, something bold, modern and fascinating to watch. Macron then  remembered a picture he saw online comparing May to sad looking cat. That was it he thought, a cat race across the channel.

 May accepted. The countries found two cats and named them after the countries respective number system with the British cat bring named 
One two three 
And the French cat being named
Un deux trois

The race was on! Both cats started in Dover and they began swimming, paddling as fast as their little paws could take them. Battling the cold, shipping lanes, and one another. As mist fell over the channel Macron and May eagerly awaited in Normandy. Only one cat made it, only cat had survived...

One two three had made it. Britain had won!

Everything was fine. He deserved to rest after all this years of hard working. He had set for himself a goal in this life, to collect as much money and wealth as he can until he dies. 

And so, he was living the dream of his life, especially when you know that the bastard payed nothing for the trip. Yeah ! That's true ! It was his lovely wife's brothers who payed for everything, because it was their father's last wish to see his daughter before he dies. 
He knew that the occasion wasn't the most appropriate for a marriage anniversary, but he thought: "" It's now or never !"".

One night, he woke up to the phone ringing. It was his loyal friend and business associate calling from home telling him that his store was burned to the ground. It meant that he has literally lost all his wealth, because the genius secretly buried all his money beneath the store. He didn't put his belief into the banking system.

The man, not believing what he heard, went straight to the nearest store and bought a fine gun. In his way back home,  he was thinking: ""All this years, I had never lost a single penny ! This a huge loss."". He decided then : "" My life without my wealth is not a life worth living !""

So, as he prepared to kill himself, the phone in the other room rang out. His wife answered the phone. It was his friend calling to say that  he was just kidding and that his store burning was just a prank. After all, he didn't lose anything.

The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.'

So mad in fact, that he would kill every daughter his wife bore as he only wanted sons. 
He lived in a huge castle right next to the sea. 

The kingdom that this King ruled over stretched far and wide. All the good people knew fine and well that the king was as mad as a hatter. This meant most of the villages just kept to themselves. 

Every night the King would make his way down to the beach. He would sit and stare at the ocean, taking in its beauty. Every time he came back from the beach he would tell his wife that the ocean was speaking to him but she would shrug it off as his madness. 

This continued for many years, every night the same, the King would come back and repeat over and over again that the ocean was speaking to him. 
This got too much for the Queen to handle and she confronted him. She made it clear he was to either prove it to her or they would be divorced. 

So the King scoured the land for all the famous linguists, oceanographers and anyone who could help. They all gathered at the beach and waited day and night for the ocean to say something to them. To prove the mad King was truly right about this. 

After 3 weeks, the King got so fed up, he stood up and took a deep breathe and screamed at the ocean:

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to say something to me, do it now! Or I shall never come back here!‚Äù

But the ocean still said nothing. It just waved.",The mad old King,60

‚ÄúOk class, I want you to go home tonight and learn the first six letters of the alphabet.‚Äù

So Billy left school determined to learn what the teacher had asked. When he got home, he found his mother in the hallway. She was busy talking on the phone.

He asked her, ‚Äú Mom, what‚Äôs the first letter of the alphabet?‚Äù

She replied‚ÄúShut up! Can‚Äôt you see I‚Äôm on the phone!?‚Äù

Billy was a little confused, but he thanked her and continued his mission. He walked by the bathroom and found his dad trying to fix the toilet.

He asked, ‚ÄúDad, what‚Äôs the second letter of the alphabet?‚Äù

Billy‚Äôs father didn‚Äôt hear him, and said to himself, ‚ÄúOh man, do I just looove fixing this goddamn crapper.‚Äù

Again, Billy was confused, but he continued his journey. He walked into the living room and saw his brother (who was only a year older) watching cartoons.

He asked him, ‚ÄúHey brother, what‚Äôs the third letter of the alphabet?‚Äù

His brother turned to him and said, ‚ÄúNa na na na na na na na na, Batman!‚Äù

Billy accepted that his brother knew more than him, and continued on his way. He stopped in the kitchen, and found his grandfather assembling hamburgers.

He asked him, ‚ÄúHey grandpa, what‚Äôs the fourth letter of the alphabet?‚Äù

Grandpa‚Äôs hearing wasn‚Äôt that good in his old age, so he said to himself, ‚ÄúMy buns are ready!‚Äù

Again, Billy thanked his family member and strolled into the family room, where his grandmother was watching TV.

He asked her, ‚ÄúGradma, what‚Äôs the fifth letter of the alphabet?‚Äù

She was too focused on the sports game, and said, ‚Äú99! Hit em hard!‚Äù

Billy thanked her too and left to go to his room. Upon arriving, he saw his twin sister playing with her My Little Pony figures.

He asked her, ‚ÄúSister, what‚Äôs the sixth letter of the alphabet?‚Äù

She ignored him and said, ‚ÄúOver the rainbow!‚Äù

Billy felt like he had learned enough for today, so he rested. The next day at school, the teacher addressed the class.

‚ÄúOk everyone, who can tell me the first six letters of the alphabet?‚Äù

Billy couldn‚Äôt contain his excitement. He jumped up and yelled,

‚ÄúShut up! Can‚Äôt you see I‚Äôm on the phone!?‚Äù

He whole class erupted in laughter, and the teacher sent Billy down to the principal‚Äôs office.

The principal saw Billy walk in and asked him,

‚ÄúWhat were you sent down here for?‚Äù

Billy replied, ‚ÄúOh man, do I just looove fixing this goddamn crapper!‚Äù

The principal was shocked.

‚ÄúWho do you think you are?‚Äù He asked.

Billy replied, ‚ÄúNa na na na na na na na na, Batman!‚Äù

The principal stood up and said, ‚ÄúAre you looking to get a spanking?‚Äù

""Ah, now I see,"" the priest says. ""You cursed then.""

""No father, this was not when I cursed. The hawk started flying over the green, and by some miracle, maybe an act of God, the squirrel let my ball drop right over the green. It landed and rolled within 5 feet of the hole.""
