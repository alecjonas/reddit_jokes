He did this by ordering a $2.50 coffee with 10 cent coins and in doing so he throws the coins all over the counter, leaving the poor seller to pick up all the coins.

But on this one occassion this customer only had a $5 note and so reluctantly used it to purchase the coffee. The seller after serving him was about to give his 2.50 change realized that this was his opportunity to get revenge. 

He quickly counted all his 10 cents up until it summed up to 2.50 and then with a grin he threw all the coins on the counter shouting: ""Heres your change!""

The customer looked at the change and said: ""Actually, I will get another cup as well""",An Annoying Customer,11

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.    Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. 


Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. 

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.    Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. 

And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. 

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.    

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" 

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.   

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,18

 An extremely modest man was in the hospital for a series of tests, the last of which had left his bodily systems extremely upset.

 Upon making several false alarm trips to the bathroom, he decided the latest episode was another and stayed put. He suddenly filled his bed with diarrhea and was embarrassed beyond his ability to remain rational.

 In a complete loss of composure he jumped out of bed, gathered up the bed sheets, and threw them out the hospital window.

 A drunk was walking by the hospital when the sheets landed on him. He started yelling, cursing, and swinging his arms violently trying to get
the unknown things off, and ended up with the soiled sheets in a tangled pile at his feet.

 As the drunk stood there, unsteady on his feet, staring down at the sheets, a hospital security guard (barely containing his laughter) who had watched the whole incident walked up and asked, ""What the heck is going on here?""

 The drunk, still staring down replied: ""I think I just beat the shit out of a ghost""

But one day, Adam began to feel lonely and decided to talk to God about it. In that discussion, Adam expressed that he didn't really have anyone to talk with or connect to on an emotional and physical level and that, somehow, he was incomplete.

God then told Adam about this wonderful creation he had in the works called a woman. In that discussion, he described this woman as being a helpmeet, a lover, a friend, a confidant, and a lifetime companion. God said that she would support him in all of his righteous endeavors, raise children for him, be a homemaker, and even make sure dinner was on the table every night when he got back from work. 

Adam told God that this sounded like the perfect remedy to his ailment and asked God if there was anything he could do to help get things moving along? God said that he would take care of everything, but that he needed an arm and a leg from Adam before he could proceed. 

Shocked, Adam asked for some alone time to contemplate such a sacrifice for his own emotional and physical needs. After several hours, he got up, reconvened with God and asked, ""What can I get for a rib?""","In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth and all things that in them are: (Long)",139

A blonde gingerly works her way through the crowd and steps up to the stage.


The leader asks her, ""What is 15 plus 15?""


After 15 or 20 seconds she says, ""Eighteen!""


Obviously everyone is a little disappointed. Then 80,000 blondes start cheering, ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""


The leader says, ""Well since we've gone to the trouble of getting 80,000 of you in one place and we have the world- wide press and global broadcast media here, gee, uh, I guess we can give her another chance.""


So he asks, ""What is 5 plus 5?""


After nearly 30 seconds she eventually says, ""Ninety?""


The leader is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh -- everyone is disheartened - the blonde starts crying and the 80,000 girls begin to yell and wave their hands shouting, ""GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE! GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE!""


The leader, unsure whether or not he is doing more harm than good, eventually says, ""Ok! Ok! Just one more chance -- What is 2 plus 2?""



The girl closes her eyes, and after a whole minute eventually says, ""Four?""


Throughout the stadium pandemonium breaks out as all 80,000 girls jump to their feet, wave their arms, stomp their feet and scream... ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""","80,000 blondes meet in a football stadium for a ""Blondes Are Not Stupid"" Convention.",35323

Now, these guys were the men of God, so all the people in the village wanted to buy from them, rather than the existing flower shop, which was not affiliated with the church. The owner of the existing flower shop felt this was entirely unfair, as he was there first, and they were stealing all of his customers to a market that he had the corner on. So he went over to the friars' shop and kindly asked them to take their business elsewhere or find some other way of making money. The friars laughed in his face, proclaiming how the greatness of the Lord had brought them into wealth. So he went home despondent and unsure of what to do. Then, he had the idea that maybe his wife could talk some sense into them. They ignored her requests as well. At this rate, he would be run out of business by the end of the month, so he went over and begged the friars to stop, saying he would even pay regular donations to church if they did so. Again, the friars remained steadfast, and ignored his wishes once more. As the final straw, the flower shop owner hired the toughest man in town, Hugh McTaggart, to go rough them up a little bit. Hugh did so, saying that if they didn't shut down he would destroy everything they owned. Fearless, and faithful that the righteousness of God would protect them from these heathens, the friars ignored Hugh as well. So the next day, Hugh came back to the friars' shop, took a giant hammer, and started smashing everything in the shop. The friars found they didn't have the funds to replace everything that was destroyed, so they finally decided to give in and close up their flower shop, proving that (are you ready?)

""Prisoner!  We will give you an opportunity to gain your freedom by completing three challenges in the tents behind me, which if successfully completed, you will be granted your freedom immediately.  If you fail, you will be executed.""

The pilot thinks it over for a moment, and agrees to take a shot at the challenges in the tents.  

""In the first tent,"" the commander explains, ""are two fifths of vodka.  You must consume both bottles without succumbing to alcohol poisoning, and continue to complete the final two challenges immediately.""

The pilot replies ""Hell, that's normal for me every time I'm on leave.  What's next?""

""In the second tent, there is a lion with a bad tooth.  You must successfully extract the tooth after drinking the vodka without being mauled by the lion, and continue on to complete the final challenge.

The pilot anxiously agrees.  ""And the third tent?""

""In the third tent, there is a woman who has never been sexually satisfied in her entire life.  You must complete the first two challenges and satisfy the woman, at which time you will be released immediately.""

The pilot agrees and anxiously enters the first tent.  After three hours, the pilot finally emerges, so drunk that he can barely walk.  He is then guided to the second tent containing the lion with the bad tooth. 

After a brief moment of tense silence, the tent begins to shake, and the pilot is heard screaming and the lion roaring.  After a few minutes of this, all falls quiet.

The man stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes, with the officer quietly observing. After what seemed an eternity, in which he tried his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his car and fall into it. He sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off. Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off; it was a fine, dry summer night, flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked the horn and then switched on the lights. He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little, and then remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patrons' vehicles left. At last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out and drove slowly down the road. The police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, and promptly pulled the man over and administered a breathalyser test. To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence that the man had consumed any alcohol at all! Dumbfounded, the officer said, ""I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyser equipment must be broken."" ""I doubt it,"" said the truly proud Redneck. ""Tonight I'm the designated decoy.""

He finds his mother in the living room and greets her, “Hello mother, I’m back from school!” his mother replies “Hello Billy, how was your day at school?” the boy proceeds to tell his mother about his day at school, he then remembers about the apple in his pocket. “Also, when I was walking home from school, I found this box sitting on the side walk, when I went over to open it I found a single apple inside.” He pulls the apple out from his pocket and shows it to his mother, who immediately exclaims, “How dare you bring that into my house you disgusting boy! You have bought shame on this family and I never want to see your face again!” she then proceeds to slap him and send him out to his father who is in the yard. “Hello son how was your day at school?” asked the father. The boy, slightly shaken, says “it was ok but when I was walking home from school, I found this box sitting on the side walk, when I went over to open it I found a single apple inside.” He holds his hand outstretched clutching the apple. The boy’s father immediately exclaims “How dare you bring that onto my land you disgusting boy! You have bought shame on this family and I never want to see your face again!” the father clips him around the ear and sends him off to sleep in the tool shed for the night. At this point the boy is extremely confused, what is so bad about one single apple? He places the apple back into his pocket and falls asleep. 

The next day comes around; the boy wakes up in the tool shed and goes inside to get ready for school. He quickly gets everything he needs and leaves for school before his family wake up. The boy arrives at school and gets settled down, ready for show and tell. The teacher walks into the room and exclaims, “Good morning everyone, first up today we have: ‘show and tell’ when I call out your name, come to the front of the class.” A few children present their show and tell, then it is time for the young boys turn, he walks to the front of the class and exclaims, “When I was walking home from school, I found this box sitting on the side walk, when I went over to open it I found a single apple inside.” He pulls the apple out of his pocket and holds it up for the class to see. Immediately the whole class beings to scream and cry, some children become ill, others faint. The teacher grabs the boy by his arm and yells “How dare you bring that into my classroom you disgusting boy! You have bought shame on this school and I never want to see your face again!” the teacher marches the boy to the principal’s office and instructs him to wait. The boy waits for a few moments, and then the principal emerges from his office and greets the boy: “Hello Billy, what are you doing here, I never thought I’d see you in trouble!” the boy says “all I did was to bring this apple that I found yesterday when walking home from school!” he shows the apple to the principal who immediately exclaims “How dare you bring that into my school you disgusting boy! You have bought shame on this town and I never want to see your face again!” the principal immediately phones the police station to come and arrest the boy. When the police officers arrive they handcuff the boy and take him back to the station.

Once they arrive at the station the police commissioner asks the boy “what is the reason for you being here today, young man?” the boy pulls the apple out from his pocket and says “well, I was walking home from school, I found this box sitting on the side walk, when I went over to open it I found a single apple inside, that’s all I did!” the commissioner recoils at the sight of the apple and calls his officers in to throw the boy in a cell. The police commissioner shouts to the boy: “How dare you bring that into our community you disgusting boy! You have bought shame on this town and I never want to see your face again! You will be facing the judge for this!” A few days later, the boy is bought up before the judge who remarks “Well, Billy, I never thought I’d see someone so young up before my court, what is it that you did that landed you here?” the young boy, visibly distraught yells to the judge “I was walking home from school, I found this box sitting on the side walk, when I went over to open it I found a single apple inside, that’s all I did, nothing else!” the boy holds the apple up and the judge immediately shouts “How dare you bring that into my court house you disgusting boy! You have bought shame on your family and your community and I never want to see your face again so I will be sentencing you to 60 years in prison for such a despicable and disgusting act!” the boy is hauled away to prison where all of his belongings are taken except the clothes off his back and the single apple.

As the years pass, the young boy grows into an old man, with only a single apple to his name, none of the other prisoners or wardens ever speak to him. Finally, the day comes for his release. He walks out of the prison under the angry stares of the wardens, apple in hand. He exclaims to himself “before I die, I must find out, what it is about this apple that is so volatile for everyone around me…” the old man, too afraid to confront anyone face to face, searches the internet far and wide to find out: what is so controversial about this apple? After months of searching he comes across a seedy criminal who offers to give him information about the apple in exchange for the man’s life savings. The old man insists that he must know, so, he sends all his money to the seedy criminal who tells him to travel to the mountain ranges of Tibet where he will find a monk who will explain the true meaning behind the apple.

The man travels for days, by boat, by plane, by train and finally by foot, until he reaches the town at the base of the mountain. Almost dead from exhaustion, the man walks into the local shop to ask about how he can reach the temple at the top of the mountain. The store owner exclaims “Ah yes, you want to see the man over the other side of the street, he has a yak that can take you up to the temple!” the man thanks the store owner and rushes out of the shop and crosses the street. 
Unfortunately, the man forgets to look both ways when crossing the street and is hit by a semi-truck and is killed immediately. That’s why you should always look both ways before crossing the street.

Alas, they arrive at the Grail’s fabled final resting place: a crumbling old castle, separated from them only by a bottomless crevasse, with a rickety bridge as the only way across.

As they attempt to make the crossing, an old hermit appears.

“STOP! He who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see,” says the hermit. 

The legend of the old hermit bridge keeper was known far and wide throughout the kingdom, yet none had ever claimed to have passed the hermit and his three questions. 

For that reason, each knight was hesitant to challenge the old man, lest some terrible fate befall he who failed to answer the hermit’s questions. 

“We should let Sir Lancelot go first!” said Sir Robin. “He’s the bravest of us, and never shown fear before, why should he now?”

Having been called out in front of his mates, Lancelot was loathe to show weakness, so he plucked up his courage and confronted the bridgekeeper. 

“Ask away, old man.”

“Brave knight, what is your name?”

“Sir Lancelot of Camelot.”

“What is your quest?”

“I seek the Holy Grail.”

“What is your favorite color?”

Confused, Lancelot replied, “Blue.”

“You May cross now good sir.”

Seeing the ease at which his comrade conquered the 3 questions, Sir Robin loudly exclaimed, “I will go next!”

“Brave knight, what is your name?” Asked the old hermit.

“Sir Robin of House Arryn.” Replied Sir Robin with smug confidence.

“What is your quest?”

“I seek the Holy Grail.” Said Sir Robin, sounding almost bored.

“What is the capital of Assyria?”

“Wait what? I don’t know that!”

POOF

Sir Robin was ejected high into the air by an unseen force, before plummeting into the ravine, screaming all the way.

The remaining two knights were deeply shaken, but were determined to press on. 

“Brave knight, what is your name?” 

“Sir Galahad of House Tully.” said the third knight nervously. 

“What is your quest?”

“I seek the Holy Grail.”

“What is your favorite color?”

“Blue. Wait, no I mean-“

POOF

Sir Galahad was catapulted into the air as if he had stepped on an SRS airbag.

The engineer was now thoroughly unnerved at all this, yet he somehow gathered the courage to face the old hermit.

“Brave knight, what is your name?”

“T...Tim.”

“What is your quest?”

“I seek the Holy Grail.”

“What is the velocity of a jet plane cruising at 10,000 feet above sea level?”

“A jet plane? What model, and what’s its thrust to weight ratio?” asked the engineer.

“What? I don’t know that!”

""*Do not even think about escaping.*"" the Devil laughed at the poor men ""*These cells are meant to keep the condemned!  Nothing can leave them! Nothing can enter them! Nothing! Unless I say otherwise.*"" he laughed devilishly ""*But here are two iron balls. As you can see they are big as fuck and heavy as shit. I use them to chain some of the sinners for fun. They are useless for anything else.... But If you can show me a trick which I will not be able to repeat, I will let you go. No cheating! I promise. You have until tomorrow*""   
Then he laughed even more devilishly and vanished in a puff of sulfuric smoke.

All three men lamented their cruel fate and laboured through the night (how they knew it was night in Hell nobody knows) to perfect their one chance of escape.  It was hopeless for how can you come up with a trick if all you have is two iron balls, big as fuck and heavy as shit  and completely useless. 

The night lasted for an eternity and it was Hell.

On the next morning the Devil appeared (because he knew when it is morning in Hell) and came to see the Russian.   
""*Show me your trick!*"" he demanded and the Russian nervously  began juggling the two heavy iron balls while dancing Kozachok and singing the Katyusha.    
The Devil laughed at how ridiculous it looked because it looked really ridiculous and then took the two iron balls repeated the trick easily  and so the Russian was forever bound to stay in Hell.  

Next the Devil came to see the German.   
""*Show me your trick!*"" he demanded and the German threw each ball at one of the walls of his cell. They hit the walls, bounced back and then hit each other mid-air and stopped. Then they fell to floor together and stayed like that.    
""*Neat*"" said the Devil playing with his goatee ""*But it is not nearly as hard as you think.You Germans think you are the shit but you always make things  too complicated without a reason*"" and he repeated the trick with ease thus condemning the German to spend eternity in Hell.  

At last he came to the Pole.
He was about to demand the trick when he saw that the Pole is sitting on the floor of his cell and is crying like a child whose parents told him Santa is a pedophile and he did not understand what it meant.   
""*What the Hell is wrong with you.*"" said the Devil annoyed ""*You are supposed to show me your trick using the iron balls I gave you! Keep it serious! This is Hell dammit!*""    
""*I can't*"" cried the Pole.    
""*What do you mean you can't?*""   
""*Because I lost the first ball!*"" the Pole said ""*And then I broke the other one!*""

The woman said, ""That will be okay because what is mine is his and what is his is mine."" So, KAZAM - she's the richest woman in the world!
