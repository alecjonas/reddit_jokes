He asked several captains of the ships if he could ride with them but they all turned them down, saying ""What use would I have for an amphibian on my boat? If you stick around we're just going to eat you!""

Finally one day he found a captain of a ship that said he could board, however if he wanted to board the ship he would have to prove his worth.

The amphibian thought about it for a while but eventually agreed and they set sail the next day.

Aboard the ship, the sailors were big and strong, great at rowing and manning the sails with giant muscular bodies.

After a couple of weeks of journeying though, there came a great storm, the wind was howling, the ocean was quaking and at the very top of the sails, a giant gash was torn. 

It was way up high, so high that the masts were so small that a man couldn't even reach them. Anyone that tried would only break them and damage the ship more.

The captain goes back to the amphibian and says, ""So I need you to climb up there and fix the sails.""

To which the amphibian replied, ""There's no possible way that I could do that! The wind push me off or I will get swept overboard. If I went up there it would be incredibly dangerous and I would surely perish in the depths of the sea. Do I really have to do it?""

The captain looks at him and says, ""Well, considering it may be my last meal, let me eat some food and I'll make a decision."" After which, the captain goes off and chows down on his grub. 

A little later the captain captain comes back to him and says, ""I ate to say...Aye, toad, you sew...""

The father looks over and sternly says, “Max!”

The young man realizes the father thinks it was the dog who farted. Delighted, he feels another fart coming on. This time he lets it out and again the audible sound fills the room.

“Max!” Shouts the father this time.

The young man can’t be happier, he’s farting as much as he needs and the father thinks it’s their dog. Eventually he feels a third fart coming on. Without flinching the young man passes his gas again.

Before leaving, they happen to notice a fortune-teller shop across the mall. Two of the women thought it would be a fun way to end their outing while the third one was a bit more skeptical. After a moment of debating, they all agree to go in.

As they entered the shop they were greeted by the Miss Catarina.

* **Miss Catarina**: *Welcome, my beautiful friends! I would like for you to join me on a wonderful adventure into your minds.*

The two women were excited for the experience while the skeptical one rolled her eyes. Miss Catarina acknowledge the gesture.

* **Miss Catarina**: *I see we have a disbeliever in the room. In what way would I be able to lessen your uncertainty?*

Skeptical Woman: How about you start by guessing our names.

* **Miss Catarina**: *And that is exactly what I will do! However, uncovering the names of you three would be way too simple for Miss Catarina. One may say I overheard you addressing each other during a recent debate about coming in here.* (She says with a smirk)

The faces of the other two women were filled with amazement.

* **Miss Catarina**: *I will predict the names of your children and explain some history behind why it was chosen!*

Thinking that there could be no way that she would know, the skeptical woman agreed. Miss Catarina starts with the first two.

* **Miss Catarina**: *Hello my little Princess, your name has to be Penelope!*

The first woman was stun while Penelope looked to her mom confused.

* **Miss Catarina**: *I see you are confused my child, but be no more. You would most likely recognize your name as Penny! It is short for Penelope! Do you know why your name is Penny? It’s because your mommy loves collecting money! All kinds of money! Old money, new money and even foreign money!*

The first two women cheered while confirming that it is correct. The third woman was a bit shocked but still skeptical. 

* **Miss Catarina**: *It was nice meeting you, Penelope!*

She then moves to the second child.

* **Miss Catarina**: *Hello my little Angel. You must be Lillian!*

* **Lillian**: *Yes! But everyone calls me Lilly!*

* **Miss Catarina**: *And I bet that is because your mommy loves flowers! All types of flowers! Wild flowers, house flowers and even exotic flower!*

The two women confirmed with excitement! But now the skeptical woman is concern.

* **Miss Catarina**: *It’s a pleasure meeting you, Lillian.*

Saving the best for last, she walks over to the third child.

* **Miss Catarina**: *And you my handsome Prince. Your name is the most fitting of all!* 

While feeling embarrassed, the skeptical woman cuts off Miss Catarina.

* **Skeptical Woman**: *I’ve had enough! My son and I do not want to hear what you have to say! We’re leaving!*

While looking at the sad little boy getting taken out the shop, Miss Catarina shouts to him.

* **Miss Catarina**: *You have a wonderful day, Richard!*

So, he went in and made the necessary arrangements to have Finkelstein prepare a new robe for him. A few days later, when the robe was finished, Jesus tried it on -- and it was a perfect fit! 

He asked how much he owed. 

Finkelstein brushed him off: ""No, no, no, for the Son of God there's no charge! 

However, may I ask for a small favor. Whenever you give a sermon, perhaps you could just mention that your nice new robe was made by Finkelstein, the Tailor?"" 

Jesus readily agreed and as promised, extolled the virtues of his Finkelstein robe whenever he spoke to the masses. 

A few months later, while Jesus was again walking through Jerusalem he happened to walk past Finkelstein's shop and noted a huge line of people waiting for Finkelstein's robes. 

He pushed his way through the crowd to speak to him and as soon as Finkelstein spotted him he said: ""Jesus, Jesus, look what you've done for my business!  Would you consider a partnership?"" 

""Certainly,"" he replied. ""Jesus &amp; Finkelstein it is."" 

""Oh, no, no,"" said Finkelstein. ""It should be Finkelstein &amp; Jesus...  After all, I am the craftsman."" 

The two of them debated this for some time. 

Their discussion was long and spirited, but ultimately fruitful -- and they finally came up with a mutually acceptable compromise.

On her way home, she stops at a news stand to buy a newspaper. Before leaving, she says to the clerk, ‘I hope you don’t mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?”.
‘About 32,’ is the reply.’
‘Nope! I’m exactly 60,’ the woman says happily.
A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.
The girl replies, ‘I’d guess about 29.’ The woman replies with a big smile, ‘Nope, I’m 60.’
Now she’s feeling really good about herself. She stops at a candy shop on her way down the street.
She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.
The clerk responds, ‘Oh, I’d say 30.’
Again she proudly responds, ‘I’m 60, but thank you!’
While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks a young man with supermodel looks standing next to her the same question.
He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going. Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’
They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, you look so young tho. Anyways, go ahead.’
He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other. Then he puts his face into them. 
After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’
He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 60.’
Stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘That was incredible, how could you tell?’
‘I was your surgeon. You are the patient who wanted a face lift but had tumor in your breasts. I remember you.""

On her way home, she stops at a news stand to buy a newspaper.  Before leaving, she says to the clerk, ‘I hope you don’t mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?”.

‘About 32,’ is the reply.’

‘Nope! I’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily. 

A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.

The girl replies, ‘I’d guess about 29.’  The woman replies with a big smile, ‘Nope, I’m 50.’

Now she’s feeling really good about herself.  She stops at a candy shop on her way down the street.

She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.

The clerk responds, ‘Oh, I’d say 30.’

Again she proudly responds, ‘I’m 50, but thank you!’ 

While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.

He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going.  Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was.  It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra  Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her.  She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully.  He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple.  He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

Stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘That was incredible, how could you tell?’

Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those big cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend.

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

The next day, he goes to sign up for the airforce. The same thing happens, everything is normal until he was asked what his job prior to this was. Again he responds with ""A glukemaker."" Like the army, the airforce denied him.

The next day, he goes to get recruited for the navy. Once again he is asked a bunch of questions, and once again the recruiter asked him his profession, and once again he responded with ""Glukemaker."" The recruiter goes back to discuss, and one person says ""What if a 'Glukemaker' is someone that can make some sort of weapon? Hire him in!"" And they did. The captain asks him to make a gluke. The man responds with ""Oh, but I need some materials. I need 100 cases of lard, a giant storage truck, a giant crane, a marine carrier, and we sail to the top of Mariana's trench."" The captain was confused, but did as the man asked.

The carrier, with the captain, the man and all that he asked for arrived at the tip of the trench. The man then gives him the following instructions. ""Now, load all 100 cases of lard into the truck, then use the crane to lift the truck and then throw it into the ocean."" And so they did. They loaded up the truck with all 100 cases of lard. The crane then picked up the  truck, and then dropped it into the ocean, creating the sound: ""gluke... gluke.... gluke...""",A man goes to inlist in the army.,0

After everything quiets down, though, the r/jokes subscribers decide to give the meetup one last shot. They select a very nervous u/love_the_heat to be host because of his avid mod work and increase security, just to be on the safe side.

""Welco--"" u/love_the_heat begins, but is immediately killed by the Grim Reaper, who popped out of nowhere to chop off his head with that rather large scythe of his.

Security, however, is quick to react this time, and they tackle Death to the ground, subduing and handcuffing him. As they lead him off the stage in shackles, someone yells ""why? Why did you have to come to the r/jokes meetup?""

The first victim is discovered in the Florida Everglades.

0, 8, 2 on his hands and forehead. 5 on his abdomen.

“We believe the numbers may be significant,” a uniformed man reads from a prepared statement to the press, “but we cannot say for sure at this time.” Detective Pierce has seen more faces of death than any man should ever have to endure, but this case—this seems different, somehow.

Another victim is discovered in the marshes of Louisiana soon after.

0, 8, 0 on her hands and forehead. 19 on her abdomen.

Are they connected? Law enforcement in Louisiana contact the agency in Florida. Criminal psychologists and cipher experts are called in to decode the strange numerical messages. Nothing yet. There isn’t enough data. Detective Pierce knows, if there is a deeper meaning, *it will only surface with more bodies*. To solve the murder, more must be committed. A cruel irony.

A third victim emerges, and a macabre certainty is apparent—a serial killer.

0, 6, 9; 2

“What could it mean?” Detective Pierce ponders over a table littered with dozens of photographs. The psychological stress begins to weigh on him. He first began the investigation into the mysterious number killings, and he now makes it his mission to discover the secret of these symbols and put an end to this evil.

More victims.

0, 7, 1; 6

0, 6, 5; 10

0, 7, 8; 8

0, 7, 3; 12

0, 6, 9; 4

0, 7, 8; 9

“*069* repeats!” the authorities notice after the ninth victim is discovered. “It’s certainly a code!”

“And here! The victims with 8 and 9 on the abdomen have identical numbers on the hands and forehead too: both 0, 7, 8.”

Detective Pierce broods over this information. He locks himself away with the numbers, poring through literature about ciphers and codes. He devises complex algorithms to analyze the data, looking for patterns.

Pierce has always put work before his family. His colleagues will all tell you that. But the domestic strain from the number killings is pushing his relationships to the brink of collapse.

Another body in Florida.

0, 8, 5; 17

Pierce is on the scene, crouching over the Number Killer’s latest conquest, examining the slapdash *17* scrawled unceremoniously on the abdomen.

“Detective Pierce.” A voice from behind him. Pierce stands and peels the purple nitrile gloves from his hands and glowers at the intruder on his crime scene. “Agent Rickson. Federal Bureau of Investigation. This is my crime scene now, sir. I’ll need a full briefing.”

“The *hell* it is!” Pierce snaps back. “I’ve been working these killings from *day one*! You think you can just come in here with your federal mandate and expect me to catch you up on all the work *my people* have done?!”

Agent Rickson hands Pierce a bound legal envelope. “You’ve been relieved.”

“This isn’t over. You’re gambling with people’s lives…*sir*.” Detective Pierce practically spits the final word at the agent’s feet before snatching the envelope and rushing off the scene.

Over the next two weeks, eight more victims. Pierce’s anxiety has left him unable to leave his office. He hasn’t been home in three days. Though he’s officially off the case, he’s still haunted by the numbers and mounting body count. His work has suffered to the point that his superiors have issued reprimands.

At his wits’ end, Detective Pierce pulls officer Malloy into his office. Malloy is a rookie who’s eager to please and has a knack for numbers.

“I need you on special assignment, rookie.” Pierce is looking pensively out his office window when Malloy enters.

“Special assignment, sir?”

“*Secret*, special assignment, Malloy.” He turns and places a sealed envelope on the table. “I need you to collect everything we have on the Number Killings. Meet me at the address enclosed here. Tomorrow night. Midnight. Tell no one.”

“But sir, I thought you had been reliev-”

“Dammit, rookie! Do you want more people to *die*?! We need to figure out this nonsense now or we’re going to end up with dead bodies in triple digits, son!”

Malloy reluctantly agrees. He smuggles boxes of files and pictures out of the precinct late the next night and meets Pierce at an abandoned warehouse to go over the information.

For hours, the two sit at opposite tables, running numbers, delving into research, and analyzing the evidence, late into the early hours of the morning.

With a sudden energetic vigor, Malloy springs from his chair and cries out, “ASCII!”

Startled out of his analytic trance, Pierce inquires, “What did you say, Malloy?”

“ASCII! It’s a computer language that uses numbers to represent letters! Look!” Malloy pulls up a reference sheet and begins arranging numbers on Pierce’s desk. “If we take the abdomen numbers as the order, and the palm and foreheadnumbers as the code for the letter…”

“Malloy, you’re a genius!”

Working furiously, Pierce and Malloy clear a space on the dusty warehouse floor to lay out the pictures in sequence:

Abdomens: 6, 12, 17…

G, I, U…

4, 9, 11…

E, N, G…

In minutes, the men have spread 76 photos over a 10 foot square of the warehouse floor and scratched nervous letters on ripped sheets of notebook paper under each group corresponding to the symbol.

As they finish, Malloy stands back to survey the message.

“No…” All blood drains from his face. His legs go weak, and he collapses onto his knees. “It can’t…It just…It *can’t*!

Detective Pierce is wide-eyed next to Malloy’s broken form, mouth agape.

A sound from the warehouse wall rattles the building as a dozen federal agents storm the facility.

“Mother of God…” Pierce doesn’t even notice the agents. His unbroken stare is consumed by the message on the dusty warehouse floor.

Agent Rickson grabs hold of Detective Pierce. “You’re under arrest for interfering with a federal investigation and tampering with evidence.”

Malloy sheepishly confesses. “I told them everything! I told them you wanted me to take the evidence. It was a setup. I was worried about you. I’m sorry! But I never thought…oh God! What can we do?!”

Pierce is handcuffed, and as he is dragged backward from the grotesque mosaic of death, he laughs in spite of himself, “You monster…”

As he comes back to his senses, Pierce begins tearing at the agents pulling him away. He lets out a shrill, animalistic shriek…

“YOU MONSTER!!”

The other agents crowd around the space on the floor that has itself become a crime scene, and in an eerie silence, they collectively ponder the ethereal message left by the elusive Numbers Killer:

“NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP”

He saw a young girl playing on the frozen lake. The ice gave and she fell in. Acting quickly, the tramp ran onto the ice and managed to pull her out and get her back to shore.

Waiting for him was a man in a suit. The girl ran over to him and hugged him. The man looked at the tramp and shook his hand. ""Thank you so much for saving my daughter."" the man said, ""I have to give you a reward. What would you like?"" The tramp responded ""Oh, I couldn't ask for anything I was just happy to help."" The man told the tramp that he was in the oil business and that money was not a question and demanded the tramp ask for any reward he wished.

Finally the tramp said, ""Well, to be honest, I've always wanted a holiday but never could have one."" The man told the tramp to come with him to his car. Once there the man got a piece of paper from his car. ""This is a ticket to an upcoming cruise my company is having. It'll have food, entertainment, and the nicest rooms on any ship. All yours, all expenses paid."", the man explained. The tramp took the paper and thanked the man.

A few days later, the tramp arrived at the docks to board the cruise. As he tried to walk up the ramp he was stopped by an attendant. ""Excuse me, but you need a ticket to be here so I'm going to need to ask you to leave"" the attendant said. ""But I do have one"" the tramp responded as he pulled out his paper. The attendant looked it over. ""Hold on, let me get the captain."" After a few moments a man the tramp assumed to be the captain walks down the ramp. ""Let me see that ticket."" The captain said as he ripped the paper from the tramp's hand. After looking it over the captain motions for the tramp to follow him.

They walk through the ship, the captain talking about what the cruise offers. ""So we have a pool, all you can eat buffet, shuffleboard, tanning beds, and several other activities but I have some bad news."" The tramp's smile that had grown on his face turned into a frown. ""Well what's wrong?"" He asked. ""Well,"" started the captain, ""we're still doing some preparations so you'll have to wait in your room until we're ready."" 

The tramp figured that made sense so he asked to see his room. The tramp and the captain headed off towards the 1st class rooms. But they walked past them and headed down the stairs. They passed the 3rd class cabins then the kitchen then the crew quarters then the engine room, down all the way to the bottom of the ship. The captain opens the door to a room barely larger than a closet. It was dark and damp and had little more than a cot. 

The tramp exclaimed, ""Wow! This is fantastic!"" Compared to sleeping outside in the dead of winter, it truly was. The captain reminded the tramp to not come out until he was told the preparations were completed and that they'd send someone.

A few hours pass the tramp gets hungry. He decided to go see if the preparations were almost done yet so he headed up to the top deck. The ship was bustling with passengers enjoying all the pleasantries of the ship. The tramp figured they must have just finished and decided to enjoy his holiday. He pigs out at the buffet, splashes around in the pool, and generally causes a ruckus. The captain catches wind of this disruption and confronts the tramp.

""I thought I told you to stay in your room,"" the captain said with a scowl. ""Well I-"", ""No, no, no."" The captain interrupted, ""You broke my rules so now you have to do something for me. Go back to your room, someone will get you in a bit for your job.""

The tramp returned to his room and waited for a couple hours until finally the attendant knocked on the door. ""We're ready for you."" He says, and the two return to the pool. There's a new ladder now, climbing so high into the sky it passes the clouds. The captain tells the tramp that if he can dive off that diving board that he would make the tramp captain. The tramp agrees and begins his ascent.

This ladder is tall. Like, loony toons proportions. He climbs up and up, farther and farther into the sky. When he finally reaches and top he peers over the edge and can't even see the ship anymore. He takes a deep breath and jumps.

He plunges down through the air, through the clouds and into the pool, but he keeps going down through the first class cabins, the third class cabins and the kitchen and the crew quarters and the engine, all the way down until he comes to a stop in his room. The people on deck gather around the hole and stare for several minutes until the tramp bursts triumphantly through the door to the deck. Everyone burst into applause and the captain runs up to shake the tramp's hand. He says, ""That's the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life! How did you survive that?!""

""Well,"" says the tramp, ""you see captain in my life I've been through many a hard ship.""",The story of the tramp and the holiday,5

The bear gets to Bill then stops and says, ""Know what? I ain't to hungry any more. I'll let you go but you gotta suck my dick.""

Bill says, ""No fucking way."" 

""Well then i guess im eating again.""

Bill drops to his hands and knees and begs the bear to let him go. 

He tells him again, ""Suck my dick."" 

Bill does it and he is allowed to leave but returns to the cabin, the whole way crying and yelling about the mother fuckin bear. He returns with a 50 cal Sniper. He sees the same bear and shoots him but again all it does is piss him off. The bear rushes at Bill but Bill promptly sucks his dick. The bear grumbles a bit then leaves him alone.

He runs back to the cabin and comes back with an Rpg.

""Now i gotcha."" He shoots a rocket at the bear and it hits. Smoke fills the air and so does the scent of burned meat. He runs over to where it was and sees a small piece of singed bear fur. He picks it up and says, ""Got you know mother fucker.""

Just then he feels a tap on his shoulder and he turns around to see the bear.

""I feel terrible,"" he explained, ""I accidentally hit this rabbit and killed it."" The woman told the man not to worry and that she knew what to do. She went to her car trunk and pulled out a spray can. She walked over to the limp, dead rabbit and sprayed the contents of the can onto the rabbit.

Miraculously the rabbit came to life, jumped up, waved his paw at the two humans and hopped down the road. 50 feet away the rabbit stopped, turned around, waved and then hopped down the road another 50 feet, turned, waved. It continued hopping, turning and waving every 50 feet until it was out of sight. The man was astonished. He couldn't figure out what substance could be in the woman's spray can. He ran over to the woman and asked ""What is in your spray can? What did you spray on that rabbit?"" The woman turned the can around so the man could read the label - it said:

Finally, I got around to doing it while Judy was out.

After finishing, I left to take care of another matter before she returned.

She came in and undressed to take a shower. Before getting in the shower, she sat on the toilet.

As  she tried to stand up, she realized that the not-quite-dry epoxy paint had glued her to the toilet seat.

About that time, I got home and realized her predicament. 

We both pushed and pulled without any success whatsoever. 

Finally, in desperation, I undid the toilet seat bolts.

Judy wrapped a sheet around herself and I drove her to the hospital emergency room. 

The ER Doctor got her into a position where he could study how to free her (Try to get a mental picture of this.) 

Judy tried to lighten the embarrassment of it all by saying, ""Well, Doctor, I'll bet you've never seen anything like this before.""

Like most men, I found shopping boring and preferred to get in and out. 
 
She's like most women - loves to browse &amp; leaves me with endless time to fulfill. 
 
Yesterday my dear wife received the following letter, 
from the local Shopping centre:

Dear Mrs. Harris: 

Over the past six months, your husband has caused quite a commotion, in our store.

We cannot tolerate this behavior and have been forced to, ban both of you from the store. 

Our complaints against your husband, Mr. Harris, are listed below and are documented by our video surveillance cameras:   

June 15: He took 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in other people's carts when they weren't looking.

July 2: Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5-minute intervals. 

July 7: He made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the women's restroom. 

July 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an official voice,
'Code 3 in House wares. Get on it right away'. 
This caused the employee to leave her assigned station and receive a reprimand from her Supervisor that in turn resulted with a union grievance, causing management to lose time; and costing the company money. We don't have a Code 3.   

August 4: Went to the Service Desk and tried to put a bag of M&amp;Ms on layaway.   

August 14: Moved a, 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area.  

August 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told the children shoppers he'd invite them in if they would bring pillows and blankets from the bedding department to which twenty children obliged. 

August 23: When a clerk asked if they could help him he began crying and screamed, 'Why can't you people just leave me alone?' 
EMTs were called.   

September 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose. 

September 10: While handling guns in the hunting department, he asked the clerk where the antidepressants were.   
 
October 3: Darted around the store suspiciously while, loudly humming the, 'Mission Impossible' theme.   
 
October 6: In the auto department, he practiced his, 'Madonna Look' using different sizes of funnels. 

October 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed through, yelled 'PICK ME! PICK ME!'   
 
October 22: When an announcement came over the loud speaker, he assumed a fetal position and screamed;  

'OH NO! IT'S THOSE VOICES AGAIN!'   
  
Took a box of condoms to the checkout clerk and asked where is the fitting room? 
 
And last, but not least: 

October 23: Went into a fitting room, shut the door, waited awhile; then yelled very loudly, 'Hey! There's no toilet paper in here.' 
One of the clerks passed out.

Edit: Thank you for Silver and  Gold! I just want to say that a lot of people have mentioned this is either a repost (it's not as far as I'm aware as I did my due diligence to check before posting), or got sent to me by my grandma, ha, I wish she were still alive but she'd be in the Guinness book of records if she were. But of course, this is an oldie. And so am I for that matter, but I received quite a few comments from people that enjoyed it and who naturally had never heard it before, and if it brightened up your day like it did me when I got sent it, then that's good enough for me :) ","After my retirement at the company I worked at for 50 years, I looked forward to some relaxation time and putting my feet up, but my wife had other ideas...",13076

The first one laments that the average person knows very little about math. The second one disagrees, and they argue over this point for a while.

The first mathematician eventually gets up to use the restroom. While he’s away, the second mathematician calls the waitress over and tells her that, in a few minutes, he’s going to call her over and ask her a question. All she needs to do is respond to it by saying “One third x cubed”.

She repeats, with a puzzled look on her face: “One thir...dex cue???”

He corrects her: “One third x cubed.”

She agrees, and walks away, diffidently repeating to herself “One third...dex cube...One...third dex cube...One third dex…cube.”

When the first mathematician returns, the second proposes a bet—that he’ll ask the waitress to solve an integral, and she’ll be able to do it. The first one agrees, and so the second one calls the waitress over and asks her: “What’s the integral of x squared?”

The waitress proudly states: “One third x cubed!”

As she’s walking away, she looks over her shoulder, smiles, and says: “plus a constant of integration.”

So the female fly goes up to the male fly and asks, ""Hey, how do you get out of this jar?""

The male fly says, ""I can tell you, but you have to fuck me first."" And flies....they aren't very smart. So they do it and the male fly tells the female fly, ""You start from the bottom of the jar and fly as fast you can to the top of the jar and Boom, you'll pop right out.""

So the female fly does just that. Flies from the bottom of the jar to the top of the jar as fast as she can. SPLAT. Dies.

""Now, look, you're faster and more agile than this guy.  He's big and strong, but just keep moving and let him tire himself out and you can beat him.""

 ""Got it, coach,"" says the wrestler.

""One more thing,"" says the coach.  ""He's got this hold called the Pretzel Hold that no one has ever escaped from.  Whatever happens, don't let him get you in the Pretzel Hold cause then it's all over.""

""Got it, coach,"" says the wrestler.  ""Stay out of the Pretzel Hold.""

The match starts and in five seconds the redneck is in the Pretzel Hold.  A groan goes up from the American spectators and the coach buries his face in his hands, unable to watch.

Suddenly, there's a tremendous yell and a thump from the mat and the crowd bursts into cheers and applause.  The coach looks up and sees the Russian out cold on the mat and the redneck standing over him.  Before he can get up into the ring the crowd rushes in and hoists the redneck into the air, celebrating his victory.

Half an hour later, the coach and the redneck are alone and able to talk.

""What happened out there?"" asks the coach.  ""I mean, one second you're in the hold, and next thing I know, you've won.  How?""

""Well,"" says the redneck, ""I don't know how he got me in the hold so fast, but once I was in it, I was pretty much unable to move anything but my head.  So, I looked up, and there was a pair of testicles dangling right in front of my face.  So, I did the only thing I could do.  I craned my neck forward and bit fown.""

""Ah, so that's how you beat him?"" said the coach.

""Not exactly,"" said the wrestler.  ""You'd be surprised how much strength you have when you've just bitten down on your own testicles.""

People hate on a .22 all the time saying it's not enough power or not man enough. My personal favorite defense gun has always been a Beretta Jetfire .22 short. I've carried it for many years including while hiking. I never leave home without it in my back pocket.

I remember one time while hiking with my girlfriend in northern Alberta, out of nowhere came this huge brown bear charging us and boy was she mad. We must have been near one of her cubs. Anyway, if i had not had my little Jetfire, I wouldn't be here today.

Just one shot to my girlfriends kneecap was all it took...the bear got her and I was able to escape by just walking at a brisk pace.

The priest is frustrated now, so he says again, ""I am asking you please not to swear in front of me, I am a man of god.""

The man agrees a little longer, and the play for some more time, until they come to the second to last hole. The man winds up, swings, and hits the ball. It flies into a tree, bounces back, and hits him in the face.  ""Damn,"" He says, ""I missed."" 

The priest raises his hands to the sky, and says ""God, if this man swears one more time, strike him down.""

The man is scared, so he makes sure not to swear. He does a pretty good job all the way up to the last hole and the last shot. When he swings, his brand new golf club flies out of his hands, hits a tree, and breaks into two pieces, one which bounces into the lake, and the other which hit's him in the knee, bruising it. 

 ""Damn,"" He says, ""I missed."" 

A huge bolt of lightning shoots down from the sky and kills the priest. Then God speaks.  ""Damn,"" He says, ""I missed."" ",A man went golfing with a priest.,18

post,affp4p,2qh72,jokes,false,1547353000,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/affp4p/i_have_two_jokes/,self.jokes,,"1: There was a potato hitch hiking across PCH. A storm began to form and he was desperate to get in a car.  Cars would keep driving by him, but luckily someone stopped and took him in. The driver was going in the direction the potato needed, and was going to drop him off on his way. The driver’s heater was broken and the car continued to heat up. Hot air blew into the car and if became uncomfortable. The driver went to open a window for some cool air, but before he could the potato stopped him. “Woah, hey. I’m sorry, I’m just so small, with the storm and the extra wind, I’m worried I will fly away with the window open”. The driver argued that it was his car and he could do what he wants. Besides, it would take a lot for a potato to fly out the window. The driver opens the window, and the potato flies out into the ocean and is gone forever. 

2: A man and a woman had been dating for several years. They were truly in love, and the man decided it was time to pop the question. He planned the perfect proposal, something he knew she would appreciate. He planned to take her on a romantic walk on the beach at sunset, and eat at a fancy restaurant on the beach that she loves. He made the reservations, and the day came. Everything was going perfectly. While walking on the beach, he noticed the ring was no longer in his pocket. He desperately tried to find it, but the water must have taken it. He explained to her what had happened. They decided to still go to the restauant, as they had reservations and he didn’t want the night to be ruined. When they got there, he was so flustered he couldn’t read the menu. He decided to get whatever the waiter recommended, which was clams. His girlfriend got the same. They got the clams, and when the woman opened one, she was shocked. Inside the clam, was the potato.

""I'm sick of all these conferences. I always say the same things over and over!""

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""  
 

So  they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as  Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the  real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.  
 

But in  the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and  thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be  able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by  posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding  their breath, waiting for the response.

I've suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me. The usual signs...phone rings, but if I answer, the caller hangs up. My wife has been going out with the girls a lot recently, although when I ask their names she always says, ""Just some friends from work, you don't know them.""
 
I sometimes stay awake to look out for her cab coming home, but she always comes walking up the drive as I hear the sound of a car leaving, around the corner, as if she has gotten out and walked the rest of the way. Why? Maybe she wasn't in a taxi at all?
 
I once picked up her cell phone, just to see what time it was. This caused her to go completely berserk. She quickly snatched the phone out of my hand and cursed me hysterically, screaming that I should never touch her personal property, then accused me of trying to spy on her.
 
Anyway, I have never broached the subject with my wife. I think deep down I just didn't want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her. I decided I was going to park my Harley Davidson Lowrider next to the garage and then hide behind it so I could get a good view of the street around the corner when she came home. It was at that moment, crouching behind my motorcycle that I noticed a small amount of motor oil leaking through the gasket between the rear head and rocker arm cover.
 
So...is this something I can easily repair myself or do you think I should take it back to the dealer?

&amp;#x200B;

So the next day after I got settled back to good ol' cold England, I went to try visit them, I rang the doorbell a few times, no response ovbiously

So I rang the local police department to ask what the incident was and they said the neighbour was being charged with major theft and was due in court, but did not leave their house, I did some further digging and found a locksmith shop was recently robbed.

And that's the tale of how my neighbour got arrested, where's the punchline? They forgot to get protected glass, so the police planned a raid and broke their windows.

During early industrial times, a lot of British engineers went to China to start up new businesses there, because of their low taxation rates. Because of this huge increase in migration, the Chinese government invested in the proper translation of the English language for its civilians. There was a special professor recruited to teach the Chinese businessleaders English, called Jao Long, but he secretly despised the English men, since they had taken so many engineering jobs from the Chinese engineers. So, he decided to take matters into his own hands

*class lets out a collective ooooh*

Professor: During the following decade, mister Long pulled out a big stunt. Every single student that was thaught how to translate from Chinese to English learned that the Latin alphabet only had 25 letters, he replaced one of the original 26 letters by another letter in every single sentence he wrote. 

*the class lets out another ooooh*

Professor, pointing at one of the students: You there, would you like to guess which letter it was? 

Student, confidently: I believe it's the letter C

The professor is shocked. He thought that no one knew about this, yet this student guessed it on the first try. It isn't even on Wikipedia. How is this possible? 

Professor: How did you know that the letter C was replaced by K's? 

Student: It's right here in the powerpoint, professor

The class laughs. The professor had accidentally skipped to the next slide on his powerpoint, revealing the answer on the screen:

Billy's mom had left right after his birth and his dad did his best to raise him right and prepare him for the world. As Billy is getting ready to start kindergarten his dad thinks the best way to get him to do good in school is to bribe him. They're sitting in the car outside of school

Dad ""Billy I want you to do your best in school. If you go the whole year without getting in trouble and do good on your school work I will buy you whatever you want as a reward"". 

Billy ""I'll do my best dad"".

The school year ends and Billy's teachers had nothing but great things to say about him. He didn't get in trouble with other students, never argued about naptimes, and was all around a model student. So Billy's dad honors his offer to buy him whatever he wanted. 

Billy ""I just want a green golf ball""

Dad ""are you sure? I'll buy anything you want""

Billy ""that's it""

So his dad went ahead and bought Billy his green golf ball and gave it to him that night. 

Dad ""what are you going to do with it""?

Billy ""don't worry about it""

His dad wanted to argue back with him about being disrespectful to people but decided against it and thought that he couldn't really get in trouble with a single green golf ball and pushed the thought out of his mind. The summer goes by and the school year is getting ready to start so Billy's dad makes him another offer. 

Dad ""I'll make you another offer. This one will be a little bit harder to achieve but I think you can do it. If you get straight A's all through grade school I will buy you whatever you want for a reward. But it has to be all six years.""

Billy ""alright dad sounds good""

So Billy goes though all of grade school with the highest marks you can get. He even gets extra credit even though he doesn't need it. At the end of his final year in grade school his dad takes him out for a celebratory dinner. As they finish eating his dad mentions the deal again

Dad ""you did better than I hoped for Billy and I'm so proud of you. If you're ready to tell me what you want for your reward I can buy it for you tonight""

Billy ""this time I want 100 green golf balls""

Dad ""are you sure? I'll buy you anything you want. I'll get you that mountain bike that you like. Or I'll throw a pizza party for all your friends. I'll even get you a dog if you want.""

Billy ""no I just want the green golf balls""

Dad ""ok if you're sure that's what you want""

So his dad gets him the golf balls that night and they drive home. The next day his dad is helping Billy clean his room and he can't spot a single green golf ball. He finds it weird because Billy didn't go anywhere once they got home last night. 

Dad ""Billy what did you do with all those golf balls""

Billy ""don't worry about it dad""

Dad ""you need to tell me what you're up to""

Billy ""I'm sorry dad but I can't""

His dad wanted to argue again but he trusts his son and doesn't want to upset him. Again her pushes the thought from his mind. Summer ends again and on the way to school his dad makes the same deal

Dad ""Billy if you get straight A's though Junior high I will buy you whatever you want for a reward"" 

Billy ""ok dad sounds good""

Again Billy does wonderfully in school. He's starting to separate himself from the rest of the class with his outstanding school work. He gets straight A's both years. Again Billy's dad takes him out for a celebratory dinner and asks him what he wants for his reward.

Billy ""I want 1000 green golf balls""

Dad ""again with the green golf balls? You'll be turning 16 soon. I can start saving up for a car if you like""

Billy ""no I want the green golf balls""

Dad ""ok but seriously what are you doing with those green golf balls""

Billy ""I can't tell you and please stop asking""

His dad was starting to get annoyed that Billy was being so secretive about them but again he didn't want to push the issue. So he bought Billy his 1000 green golf balls and gave them to him. He really wanted to know what he was doing though so he started to pay more attention to Billy when he was around but he never saw a single green golf ball once he gave them to Billy. It drove him mad. So the summer ends and Billy is getting ready to start high school. On the way there his dad gives him the same offer and Billy accepts. Billy again does great in school. He gets into all the honors classes and advanced classes. He doesn't miss a single day of school and graduates valedictorian and gets a full ride scholarship to an ivy league school. At dinner his dad asks him what he wants and has a pretty good idea of what the answer is.

Billy ""I want 10,000 green golf balls""

His dad doesn't argue or try to dissuade him. He gets the green golf balls and moves on with his life. So summer ends and Billy's dad is driving him to college. When they get to his dorm room his dad can't help but feel proud at his son. 

Dad ""Billy you've done better then I had hoped for. You're the smartest person I know and I know you'll do great things in life. I know you don't need my help anymore but I'm going to give you a little more incentive to go good in college. I'll give you the same deal. You get straight A's and I'll buy you whatever you want."" 

Billy ""ok dad sounds good. Thanks""

Again Billy does better than everyone else in school. He graduates with honors and as magna cum laude. He even gets accepted into the best medical school in the world. His dad is happier than he's ever been. At his dinner that night his dad asks Billy what he wants.

Billy ""I want 100,000 green golf balls""

Dad ""again with the green golf balls? I will buy you whatever you want. I'll pay for a summer in Europe. I'll pay for your apartment. I'll buy you a brand new car. Anything you want""

Billy ""just the green golf balls"" 

So his dad gives up on the matter and gets him the green golf balls. Again he's going crazy trying to figure out what Billy is doing with all these green golf balls but can never catch him. He goes all summer and gets nothing. So the summer ends and Billy is going to medical school. His dad offers the same deal and Billy accepts. Again Billy does awesome in school. Still gets the best grades and was ranked 1st in his class. After graduation Billy and his dad go out for dinner and his dad asks him what he wants.

Billy ""I want 1,000,000 green golf balls"" 

Again his dad wants to know why and what he does with them

Dad ""what are you doing with all these green golf balls""

Billy ""don't worry about it""

The way Billy said that made it clear he was upset that his dad kept asking him. So his dad again pushed the matter from his mind and went about his business. 

A few years go by and it turns out Billy was sick. They were trying everything they could to help him but nothing was working. Billy's dad spent as much time with him as he could at the hospital. They would sit there and talk for hours on end.

Billy ""I'm getting tired dad I think I'm going to try and get some sleep"" 

Dad ""ok son I'll let you rest and I'll be back in the morning"" 

Both knew though that this would be the last time they would see each other. As his dad got to the door he turned around to face Billy

Dad ""I know it's none of my business but I have to know son. I just have to. What did you do with all those green golf balls bought you""

Billy ""well there's no sense in not telling you now. I...."" 

And Billy died",Billy and his green golf balls,2

It's a delicious savoury scent wafting up the stairs - his wife's wonderful cheese scones which he hasn't tasted in years, a wonderful tang of sharp Cheddar humming musically with a hint of paprika. And if anything could bring a man back from the dead...

He feels the tingle of returning circulation in his fingers and toes, and with trembling hands he pushes the blankets aside and swings his feet to the floor. At first faltering, his steps become increasingly assured as he makes his way to the stairs and down to the kitchen. There, on the cooling rack, are two dozen fresh-baked cheese scones, deliciously hot and steaming slightly, while his wife is bent over preparing a second batch for the oven.  

With faltering hands he reaches out for one of the cheese scones...  

And his wife, without turning around, raps his knuckles with the wooden spoon and snaps ""Get off - they're for the funeral"".",An old man is lying on his deathbed.,4

Wearing his bright red shirt, the captain exhorted his crew to fight.  So inspiring was he, in fact, that the pirate ship was repelled without casualties.  

A few days later, the ship was again approached, this time by two pirate sloops!  

""Captain, captain, what should we do?""

""First mate, bring me my red shirt!""

The crew, emboldened by their fearless captain, fought heroically, and managed to defeat both boarding parties, though they took many casualties.  That night, the survivors had a great celebration.  The first mate asked the captain the secret of his bright red shirt. 

""It's simple, first mate.  If I am wounded, the blood does not show, and the crew continues to fight without fear.""

A week passed, and they were nearing their home port, when suddenly the lookout cried that ten ships of the enemy's armada were approaching!
