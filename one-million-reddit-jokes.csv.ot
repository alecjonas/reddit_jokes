She was old, and one day she passed away. Saddened, but wanting another cow to give his family milk he sought out another cow in the local paper.

He found a listing from a dairy farmer in North Dakota a few hours away, and made arrangements to go and see the farmer. Upon arriving he was greeted by the owner, who took him out to the barn to inspect the cows he had for sale. Our farmer was impressed by the size of the cows, and the owner encouraged him to pull up a stool and pale to milk one of the cows and taste for himself.

And so he grabbed the stool, the pale, and sat down to milk. When he grabbed the teat and pulled, the cow farted. Again he pulled on another teat and the cow farted.

Looking up at the owner with a slightly alarmed look, and trying to hold back a smile, the owner simply said, ""Ah, don't worry about that. They all do that.""

And so, not thinking any more about it, and satisfied with the milk, he bought the cow and loaded her up for the trip home. All week long he bragged at the feed store, and even on Sunday at church about the delicious milk his new cow was making.

Curious, his neighbor came by the next day to see the cow. The farmer brought him into the barn and handed him a stool and pale, told him to sit and milk the cow for some fresh milk. 

He grabbed the teat, pulled, and the cow let out a loud but low release of methane, and held that note for several seconds. Intrigued, he pulled another teat, and the same thing happened. He pulled a third time and the cow let out another long, low, fart.

Distracted from the milk now, he stands up, and says to the farmer in a matter-of-fact way, ""You got this cow in North Dakota didn't you?""

The farmer, having expected the man to say something about the cow's flatulence, was surprised to hear his neighbor ask this question. He replied, ""Why... yes. I did. I bought her from another dairy farmer several hours away from here, but... just how did you know that?""

His neighbor replied, ""My wife's from North Dakota.""",North Dakota,7

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors
and the value of the products increases as the shopper ascends the flights.

The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor
or may choose to go up to the next floor but you cannot go
back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband.

On the first floor the sign on the door reads: **Floor 1**- These
men Have Jobs

She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads: **Floor 2** - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.

'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.'

So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads: **Floor 3** - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good
Looking.

'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads: **Floor 4** - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'

Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads: **Floor 5** - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads: **Floor 6** - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

PLEASE NOTE:

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.

The First floor has wives that love sex.

The Second floor has wives that love sex, have money and like beer.

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.",A store that sells new husbands has opened where a woman may go to choose a husband.,163

No one wants him to leave because he is so popular.

Saul Cohen, a successful businessman and lawyer, stands and says, ""If the rabbi will stay on here, I’ll personally double his salary and establish a foundation to guarantee a free college education for his children!”

More sighs and loud applause.

Estelle Rubin, age 88, stands and announces with a smile: ""If the Rabbi stays, I will give him sex.""There is total silence.

The rabbi, blushing, asks her: ""Mrs. Rubin, you’re a wonderful and holy lady. Whatever possessed you to say that?”

You know the story, after a couple of years they’re both feeling horny.  Frank says to the Mike “sorry buddy there’s no way you and me are ever going down that road.  Tell you what there’s a bunch of apes over the other side of the island – what say we grab on of the females and have our way with her.”  Mike thinks about if for a while. “An ape??  Nope too ugly, it’s  never going to happen” says Mike.

Anyway, a year passes and Mike can’t take it anymore.  “C’mon Frank we’re grabbing one of those apes!”  Blah blah blah they capture an ape, bring her back and tie her down.  “Gawd shes ugly,” whines Mike.

Frank grabs a paper bag and puts it over the apes head.  “There, how’s that?”

Mike is impressed - he rips off his clothes and jumps on the ape and starts going for it.  After a little while the ape starts getting into it as well.  All of a sudden she breaks free of the ropes, grabs Mike and throws him to the ground and mounts him.

“Get it off!! Get it off!!” yells Mike.  “Huh?” Says Frank in all the commotion.  “Get the paper bag off! I wanna kiss her!!!!”

She removes her clothes puts on the gown provided. After a few minutes an older lady walks in and greets her
Doc: hello I'm doctor cockandballs, and I'll be doing your examination today
The examination begins and after a few minutes the doctor asks the patient to remove her shirt.
When the patient removes her gown she reveals she has gotten pierced nipples.
Doc: now I don't mean to make you uncomfortable but I have to ask about you're nipple piercing. Any redness, swelling infection?
Patient: no, none of that but I do have to admit it's a little embarrassing coming into a doctors office with pierced nipples
Doc: don't worry, as long as you don't do anything unhealthy I don't care. In fact between us ladies, I too thought about having my nipples pierced. I wouldn't cast judgment upon anyone who made a decision for their own happiness.
Patient: wow, I would think an older, professional women like yourself would have more conservative views on stuff like that. Did you think about getting your nipples pierced when you were younger?
Doc: No, actually it was only a couple of years ago...instead I got implants and chopped off my dick

I know explaining jokes usually ruins them but when you first read this you might chuckle about how a women at the doctor, insecure about something as trivial as nipple piercings discovers her doctor is actually a transvestite. But the joke is actually just about how a women could never become a doctor.

He lived in the rural areas and LOVED tractors. Big ones, small ones, long ones, short ones, red ones, green ones, grey ones, you name it. He was also a member of the Tractor Society, which would put out a magazine every month.

It was called ""Tractor monthly"" and boy, did he adore it. He would have a mini party every time it came out; champagne, cigars and all. It had information on the top-end vehicles that graced the English countryside with pride. But what he loved most was that at the back, there were huge posters of tractors that he would take out and put on his wall.

It was the day that his favourite magazine would publish another issue. He sat on his tractor-shaped chair, just waiting for it to slip through the letterbox, and it did. He lit a cigar and popped open his Moet and Chandon, then grabbed it. He flicked through the pages, and to his absolute disgust, the posters were gone! He called up the publishing company to file a complaint, but was told that they had cancelled the posters due to budget cuts.

Distraught, Paul went into a fit of rage. He put up all his model tractors for sale, ripped down all his posters and went outside with an axe, about to destroy his most prized possession- his 1969 John Deere- when he thought that just for all times sake, he would take the old girl for a final ride. 

He rode it to the local pub to drown out his sorrows with lager and ale. He drank and drank, and it seemed to help. But then something horrible happened. The whole place caught on fire. Everyone else ran around, trying to get out as the building filled up with smoke. Paul took a last sip of his beverage and inhaled all of the smoke. He then blew it all out of the window. One person, clearly amazed, said:

""How the hell did you do that?""

To which Paul replied,

""I'm an ex-tractor fan.""",The man who loved tractors,9

The officer ponders it shortly before nodding his head. Then, he says, ""Prove to you the difference? Ugh. That's the kind of thing people say in shit jokes as an obvious set up to a lazy punchline.

""It stretches believability to think a cop would entertain such a question, to say nothing of having it phrased like that.

""You know who this joke appeals to? People who want to see the smug lawyer gets his comeuppance at the hands of the simple cop. I mean, talk about a complete abdication of your own moral authority.

He asks the clerk, “How much for that brass rat?”. The clerk says “Well sir, it’s 25 bucks just for the rat, and 50 bucks if you want to hear the story that goes with it. Take my word, you’ll want to *hear* the story.” The guy says “No, I believe I’ll just take the rat for 25 bucks.”

So, this fella takes his brass rat and heads down the street. Right away he notices that a *real* rat is following him, so he makes a quick turn down the next street. He passes an alley, at which point about a half-dozen rats come out and start following him. This guy is getting pretty panicked at this point, so he starts heading out toward the outskirts of town. When he passes the town dump, *hundreds* of rats stream out and follow him. Our hero is beside himself at this point, so as he passes the river that winds around town, he tosses the brass rat right in the drink. Every last one of the real rats follows the brass rat into the river and drowns.

Relieved, our protagonist heads back to the antique store where he got the brass rat. “I knew it!”, says the clerk, “You’re back to hear the story about the rat, aren’t you?”. “No sir”, says the guy, “I just wanted to find out how much you’re asking for that brass accordion I see you’ve got up there.”",Brass Rat,2

He eventually decided to see a Doctor.
 
The Doctor said, ""Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.""' 

Joe was shocked and depressed.He wondered if he had anything to live for. He had no choice but to go under the knife. The surgery cost him $15,000.

When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.   

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. 

He saw a Men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new Suit.' 

He entered the shop and told the salesman, ""I'd like a new Suit.""

The elderly Tailor eyed him briefly and said, ""Let's see...size 44 long""

Joe laughed, ""That's right, how did you know?""

""Been in the business 60 years!"" the tailor said. 

Joe tried on the suit and it fit perfectly. 

As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about a new shirt?""

Joe thought for a moment and then said, ""Sure.""

The salesman eyed Joe and said, ""Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.""

Joe was surprised, ""That's right, how did you know?"" 

""Been in the business 60 years.""

Joe tried the shirt and it fit perfectly. 

Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, ""How about some new Underwear?"" 

Joe thought for a moment and said, ""Sure...""

The salesman said, ""Let's see..... size 36""

Joe laughed, ""Ah ha! I got you! I've worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old...""

The companion will remind him of his limitations, so he will know that he is not always worthy of adoration.” And God created CAT to be a companion to Adam. And Cat would not obey Adam.

""And how?"" the mother asks on.
""I didn't ask that."" the son admits.
""Then go and do that!""
Another few minutes later, the son comes back and says, ""Rectally.""
""And what does that mean?"" she asks him, exasperated. 
Again, he shrugs. 
""Go. Back. Inside. And. Ask!"" the mother orders him.
And so the son goes, and comes back almost immediately. 
""Mom, now I think I made him angry. He told me I should take them and shove them up my arse.""",A mother takes her little son to the doctor for a check-up.,35

Little Johnny was waving his arm higher than all the other kids. She didn't want to call on him, because he was a pervert and always said dirty things.

She called on Betty instead. Betty stood up and said ""Apple"".

""Very good, Betty! Next is the letter 'B' ."" Again, Little Johnny was waving his arm as high as he could, but she picked Andy instead.

""Butterfly.""

""Excellent, Andy! How about 'C' ."" Little Johnny was almost having a seizure he was waving so hard. The teacher picked Billy, still afraid of what Little Johnny would say.

""Caterpillar.""

""Great job, Billy!""

She continued going through the alphabet, never calling on Little Johnny. When she got to 'R', Little Johnny was the only child waving his arm. She thought to herself and couldn't think of anything too bad that started with 'R' so she said, ""OK Johnny, give me a word that starts with 'R' .""

Little Johnny stood up straight, smiled and yelled,

The next day, the devil stops to check on them and sees them dressed in parkas, mittens and bomber hats, warming themselves around the fire. The devil asks them, ""What are you doing? Isn't it hot enough for you?""
The two guys reply, ""Well, you know, we're from Michigan, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy for a chance to warm up a bit, you know.""
The devil decides that these two aren't miserable enough and turns up the heat. The next morning, he stops by again and there they are, still dressed in their parkas, mittens and hats. The devil asks them again, ""It's awfully hot down here, can't you guys feel that?""
Again, the guys reply, ""Well, like we told you yesterday, we're from Michigan, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy to warm up a little bit, you know.""
The devil gets a little steamed up and he decides to fix the two guys. He cranks the heat up as high as it will go. The people are wailing and screaming everywhere. He stops by the room with the two guys from Michigan and finds them in light jackets and hats, grilling sausage and drinking beer. The devil is astonished. ""Everyone down here is in abject misery, and you seem to be enjoying yourselves.""
The two Michiganders reply, ""Well, ya know, we don't get too much warm weather up there in Michigan, we've just got to have a cookout when the weather is this nice.""
The devil is absolutely furious, he can hardly see straight. Finally, he comes up with an answer. These two love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. He decides to turn all the heat in hell off.
The next morning, the temperature is below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere, the people are shivering so bad, they are unable to wail, moan or gnash their teeth. The devil smiles and heads for the room with the 2 Michiganders. He finds them back in their parkas, mittens and hats. They are jumping up and down and cheering. The devil was dumbfounded. ""I don't understand. When I turn the heat up, you're happy. Now it's freezing cold, and you're happy. What is wrong with you two?""

Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

Then, he saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow. It was addressed, 'Dad'. With the worst premonition, he opened the envelope and read the letter, with trembling hands.

Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy. She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight Motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it!

Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

Love, your son, Joshua.

P.S . Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jason's house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table. Call when it is safe for me to come home!

 I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pants pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry &amp; that the food is nutritionally complete so I was going to try it again.
 I have to mention here that practically everyone in the line was by now enthralled with my story, particularly a guy who was behind her.

 Horrified, she asked if I'd ended up in the hospital in that condition because I had been poisoned. I told her no; it was because I'd been sitting in the street licking my balls and a car hit me.

St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.
The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.
'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'
'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'
St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.

They are in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings.

The teacher asks Mr. Trump if he would like to lead the discussion of the word “Tragedy.”  So he asks the class for an example of a tragedy.

One little boy stands up and offers: “If my best friend who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that would be a tragedy.”

“No,” says Mr. Trump, “that would be an accident.”

A little girl raises her hand: “If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.”

“I’m afraid not,” explains the exalted businessman. “That’s what we would call a great loss.”

The room goes silent. No other children volunteer.  Mr. Trump searches the room.

“Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?”

Finally at the back of the room, a boy raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: “If a private jet carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.”

“Fantastic!” exclaims Mr. Trump, “That’s absolutely right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?”

As he gets closer, he notices that the old man has extremely little head. Out of curiosity, he decides to strike up a conversation. 

""How's it going sir?""

""Good, how you doing?""

""Good. Well to be honest, I'm quite baffled by the proportions of your head. Were you born this way or is there a story behind it?""

The old man chuckles as he turns to look at the ocean with a half smile. 

""There is a story my friend, a long one but I'll make it short.""

He then stops and stares at the ocean again, this time with an intense look on his face. 

""I was a sailor that loved the oceans so much, I basically lived out at sea. One night, during a terrible storm, I don't remember exactly what happened, but I pretty much blacked out and woke up stranded on this very beach. I got up and instinctively looked for any signs of civilization when something out in the water caught my eye. It was a mermaid. I couldn't believe my eyes! I instantly tried to communicate with her, and as soon as she heard me, she started swimming towards me.""

""The mermaid then says, 'You are the first human being to ever see one of us in real life, so I'll grant you one wish, anything you'd like.' ""

The stranded sailor is overjoyed and says ""Okay, how about a little head?""

Memo to A New Priest

A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."" So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:

1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the Spook.
8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey, don't say,  ""He was stoned off his ass""
10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T.""
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, ""Take this and eat it for it is my body."" He did not say ""Eat me""
12. The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,""
13. The recommended grace before a meal is not: ""Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, yeah God.""
14. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St. Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St. Taffy's.",Memo to the new Priest,169
