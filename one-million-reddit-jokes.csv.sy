I was about twenty minutes early. 
I'd got the time of the train wrong. I suppose it is at least equally possible,""
he added after a moment's reflection, 
""that British Rail had got the time of the train wrong. Hadn't occurred to me before.""
             ""Get on with it."" Fenchurch laughed. 
""So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee.""
 	""You do the crossword?""
 ""Yes.""
 	""Which one?""
 ""The Guardian usually.""
 	""I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer The Times.  Did you solve it?"" 
""What?"" 
	""The crossword in The Guardian.""
 ""I haven't had a chance to look at it yet,"" said Arthur. ""I'm still trying to buy the coffee.""
 	""All right then. Buy the coffee."" 
""I'm buying it. I am also,"" said Arthur, ""buying some biscuits."" 
	""What sort?"" 
""Rich Tea."" 
	""Good choice.""
 ""I like them."" Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a table. And don't ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and I can't remember. It was probably round."" 
	""All right.""
 ""So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table, on my left, the newspaper, on my right, the cup of coffee, in the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits."" 
	""I see it perfectly.""
 ""What you don't see,"" said Arthur, ""because I haven't mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there opposite me."" 
	""What's he like?""
 ""Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn't look,"" said Arthur, ""as if he was about to do anything weird."" 
	""Ah. I know the type. What did he do?""
 ""He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and . . .""
 	""What?"" 
""Ate it.""
 	""What?""
 ""He ate it.""
 	Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment. ""What on earth did you do?"" 
""Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled,"" said Arthur, ""to ignore it.""
 	""What? Why?""
 ""Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for, is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience, or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits.""
	""Well, you could . . ."" Fenchurch thought about it. 
	""I must say I'm not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?""
""I stared furiously at the crossword,"" said Arthur, ""couldn't do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice,""
he added, ""that the packet was already mysteriously open. . . .""
	 ""But you're fighting back, taking a tough line.""
""After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit,"" said Arthur, 
""it stays eaten.""
	""So what did he do?""
""Took another one. Honestly,"" insisted Arthur, ""this is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground.""
 	Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably. 
""And the problem was,"" said Arthur, ""that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around. What do you say? 'Excuse me ...I couldn't help noticing, er . . .' 
Doesn't work. No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigor than previously.""
  	""My man .. ."" 
""Stared at the crossword again, still couldn't budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St. Crispin's Day . ."" 
 	 ""What?"" 
""I went into the breach again. I took,"" said Arthur, ""an-other biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met.""
 	 ""Like this?"" 
""Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you,"" said Arthur, 
""that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension building up over the table. At about this time.""
	 ""I can imagine.""”
""We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me . . .""
  	""The whole packet?"" 
""Well, it was only eight biscuits, but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time.""
   	""Gladiators,"" said Fenchurch,
	 ""would have had to do it in the sun. More physically gruelling."" 
""There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead between us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a sigh of relief, of course. 
""As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper . . ."" 
   	""Yes?"" 
""Were my biscuits."" 
   	""What?"" said Fenchurch. ""What?""
""True.""
 	  ""No!""

Throughout the first night, my parrot remained quiet, but the next morning, I awoke to a machine-gun sequence of swear words, rude insults, and some of the dirtiest jokes I had ever heard.  I was shocked, to say the least.  In an attempt to correct the parrot's behavior, I would read aloud children's books, play Bach and Beethoven over the speakers, and did everything I could to set a calm and relaxing atmosphere.  But it was to no avail.  The parrot remained relentlessly crass, rude, and now, it had even begun talking back and mocking me with every action I took, calling me names.  It was pushing my buttons.  Finally, I was at my last straw, and I began screaming back, trading swear words and scathing insults with this ungrateful excuse of a pet.  But in a sudden moment of clarity, I realized the ridiculousness of this situation and, immediately grabbing the bird by its neck,  placed it in the freezer, with the intent of killing it once and for all.  The parrot kicked and screamed for a good while before the kitchen grew eerily silent.  I slowly opened the freezer to check on my victim, when the parrot flies out calmly, landing on the counter.  The parrot looked up at me and said, ""I truly apologize for my behavior.  I realize now I may have been rude and insulting to you, and I will correct my attitude and my behavior from now on.""

The next day he goes to the tattoo parlor and gets her name tattooed on his erect penis. Afterwards, he goes home and waits for Wendy to get back from work.

He explains this to her, and she says ""show me tonight when we have sex, you'll be erect then."" He does, and she is ecstatic when she sees it. 

One day, the two are in a restaurant and Jimmy goes to use the bathroom. He starts peeing in the urinal, when something catches his eye. There is a large Jamaican man next to him, whose dick also says ""WY."" *Is Wendy cheating on me?* he thinks to himself. He decides to confront the man about it. 

He stops the man before he leaves the bathroom. ""Hey, uh, what does your tattoo say?"" Jimmy asks the Jamaican man.

Up first was Bernie Sanders. Being old and not used to exercising he struggled to get around, but finally posted a time of 12:30.

Next was Donald Trump. He trained his ass off for this and was sure he was going to be the fastest to run around The Whitehouse. He came across the line at a faster 10:30.

Hillary was not going to let Trump beat her. She took off and started hopping fences and trampling flowers in order for her to make sure she had the fastest time. She crossed the line at 9:30.

She walked up to Obama and said have you ever seen a faster time?

Dad said, ""Bring Belle over here.""

Annoyed, because she can't sleep, his wife goes to the vet to see if he can help. 

The vet tells the woman to tie a ribbon around the dog's testicles and he will stop snoring.

A few hours after going to bed, the dog is snoring as usual.
 
Finally, unable to sleep, she goes to the closet and grabs a piece of ribbon and ties it around the dog's testicles, and sure enough, the dog stops snoring. 

The woman is amazed!

Later that night, her husband returns home drunk from being out with his buddies. 

He climbs into bed, falls asleep, and begins snoring very loudly. 

The woman thinks maybe the ribbon will work on him. 

So she goes to the closet again, grabs a piece of ribbon, and ties it around her husband's testicles. 

Amazingly, it also works on him!

The woman sleeps very soundly.

The next morning, the husband wakes up very hung over.

He tumbles into the bathroom to urinate. 

As he is standing in front of the toilet, he looks in the mirror and sees a blue ribbon attached to his privates.

He is very confused, and, as he walks back into the bedroom, he notices a red ribbon attached to his dog's testicles.

Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her. “Before you get settled in” he said, “We have a little problem…you see, we’ve never had a HR manager make it this far before and we’re not really sure what to do with you.”

“Oh, I see,” said the woman, “can’t you just let me in?”

“Well, I’d like to,” said St Peter, “But I have higher orders. We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.”

“Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven”, said the woman. “Sorry, we have rules…” at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.


As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.

They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.

Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. “Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven,” he said.

So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. “So,” he said, “You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven”. “You must choose between the two.”

The woman thought for a second and replied: “Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.”

Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.

“I don’t understand,” stuttered the HR manager, “The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.”

The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, “Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.”",An HR manager was knocked down by a bus...,114

One of the girls saw a glint of light in the riverbank and went to it. She pulled up a golden lamp from the river, and when she was cleaning its surface, a puff of smoke came out and a genie soon stood before them.

The genie said, ""I will grant each of you a gift: Tell me what you wish to look like and it will be done.""

The three girls were a bit flustered for a while, but the one who found the lamp spoke out, ""I wish to look like Megan Fox."" A puff of smoke and boom! A girl resembling Megan Fox appeared. The girl looked at the river at her reflection and exclaimed, ""Wow! It's true! It's really true!""

The second girl, seeing that the genie was the real deal, said, ""I wish to look like that actress who played the young wife of Lord Edmure in the Game of Thrones TV series. The one in the Red Wedding."" A puff of smoke and boom! A girl resembling that actress appeared, and when she looked at her reflection in the river, she gasped, ""Wow! It worked! It really worked!""

Now, the third girl pondered a bit more on what she wants to look like, thinking back at all the TV shows and films she's watched and magazines she'd read. At last, she found a suitable actress, and she walked towards the genie and said, ""I wish to look like...""

But a stone caught her heel, and as she stumbled, she shouted, ""Shit!""",Three girls went hiking,4

The two men call it a day and decide to meet up again at the same place in a couple of days.

The next time they reach the park there is chaos and commotion at the politicians estate with police and ambulance on the scene, they ask what has happened and finds out that the politician had arrived home earlier then expected, found his wife with another man and shot them both dead on the spot.


After the older men had made their way to their regular spot one of them burst out and says:

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.
Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.
He made it out, but a single person died.
Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.
He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.
When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.
After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.
The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.
The man was perfectly fine.
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.
And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.
Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.
Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.
The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.
For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.
After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.
The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.
And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.
To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.
And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.
On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.
“You know what? No,” said the executioner. “I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.”
Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.
The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.
The executioner was speechless.
The man looked at the executioner and said “Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.”",There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.,17

""Peter!""

""Almighty father, what can I do for you?""

""Heaven is getting crowded, I need to buy some time while I expand.""

""What would you have me do?""

""Only allow those who died truly horrible deaths in, until I tell you otherwise.""

""Yes father.""

Shortly after the first man arrives at Heaven's Gate.

""To pass, you must tell me about your death.""

""Okay.  So I was like 100% sure my wife was cheating on me while I was at work.  So I decided to go home for lunch, which I never do, and sure as shit there she is naked in bed.  She had clearly been busy getting fucked, so I began searching for the guy.  I cant find him anywhere though, and we live on the tenth story so the only way in or out was through our front door.  I knew he had to be somewhere in the apartment, and I finally found him hanging from my balcony; naked!  I didn't even give him a chance to speak, I stomped on his hands till he fell.  Can you believe this asshole survived!  The bushes broke his fall.  So I push my refrigerator onto the balcony, and flip it over the edge.  As it was going over the power cord caught my foot and pulled me with it.  I hit the pavement,  and now I'm here.""

""Oh my, that is horrible.  Please come in.""

Just then, a second man arrives.

""To pass, you must tell me about your death.""

""Well, I lived in an eleventh story apartment.  I loved the view from my balcony, and I would often workout in the nude there.  I tripped over one of my weights and was flung over the railing, though I managed to grab hold of the balcony below.  Then the guy who lives there comes out just screaming at me, something about fucking his wife whom I've never even met.  Before I can explain, he stomps on my hands until I fall.  Somehow the bushes broke my fall, but then this asshole literally throws his refrigerator off the balcony at me.  At least I got to see that it pulled him over with it, hope he missed the bushes.  Anyways the fridge landed on me and now here I am.""

""Oh dear, I see.  Well that is just awful.  Welcome.""

The third arrival is now walking up to the gate.

""To pass, you must tell me about your death.""

""Hahaha.. okay.  So get this, I'm hiding in this refrigerator...""

On the bank of the stream was a bear. He sees the fish is distracted and says to himself, 'if that fly drops about 6 inches,  that fish will jump up, and ill grab the fish and have some lunch.'

50 yards away, a hunter, eating a cheese sandwhich,  sees the bear looking into the stream. He think, 'if that fly drops about 6 inches, the fish will jump up, and that bear will go after the fish, and ill shoot that bear for a nice trophy.'

Right behind the hunter is a mouse. Realizing what is happening,  he eagerly awaits.  'If that fly drops 6 inches, the fish will jump out of water, the bear will go after the fish, the hunter will go for the bear,  and leave his cheese sandwich unattended for me to eat some lunch.'

Behind the mouse lays a cat. He understands the situation.  He says, ' if that fly drops about 6 inches, the fish will jump after it, the bear will go for the fish, the hunter will shoot the bear, the mouse will eat the cheese sandwhich,  and while he is distracted, I'll catch him and have some lunch.'

As they all wait with anticipation,  a sudden movement happens. The fly drops 6 inches! The fish jumps after the fly. The bear nabs the fish. The hunter drops his cheese sandwich and readies his rifle. The mouse runs for the cheese. The cat pounces toward the mouse, but slips and ends up drenched in the river.

So, before moving here, the three of us agreed to always have three shots each wherever we move to. This way, we can always feel like we're together.""

The bartender found this to be very thoughtful and smiled. A couple weeks go by and the one night the regular purchases only two shots. The bartender immediately becomes upset and walks over to the man:

BT: ""Hey, I just wanted to say, I am sorry for your loss. I know the three of you were very close and I hope you're alright.""

Reg: ""What are you talking about?""

BT: ""Hmm? You told me you always got three shots so you and your two brothers always felt like you were together wherever you were. So when I saw you only get two shots and drink, I thought one of your brothers passed.""

Reg: ""Oh, no no no, my brothers are fine! I just decided to quit drinking!""",A regular always buys three shots every friday night then leaves.,26

The lizard climbs down the tree, walks thru the jungle to the river and leans over the river to get his drink. The lizard is so stoned that he leans too far over and falls into the river.

A Crocodile sees this and swims over to the lizard and helps him to the side, then asks the lizard, ""What's the matter with you?""

The lizard explains to the crocodile that he was sitting smoking a joint with a monkey in a tree, got too stoned and then fell into the river while taking a drink.

The crocodile says he has to check this out and walks into the jungle, finds the tree where the monkey is sitting, finishing a joint. He looks up and says ""Hey you!""

The nun warns him that his actions are offensive to God and she will be forced to take action if he exclaims again.

Sure enough the golfer attempts his third ball and misses yelling ""Fuck! I missed!""

The nun is furious and raises her arms up to the sky and begins a prayer: ""powerful and mighty God, strike down on this foul man that I once called a friend"" 

Moments later there is a flash and the nun is struck by 3 bolts of lightning.

The golfer looks up into the sky and hears a loud booming voice:

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:  
First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.  

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.  

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.  

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",I hate my job...,49
