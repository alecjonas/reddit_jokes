Jeff replied: ""Yeah, why?"" The homeless man, looking sinister replied ""Beware the man named John Avoh, he literally steals the creativity of other people!"" Jeff was taken by this.

post,8erim0,2qh72,jokes,false,1524638242,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8erim0/divorcee/,self.jokes,,"Heard this from a friend a couple years back... 

A man named Ted has recently been divorced. It was ugly; his wife got the dog, the nice house in the suburbs and the car, and Ted is forced to stay in a shitty motel in an even shittier part of town. Depressed and with nothing left to lose, Ted takes a walk one night to a dingy biker bar just down the road from his motel. 

Inside the bar it's dark and smells of vomit and stale beer. Men are laughing raucously and fighting at the drop of a hat. Ted walks nervously up to the bar and orders a lite beer. As he's drinking it, he sees a sign on the wall above the bar: 

Iron man challenge: finish and win $1000. 

Not feeling like much of an iron man, Ted ignores the sign and goes back to his beer. 

Fast forward a few hours and Ted's lost count of his beers and is feeling that wonderful mix of confidence and not-giving-a-fuck that drinking brings. So he asks the bartender, ""What's the iron man challenge?""

The bartender looks at Ted skeptically, but figures it might be worth a laugh and tells him, ""it's three parts: part one is to knock out Big Jim."" He points to an absolute tank of a man sitting in the corner surrounded by at least 15 empty beer bottles. 

""Part two is to get hold of my dog Roxeanne and pull her rotten tooth. She's had it for years and the last vet who tried lost a few fingers.""

""Part three is to go upstairs and have sex with Old Sheila. Sheila is 86 and doesn't shave or bathe anymore, no man has been able to get hard for her in years.""

Ted pauses for a second and decides he has nothing left to lose. He gets up and with a howl charges across the room. Just before he reaches Big Jim, he trips on a chair leg and flies forward, his beer glass smashing Jim right in the head. Jim slumps over, out cold. 

The bar explodes in cheers. Ted, his confidence bolstered, disappears from the bar room. Moments later come the sounds of growling barking and yelping like the patrons have never heard. After a few moments of silence, Ted re enters the bar, bloody and disheveled but looking proud. 

Once the cheers die down, Ted looks around with his chest puffed out and shouts, ""NOW WHERE'S THE BITCH WITH THE TOOTH?""",Divorcee,5

At one point the drunk notices her and asks:
- My lady, are you by any chance a gymnast?

Totally ruined the mood. 

Now, I didn't know Joseph THAT well, can't even remember where he was from, but let's just say I put my plans on hold since we had to run him to the ER. Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. 

Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend. Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could. 

In conclusion, if it hadn't been for Cotton Eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?

Right as they all began to despise each other, a magical genie lamp washed onto the shore. They rubbed it, and sure enough, out popped a genie. 

The genie looks at the three girls and says ""I can offer three total wishes. Since there are three of you, each of you gets one wish."" 

All three girls start carefully thinking about what to wish for when the red-head steps forward. 

""You know, I've been trapped on this island for years now. It's about time I've gotten back to my family. I miss my two little girls dearly.""

The genie looks at her, nods, and says: ""okay, in order to leave, you need to run one lap around the island. Once you make it all the way around, jump, yell what you want to turn into, and that's what you'll become.""

The red-head began to think. ""I must think of my favorite bird... I know! Owl!"" She runs around the island, jumps, screams ""owl!"", Turns into an owl and flies away. 

The brunette, watching her friend leave, gets a similar idea. ""I want to see the world. I'm tired of the same old beach and ocean."" 

The genie looks at her and says ""do the same thing as your friend. Run one lap around the island, jump, shout something to turn into, and that's what you'll become.""

“You seem nervous. Are you getting cold feet?” his grandfather asks.

“Grandpa, I’m not nervous about the wedding. I’m nervous about the wedding night. I was never able to have the talk about the birds and the bees with my father before he passed. I’m worried I won’t be able to satisfy my wife tonight.”

“Oh, that’s all? I can help with that. Follow these steps. When you go to bed, take off her clothes, lay her down gently, kiss her passionately for a while and when you’re both ready, your dick will be hard and her vagina will be wet. Just slide your dick between her legs and into her vagina. Pump it a few times. You probably won’t last longer than that if it’s your first time. Simple as that.”

“Take off her clothes, lay her down gently, kiss her passionately, put my dick into her vagina, pump three times. That’s a lot to remember. I just feel like I’m going to do something wrong. I don’t want to screw up our first time together.”

“I’ll tell you what. I’ll sneak up to your room before you get there and hide in the walk-in closet. If things aren’t working out or you need some pointers, just come see me and we’ll work it out.”

Feeling more confident knowing he has some support, the young man goes off and gets married. After the reception, he brings his new wife up to the honeymoon suite. She tells him she’s going to slip into something more comfortable and heads to the bathroom. 

Feeling his nerves coming back, he checks to see if his grandfather is in the closet. He is. So they review the steps one more time before he goes back to the bed. Take off her clothes, lay her down gently, kiss her passionately, put my dick into her vagina, pump three times.

His wife comes out dressed in sheer lingerie and the young man gets excited. He tells her since she’s changed he might as well do the same and goes to the bathroom. 

While she waits, the young bride feels her stomach rumbling. Not wanting to ruin the mood by rushing her husband out of the bathroom so she can take a dump, she looks around for another option. She finds a shoebox near the bed and quickly decides to do her business in it. She finishes up, covers it, and tucks it up against her side of the bed.

The young man returns in nothing but his boxers. He sees his wife standing at the foot of the bed. He’s nervous, but she’s so sexy in her lingerie he shakes it off and gets to it. He’s thinking about the plan the entire time. He slides the lingerie off her body and it falls to the floor. He picks her up and carries her to her side of the bed and lays her down gently. He drops his boxers and prepares to get on top of her. He puts one knee on the bed and steadies himself with another still on the ground. As he leans in to start kissing her his foot lands on the shoebox and, feeling something squish, looks down to his foot. 

“Ugh, there’s shit in there!”

Then a voice from the closet yells, “Damn it, turn her over boy!”",A young man learns about the birds and the bees on his wedding day.,65

He looked at his hand to find white paint on his fingers and got a brilliant idea. Tyrone rubbed his hands up and down the fence and slathered his face and body with white paint.

People immediately treated Tyrone better. As he arrived at school, the janitor was dressed in a tuxedo and opened the door for him. During class, the teacher was impressed with how smart and well-behaved he was. Even when he got the wrong answer, he didn't get in trouble - he just got another chance! At lunch, he got to actually eat, rather than wear, his food and he even sat at the ""cool kids"" table. At recess, he was picked first for tennis doubles and a new friend set him up with an internship at his dad's wall street brokerage. Tyrone was only 10! It was unequivocally the best day of school ever. 

As he skipped home, Tyrone sang and snapped his fingers in rhythm: ""IIIIIIIII's white! IIIIIIIII's White! Heavens to Betsy, mamma IIIIIIIII's white"". Cars stopped to let him cross the street, and not just so they could honk when he was right in front of them. Sophisticated folks tipped their fancy hats and said ""howdy"". Nobody yelled insults from passing cars or spit in his face. And the old man at the soda shop offered him a free ice cream sunday! By the time Tyrone got home, he was delirious with joy and boldly singing ""I's white! I's White! All you motherfuckers suck it. I's white"".

Tyrone's sister was outside the house and the first to see him. ""oooh boy, you done it now. Don't you know you's black and black's beautiful? If you don't wash yourself up quick, you're in for an ass-whoopin. I gotta see this!""

Tyrone's jubilation was a little tempered from this, but his sister was a bitch and he wasn't about to let it ruin his day. He walked into the house singing a little softer ""I's white. I's white. Life is sweet as peaches now cuz I's white"". 

His mamma caught a glimpse of him through the kitchen door. ""Boy, what you gone done paint yo'sef up white for? You's black and black is beautiful. You better wash y'sef up before your papa comes home and whoops some sense into you.""

Tyrone's sister snickered as Tyrone hung his head a little lower and headed into the living room still singing softly: ""I's white! I's White. nothin you can do 'bout it, I's white"".  

Then his brother saw him. ""Boy you look a damn fool all covered up in white paint. You's black and black is beautiful. You in for a beatin' if you don't wash up before Papa sees!""

Tyrone was feeling pretty bad at this point and kinda mumble-singing ""I's white. I's White. you fuckers gon' get it now cuz I's White"" as he headed toward the stairs. Just then, his father walked in the front door.

""Tyrone!! What you gone done paint yourself up white for?! huh?!! You's black and black is beautiful. You have till I get my belt off to wash up and then you still in for a beatin!""

Tyrone ran to the top of the stairs, tears streaming down his face, and turned around to see his mamma, arms akimbo and stone-faced; his papa, pulling his belt from his pants; his brother, arms crossed and head down, but with a disapproving sidelong glance; and his sister, doing everything she can to keep from laughing. Fury welling up inside of him, Tyrone screamed down at them ""I ain't been white but six hours and I already hate you n****s.","Dreading another day of being teased and bullied at school, Tyrone was trudging along the sidewalk,",4

""Please San Pedro, if my team won this match, I swear I will give you $100"". 
 
And because his team is very good, they usually win every match, and the man always fulfill his word and bring the $100 and leave it on the statue's feet. 
 
This behavior was very strange for the priest, but because it was economically helpful for the church, he didn't stop him. 
 
But then, his team started to play badly, and they lost every match. Regardless, the man continued going to the church and asking Saint Peter for his team's victory. 
 
And then the worst moment for his team arrived. If they lose this match, they will descend to the secondary league. And the man was very upset with Saint Peter. So the next day he went to the church completely drunk and threatened Saint Peter. 
 
""Hear me out, San Pedro, if you don't make my team win, I swear to God I'm going to destroy you with a hammer, and I'm not going to stop until making dust of every piece of you"" 
 
The priest heard this and was very scared, but he was confident the team will win.

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Easily my favorite joke of all time: Dave,7107

First of all, you need to know that my 52 year old hubby caters to no one, he doesn’t smile much and is one of the most antisocial people I know. I, on the other hand, will talk your ear off. We’ll call my husband Jack. 
Year before last I was having surgeries just right and left. It was a horrible time. I had just had my third surgery of the year on my left knee. My son and his wife decided to cheer me up by buying me this teeny tiny pup. Everyone fell in love. I was mostly immobile because of the surgery so she laid in my lap, Jack would come home and the pup would be in his lap. My niece would come and the puppy would be with her. 
Then I developed these really weird rashes. On my arms, on my torso, neck..everywhere. Thought it was an allergic reaction to the pain meds I was on from the surgery. Then the pup starts looking funny. Like a baby bird almost. I got pissed because Mr Antisocial wouldn’t go with me to take her to the vet. He was tired and the more I hobbled, the madder I got. It’s on a Saturday so they are closing soon. We get there  and I am fuming. The vet looks at the pup and says “she has the mange, I’m going to take some skin scrapings and we’ll know what kind”. Oh God, now what??  He scrapes her stomach and the places with no hair. He comes back and tells me she has sarcoptic mange. Which is mites. Like scabies. Only the mites cannot live on the human body, they will infest your body, but then die (which is still flipping gross) The vet notices the rash on my neck. Yes, I have the sarcoptic mange, too. The vet says I need to go to my family doc or the ER ASAP. Puppy has to be in quarantine for a minimum of 12 weeks, which is hard on her, me and my other dog. The pup was crated in a huge pen in my den. Bathed 3-4 times a week. 
I call my mom, my niece is also infected. She is calling the pediatrician. I call Jack and ask him if he’ll take me to the ER. He would rather not, the ball game just came on. Now I am beyond pissed. I bring the pup home, I’m crying, hobbling, snotting but I was not going to let him see. I leave for the hospital and my mom calls, the pediatrician says my niece and I can be treated with hydrocortisone and Benadryl. (That’s a lie, that crap is bad, I finally had to go and get a prescription later that week).  I am still angry that he’s not really worried and I’m driving with a knee that I can’t bend. He doesn’t know I don’t have to go to the ER. So I go to my mothers. Fuming. My mom tells me I should tell him he has to come to the hospital and be treated (payback is a bitch at times). I called him and I told him I needed him to come to the hospital. That because we all held the dog we all have to be treated for the mange. I hear his recliner being lowered. He says “WHAT exactly is the treatment”   Me: “Well honey, we won’t know until they do the scrapings and check them in the microscope. “
“What do you mean, scraping?  I don’t have a rash, I don’t need to be treated” he says. Me: “Sorry but you have to, you could reinfect all of us (which is a lie, the mites die and can’t be passed person to person). It will only take a minute, they’ve already scraped my privates, it only bleeds a little, they only have to scrape your testicles and penis since she only laid in your lap.  It’s just like having crabs. The cream will clear it up in a couple of days”. Silence. My mother is rolling, I’m fixing to pee. I thought I was going to pass out. Still silence and I said “Jack, are you there? How long before you’ll be here?”  And I hear the most god awful string of words, it was bad. And then he says angrily “I’ll be damned if anyone will be scraping my junk. I’ll do without.  You just need to get what you need and come home because I’m not coming over there”. At that point I’m laughing so hard I had to tell him. 
He was so mad he wouldn’t speak to me for days. ",A true practical joke.,0
post,8ehn0l,2qh72,jokes,false,1524542407,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8ehn0l/the_irish_square_testicals/,self.jokes,,"An elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with a purse full of money. She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money.


After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office.

 
The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'.

 
The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money . The elderly woman replied that she made bets.
 

The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?'
 

The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $10,000 that your testicles are square.'

 
The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.           


The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?'


'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $10,000 that my testicles are not square.'

 
'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 
 

'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently.


That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.


The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $10,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square


The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.


The president was happy to oblige.
 

The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked    the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.'


The elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock this morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland '",The Irish Square testicals,1880

Certain the bear is dead the man lowers his rifle, whereupon the bear jumps up, grabs the man, fucks him in the ass and leaves him to die.

The man is found again by the rangers, and taken home to recover.

Another week passes and the man is downright furious. He forgoes his rifle grabs a large huntin’ knife and goes after the bear again.

He finds the farmer, who is sitting on his porch. ""Hey, did you see that chicken? It was running at over 200km/h!""

The farmer tells him that he has bred these new chickens to have three legs, because, as you all know, the best bit of the chicken is the drumstick. The farmer explains that if chickens had three drumsticks, they'd sell for more. However, a side-effect seems to have been that the third leg makes them run incredibly fast!

The brunette leans over the edge to look down and the firemen start shouting “Jump! Jump! Jump!”

So the brunette takes a deep breath and jumps off the roof. Just before the brunette lands on the tarp, the firemen move out of the way. *SPLAT*

The two women look over in horror and see what had happened. The firemen yell back up to the women “cmon jump! Jump! Jump!”

The redhead leans over and says “No way! You’re gonna move again!” The firemen reassure her they won’t, so she takes a deep breath then jumps.

Sure enough, the firemen move again and *SPLAT* the redhead hits the pavement.

The firemen again scream up for the blonde to jump. “Jump! Jump! Jump!” but the blonde knows better by now though.

“No way, this time put the tarp down and THEN I’ll jump.”

The man is stripped of his job for 5 years until he is proven worthy again. Once he finally has his job back due to a shortage of staff, he rides the rails for another 5 years. Until one day, the train the man is on derails at a train station and explodes, killing everyone at the station and on the train, except him. 

The police finally take him in, and seeing all the deaths on his hands, decide to execute him. The strap him in the electric chair and turn the voltage up. The man doesn’t die and simply looks around confused. The sheriff, being devoutly Catholic takes it as a sign of god, and gives the man life in prison instead.

After 2 years in prison, the previous sheriff was fired, and a new one put in his place. This sheriff’s brother was killed in the train station incident, and his first order was to put the man to death. They take him in and strap him in the electric chair. They crank the voltage high enough to kill an elephant, but the man shows no reaction. 

“What’s wrong with you? Why won’t you die?” Shouts the sheriff angrily 

“I don’t know” the man replied “I guess I’m just a bad conductor”

A pathologist examined the birds, and to everyone's relief, it was not bird flu. The cause of death seem to be from vehicular impact. During analysis it was noted that many of the crows had various colors of paint on their claws and beaks. Testing of these paints found that 98% of the birds were killed by impact with motorbikes, while the other 2% were impacted by cars. The agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine why there was such a large difference in the number of crows killed by motorcycles compared to that of cars. The behaviorist discovered that when crows eat road-kill, they always have a look out bird to warn of incoming danger. Further research revealed the real reason the birds were dying. It seems that, while all the look out birds could shout ""Cah!"", not a single one could shout ""Bike!""",A study of avian deaths on California highways.,5

""What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!"", he said to himself.

As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. He turned to look. He saw a 7-foot grizzly charge towards him. 

He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing.

He ran even faster, so scared that tears were coming to his eyes. He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. His heart was pumping frantically and he tried to run even faster. He tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up but saw the bear right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him.

At that instant the Atheist cried out ""Oh my God!...."" 

Time stopped. The bear froze. The forest was silent. Even the river stopped moving.

As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky, ""You deny my existence for all of these years; teach others I don't exist; and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer?""

The atheist looked directly into the light ""It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask You to treat me as Christian now, but perhaps could you make the bear a Christian?""

""Very well,"" said the voice. The light went out. The river ran again. And the sounds of the forest resumed. And then the bear dropped his right paw ..... brought both paws together...bowed his head and spoke:
""Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful...AMEN!""",An atheist was taking a walk...,309

post,8e9r4q,2qh72,jokes,false,1524469354,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8e9r4q/a_baked_bean_lover/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked beans. He loved them, but they always had an embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction on him. 

One day, he met a girl and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry, he thought to himself, ""She'll never go through with the marriage with me carrying on like this,"" so he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. 

Shortly after that they were married. 

A few months later, on the way home from work, his car broke down and since they lived in the country, he called his wife and told her that he would be late because he had to walk. On his way home, he passed a small cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him. 

Since he still had several miles to walk, he figured he could walk off any ill effects before he got home. So he went in and ordered, and before leaving, had three extra large helpings of baked beans. All the way home he farted. By the time he arrived home, he felt reasonably safe. 

His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited. She exclaimed, ""Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!"" 

She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the table and made him promise not to peek. 

At this point, he was beginning to feel another one coming on. Just as his wife was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She again made him promise not to peek until she returned, and away she went to answer the phone. While she was gone, he seized the opportunity. He shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was not only loud, but as stinky as a rotten egg. He had a hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about him. 

He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on. He raised his leg and RRIIIPPPP! It sounded like a diesel engine revving, and smelled worse. To keep from gagging, he tried fanning his arms a while, hoping the smell would dissipate. He got another urge. This was a real blue ribbon winner-the windows shook, the dishes on the table rattled, and a minute later, the flowers on the table were dead. 

While keeping an ear tuned in on the conversation in the hallway, and keeping his promise of staying blindfolded, he carried on like this for the next 10 minutes, farting and fanning each time with his napkin. When he heard the phone farewells, he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it. Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of innocence when his wife walked in. 

Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner table. After assuring her he had not peeked, she removed the blindfold and yelled, ""SURPRISE!"" 

To his shock and horror, there were 12 dinner guests seated around the table for his surprise birthday party.",A Baked Bean lover,56

Too shattered to play his usual role in this familiar ritual, he poured himself a shot of whiskey and headed off for a long hot soak in the bathtub, pursued by the predictable sarcastic remarks as he dragged himself up the stairs.

While he was in the bath, the phone rang. The wife answered and was told that her husband's client, James Wright, had been granted a stay of execution after all. Wright would not be hanged tonight.

Finally realizing what a terrible day he must have had, she decided to go upstairs and give him the good news.

As she opened the bathroom door, she was greeted by the sight of her husband, bent over naked, drying his legs and feet.

What!? are you sure honey? She nods. The man's heart begins racing and he breaks out in a sweat. He is so upset, he can't sleep at all that night.

The next day he goes off to work, but locks himself in his office. He takes the phone off the hook, cancels all his meetings and awaits the inevitable.

He stays at work past 5 because he feels secure there. He watches the hours tick by. Finally it is midnight and, drenched in sweat, he realizes he has cheated death. He drives home drenched in sweat and with all his nerves frazzled.

For all of your life you have been terribly mistreated by your fellow man and no fairness has come to you. You have faced harshness and harassment seldom seen and yet you have overcome such hardship and adversity with a strength of will and courage that is seldom seen in man and despite your faults, you have done more good for your brothers and sisters than you realize.

Wanting to get one for relatively cheap, the man began looking on Craigslist, and soon found a really inexpensive horse only a few miles away from him. 

When he arrived, he was astonished by the horse. It looked noble and strong, like out of a story book. He was in awe about how a horse like this could be so cheap.

He asked the owner why the horse was so cheap. The owner said, ""Well, we're a Christian family. We don't want to charge too much for this horse to get a nice home."" He continued, saying ""There is one thing, however. This horse 'operates' a little different than most. To get this horse to move, you need to say ""Praise the Lord!"" To get the horse to come to a halt, you need to say ""Amen!""

The man gladly took the horse home, and went to ride it.

""Now what were those words?"" Said the man.

""Hallelujah!"" Nothing. The horse didn't move.

""Peace to all good men!"" Nothing. 

""Praise the Lord!"" The horse immediately dashed, going incredibly fast. The man had to nearly hold on for dear life. He was having the time of his life.

He rode the horse for a while, through valleys and up to a mountain. As they approached the top of the mountain, however, the man realized he couldn't get the horse to stop. They were dangerously approaching the edge.

""Uh-oh, what were those words?"" Said the man.

""Hallelujah!"" Yelled the man, yet the horse kept galloping. 
 
""Glory to all!"" Nothing. The cliff appeared only meters away.

Finally, he remembered, at the last second.

""Amen!"" The horse stopped. 

The man was so thankful to have remembered the words, and in a sigh of relief, said ""Praise the Lord!""",The Christian Horse (long),19

The gruff old cowboy makes himself comfortable, and upon settling in, asks to the other patrons at the bar, “Who wants to hear a Blonde joke?”

The bartender, a butch, rough and tough woman, walks over to confront the cowboy and says, “Sir, I am inclined to excuse you, because I can see that you’re blind, but I must enlighten you to the fact that you have walked into a women only bar.”

The cowboy grunts heavily and then repeats his query, “Anybody want to hear a blonde joke?”

The bartender calmly continues explaining to the cowboy his current predicament:

“Sir, I’m the bartender, I’m 240 pounds, and I’m holding a shotgun. Plus I’m blonde. On you’re left is another woman, an ex marine, and she’s a blonde too. On you’re right is a women that used to be a professional wrestler, and she’s blonde. Now, sir, are you sure you still want to tell that joke?”

The cowboy grunts again and says, “Oh, well in that case I suppose not. I don’t want to have to explain it three times.”",An old blind cowboy is making his way to the bar...,28
