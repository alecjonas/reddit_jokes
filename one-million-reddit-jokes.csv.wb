He lost the shirt off his back, and had nothing left but a quarter and the second half of his round trip ticket. All he needed to do was somehow get to the airport, and then he'd be home-free. 
So he went out to the front of the casino where there was a cab waiting. He got in and explained his situation to the cabbie. He promised to send the driver money from home. He offered him his credit card numbers, his drivers license number, his address, etc... 
The cabbie said, ''If you don't have fifteen dollars, get the hell out of my cab!'' 
So the businessman was forced to hitchhike to the airport and was barely in time to catch his flight. 
 One year later the businessman, having worked long and hard to regain his financial success, returned to Vegas and this time he won big. Feeling pretty good about himself, he went out to the front of the casino to get a cab ride back to the airport. Well who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs, but his old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck. 
The businessman thought for a moment about how he could make the guy pay for his lack of charity, and he hit on a plan. 
 The businessman got in the first cab in the line, ''How much for a ride to the airport,'' he asked?
 ''Fifteen bucks,'' came the reply.
 ''And how much for you to give me a blowjob on the way?''
 ''What?! Get the hell out of my cab.'' 
The businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same questions, with the same result.
 When he got to his old friend at the back of the line, he got in and asked, ''How much for a ride to the airport?'' 
The cabbie replied, ''Fifteen bucks.'' 
The businessman said, ''OK,'' and off they went. Then, as they drove slowly past the long line of cabs, the businessman gave a big smile and thumbs up sign to each of the other drivers. ",The Cabbie,421

On the day of the triple execution, they are brought to be beheaded. The priest blesses the execution, saying all is done in God's name, and the King orders the three executed.

The mathematician is to be killed first, and the executioner gives him two options: would he like a hood on or off, and would he like to be face up or face down.

So the mathematician says ""Well, they all arrive at the equivalent state of beheading, so it's an arbitrary choice. I suppose I'll take no hood and face down, since it's the simplest solution.""

So they lock him into the guillotine, the executioner drops the blade... and it stops inches from his neck.

The priest exclaims ""It's a sign from God! This man is innocent! He must be let free!""

The King agrees, pardons the mathematician, and lets him go.

Next up to be killed is the physicist. He is given the same options: hood on or off; face up or face down.

So the physicist thinks, and says ""Well, I've spent my whole life looking up at the stars and studying them... but it's broad daylight. I will take the hood to make it dark like night, and face up towards the Heavens.""

So they lock him into the guillotine, the executioner drops the blade... and it stops inches from his neck.

The priest exclaims again ""It's a sign from God! This man is innocent! He must be let free!""

The King agrees, pardons the physicist, and lets him go.

Finally, it's the engineer's turn to face the guillotine. He's given the same options: hood on or off; face up or down.

The engineer ponders, and says ""I've spent my whole life studying machines and mechanical devices. If I am to be killed by the most efficient killing machine of all time, then I will look at its workings while I die! Hood off and face up!""

So they lock him into the guillotine, and the executioner is about to drop the blade, when the engineer exclaims: ""I see the problem!""","A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer are all found guilty of treason...",1005

There was a sign on the cage that said $50.00.

""Why so little,"" she asked the pet store owner.

The owner looked at her and said,
""Look, I should tell you first that this bird used to live in a house of Prostitution
and sometimes it says some pretty vulgar stuff.""

The woman thought about this, but decided
she had to have the bird any way.

She took it home and hung the bird's cage up
in her living room and waited for it to say something.

The bird looked around the room, then said..

""New house, new madam.""

The woman was a bit shocked at the implication,
but then thought ""that's really not so bad.""

When her 2 teenage daughters returned from school
the bird saw and said, 
 
""New house, new madam, new girls.""

The girls and the woman were a bit offended
but then began to laugh about the situation
considering how and where the parrot had been raised.

Moments later, the woman's husband Keith
came home from work.

The bird looked at him and said,

A tourist is visiting New York city for the first time and has come to the observation deck of the Empire state building, replete with bar. It must have been a Tuesday because the only other people there were the bartender and a stranger who was drinking quite heavily at the bar. 

After taking in the view and snapping some photographs the tourist orders a drink from the bartender and engages the stranger in small talk.

Eventually the stranger turns to the tourist and says ""You know, last week I discovered that if you jump from the top of this building, by the time you fall to the 10th floor, the winds around the building are so intense that they carry you around the building and back into the window."" 

Hearing this, the bartender just shakes his head disapprovingly while continuing to clean a glass. 

The tourist responds, ""What, are you nuts!? there is no way that is true!"" The Stranger says ""No, seriously it is absolutely true, and I'll prove it to you!"" He gets up from the bar, jumps over the balcony, and plummets towards the street below. When he passes the 10th floor, the high wind whips him around the building and back into the 10th floor window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar. He meets the Tourist, who looks quite astonished.

""You know, I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke."" Says the tourist. ""No, I'll prove it again,"" says the Strandger as he jumps over once more. Again just as he is hurtling toward the street, the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window. 

Once the stranger get's upstairs again the tourist is adamant that he must try this once in a lifetime experience for himself and insists that the stranger takes his camera to capture the event for his friends back home. The stranger agrees, and the tourist flings himself over the balcony! He rushes past the 12th floor, 11th, 10th...... 9th, 8th floors..... and hits the pavement with a huuuuge splat!

Back upstairs the bartender turns to the stranger and says: ""You know what Superman, you are a real asshole when you're drunk!""",Only joke I know.,41

Dear Son,
I am feeling pretty bad because it looks like I won’t be able to plant my potato garden this year. I hate to miss doing the garden because your mother always loved planting time. I’m just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. If you were here, all my troubles would be over. I know you would dig the plot for me, if you weren’t in prison.
Love,
Dad

 

Shortly, the old man received this telegram: ‘For Heaven’s sake, Dad, don’t dig up the garden!! That’s where I buried the GUNS!!’

At 4 a.m. the next morning, a dozen FBI agents and local police officers showed up and dug up the entire garden without finding any guns.

Confused, the old man wrote another note to his son telling him what had happened, and asked him what to do next.

His son’s reply was: ‘Go ahead and plant your potatoes, Dad. It’s the best I could do for you, from here.’

With every step the bull was gaining ground on the officer, and it seemed likely that he sure enough would get gored before he reached safety. The officer was clearly terrified.

I threw down my tools, ran for the fence, and yelled at the top of my lungs...

The first time, he was kidnapped by a villain and failed to escape in a badass way. He only survived because the agency sent a squad to arrest the villain. For his failure to escape on his own, he was demoted.

The second time, he accidentally shot two men on his own side during a raid of a meth lab. One died while the other survived. Again, he was demoted.

The third time, he was instructed to assassinate a man that was plotting to lace the earth's water supply with a mutant version of Viagra, which would cause everyone, including females, to get a raging boner. The plan was brilliant and flawless.

When Bond went to assassinate this man, he took out his pistol, aimed, and fired. 

He missed.

The villain was alerted by this and he immediately finished his plan by unleashing the Viagra into the world's water supply. He then disappeared to the Victoria Islands under a new alias and was never seen again.

For this one, James Bond was demoted so hard that he was now a janitor in the facility. The facility's original janitor replaced him and became a badass spy.

Bond was ashamed, and for thirty years he worked as a janitor as the other agents and staff at the agency laughed at him and taunted him for his failure.

Eventually, he decided that he had had enough.

He quit.

Now that he had quit, he needed a new job, so he went to a clothing factory that was currently hiring. He knew this was his only chance to make any money, so he sighed and walked in.

After discussing a job interview with the secretary, it was agreed upon that the job interview would be scheduled for next week. Bond was excited.

------------

Eventually, a week passed and it was time for Bond to go do the interview.

He went to the place with a huge smile on his face and sat down in front if the manager to discuss job oppurtunities.

The manager said, ""Well, Mr. Bond, we have two jobs currently available in our clothing factory. The first is to give oral lectures to all newcomers and to students that come here on field trips.""

Bond nodded. ""Fair enough"", he said. ""And the second job""

The manager cleared his throat and said, ""For the second job, you will be using a natural or synthetic substance to add or change the color of clothes"".

Bond considered these two options and then said,

""Do you expect me to talk?""

""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to dye."", said the manager.

The man thinks it over for a bit while drinking a few beers, and in his slightly intoxicated state decides that hes gonna try to win the money.

He slurrs out, ""Ok Barkeep, here's $50 big ones. Whats I got to do?""

The barkeep smiles and says, ""There are four things you must do. First, you have to drink 10 beers and 10 shots in 10 minutes. Next, you see that group of mean old bikers in the back? They come in every night and make a big mess. I need you to take one of these beer bottles and smash it over one of their heads. After that, I have got an old pitbull in the back that has a mean toothache, I need you to go back there and pull it out. And finally, my 85 year old grandmother is up stairs. She was a whore in Romania for almost 35 years. I need you to go upstairs and have your way with her.""

So the man races down the beers and shots in under 8 minutes, to the amazement of the bar keep. He grabs one of the beer bottles and walks up to the biggest biker in the back and smashes it over his head, knocking him out cold. A few of the other bikers rough him up a bit but he keeps going. He stumbles out side and from inside the bar, all the barkeep hears is the most horrible screaming and yelping he has ever heard. After what seems like an hour, the man comes back in, clothes torn to bits and bloodied and rushes to the bar keep and slurrs out,

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He saw a men’s clothing store and thought, ""that’s what I need .. a new suit."" 

He entered the shop and told the salesman, ""I’d like a new suit."" The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, ""Let’s see... size 42 long."" Joe laughed, ""That’s right, how did you know?""

The next day, he's off in the woods and waiting for a bear to cross his way. 2 hours later, a bear comes by, so he loads his rifle, aims and shoots. After the smoke has cleared, he looks out for the bear, but it's gone. While still confused where the bear has gone, he feels a tip on his shoulder. He turnes around and sees the bear in front of him. The bear says: ""Ok, you got 2 options. You either give me a blowjob or i'll eat you alive.""


Not wanting to get eaten alive, the man blows the bear and goes back to his hotelroom to spend the night in deep shame and anger.


The next day, the man wants revenge. He goes back to the place he was the day before, and lays down waiting for the bear to come by. A few hours later, the bear crosses his way again. The man loads his rifle, aims, and in a moment of being happy to finally get his revenge, he shoots. After the smoke has cleared, he stands up to celebrate his victory, but the bear is gone once again.


Once more, the man feels a tip on his shoulder. Knowing what awaits him, he turns around. ""You know the deal"", the bear says. ""You either give me a blowjob or i'll eat you alive"". Being really depressed about the bear outsmarting him once again, he blows the bear and goes back to his hotelroom. This night he's swearing to himself he's not gonna miss once more and finally get his revenge.


The next day comes, and the man goes back to the spot he's been to the last 2 days, waiting for the bear to come by. 3 hours later, he spots the bear. He loads his rifle, aims very carefully, and shoots. After the smoke has cleared, the bear is gone. Preparing himself for what comes next, he feels a tip on his shoulder. The man is already prepared to blow the bear one last time, when he turns around. 


The bear stands in front of him and says: ""Oh dear, you are not here for hunting, are you?""

Soon, almost 20 people are standing around the table. This includes the chef and the restaurants owner. Every single one is trying to convince the old man that it is, in fact, a 1928 Mouton. The waiter then asks: ""How can you be so sure this *isn't* a 1928 Mouton?""

After that, he is probably best-known for conjecturing that on the plane back from Dallas, Johnson was busy fucking JFK's corpse in the neck to make an exit wound look like an entry wound.

But my personal Krasner favorite was a throw-away of his.  You see, around the time of the first manned orbital space flights, there was still a laxative-type product called ""Serutan"", a name that was picked solely so that the slogan for the product could be:  ""Serutan - it's ""Natures"" spelled backwards.""

And there was another product called Tang - powdered frozen orange drink crystals which NASA had developed specifically for use by the astronauts. 

Trouble is, Tang made the astronauts gaseous and they reported this tendency toward flatulence to NASA mission control.

Whereby Krasner had, in the next issue of The Realist, a statement to the effect that Tang is Fart spelled sideways.","An example of real humor, courtesy Paul Krasner, founder of the now defunct Realist magazine",0

They have kept each other company and been best best friends for all that time. But lately, Bill's performance has been worsening, and he rarely wins a race.

Bob and Bill's owner comes into the stable to have a chat with Bill. ""Bill,"" he says, ""times are tough on my ranch. You have done well for me so many times, so it pains me to say this, but unless you win one of the next three races, I'll have to sell you. If I can find another trainer, I will, but if not, it'll be the glue factory for you. Think about it, and do your best in the races.""

With that he leaves. Bob is shocked. He turns to Bill and says, ""what are you going to do?""

""I'll do the best I can, but my strongest competition out there is going to be you,"" says Bill. ""Please, show your old friend some kindness and help me out?""

""Of course, old friend,"" says Bob.

The next Saturday is the day of the August race. The sun is shining brightly. The women are wearing bright sun dresses and white hats, while the men have rolled up their shirtsleeves. A gentle breeze blows over the track as the race is about to begin. 

And they're off! Bob and Bill are in the thick of the pack. Bill moves steadily upwards, followed by Bob. At the first turn, Bill emerges in the lead! His heart is racing, his breathing is heavy, his jockey is whipping swiftly. But then, Bob pulls up close behind. He gallops and easily overtakes his friend at the last turn. At the end of the race, Bob wins by three lengths.

At the stable that evening, the owner comes back. ""That was a good effort Bill,"" he says, ""but not good enough. I will give you two more chances, though, to prove you have what it takes to win. Good luck."" He leaves.

Bill turns to Bob. ""What happened?"" he asks. ""I thought we had an agreement.""

""I'm sorry, Bill,"" says Bob. ""I don't know what came over me. The excitement of the race, the crowds cheering. I promise next time, you will win.""

Then the time comes for the Saturday of the September race. The sun is hidden behind scattered clouds. The women are wearing grey dresses and clutching their hats against the wind, while the men wear light jackets. A chilly breeze blows over the track as the race is about to begin. 

And they're off! Bob and Bill are in the back of the pack. Bill struggles to maintain his position. At the first turn, Bill begins to pull up. At the last turn, Bill emerges in the lead! His heart is pounding, he gasps for air, his jockey is whipping fervently. But then, Bob pulls up behind once again. He thunders ahead and eventually overtakes Bill in the final stretch. At the end of the race, Bob wins by one length.

At the stable that evening, the owner comes back. ""That was another great effort Bill,"" he says, ""but not great enough. I will give you one more chance, though, to prove you have what it takes to win. Good luck."" He leaves.

Bill turns to Bob. ""What happened?"" he asks. ""It can't be a coincidence, to happen twice like that.""

""I'm sorry, Bill,"" says Bob. ""I don't know what came over me. The thrill of the race, the crowds roaring. I wouldn't do this to you on purpose, please believe me.""

""I believe you,"" says Bill.

Then the time comes for the Saturday of the October race. The sky is completely overcast, and dark clouds are gathering on the horizon. The women are wearing heavy coats and carrying umbrellas to shield themselves from the light rain, while the men are weaing long trenchcoats. A strong gust blows over the track as the race is about to begin. 

And they're off! Bob and Bill are in the rear of the pack. Bill falls behind, trailing behind the pack. He musters all his strength, throwing his hooves forward with all his might. ""I can do this, I must!"" At the first turn, he reaches the middle of the pack! At the last turn, he is in the lead! His heart is throbbing, his lungs are burning, his jockey is whipping angrily. Every muscle is sore and struggling. But then, in the final stretch, Bob pulls up behind for a final time. He gallops ferociously barely overtakes Bill at the finishing line. At the end of the race, Bob wins by a nose.

At the stable that day, the owner comes back. ""That was an amazing effort Bill, the best I have ever seen,"" he says, ""but not amazing enough. I cannot keep a horse that cannot win a race. Tonight, you will be taken away."" He leaves.

Bill turns to Bob, but no words come to his lips. He is overcome with emotion. He looks back on his long career, and his many wins. He wants to be angry at Bob, but he can't be. He is proud of his friend and protege for winning three races, and knows that Bob will go on to great things. But he is filled with sadness that he will not be there to experience them with his friend. His time with Bob, and perhaps, his life, are at an end.

Just then, one of the ranch dogs enter the stable. He looks up at Bill. ""Bill,"" he says, ""we just heard what happened. What are you going to do?""

""I don't know,"" says Bill. The dog, whose attention span is short, wanders off.

Then Bill, at last, knows what to say. He turns to Bob and says, ""holy shit, did you see that? A talking dog!""",Bob and Bill are two racehorses....,0

He approached her and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know me?' She responded, 'Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'

The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?'

She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a 
youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'

The defense attorney nearly died.

The judge then asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said, ""If either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the electric chair.""",Mrs. Jones on the witness stand.,6

I had lunch with 2 of my unmarried friends.

One is engaged, one is a mistress, and I have been married for 20+ years.

We were chatting about our relationships and decided to amaze our men by greeting them at the door wearing a black bra, stiletto heels and a mask over our eyes. We agreed to meet in a few days to exchange notes..

Here's how it all went.

My engaged friend:

The other night when my boyfriend came over he found me with a black leather bodice, tall stilettos and a mask.

He saw me and said, 'You are the woman of my dreams. I love you.' Then we made passionate love all night long.

The mistress:

Me too! The other night I met my lover at his office and I was wearing a raincoat; under it only the black bra, heels and Mask over my eyes. When I opened the raincoat he didn't say a word, but he started to tremble and we had wild sex all night.
Then I had to share my story:

He walks up to a urinal and notices that standing at the next urinal over is a very short person wearing s green coat, shoes with golden buckles, and a green top hat. He also can't help but notice that this little man appears to have an enormous penis.

The man in green sees the guy looking at him and says, in a thick Irish accent, ""You see someting you like, lad?""

The man is embarrassed and apologizes. ""Sorry, I didn't mean to stare. It's just, I hope you don't mind me asking (he's a bit drunk), but how is it that a guy of your size is so well endowed?""

The little man lets out a mischievous giggle. ""Well you see,"" he says, ""it's because I'm a Leprechaun. That's just how we are.""

The man laughs. ""Well seeing you're a Leprechaun, aren't you supposed to grant me wishes or something?""   

""Aye"" The Leprechaun responds. ""You get t'ree""

The man, not believing, plays along. ""OK. I wish for a bag of gold.""

""Granted."" says the leprechaun. He reaches into his coat and produces a little bag filled with gold coins, and hands it over.

The man, looking into the bag, is shocked. ""What the..."" Unable to believe his eyes, he decides to test the little man again.  ""OK. my next wish is for my hair to grow back."" (he's bald)

The Leprechaun says, ""bend your head down and I'll make it so."" And he rubs his hands together vigorously and lays them on top of the man's bald head. ""By tomorrow morning, you'll notice that your hair has started to grow back. 

Already the man can feel his head tingling, and he starts to feel overcome with joy over his good fortune.

""One more"" the leprechaun says. 

""Alright, the man says, his heart racing. OK, for my last wish, I want a penis as big as yours.""

The leprechaun smiles and scratches his chin. ""Well, lad, I can make that come true, but it's a wee bit more involved, and you aren't going to like it."" His eyes sparkle with delight. ""You'll have to let me fuck you in the arse.""

This comes as something of a shock to the man, but he looks at the bag of gold in his hand, feels his tingling head, looks around the empty bathroom and says, ""well, as long as nobody knows, and it's over quickly.""

""Not a soul will be told"" the leprechaun says. 

So the guy turns around, pulls his pants down, and the leprechaun starts going for it. 

A minute or so in, the man starts to moan, ""Oooooh god... yes. Oh fuck!""

The Leprechaun is encouraged and starts to grunt louder, ""Mmmmmm uhn, uhn, uhn."" He traces the man's inner thigh and then gently cups his testicles. 

The man gasps out, ""NNnnnngggaaaahhhh  oooOooOoo yeah..."" and starts convulsing as he ejaculates. He feels the leprechaun cumming inside him and grips the sides of the urinal to keep himself from collapsing to the floor in ecstasy. 

After a moment, the leprechaun is finished. He leans his weight against the man, pushing himself deep one last time, then falls forward onto the man's lower back.

The bathroom is silent but for the synchronized breath of the sudden lovers. They are frozen together, afraid to move lest it signal time to resume its inexorable march to reality, neither of them quite ready to let the moment end, neither of them yet willing to come to terms with the meaning of what had just occurred.

The only thing IRS has not yet taxed is the penis.

This is due to the fact that 70% of the time it is hanging around
unemployed, 13% of the time it is pissed off, 12% of the time it
is hard up, and 5% of the time it's in the hole.

It has two dependents, but they're nuts.

Issues still under consideration are as follows: Are there
penalties for early withdrawal? Do multiple partners count as a
corporation? Are condoms deductible as work clothes?

Effective May 30, 2015, penises will be taxed according to
size. The brackets are as follows:

10""-12"" Luxury Tax

8""-9"" Pole Tax

6""-7"" Privilege Tax

4""-5"" Nuisance Tax

Suljo &amp; Mujo were life-long friends in Bosnia, but one day Suljo decided to move to the US.  After a couple years apart, Mujo decided to visit his friend in the States.  

Suljo picked Mujo up from the airport in a stretched Cadilac, top of the line.  He tells Mujo ""This car, Mujo, this is MY car.""

""Wow, this is a beautiful car.  Great job, my friend.""

Driving the main strip downtown, Sujlo points to a high-rise building and tells Mujo ""See that building?  That's MY building.""  

Mujo is impressed.  ""Such a great building!"" he says.

After some driving, they arrive at a sizable and luxurious mansion.  Suljo turns to Mujo and says ""See that house?  That's MY house."" 

""Wow!"" says Mujo.  ""You must be doing very well.""

They park and get out of the car. When Suljo and Mujo step around to the side of the house, they get a view of the back yard.  Suljo points to the olympic-sized swimming pool in the back and says to Mujo ""That pool over there... MY pool.""

""Amazing!"" says Mujo, ""Look how big it is!""

Then Suljo points to a woman who is seated next to the pool.  The woman is receiving a back massage.  Suljo says to Mujo ""Do you see that beautiful woman sitting next to my pool?  That dreamboat of a woman is my wife.""

To which, Mujo replies ""But, Suljo, who is the man over there rubbing your wife's shoulders?""

""Oh, that man,"" says Suljo, ""That's me.""",Suljo &amp; Mujo anyone?,2

However, their manager got the dates wrong and the group ended up doing a three-day run in an outdoor theater in Albuquerque in the middle of the July heat. The event was exhausting and by the third night, everyone was just hoping to survive one more concert and move on. 

During the last song - Beethoven's Ninth - the bass players in the back of the orchestra hatch a plan. There's a bit in the middle of the song that's all violins and flutes, surely they won't be missed. They decide to sneak out to the bar next door for a drink, 'just to keep hydrated.'

They stay a little longer than they should have, and drink a lot more than they would have, when one of them realizes that they are going to miss their entrance. The ring-leader of the group tells them to not worry, as he had the foresight to tie the last page of the score down with a bit of string. It will take the conductor a while to unite it, which means the concert will stop and they can sneak in. They drunkingly congratulate him for being so smart as they stumble back to the theater. 

Meanwhile, the conductor is in a bind. The very energetic end of the piece is coming up and his bass section is missing. The violinists are working up a sweat trying to keep up in the heat when suddenly the first violinist faints from heat exhaustion. This is the last straw for the second violinist and she faints too. The bass section begins stumbling in not so subtly as they are knocking people, instruments, and chairs over.  To top it all off, someone has tied down the last page of the score as he is desperately trying to flip the page.

It would do us good to sympathize with the conductor and put ourselves in his shoes. From his vantage point, he begins to realize that:

There are two out, at the end of the ninth

The score is tied

And the basses are loaded.",An Orchestra in Albuquerque in July,15

It is 1950s America. Children are on the school bus heading back home. Black children are required to sit in the back of the bus whereas white children sit in the front. Eventually, one of the black children complains and starts a big argument that sees the whole bus fight over who is better and more intelligent, athletic, etc. 

Eventually the bus driver has had enough and pulls over. ""ENOUGH!"" he says...""EVERYONE OFF THE BUS."" 

So the children line up on the side of the road and the bus driver begins to lecture them. ""I AM TIRED OF LISTENING TO YOUR ARGUMENTS OVER WHETHER BLACK OR WHITE PEOPLE ARE BETTER.""

""THEREFORE"" he says....""NO MORE BLACK vs. WHITE ARGUMENTS. FROM NOW ON, EVERYONE ON THE BUS IS GREEN.""

""Fine"" the children say, as they agree to stop arguing. 

Relieved, the bus driver says ""Alright then, get back on the bus. Dark Greens to the back, light greens to the front.""",Segregated Bus Ride,6

I get all my relatives over to my house and we work together to make special tea out of gum-tree leaves.  Then I give tea to you.

He was born in San Dimos, California, to two drug-addicted parents. They regularly injected him with heroine and cocaine and forced him to smoke lit joints filled with low-quality weed. Life sucked for Scotie.

One day, everything changed for him. The police raided the house and arrested the parents. They then found Scrotie in the basement, tied to a table and having meth shoved into his urethra by his younger brother, who was in turn having lit joints shoved up his ass by his baby sister. Scrotie was the only member of his family that didn't like drugs.

They took the three kids to a foster home, where Scrotie's two siblings brutally burned the place to the ground. They both died in the attack, and Scrotie was the only survivor. 

The police retrieved Scrotie and sent him to another foster home. This time, it was the White House.

At this point, Scrotie was severely messed up in the head, and couldn't even be trusted to stand fifteen feet from a matchbox.

Needless to say, one day, Scrotie looked outside of the White House window and saw a fat ugly bitch break in. It was Hillarly Clinton. 

He went downstairs to see what was going on, and he saw her making preparations for when she moved into the White House while singing a Nickelback song. 

That motherfucking bitch!

Without a moment's hesitation, he went up to his adoptive dad's room and entered the secret code for the weapons cache, which contained a wide arsenal of deadly weapons that included assault rifles, grenade launchers, flamethrowers, and nuclear missiles. 

Scrotie found it ironic that his adoptive father, OBAMA of all people, would have a goddamn weapons cache. 

Anyway, he immediately took out a large nuke. This nuclear missile was 35 feet long and weighed two tonnes, although Scrotie lifted it with ease. He then climbed onto it and activated the launch sequence. Immediately, the missile went into the air and then came crashing back down.

It landed on the White House and exploded in a spectacular explosion, killing every single person in the White House, including Obama and that fat racist bitch Hillary Clinton.

Scrotie, meanwhile, miraculously survived the explosion. A magical aura encompassed him when the nuke exploded. It seemed as thoUgh God had more plans for him.

When police arrived on the scene, they found Scrotie sitting there, jerking off on top of Michelle Obama's corpse.

We must point out at this point that Scrotie McBoogerballs is a seven-year old boy. 

The police were stumped. However, without a moment's hesitation, the government automatically assumed that Russia and North Korea were responsible for the nuking, so it annihilated them both. It then annihilated Iran and Afghanistan before annihilating Sri Lanka and Nepal for the lulz. 

Meanwhile, the police didn't know where to take Scrotie now. Suddenly, they had an idea. They'd keep him in a prison cell for his own safety!

Twenty years went by, and Scrotie rotted in a jail cell with little to eat or drink. Eventually, he broke out. The escape wa very elaborate.

First, he feigned sickness. When the guard came in, Scrotie kicked him in the nuts so hard that the foundation of the universe was disrupted, vaporizing the guard. Scrotie then put on the vaporized man's guard uniform and took the keys. 

After leaving the cell, which had been unlocked by the guard beforehand, Scrotie freed all the other prisoners and armed them with shotguns and pistols he had found in the prison's armory. 

It was fourteen thousand prisoners against twenty four guards, half of whom had batons instead of guns. The prisoners fearlessly charged at the guards, who opened fire before retreating. The guards were all killed, while only one or two prisoners died. 

The prisoners burst out of the prison doors and went to find the warden. He was hiding in the closet. The prisoners merely chuckled and fired their guns at the same time, destroying the closet and the man hiding inside. It was excellent.

They then proceeded to tear down the prison fence and escape through it, laughing all the way.

Led by Scrotie, they all made their way to a nearby Wendy's, where they all sat down and heartily ate some burgers and chili. It tasted great, although one inmate's chili had a human finger in it. He would later sue Wendy's for five trillion dollars, forcing them to shut down.

The cashier at the Wendy's was rather terrified of the situation. Specifically, the fact that fourteen thousand prisoners had stuffed themselves into one small Wendy's and had bought all the food was very unnerving for her. She called the manager, who was crying in fear in his office.

Eventually, he gained the courage to go confront the convicts that were in his restaurant, so he went. The cashier explained the situation to him, even though he already knew all about it.

After thinking for a moment, he finally sighed and yelled at the top of his lungs, ""WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU GUYS WANT?!?!?!"".

The prisoners all stopped eating and glared at him. A few even loaded their guns. The manager gulped and tried to retreat, but two large and muscular convicts grabbed him and held him in place as he desperately fought to escape.

Scrotie McBoogerballs himself then appeared and was given a shotgun by one of the freed prisoners. He made his way up to the manager and got so close to him that the manager could hear Scrotie's cold, dark heart beating. Scrotie could hear the manager's heart beating too. It was beating as fast as a horny rabbit's heart.

After staring deep and intimidatingly into the manager's eyes, Scrotie finally opened his mouth and said,

""Deace nuts, bitch.""
