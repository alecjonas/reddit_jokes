post,3sawtw,2qh72,jokes,false,1447179852,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3sawtw/new_in_town/,self.jokes,,"A man just moved to a new city and decided to go out on the town to find a good bar and possibly make some new friends.
He came upon a small dive bar down the road and decided to check it out.

He went in and sat at the bar, looked around for the bartender and spotted a large jar full of $10 bills near the back. As soon as the bartender came over he inquired about why there were only ten dollar bills in the jar.

""Oh, that's the membership fee for our special drinking club! We meet here a few times a week, after hours,"" said the bartender.

“But it’s not just a $10 entrance fee,” he continued. 

“You have to prove you’re worthy of drinking and partying with us. Under the bar is a large bottle of Peppermint Schnapps. You have to chug the entire thing without stopping. 

Then, you see that large Indian guy meditating on the small table in the corner? He weighs over 400 pounds. You have to push him off the table. 

And after that you have to take these pliers and go find the Rottweiler that guards the junkyard a block away and pull out a couple of its teeth without being scratched or bitten. 

And lastly, you have to go the apartment above the bar and give the old lady who lives there an intense orgasm. So intense that we can all hear it. If you do all of that, you can join our little club here.”

The guy thought about it for a few minutes then said to the bartender, “What the hell? I’ll try it.” 

He handed over ten dollars and then grabbed the large bottle of Peppermint Schnapps. He started chugging and chugging and chugging. The patrons at the bar noticed and started to cheer him on, yelling and throwing their hands in the air. The guy barely finished the entire bottle. By this time he was completely wasted and having trouble walking.

He staggered over to the meditating Indian and using all of his strength, slowly pushed him off the table. The whole bar erupted in deafening applause.

The guy then threw open the door and ran around the corner. Everyone leaned against the wall inside the bar to listen. They could hear the poor Rottweiler howling and whining in pain.

A few seconds later the new guy kicked open the front door, almost falling over, then grabbed the pliers from the bar and screamed:

God Will Save Me

A terrible storm came into a town and local officials sent out an emergency warning that the riverbanks would soon overflow and flood the nearby homes. They ordered everyone in the town to evacuate immediately.

A faithful Christian man heard the warning and decided to stay, saying to himself, “I will trust God and if I am in danger, then God will send a divine miracle to save me.”

The neighbors came by his house and said to him, “We’re leaving and there is room for you in our car, please come with us!” But the man declined. “I have faith that God will save me.”

As the man stood on his porch watching the water rise up the steps, a man in a canoe paddled by and called to him, “Hurry and come into my canoe, the waters are rising quickly!” But the man again said, “No thanks, God will save me.”

The floodwaters rose higher pouring water into his living room and the man had to retreat to the second floor. A police motorboat came by and saw him at the window. “We will come up and rescue you!” they shouted. But the man refused, waving them off saying, “Use your time to save someone else! I have faith that God will save me!”

The flood waters rose higher and higher and the man had to climb up to his rooftop.

A helicopter spotted him and dropped a rope ladder. A rescue officer came down the ladder and pleaded with the man, ""Grab my hand and I will pull you up!"" But the man STILL refused, folding his arms tightly to his body. “No thank you! God will save me!”

Shortly after, the house broke up and the floodwaters swept the man away and he drowned. It's a real shame he didn't let himself be saved because God doesn't exist.",God will save me,0

'Hello again. Are you really sure you don't have any broccoli?'

'Er...quite positive, ma'am. We just sold the last bag to the gentleman before you. I'm afraid we won't have any more until tomorrow. Could I interest you in some cauliflower?'

'Oh. No, thank you.'

Once again, she takes a good look around the store and walks around the various displays. Once again she asks the owner,

'You know, I could really use some broccoli.'

'Look ma'am, I don't want to sound rude but I don't really know how else to tell you. We're out of broccoli. We have lettuce, spinach, carrots - you name it, we have it. Just no broccoli. I'm sorry.'

'Oh. I see.' she goes again, but again she says there and keeps looking around at the displays.

After another five minutes, sure enough, she goes to the owner again and says,

'Are you *absolutely* sure you have no broccoli left?'

The owner lets out an exasperated huff and starts,

'Look lady, listen here. What do you get if you take the pine out of pineapple?'

Slightly puzzled, she answers, 'An apple?'

'Right. And what do you get if you take the water out of watermelon?'

Would you be willing to have sex with this gorilla for $500? He asks.

The janitor accepts the offer, but only on three conditions: First, I don't want to have to kiss her. And second, you can never tell anyone about this. The zookeeper agrees to the conditions and asks about the third.

Well, says the janitor, I'm gonna need another week to come up with the $500.

I immediately called the police. I gave them my location, Description of the car, Place I parked, etc, I equally confessed that I had left my keys in the car, and that the car had been stolen.


Then I made the most difficult call of all, to my husband, ""Honey"", I stammered; (I always call him ""honey"" in times like these .) ""I left my keys in the car, and it has been stolen.""

When the chicken sees that it has the librarian's attention, it squawks,
""Book, book, book, BOOK!""
The librarian complies, putting a couple of books down in front of the chicken.
The chicken quickly grabs them and disappears.
The next day, the librarian is again disturbed by the same chicken, who puts the previous day's pile of books down on the desk and again squawks,
""Book, book, book, BOOK!""
The librarian shakes her head, wondering what the chicken is doing with these books, but eventually finds some more books for the chicken.
The chicken disappears.
The next day, the librarian is once again disturbed by the chicken, who squawks (in a rather irritated fashioon, it seems),
""Book, book, book, BOOK!""
By now, the librarian's curiosity has gotten the better of her, so she gets a pile of books for the chicken, and follows the bird when it leaves the library.
She follows it through the parking lot, down the street for several blocks, and finally into a large park. The chicken disappears into a small grove of trees, and the librarian follows.
On the other side of the trees is a small marsh. The chicken has stopped on the side of the marsh.
The librarian, now really curious, hurries over and sees that there is a small frog next to the chicken, examining each book, one at a time. The librarian comes within earshot just in time to hear the frog saying,

The man stumbled around the car park for a few minutes, with the officer quietly observing.

After what seemed an eternity and trying his keys on five vehicles, the man managed to find his car which he fell into. He sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off. Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off (it was a fine dry night) flicked the indicators on, then off, tooted the horn and then switched on the lights. He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little and then remained stationery for a few more minutes as some more vehicles left.

At last he pulled out of the car park and started to drive slowly down the road. The police officer, having patiently waited all this time, now started up the patrol car, put on the flashing lights, promptly pulled the man over and carried out a breathalyzer test. To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence of the man having consumed alcohol at all! 

Dumbfounded, the officer said ""I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyzer equipment must be broken.""

It seemed a little strange. When the busboy brought our water and utensils, I noticed he also had a spoon in his shirt pocket. Then I looked around saw that all the staff had spoons in their pockets.

When the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, ""Why the spoon?"" Well,"" he explained, ""the restaurant's owners hired Kurt Salmon Associates to revamp all our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon is the most frequently dropped utensil. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our personnel are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift.""
As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare. ""I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now."" I was impressed.

I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's fly. Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter, ""Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?""

""Oh, certainly!"" Then he lowered his voice. ""Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we can save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 76.39%.""

""After you get it out, how do you put it back?""

Well,"" he whispered, ""I don't know about the others, but I use the spoon.""

When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm hurt and badly broken at the elbow. When it healed and Jem’s fears of never being a professional football player was assuaged, he was never self-conscious about the injury. However he was very self-conscious about his previous failed business endeavor, a dating site named Pastor’s Only.   
	When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading up to the accident. (We never discussed Pastor’s Only.) I maintained that it was the Euwells that started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started four years before that. 
	He said it began the morning of Asian Tom’s trial. I said he should shut his mouth. My father, Atticus Finch, was Tom’s lawyer, and a he was a very good lawyer, since he spent all his time at the bar. 
Despite all of his skill, my father was worried. If he could not convince the jury that Asian Tom had not punched Old Mayeller in the mouth, then Asian Tom and he would both go to jail since that’s how the legal system works.  Jem would not be attending since he was crying softly out behind the garage because of his failed charity “Chicken for Cows”.  
On our way out, my friend Dill asked if could accompany us.  My father said yes. 
Dill screamed. 
Part Two
We arrived at the courthouse a quarter past one and seated ourselves in the balcony. 
“Atticus, why aren’t you sitting with Asian Tom?” 
 “I’m trying a new hands off approach Scout. Sometimes people need to work out their own problems.”
The judge hit his gavel against his stand, and the din of the courtroom disappeared like magic.  Then he threw the gavel at Dill and killed him instantly.
“Now that that’s taken care of we can proceed with the trial.” The Judge declared.
A man who was neither tall nor thin walked up to the witness stand. Another man approached him with a Bible, which the first man placed his hand gaily on.
“Darius Runnynose, do you pledge to tell the truth and nothing but the truth?”
“I am agnostic, so I pledge to tell some of the truth and nothing but half-truths.” 
 “Now I understand your initials spell doctor, and I understand that qualifies you as a doctor correct?” The judge inquired.
“I believe it does, but I also believe it doesn’t.” Darius 
 “Were you present for the punching?”
“I sometimes think I was and sometimes think I didn’t. I’m leaning towards no today though.” 
	“Then can you tell us what you think happened?”
“Maybe.”
Part Three 
Darius inhaled deeply, rubbed the head of the man closest to him, and began to tell his story.
***
 Asian Tom was walking home from work one day when he stopped in front of the Mayeller household to think about what had happened to him that day for no particular reason.
He had visited Darius Runnynose to see if he could fix his sprained ankle. Darius ingeniously broke both of Tom’s arms to make him forget about his ankle. Tom’s life savings had been well spent. 
Then Tom heard Old Mayeller’s voice erupt from the house. Asian Tom ran towards the house and found the girl on her porch. Old Mayeller was pretty, but not as pretty as Darius, and she had long blond hair, but not as long as Darius’ hair.  She asked him if he could fix her computer. He thought it was a little racist, but he decided to do it anyway. 
While walking towards the house, Tom realized how strange it was that her first name was Old while she appeared so youthful but could not judge her for it since he was not Asian. 
Asian Tom arrived at the computer and saw the monitor was split in half. 
“I can’t fix this.”
“No, but you can fix my fix my broken heart.” Old grew pale and fell over onto the floor and died.  
 “Don’t die on me!” He screamed, using a patented Darius Runnynose technique of hitting your victim in the face until they came back to life. 
	Old came back to life with a gasp, but Tom punched her one more time just to be safe. 
Mayeller gasped. She had been raised on a strict set of values that dictated that if a man punched you, you must take him out to dinner and then to court. They then proceeded to do this while telling each other how great of a doctor Darius is and how handsome he is. 
Part 4 Part 1
Every sole in the courtroom gasped collectively. For a moment, there was silence. Then the crowd erupted into whispers of speculation. 
The judge no longer had a gavel so he slammed Darius’s head repeatedly against the table. The crowd, as if on cue, immediately quieted down and the judge began to speak. 
“Seeing as how our town could not afford a jury…” The judge stroked his rare imported white tiger.
“I’ll decide the verdict.”
	 The judge jumped on the table dramatically. 
“I sentence him to…Death by chocolate!” 
Asian Tom stood up from his seat, visibly shocked.
“Wait! I was never defended! I saved a girl’s a life! How could you decide the verdict? What does this have to Mockingbirds? Does no one care you killed a child!?” 
	“No”
“What are you doing up there?! You’re my lawyer!” Tom screamed. 
“Guards take him away.” The judge gestured to two large men in uniforms. 
Tom resisted, but both men overpowered him.
“Why are you doing this to me?” 
“Oh Tom, don’t you remember me? I was once your student in elementary school. You denied my request for an extra juice box, and when you started to write me off as a spoiled child, I began to write your obituary.  I hope you learned your lesson today teacher.”
	Tom was dragged out the courthouse doors, and two additional guards closed them with a loud thud.
“No one messes with Big Mama.” 
Part 4 Part 2
Honorable Judge Big Mama dismissed the crowd and everyone began filing out of the courtroom.
Atticus stood up to leave, and I jumped to my feet and hugged him as hard as I could. 
Now he would be taken away with Asian Tom because he had not been able to defend him. I could not imagine a life without him because I was not very creative. 
Atticus bent down and asked me what was wrong.
“Now you’ll be taken away to die with Asian Tom. You told me that was how the legal system works“
“Naw cuz I was just playin.”

His store was conveniently named ""Mr. Pages ironwares"". He sold screws, nails, bolts, hooks and the lot. But business wasn't going too well and so Mr. Pages decided to hire a advertisement company. And so he did...

A couple of days went by and when Mr. Pages was walking to his store one morning, he saw a big billboard depicting Jesus hanging from his cross, and in big letters above it: ""With nails from Mr Pages, you hang for ages.""

""OMG!"", screamed Mr. Pages, as he rushed to his store to call the advertisement company. On the phone with the designer of the billboard: ""You can't possibly be serious about this!"", he yelled at the guy, ""I will lose all my customers!""

""Calm down"", the guy said, ""I will fix it emediately."" So the designer, a bit frustrated because he thought the Jesus thing was a good idea, started working on a new concept.

The next morning Mr. Pages was walking to his store again and looked up at the billboard hoping the advertisement was changed. He was flabbergasted, as now Jesus was lying in a little bundle under his cross and the text above it read: ""He has teared of, but nails from Mr. Pages are still tough!""

Steaming with rage, Mr. Pages ran to his shop and called the advertisement company again. ""That's it!"" he said ""Our deal is off! I want nothing to do with your company anymore! I want this billboard removed and I'm not paying you either!"" and hung up the phone.

The designer, now also pissed off, not in the least because he wasn't getting payed for the work he already done.

The next morning Mr. Pages was eager to see the billboard removed. Instead, there was a big white canvas, and written in huge black letters: ""At Mr Pages their all Jews, but they have good screws!""",There once was a man named Mr. pages...,0

John Bradford, a Sydney University student, was on the side of the road hitch hiking on a very dark night and in the midst of a storm. The night was rolling on and no car went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him. Suddenly he saw a car slowly coming towards him and stopped. John, desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, got in the car and closed the door, just to realize there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn't on!

The car started moving slowly. John looked at the road and saw a curve approaching. Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. Then, just before he hit the curve, a hand appeared through the window and turned the wheel. John, paralysed with terror, watched how the hand appeared every time they came to a curve. John saw the lights of a pub down the road so, gathering strength, jumped out of the car and ran to it. Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and asked for two shots of tequila. He then started telling everybody about the horrible experience he went through. A silence enveloped everybody when they realized he was crying and.... wasn't drunk.

About 15 minutes later, two guys walked into the same pub. They were also wet and out of breath. Looking around and seeing John Bradford sobbing at the bar, one said to the other, ""Look, Bruce.. there's the fucker that got in the car while we were pushing it.


Edit: wow, this exploded. I didn't know it would be like this. I did not make this joke, its recycled.",It was a rainy day in Brisbane..,1884

She thought it might be dead, but since it was a basset hound and never moved much anyway, she wanted to be sure... after all, she didn't want to bury it and then find out it wasn't dead. So she took it to the vet. 
The vet agreed to take a look. He shook the dog gently. He checked for a doggy pulse, but couldn't find one. He held a mirror up to the dog's nose but it stayed clear. He said, ""Well, the dog does look dead, but I'd like to run one more test."" 
He goes into the other room and brings back an animal carrier. He opens the door and a cat comes out, walks around the dog two or three times, and finally lifts it's head and tail and goes back into the carrier. 
Vet says, ""Well, ma'am, I'm sorry to say but your dog is dead."" 
""Well, that's what I came here to find out,"" she says, ""How much do I owe you?"" 
""That'll be $520."" 
""What?"" she screams, ""$520 to tell me my dog's dead?? Why so much?""

So, he goes down the road to the next farmer and asks if he has a rooster. The other farmer says, ""yeah, I've got this great rooster, named randy; he'll service every chicken you've got. No problem""

Well, Randy the rooster is a lot of money, but the farmer decides he'd be worth it, so, he buys Randy. The farmer takes Randy home and sets him down in the barnyard, giving the rooster a pep talk, ""Randy, I want you to pace yourself now. You've got a lot of chickens to service here and you cost me a lot of money, and I'll need you to do a good job. So, take your time and have some fun,"" the farmer said with a chuckle.

Randy seemed to understand, so the farmer points towards the hen house and Randy took off like a shot ~WHAM~ He nails every hen in there THREE or FOUR times and the farmer is just shocked. Randy runs out of the hen house and sees a flock of geese down by the lake ~WHAM~ he gets all the geese. Randy's up in the pigpen. He's in with the cows. Randy is jumping on every animal the farmer owns.

The farmer is distraught, worried that his expensive rooster won't even last the day. Sure enough, when the farmer wakes up the next day he finds Randy dead as a doorknob in the middle of the yard. Buzzards are circling overhead.

The farmer makes his way out to Randy, saddened by the loss of such a colorful animal, he shakes his head and says, ""Oh, Randy, I told you to pace yourself. I tried to get you to slow down, now look what you've done to yourself."" Randy opens one eye, nods towards the sky and say's, ""Shhh. They're getting closer...""",Randy the Rooster,298

""Don't worry about it, I will call ahead and tell them you are coming.""

So I left him to play with Lego and I'm sitting on the couch, watching TV like an irresponsible prick.

Suddenly, I hear something fall in the kitchen. I go to check it out and there I see him, wielding a knife.

I fall over in shock and he marches up to me, knife raised.

""I wanna lub!"" he says.

I was confused confused. What's he saying?

He pricks me with it and then shouts ""I WANNA LUB!""

St. Pete welcomes him and says that there is a new regulation now where a soul gets to choose if they want to go to heaven or hell. The soul must spend three days in hell and three days in heaven and after that he chooses where to go.

The man elects to get hell over with first and like that he *poof* vanishes and is transported to hell. He is greeted by lightly dressed, beautiful women, rivers of gold, alcohol, lust beyond all his dreams, a paradise of pleasure. Nothing at all like he was explained on earth. Everyday a new woman. Everyday the most succulent foods. Everyday just more and more bliss.

Alas, though, his third day was up and like a flash *poof* he arrived in heaven. He was given wings and a harp. There was no river of gold, lust, women to fuck, the food was relatively bland. All and all, it was just meh.

His third day past, St. Pete appeared before him and asked where he wanted to spend eternity. The man says, ""St. Pete... I never thought I'd ever mutter these words, but I want to go to hell!"" St. Pete asked him if he was sure and as giddy as a school boy he gives a definitive yes.

And just like that *poof* he arrives in hell. This time, though, he is shackled to a wall, on fire, and being disemboweled. It's never ending! In torturous pain constantly with no relief! It began to dawn on him that this would be his eternity.

Later that day he sees Satan strolling by. Between his screams of agony and pain, the man yells, ""HEY SATAN!! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WOMEN, THE FOOD, THE LUST, THE HEAVEN THAT WAS HERE WHEN I VISITED!!!""

A few miles down the road, the donkey tripped on a rock and caused the cart to veer to the side of the road.  The husband said: ""Thats Two"".

When they were almost home, a rat ran in front of the cart, spooking the donkey, who brayed and almost tipped the cart.  The husband, without a word, stopped the cart, went to the back, pulled out his shotgun, and shot the donkey in the head.  His wife was horrified.  ""How could you do that, it was just a few mistakes!"".  The husband turned to his new wife and said: ""Thats One"".

Since he was a chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets. When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the winter was going to be like.


Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he told his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

But, being a practical leader, after several days, he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the Environment Canada Weather Service and asked, 'Is the coming winter going to be cold?'
'It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,' the meteorologist at the weather service responded.

So the chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the Environment Canada Weather Service again. 'Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?'

'Yes,' the man at Weather Service again replied, 'it's going to be a very cold winter.'

The chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find.

Two weeks later, the chief called the Environment Canada Weather Service again. 'Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?'

'Absolutely,' the man replied. 'It's looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters we’ve ever seen.'

'How can you be so sure?' the chief asked.

The weatherman replied, 'The Indians are collecting a shitload of firewood !'",Winter Is Coming,5

He said, while stroking his chin, ""Yeah, I can help you, but it is gonna take a little of you know what, if you know what I mean.""  She, of course, knew what he meant.

The professor told her to come closer so he could whisper into her ear.  She obliged and very carefully put her ear within whispering distance of the professor.  Feeling his hot breath he told her, ""D is for a little dick, C is for some Coochie, B is for Boobies because I am a Boob man and...."".  And right at that moment the professor's phone rang for which he immediately picked it up.  This was quite a relief for the student as it gave her time to think about her options.  Of course, she wanted the A and knew what this would require.  She knew she couldn't go home thinking that she didn't try her best to get an A and so resolved to go with that option.
