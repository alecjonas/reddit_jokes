The guy speeds up to outrun the chicken, but sure enough, a few seconds later, it's back keeping the pace.  He speeds up once more, and to his amazement, the chicken goes into overdrive and ZOOMS down the street, making a 90 degree turn into a farmer's barn.  So the guy decides to pull into the farmer's driveway to ask him about that crazy three-legged chicken.

Farmer comes out of the house, and the guy says

Guy:  ""Hey, you might not believe this, but I just saw a three-legged chicken bolt into your barn over there.""

Farmer:  ""Oh, yeah, that's my chicken alright!  I've got a dozen of 'em!""

Guy:  ""Why in hell do you raise three-legged chickens?""

Farmer:  ""Well the idea is, **I** like chicken legs, my **wife** likes chicken legs, and my **son** likes chicken legs.  So when we sit down for a meal, we all get a leg!""

post,3bd06p,2qh72,jokes,false,1435455135,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3bd06p/german_language_is_easy/,self.jokes,,"The German language is relatively easy. Those who can speak Latin and are used to declinations, normally learn it very rapidly. At least that is what German teachers say in their first class. They start learning: der, die, das, des, dem, den and the rest just comes naturally. It’s amazingly easy! If this doesn’t convince you, let’s learn German with an example.

First of all, take a book in German. It’s a splendid leather-covered book published in Dortmund. It is about the customs and habits of the Hottentots (which in German is Hottentotten).

The book teaches that the opossums (Beutelratten) are captured and put in cages (Kotter) with wooden slats (Lattengitter) to protect them from the elements. Those cages, in German, are called “cages with wooden slats” (Lattengitterkotter) and, when they have inside a opossum, we call all the group as “cage with wooden slats with an opossum” (Beutelrattenlattengitterkotter).

One day, the Hottentots arrested a murderer (Attentäter), accused of having killed the Hottentot (Hottentotter) mother (Mutter) (a Hottentottermutter) of a boy who stuttered and was also a bit slow (Stottertrottel). That woman, in German, is called Hottentottenstottertrottelmutter and, her murderer, we call easily Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterattentäter.

In the book, the Hottentots caught him and, without having where to put him, they used a opossum cage (Beutelrattenlattengitterkotter). But, incidentally, the prisoner escaped. After they began the search, quickly came up a Hottentot warrior screaming:

&gt; ""We caught the murderer (Attentäter)!""

&gt; ""What?,"" asked the chief.

&gt; ""Lattengitterkotterbeutelrattenattentäter"" answered the warrior.

&gt; ""Who? The murderer that was in the cage of opossums with wooden slats?"" the chief of the Hottentots asked.

&gt; ""Yes,"" answers the native with great difficulty. ""Hottentottenstottertrottelmutteratentäter (murderer of the Hottentot mother who had a slow and stuttering child).""

&gt; ""Ah,"" the chief says, ""you could have said from the start that you had caught the Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitterkotterattentäter!""

As it can be noticed, German is very easy. You only have to show a little willingness...",German language is easy.,8

I'm only a dog"" so the man takes the dog back to his friend and tells him ""This dog is good at dishes but he's useless for anything else. What else do you have?"" His friends thinks for a second and says ""ok I've got the perfect thing for you. Take this parrot. He can do whatever you want."" So the man takes the parrot home and asks him to do the dishes. The parrot gets to work and does an even better job than the dog. He even dries them and puts them away. The man is applauds the parrot and asks about the laundry. The parrot starts laundry with no trouble at all. The man says ""wow you're amazing! How are you at vacuuming?"" The parrot replies ""I can't vacuum what do you think I am? I'm only a parrot."" So the man takes the parrot back to his friend and tells him his problem. The man thinks for a second and says ""ok take this monkey. He can do everything you need him to."" So the man brings him home and the monkey does the dishes and laundry with out complaints. He even vacuums the whole house no problem. The man says ""wow you're amazing! Could you run up the the store and grab me some groceries?"" The monkey says I can't do that what do you think I am? I'm only a monkey."" So the man gets frustrated and takes the monkey back. He asks his friend ""I really need something better."" So his friend thinks long and hard and finally says ""I've got it! Take this milipede. I guarantee he can do anything and everything you can imagine."" The man is doubtful of this little milipede but trusts his friend. He takes the milipede home and explains his chores. The milipede gets to work. He washes the dishes perfectly. Dries them, puts them away, and even organizes the cabinets. He does laundry with no hassle at all. Folds them and neatly puts them in the man's dresser. He even irons the man's dress shirts. He vacuums the entire house, mops the floor, and dusts everything. The man is astonished. He says ""wow you're amazing! Here's my grocery list. Are you capable of getting everything?"" The milipede says yes and walks out the door. The man waits for the milipede to return. He watches the clock as minutes turn to hours. After waiting for what seemed like forever the man gets worried that something happened to the milipede. He goes to look for him and walks out the door to find the milipede still right outside. He angrily says ""what are you doing!? I've been waiting and waiting on you. Why are you still here!?"" The milipede looks up and says ""well sir, I'm still tying my shoes!""",A man needs help doing chores around the house,3

While trying fruitlessly to find their way out, they are found! By a group of cannibals. These cannibals take the men back to their tribe, to show their king that they brought dinner. 


&amp;nbsp;


The king, a natural gambler, spoke to the men. He said that he will give them a test. This test has two parts, and the second part will be told only once they have completed the first. If they pass, they will be led out of the forest and made free to go. Else, they will be killed and, after preparation with the best seasonings available, eaten.


&amp;nbsp;


The king explains that they will be allowed into the forest with two tribespeople. The men are to go in different directions, and gather ten fruits or vegetables and bring them back.


&amp;nbsp;


The men accept immediately, and off they go into the wild blue yonder.


&amp;nbsp;


About an hour later, Man #1 comes back. He's proud that he found his items so quickly, and he dumps ten apples on the ground in front of the king. ""I'm ready for the second part,"" he says.


&amp;nbsp;


The king explains the second part. When each man comes back with his fruits or vegetables, he is to shove all ten up his ass. The kicker: They are to do this without any face, grimace of pain, or reaction.


&amp;nbsp;


Horrified, Man #1 successfully takes in one whole apple. He almost finishes the second one, but then he winces from the pain. He's killed instantly by a tribe member, and dragged away.


&amp;nbsp;


Some time passes.


&amp;nbsp;


Now, Man #2 is on his way back. He stands before the king, and presents his find: Raspberries.


&amp;nbsp;


The king smiles and explains that he is to insert the raspberries into his ass without any face, grimace, etc. The man, slightly used to this kind of foreplay, obliges. He gets to the ninth raspberry, but then starts laughing uncontrollably. He's of course killed and dragged away.
_____________________________


&amp;nbsp;


These first two men, they meet in heaven. Man #1 has been watching Man #2 since his own death, so naturally he's confused.


&amp;nbsp;


Man #1: ""Hey, why the hell did you laugh? You were doing so well, and could have gone free!""


&amp;nbsp;


Man #2: ""I know, but were you not watching? I looked up, and in the distance I saw [Man #3] coming back with his guides... he found watermelon!""

There's nothing worse than a doctor's receptionist who insists you tell her what is wrong with you in a room full of other patients.  

Here's how one old guy handled it: 

A 65-year-old man walked into a crowded waiting room and approached the desk. 

The receptionist said, 'Yes sir, what are you seeing the doctor for today?' 

'There's something wrong with my dick', he replied. 

The receptionist became irritated and said, 'You shouldn't come into a crowded waiting room and say things like that. ' 

'Why not, you asked me what was wrong and I told you,' he said. 

The receptionist replied; 'Now you've caused some embarrassment in this room full of people. You should have said there is something wrong with your ear or something and discussed the problem further with the doctor in private.' 

The man replied, 'You shouldn't ask people questions in a roomful of strangers, if the answer could embarrass anyone. The man walked out, waited several minutes, and then re-entered.

The receptionist smiled smugly and asked, 'yes??' 

'There's something wrong with my ear,' he stated.

A man had just settled into his seat next to the window on the plane when another man sat down in the aisle seat and put his black Labrador Retriever in the middle seat next to the man.

The first man looked very quizzically at the dog and asked why the dog was allowed on the plane.

The second man explained that he was from the  Police Drugs Enforcement Agency and that the dog was a 'sniffing dog'.

'His name is Sniffer and he's the best there is. I'll show you once we get airborne,when I put him to work.'

The plane took off, and once it has leveled out, the Policeman said, 'Watch this.'
 
He told Sniffer to 'search'.
 
Sniffer jumped down,walked along the aisle, and finally sat very purposefully next to a woman for several seconds.  Sniffer then returned to his seat and put one paw on the policeman's arm.

The Policeman said,  'Good boy', and he turned to the man and said, 'That woman is in possession of marijuana, I'm making a note of her seat number  and the authorities will apprehend her when we land.
'Gee, that's pretty good,' replied the first man.

Once again, the Policeman sent Sniffer to search the aisles.

The Lab sniffed about, sat down beside a man for a few seconds, returned to its seat, and this time he  placed two paws on the agent's arm.
The Policeman said, 'That man is carrying cocaine, so again, I'm making a note of his seat number for the police.'

'I like it!' said his seat mate.

The  Policeman then told Sniffer to 'search' again.

Sniffer walked up and down the aisles for a little while, sat down for a moment, and then came racing back to the agent, jumped into the middle seat and proceeded  to poop all over the place.

The first man was really disgusted by this behavior and couldn't figure out how or why a well-trained dog would behave like that, so he asked the Policeman, 'What's going on ?'

The Policeman nervously replied, 'He's just found a bomb.'

It was autumn, and the Red Indians asked their New Chief if the winter was going to be cold or mild.

Since he was a Red Indian chief in a modern society, he couldn't tell what the weather was going to be.

Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his Tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect wood to be prepared.

But also being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked 'Is the coming winter going to be cold?'

'It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,' the weather man responded.

So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood. A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. 'Is it going to be a very cold winter?'

'Yes,' the man at National Weather Service again replied, 'It's definitely going to be a very cold winter.'

The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again.

'Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?' 'Absolutely,' The man replied. 'It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.'

'How can you be so sure?' the Chief asked.
The weatherman replied, 'The Red Indians are collecting wood like crazy.'

All of a sudden a bumble bee entered the bedroom window. As the young lady parted her legs the bee entered her vagina. The woman started screaming ""Oh my god, help me, there's a bee in my vagina!"" The husband immediately took her to the local doctor and explained the situation.

The doctor thought for a moment and said ""Hmm, tricky situation. But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit."" The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina. The doctor said ""OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. The husband nodded and gave his approval. The young lady said ""Yes, Yes, whatever, just get on with it.""


So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, ""I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper."" So the doctor went deeper and deeper. After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed.

However, yesterday I went all the way to their box, and the opponent defender dealt with it like the fury of my grandmother when I refuse to eat the 7th meal of the day. 

In a no-nonsense fashion he straight up cleared it, right on my face. The brunt of the force caused me to pass out, right there on the pitch. 2 minutes later, I awoke. And realised I could have died.

But then that's when I had my epiphany. I realised the only way I could survive these motions through time and space are if my brother has a baby. 

Because then I become an un-kill.

post,3b6dro,2qh72,jokes,false,1435312512,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3b6dro/texas/,self.jokes,,"An old prospector shuffled into the town of El Indio, Texas leading a tired old mule. The old man headed straight for the only saloon in town, to clear his parched throat.

He walked up to the saloon and tied his old mule to the hitch rail.

As he stood there, brushing some of the dust from his face and clothes, a young gunslinger stepped out of the saloon with a gun in one hand and a bottle of whiskey in the other.

The young gunslinger looked at the old man and laughed, saying, ""Hey old man, can you dance?""

The old man looked up at the gunslinger and said, ""No son, I don't dance... never really wanted to.""

A crowd had gathered as the gunslinger grinned and said, ""Well, you old fool, you're gonna dance now!"" and started shooting at the old man's feet.

The old prospector, not wanting to get a toe blown off, started hopping around like a flea on a hot skillet.

Everybody standing around was laughing.

When his last bullet had been fired, the young gunslinger, still laughing, holstered his gun and turned around to go back into the saloon.

The old man turned to his pack mule, pulled out a double-barreled 12 gauge shotgun and cocked both hammers.

The loud clicks carried clearly through the desert air. The crowd stopped laughing immediately.

The young gunslinger heard the sounds too, and he turned around very slowly.

The silence was deafening. The crowd watched as the young gunman stared at the old timer and the large gaping holes of those twin 12 gauge barrels.

The barrels of the shotgun never wavered in the old man's hands, as he quietly said;

""Son, have you ever kissed a mule's ass?""

The gunslinger swallowed hard and said, ""No sir... but...but I've always wanted to.""

There are a few lessons for all of us here:

*Don't be arrogant.

*Don't waste ammunition.

*Whiskey makes you think you're smarter than you are.

*Always make sure you know who is in control.

*And finally, don't screw around with old folks; they didn't get old by being stupid.",Texas,29

Now late that afternoon, as is want to happen, his car broke down, leaving him stranded.  Now, luckily Farmer Jones came along on his old John Deere, and Jim explained what had happened.  Of course they both realized it was way too late to get him help that evening, so Farmer Jones took him on home.

When they got there, Jim saw it was nothing but a tiny one room shack, without even a decent barn, and he got to thinking he might just have been better staying in the car.  But Farmer Jones assured Jim that they had a big ol' bed for just him and his young wife, and they wouldn't mind lending him some space with them.  Just as Jim got to thinking it over, out walked Mrs. Jones, and damn if she wasn't the prettiest little thing Jim had ever cast his eyes upon.  Of course Jim knew better than to try anything with the farmer's wife, seeing as Farmer Jones was a big ol' boy and all, but that wouldn't stop him from thinking about it anyway.

Well as they were dozing off, Jim on one side of the farmer, and the missus on the other, over the farmer's snoring Jim heard Mrs Jones calling his name.

""Hey Jim, how about you come over here and make sweet love to me?"" Jim was shocked, of course, not believing what he was hearing.  But she told him she was very serious, and that she knew once her husband started snoring, well nothing was going to wake him.  And when he still wasn't sure, she told him to just reach down between his cheeks and pluck out a hair.  After a few more denials, Jim finally gets up the nerve and reaches down.  &lt;BOINK!&gt; the hair came free, and Farmer Jones never even flinched!  

Not believing his luck, Jim immediately hopped over and gave that young woman all he could, then settled back on his own side again.

But, sure enough, not much later he is once again woken by the farmer's wife begging him to give her another round.  But, believing there was no way the farmer could keep sleeping, he wouldn't give in until she had him pluck another hair from his ass.  And sure enough, &lt;BOINK!&gt; not even a change to his snoring.  So, Jim jumped over again and gave her an even wilder ride this time, before once again settling back on his own side.

But again, just as he was dozing off, he heard the farmer's wife calling for more!  This time it took no argument at all ... He just reached down and grabbed another hair from the farmer's ass.  &lt;BOINK!&gt;

But this time, before he could breathe a sigh of relieve, Farmer Jones sits straight up and grabs Jim by the throat.

""Look,"" he says in his deep voice, ""if you want to fuck my wife, that is between you and her!  But, do you have to keep using my ass as a scoreboard!?""",The traveling salesman and the farmer's wife,24

Cersei gives Tyrion an evil look and says confidently, ""I wish Tyrion had never been born!""

Tyrion then speaks, ""Wait a minute, I..."" but the genie makes some magical gestures and Tyrion disappears.

""That is horrible!"", Jaime exclaims, ""How could you do that to our brother?"" Cersei shrugs and smiles.

""Your wish, Ser Jaime?"", the genie intervenes.

""I would like to undo Cersei's wish... I wish for you to bring my brother back,"" Jaime quickly responds.

After some magical gestures, Tyrion reappears. An expression of disappointment on Cersei's face soon becomes one of worry as she realizes that Tyrion still has a wish. Jaime soon makes the same realization and also begins to worry.

""It is your turn to make a wish, Tyrion,"" the genie says.

'What majestic trees!'
'What powerful rivers!'
'What beautiful animals!'
He said to himself.


As he was walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him.


He turned to look.  He saw a 7-foot grizzly bear charge towards him. 

He ran as fast as he could up the path.  He looked over his shoulder &amp; saw that the bear was closing in on him.


He looked over his shoulder again, &amp; the bear was even closer.


He tripped &amp; fell on the ground.


He rolled over to pick himself up but saw that the bear was right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw &amp; raising his right paw to strike him. 


At that instant moment, the Atheist cried out: 
'Oh my God!'

Time stopped.
The bear froze.
The forest was silent.


As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky.

'You deny my existence for all these years, teach others I don't exist and even credit creation to cosmic accident.' 
'Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament?'

'Am I to count you as a believer?'

The atheist looked directly into the light, and said: 'It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask you to treat me as a Christian now, but perhaps you could make the BEAR a Christian?'


'Very well', said the voice.


The light went out.  The sounds of the forest resumed.  And the bear dropped his right paw, brought both paws together, bowed his head &amp; spoke: 

'Lord bless this food, which I am about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen.'

The other day I went over to a nearby CVS Pharmacy.  When I got there, I went straight to the back of the store to where the Pharmacists’ Counter is located.
  I took out my little brown bottle along with a teaspoon and laid them both onto the counter.

Being I'm a senior  citizen...I guess the Pharmacist just went along with me.  He picked up the spoon and put a tiny bit of the liquid on his tongue and swilled it around.  Then with a stomach-churning look on his face he spit it out on the floor and began coughing.

The pharmacist, shaking his head back and forth with a venomous look in his eyes yelled, “HELL  NO!!!""

I wanted a cake with a cursive B on it! I need a new one."" The baker looks a bit annoyed, but agrees to make another one, once again telling him to come back in a couple days. 

A couple days later, the guy returns. The baker sees him and says, ""Here you are! A cake with a cursive B on it!"" The guy looks at it and says, ""Shit sorry again.... I need a cursive, lower case B! I need a new one."" Even more annoyed, the baker again agrees to make a new one, telling him to come back in a couple days. 

So in a couple days, the guy returns again. The baker sees him and says, ""Here you go.. A cake with a CURSIVE, LOWERCASE B. Right?"" The guy goes, ""It's perfect! Just what I needed!"" 

The baker is relieved and says. ""Great! Would you like a box?""

 One day my Grandma was out, and my Grandpa was in charge of me. 

 I was maybe 2 1/2 years old. Someone had given me a little 'tea set'  as a gift, and it was one of my favorite toys. 

 Grandpa was in the living room engrossed in the evening news when I  brought him a little cup of ""tea,' which was just water. 

After several cups of tea and lots of praise for such yummy tea, my  Grandma came home. 

My Grandpa made her wait in the living room to watch me bring him a cup of tea, because it was 'just the cutest thing!' 
Grandma waited and sure enough, here I came down the hall with a cup of tea for Grandpa, and she watched him drink it up.

The first night, he totally nails everything. Every trick done right, every cue nailed, and everyone has a great time. He does notice a penguin sitting in the front row of the auditorium though, and the whole night, the penguin doesn’t look away or blink- even once.
 
The second night, the magician starts his show, and the penguin is there. This time, the penguin gives away all of the magicians tricks…every trick, every cue- the penguin has figured it out. The audience can’t get enough of the penguin, and the magician finishes the show, furious, and goes to bed.
 
That night, the Cruise ship hits an iceberg, knocking the magician unconscious. When the magician awakens, he is floating on some driftwood, and there, next to him, is that damn penguin.
 
The penguin is staring at the magician, and continues to stare at him…without looking away or blinking, even once…in the 12 hours it takes the rescue crew to come and gather the survivors.
 
Finally, as they board the rescue ship, the penguin looks at the magician, and says-

and shoots the waiter dead. The Panda Bear then

'panda - a large mammal of the Asian mountain
forests related to raccoons and true bears and
characterized by bold black and white markings.

""How about now?"" he asks. ""This journey is taking forever and I cannot wait any longer!"" Flattered, she insists they wait until they arrive in Minnesota. Everyone soon gets back on the bus. 

For a third time, the bus breaks down. The man figures it is not worth bothering his girlfriend a third time. ""She might become annoyed and not want to marry me,"" he thinks. Suddenly, she takes his hand, brings him into the woods and she experiences her first time. 

As they are walking back to the bus, the man cannot help but say: ""That was wonderful. You are a skillful lover! But what made you change your mind about having your first time after the wedding?""

I sadly returned to my desk. Then I asked some of my friends what they planned for the weekend.

""Are you kidding? Strippers?"" I asked

""Yup! I figured you guys might enjoy it. All we have to do is work our butts off until Friday, spend some vacation time, and have a blast!""

At this point I dashed into my boss's room, and begged for those vacation days. He just shook his head, and gave me a disappointed scowl.

This is from a good friend of mine who heard this joke in his home country, and translated it for me. Warning contains slight racism and cursing.
-----------------
A Mom and her 2 Sons were in a pet store, the sons were looking at a parrot whose cage had a sign that read ""Talking parrot only says 2 phrases."" the Mom asked the clerk ""What phrases does the Parrot say?"" the Clerk responds ""I don't know he hasn't said them yet, he will eventually pick 2 phrases to say.""

The Mom buys the bird for her 2 Sons and takes him home. After a few hours of playing with the Bird in the Living Room their father comes home just in time to catch the big Football game, the two sons go outside to play catch.

While outside the one son throws the ball a little too hard and it smashes through the living room window, the Dad goes to the window and screams ""If that shit would of hit me, I would of fucked you up!"" the boys were sent to bed early.

The Dad goes back to watching his game, just as his least favorite player got the ball and starting running he yells at his TV ""Fly Nigga Fly!"" His team eventually won and the Dad goes to bed.

The following Sunday the Family was going to take the Bird to the Vet to get checked out, so they figured they would bring the Bird to Church and head straight to the Vet afterwards.

While at the Church the Bird starts acting up, so the Priest throws a book at the bird. The bird then screams ""If that shit would of hit me, I would of Fucked you up!"" The Priest is appalled by the birds reaction, he says to the bird ""How do you expect to get into Heaven with that mouth?"" the Bird replies ""Fly Nigga Fly!""",Talking Parrot,4

rasslin' on the tube. At the end of the match was an advertisement. 
A loud, obnoxious character came on screaming about $10,000 dollars in
prize money for anyone who could defeat ""The Killer"".

Jake looked at Bubba, a 6' 4"" giant with a brain the size of a pea,
and got an idea. He told Bubba, ""I bet you could beat that guy. He
doesn't look so rough, and you're no wimp."" Bubba thought about it for
a minute and agreed that he probably could.

The next weekend Jake and Bubba went down to the stadium where the
tournament was being held and signed Bubba up. An old man came over
and started briefing them on the rules of the contest and such. Jake,
seeing Bubba was a bit nervous, asked the old man for any tips. The
old man looked up to Bubba and said, ""Just you watch out for his
pretzel hold. Ain't nobody ever gotten out that thing.""
One by one, the contestants ahead of Bubba went in and came back,
balled up and hurting. Two hours after they arrived, it was finally
Bubba's turn. In the ring, right before the bell rang,

Bubba looked back at Jake and said, ""Don't worry, buddy. I can avoid
that pretzel thing."" But not ten seconds after he had gotten up in
the ring, The Killer laying on top of the contorted ball of Bubba, and
the referee was pounding the mat, counting to ten.

Jake screamed and started walking back to the locker rooms. He was
pissed. He had just shelled out $500 to get Bubba in this contest,
and it didn't last 20 seconds. But right before he got to the door,
the crowd went wild! Jake ran back to the ring to see Bubba with one
foot on top of the unconscious Killer and one arm raised in the air by
the referee. Jake ran into the ring and jumped on Bubba. The crowd was out of control, and Jake and Bubba were $10,000 richer!

Later in the locker room, Jake confessed to Bubba that he didn't see what had happened. Bubba said, ""Well, The Killer got me in his pretzel
hold and I thought all was lost. I hurt like I'd never hurt before,
and all I could hear was the ref slamming his hand down and counting to ten. Then I looked up, and front of me was this big, hairy sack of balls. I had nothing to lose and figured it might even help. So I
stretched a little further and bit down as hard as I could on those
things.""

when he bites down on his own balls!""

One dark and stormy night he was traveling back to his hotel when his car died. He got out of the car and opened the hood. He checked everything he could think of and couldn't find what was wrong. He pulled out his phone and discovered he had no service. He looked around and noticed an old monastery nestled in a valley between two mountains. He decided it was his best shot and walked up and knocked on the big front door.

A monk opened the door and asked ""Yes my child?"" the man proceeded to explain that his car broke down and wondered if the monk could help. The monk explained to the man that there were 2 monks at the monastery who used to be mechanics, the monk then told the man to come in and eat dinner with them while the monks worked on his car. The man agreed and ate wonderful homemade soup and homemade bread with the monks. The head monk came to the man at the end of dinner and told him that his car wouldn't be ready till morning, but they had a free room that he could sleep him. The man agreed and after a few moments, the head monk lead the man to his room.

The man laid in the most comfortable bed he had ever been in and quickly fell asleep. In the middle of the night he awoke to the most beautiful noise he had ever heard. He couldn't identify what the noise was. The noise eventually stopped and the man laid back down and went quickly back to sleep. In the morning the head monk tapped on his door and told the man that his car was ready. The man thanked him and asked ""What was that beautiful noise I heard last night?"" the head monk apologized to the man and explained ""I am sorry, but I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk."" the man tried again but the monk told him once again that he could not tell him. The man was disappointed but moved on with his life and went home.


10 years later he decided that he had such a great time in the mountains of Eastern Europe he would go back.

Then, one dark and stormy night the man was traveling back to his hotel when his car died. He got out of the car and opened the hood. He checked everything he could think of and couldn't find what was wrong. He pulled out his phone and discovered he had no service. He looked around and noticed the old monastery nestled in the valley between two mountains. The man realized that he had been here before. He decided that the monks had helped him before, maybe they'd help him again.

A monk opened the door and asked ""Yes my child?"" the man proceeded to tell the monk that he had been there 10 years previous and his car died then, and his car died again and asked if the monk could help. The monk invited the man in for dinner while the former mechanics looked at his car. The man agreed and ate the wonderful homemade soup and the wonderful homemade bread with the monks once again. The head monk came to the man at the end of dinner and told him that his car wouldn't be ready till morning, but they had a free room that he could sleep him. The man agreed and the head monk lead the man to his room.

The man opened the door and realized it was the same room. The man laid in the most comfortable bed he had laid in for ten years and quickly fell asleep. In the middle of the night he awoke once again to the most beautiful noise he had ever heard. He couldn't identify what the noise was. The noise eventually stopped and the man laid back down and went back to sleep. In the morning the head monk tapped on his door and told the man that his car was ready. The man thanked him and asked ""I'm sorry but I have to ask, what was that beautiful noise I heard last night?"" the head monk apologized to the man and explained once again ""I am sorry, but I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk."" the man tried again and again but the monk told him once again that he could not tell him. The man was disappointed and slightly angered but moved on with his life and went home.


Ten years later he decided to go back to Eastern Europe once again.

Then, on the last dark and stormy night the man was there, he was traveling back to his hotel when his car died once again. He got out of the car and opened the hood. He checked everything he could think of and couldn't find what was wrong. He pulled out his phone and discovered he had no service. He looked around and noticed the old monastery nestled in the valley between two mountains. The man realized that he had been here before. He decided that the monks had helped him before, maybe they'd help him again.

A monk opened the door and asked ""Yes my child?"" the man proceeded to tell the monk that he had been there 10 years previous and 20 years previous and his car died then, and his car died again and asked if the monk could help. The monk invited the man in for dinner while the former mechanics looked at his car. The man agreed and ate the wonderful homemade soup and the wonderful homemade bread with the monks once again. The head monk came to the man at the end of dinner and told him that his car wouldn't be ready till morning, but they had a free room that he could sleep him. The man agreed and the head monk lead the man to his room.

The man opened the door and realized it was the same room. The man laid in the most comfortable bed he had laid in for ten years and quickly fell asleep.

The man was disappointed and slightly angered but moved on with his life and decided to go home. As the man opened his car door he turned around and knocked on the door again.

The head monk answered ""Yes my child?"" and the man said that he had to know what the noise was. The monk explained once again ""I'm sorry but I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk."" The man would not take no for an answer this time and asked the head monk what it would take to become a monk. The head monk told the man to go out and count every blade of grass on earth. And the man looked at the head monk and decided it was worth it.

For 10 long years the man traveled the world counting every blade of grass. He counted in yards, he looked in fields, and he even found some in laboratories. Sometimes the wind would blow and he'd have to start all over again and sometimes people would be mowing the grass and he'd get confused by the clippings. The man eventually found what he was sure was the correct number of blades of grass on Earth.

The man returned to the monastery and knocked on the door, the head monk answered the door ""Yes my child?"" the man handed the monk the count of the blades of grass and the monk looked over it and said ""Yes my child, you are correct."" The man jumped for joy and asked ""So I'm a monk now?"" and the monk said ""No my child, I am sorry but you are not yet a monk, first you must count every grain of sand on Earth.""

For 10 long years the man traveled the world counting every grain of sand. He counted in sandboxes, he looked in the vast deserts, and he even looked at the golf courses. Sometimes the wind would blow and he'd have to start all over again and sometimes the water would wash away the sand at the beaches. The man eventually found what he was sure was the correct number of grains of sand on Earth.

The man returned to the monastery and knocked on the door, the head monk answered the door ""Yes my child?"" the man handed the monk the count of the grains of sand and the monk looked over it and said ""Yes my child, you are correct."" The man jumped for joy and asked ""So I'm a monk now?"" and the monk said ""No my child, I am sorry but you are not yet a monk, first you must count all the stars in the sky."" The man was angry, but decided it was worth it.

For 10 long years the man traveled the world counting every star in the sky. He counted every night. Sometimes he would lose track and sometimes he'd fall asleep. The man eventually found what he was sure was the correct number of stars in the sky.

The man returned to the monastery and knocked on the door, the head monk answered the door ""Yes my child?"" the man handed the monk the count of the blades of grass and the monk looked over it and said ""Yes my child, you are correct."" The man jumped for joy and asked ""So I'm a monk now?"" and the monk said ""Yes my child."" The man asked ""Well what is the beautiful noise?"" the monk told him that the noise is behind the large wooden door in the main hall.

The man went to the door and pulled on the door for hours, then the door popped slightly open. The man continued to pull on the door for 3 days and then the wooden door opened.

He looked inside and saw a larger bronze door. He began pulling on the bronze door and after the man pulled on the door for a week it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for a month at the end of the month the door was open enough for him to slip through.

He looked inside and saw an even larger silver door. He began pulling on the silver door and after the man pulled on the door for a month and it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for a year at the end of the year the door was open enough for him to slip through.

He looked inside and saw a still larger gold steel door. He began pulling on the steel door and after the man pulled on the door for a year it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for years and years at the end of the decade the door was open enough for him to slip through.

He looked inside and saw an incredibly large golden door. He began pulling on the gold door and after the man pulled on the door for a decade it creaked open slightly, after all of this a crowd began to form, wanting to see the man pulling on the door forever. He kept pulling on the door for 20 long years and eventually door was open enough for him to get through and it swung smoothly out the rest of the way.

And then he saw what was making the beautiful noise.

-------

Oh, I guess you want me to tell you what made the beautiful noise. But I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.

A day later he decides to give it one last go, but onhis way next door, he sees the China-man leading a bull down the drive-way,
...pause..., and then put his left ear next to the bull's butt.

Steve Austin, Rick Rude, and Paul E. Dangerously are car pooling together, on their way to a wrestling gig. Now, Steve Austin has a habit of swearing...a LOT. Particularly, taking the Lord's name in vein. He's riding shotgun, Paul is driving, and Rick Rude's in the back. Steve's talking, just shootin' the breeze;

""Ah well hell. This god damn chicken tastes like god damn shit. Who in their right god damn mind would eat this shit?""

So Austin and Paul are laughing, and having a good ol' god damn time. Meanwhile, Rude, an apparent devout Christian in real life is in the back seat turning red. Veins were popping out of his forehead, and the only thing missing was stream coming out from his ears.

Finally, after one too many ""god damns,"" Rude snaps, and says ""PULL THE CAR OVER PAUL!""

So they pull over to the side of the road, and The Ravishing One says to Stone Cold ""Steve, MUST YOU TAKE THE FUCKING LORD'S NAME IN VEIN?!""

Austin instantly feels bad. He apologizes, ""I'm sorry Rick. I had no idea you felt so strongly about religion. I was just shootin' the breeze, trying to have fun, but if it offends you, I will not say that phrase again.""

Rude says ""Thank you very much Steve.""

""Bah,"" said the old man, ""you're full of it woman.""

The next day, the wife woke up early and began to prepare lunch for the day. She had a fresh chicken with the guts removed, when suddenly, an idea struck her. She went into the bedroom, carefully pulled back her husband's boxers, and put the chicken guts inside. ""That'll teach him to fart all the time,"" she thought.

A few minutes later, the wife heard a shriek coming from the bedroom. Snickering, the wife waited until her husband appeared in the kitchen. ""What happened?"" she asked innocently.

""You know how you said if I kept farting eventually I would fart my guts out?"" the husband replied. ""Well, it happened this morning, but luckily with the help of some Vaseline I managed to get them all back in again.""",The gassy old man,3

The bartender accepts again, thinking that there was no way that the man could produce a better trick. He proceeds to pull a bullfrog out of his pants pocket and sets it down next to the rat. The rat begins to play a different song, and the bullfrog starts to sing along in a crystal clear voice. The bartender is once again amazed, and agrees to pay for the man's drinks for the rest of the night.

An hour later, the man is enjoying his free drinks when a stranger comes up to the man and offers to buy the bullfrog for $100,000. ""Sorry, he's not for sale,"" replies the man. The stranger offers to pay $500,000, and the man reluctantly sells the bullfrog and takes the money. The stranger leaves with glee, and the bartender is furious.

""That frog could've been worth millions of dollars to you, maybe even billions, but you sold it off for a mere five hundred thousand dollars!""

A Baptist Cowboy
A cowboy, who just moved to Wyoming from Texas, walks into a bar and orders three mugs of Bud.
H e sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn.
When he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more.
The bartender approaches and tells the cowboy, ""You know, a mug goes flat after I draw it. It would taste better if you bought one at a time.""
 
The cowboy replies, ""Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is an Airborne Ranger, the other is a Navy Seal, both serving overseas somewhere. When we all left our home in Texas, we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank together. So I'm drinking one beer for each of my brothers and one for myself.""
The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there.
The cowboy becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way.
He orders three mugs and drinks them in turn.
One day, he comes in and only orders two mugs.
All the regulars take notice and fall silent.
When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, ""I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss.""
The cowboy looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns in his eyes and he laughs.
""Oh, no, everybody's just fine,"" he explains, ""It's just that my wife and I joined the Baptist Church and I had to quit drinking.""
""Hasn't affected my brothers though....""

""I can't possibly do that,"" said the Pope.

""Not even for 100,000 dollars?"" asked the Colonel.

""No, not for 100,000 dollars,"" replied the Pope.

Six months on and KFC sales were declining still further. The Colonel was getting desperate and made another call to the Pope. This time he offered 500,000 dollars for the words of the Lord's Prayer to be changed to ""Give us this day a daily chicken.""

Again the Pope refused, ""I can't possibly change the wording of the Lord's Prayer from bread to chicken,"" he repeated.

Another 6 months and KFC sales had reached an all time low. The company was in danger of going out of business. Colonel Sanders made one last attempt to persuade the Pope to change the wording of the Lord's Prayer.

""I'll donate 50 million dollars to the Vatican if you change the word 'bread' to 'chicken' in the Lord's Prayers.""

""That's a lot of money,"" conceded the Pope.

""So you'll do it?""

""I'll have to discuss it with the cardinals.""

So the Pope called a meeting of the cardinals.

""Ah, oui? What do zey say?""

""For example: Thou shalt not commit adultery""

""Oh, non, non, merci, non"", and they send the Angel on his way.



The Angel then goes to the Germans:

""I have new Commandments from God.""

""Ja? Vat do they say?""

""Well for example: Thou shalt not kill""

The Germans shake their heads, ""I think's not, nein, danke!""


The Angel, perturbed, goes to the Jews and says:

""I have new Commandments from God...""

""How much?""

However, you can't all get the job. This final interview will decide who gets the job. I will ask you all the same question, and whoever has the best response gets the job."" 

All of the applicants look at each other and then back at the interviewer. With one final nod to all four of them, he begins the final interview.

""Your final question is..."" the interviewer says, ""...what is the fastest thing in the universe?""

The first applicant sat for no more than a minute to think about his answer. Finally he says, ""A thought! We have thousands a day, and they are so quick, you don't even realize that you are thinking about something sometimes.""

The interviewer repeats the question to the next person.

The second applicant, after short deliberation, says, ""A blink! Much like thoughts, we have several thousand per day and we barely recognize its happening. It has to be so quick that it can stop anything from harming your eye in an instant.""

The interviewer repeats the question to the next person. 

The third applicant says confidently, ""Light. The speed of light it so fast that humans literally cannot reach it ever. It's hard to even fathom the speed of light, but it when you walk into a room and flick on a light it seems instantaneous.""

The interviewer, very impressed by the level of thought that each of the applicants has given with their responses, turns to the final applicant and says, ""Well, what do you think is the fastest thing in the universe?""

Almost immediately the fourth applicant says, ""Diharrea.""

Confused and taken aback, the interviewer says, ""Well I don't know what you could possibly mean by that, but do you care to explain yourself?""

The final applicant nods and explains, ""Diharrea is the quickest thing in the universe because before you can even think, blink, or turn on a fuckin' light, you've already shit your pants.""",Four equally qualified applicants interview for a job position...,21
