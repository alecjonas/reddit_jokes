A man gets a logging job at a remote village. He's nervous when he gets there though, because he sees no women and he's signed up for 6 months without leave, and he went see any action for at least that long.

After the first day he goes to the local bar. The bartender asks how he likes it so far. He says the work is hard, but satisfying. He said, though, that he's concerned with not having any women around.

The bartender looks around and says 'it's okay, here's what you do... On the edge of town is a barrel. When you're ready, go to the barrel and do your business right in the hole on the side.'

The guy things he's crazy, but after a couple weeks he notices more than a few guys head that direction, and always come back happy. 

After a couple more weeks he has had enough. He waits until it's clear and he goes out to the barrel. He's nervous, but he finds the whole and just decides to go for it. He pulls down his pants and after a little warm up does his business in the barrel hole. The thing is, it turns out to be amazing. He can't even believe how good it feels.

The next night he confesses to the bartender that he finally broke down, and he is amazed how good it was. The bartender says 'Todd ya so. But you just have to follow the rules.'

'okay, whatever man,"" the guy says ""that was fucking awesome. How often can I go?""

Bartender says ""Any day except Tuesday night ""

""Why is that?"" the guy asks ""is that when they can the barrel?""

""No,"" the bartender says with a knowing smile, ""that's your night in the barrel!""

So they go to the apartment that is right on the top of the building, they open the door and ... no mice whatsoever.

The landlord angrily asks the tenant why he so blatantly made him walk to the top of three story high flat and pointed that this was very rude of him, but the tenant replied:

-Wait, wait, wait...

He put some cheese on the ground, turned off the lights, turned on the lights and really, they saw 2-3 little mice. But they were so small, that one would say they were even cute.

-Are these the mice you were telling me about - the landlord says - these are not mice, these are a bunch of adorable animals. I'd say that even a lone person as you can pick a cage, put a small wheel inside and look after them as pets.

-No, wait, wait, wait... - the tenant replied

He put some cheese on the ground, turned off the lights, turned on the lights and they saw 4-5 now really big rats, with fat pink tails. A very unpleasant sight. And the landlord said:

-Well... it's not like there are no mice at all, but we'll get some poison and deal with the issue

-No, wait, wait, wait... - the tenant replied

He put some cheese on the ground, turned off the lights, turned on the lights and 15 huge rats, very shaggy and nasty looking, freshly fed with shit were now surrounding the cheese.

-Okay... there ARE mice here - the landlord said - We'll call pest control, we'll lower your rent a bit, don't worry about it.

-No, wait, wait, wait... - the tenant interrupted

He put some cheese on the ground, turned off the lights, turned on the lights and what they saw was beyond imaginable. One feet diameter ball of mice, rats and all sorts of rodents fighting over the cheese and in the whole bustle of animals they saw a catfish flopping towards the cheese and the landlord asks confused:

-Okay I get the rodents, but what is this catfish doing here?

And the tenant said:

-That's the other problem I wanted to talk to you about - the humidity.

You know the owner very well, Mr. Runn, and his Cafe is somewhat magical. All the food comes to life! The coffee tries to encourage your day but is just as tired as you are. The pies are shivering in the cooler where they rest until they are sold. Every food item has a face and a personality.

As you enter, you notice there's a new person behind the counter. You read his nametag, and it says ""Oren"".

""Hello, Oren?"" You ask.

""Yes, I'm Oren Grant."" He says, ""I'm filling in for Mr. Runn.""

""Nice to meet you, I'd like a pancake.""

He begins pouring a pancake onto the grill. A face emerges and it giggles. It is quite cute.

""So how do you know Mr. Runn?"" You ask.

""Oh...uh...I work just next door."" He hesitates. ""I'm a butcher. Mr. Runn asked me to come in and cover this morning. Not sure why.""

You notice he's quite nervous, and not very good at making food. While the pancake is cooking, the butcher starts to knead some dough he had thrown together. It also produces a face, but it has the likenesses of down syndrome.

Quite some time passes and you become worried about your food being burnt.

""Is my pancake ready?""

""Pancake, are you ready?"" Oren asks over his shoulder.

""I'm a crepe!"" The pancake says excitedly.

The dough also gets excited, ""IM a WEIRD DOUGH!""

""What the hell am I doing here?"" the butcher asks under his breath. ""I don't belong here.""

Oren pulls your crepe off the grill and hands it to you and heads outside, never to be seen again.

post,elg17f,2qh72,jokes,false,1578424058,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/elg17f/the_perfect_couple/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, a perfect man and a perfect woman met.
After a perfect courtship, they had a perfect wedding.
Their life together was, of course, perfect.
One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve, this perfect couple was driving their perfect car along a winding road, when they noticed someone at the side of the road in distress.

Being the perfect couple, they stopped to help.
There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle.

Soon they were driving along delivering the toys.
 Unfortunately, the driving conditions deteriorated and the perfect couple and Santa Claus had an accident.
Only one of them survived the accident.
Question: Who was the survivor?

(Scroll down for the answer. Trust me, it's worth it)

**Answer:**    

The perfect woman survived. She's the only one who really existed in the first place. Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus and there is no such thing as a perfect man.

*** Women*** *stop reading here, that is the end of the joke.*

*** Men keep scrolling.***

 So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the woman must have been driving. This explains why there was a car accident.

Madam asked: 'Boy, what is your problem?'

The Boy answered, 'I'm too smart for the first grade - my sister is in the third grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 4th Grade!'

Madam had enough. She took the Boy to the principal's office. While the Boy waited in the outer office, madam explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Madam he would give the boy a test and if he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the first-grade and behave. She agreed.

The Boy was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test.

Principal: What is 3 x 3? Boy.: 9.

Principal: What is 6 x 6? Boy.: 36.

And so it went with every question the principal thought a 4th grade should know.
The principal looks at Madam and tells her, 'I think the boy can go to the 4th grade.'

Madam says to the principal, 'I have some of my own questions.
Can I ask him ?' The principal and Boy both agreed.

Madam asks, 'What does a cow have four of that I have only two of'?
Boy, after a moment 'Legs.'

Madam: 'What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?'
Boy.: 'Pockets.'

Madam: What starts with a C and ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin whitish liquid?
Boy.: Coconut

Madam: What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?

Boy.: Bubblegum

Madam: What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?

Boy.: Shake hands

Madam: You stick your poles inside me. You tie me down to get me up. I get wet before you do.
Boy.: Tent

Madam: A finger goes in me. You fiddle with me when you're bored. The best man always has me first.
The Principal was looking restless, a bit tense and took one large Patiala Vodka peg.
Boy.: Wedding Ring

Madam: I come in many sizes. When I'm not well, I drip. When you blow me, you feel good.
Boy.: Nose

Madam: I have a stiff shaft. My tip penetrates. I come with a quiver.
Boy.: Arrow

Madam: What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?
Boy.: Firetruck

Madam: What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' &amp; if you don't get it, you have to use your hand.

It was a girl and she was in trouble. I knew she was, ’cause she said so.

We kept on the pavement, because there was a sign that said: “Keep Death Off Our Roads”.

Then we were out of the city. I knew it, because we were not hitting so many pedestrians.

As we came to her house, she greeted me with a burning kiss. Then she took the cigarette out and kissed me again.

She pointed two thirty-eights at me. She also had a gun.


 
She had the most beautiful blonde hair I have ever seen – hanging from her left nostril.

She had teeth like the ten commandments – all broken.

She also had the most beautiful eyes – so beautiful that the one eye could not stop looking at the other one.

There was a man on the floor. He had stab wounds in his heart, bullet wounds in his head and his wrists were slashed. He was dead.


 
I said: “Lady, if this man was alive, he sure would be ill”. So I took her for a drive to calm her nerves.

Suddenly a brick came flying through the window and hit her on the left breast – breaking three of my fingers.

We had a flat tire, so I pumped and she pumped and I pumped. Then we got out and fixed the flat tire.

Then I took her home and as I was kissing her goodnight, her father opened the door and stepped on my back, almost breaking it.

A Captain takes over a command during WW2 in the middle of the Pacific.

As he is looking through the reports, he finds morale in the basement, a few desertions, and the base is rampant with STD's.

He calls his top Sergeant in for an explanation.  The sergeant looks embarrassed and says. ""Spotted snakes, sir,""

""Spotted snakes?"".

""Yes, sir.  Spotted snakes."" The Sergeant said, ""You see, they are about 4 feet long, kinda fuzzy with black and white spots, but they have a very powerful and deadly poison and the men are afraid of them.

""I see,"" said the Captain, ""Call a formation in 2 hours and I will show you how to handle this minor problem.""

Two hours later, the Captain walks out in front of the formation and everyone is shocked and amazed that the Captain has one of these snakes in his hands.

""Gentlemen,"" the Captain began ""It seems that these things are a major concern in this camp.  However, I will show you how to handle this in a proper military manner.""

""You grab the snake with your left hand like so.""  He demonstrates by holding up his left hand.

""You grab the snake with your right hand."" again demonstrating with his right hand.

You then, forcefully, slide your left hand up like so,"" and the Captain popped the head off of the snake killing it instantly.

The men all mutter amongst themselves and agree that this is a simple and effective way of dealing with the problem.

The next reports come out and morale is at a record high, there have been no desertions and the STD's are almost nonexistent.

However, he does see one of his men is in the hospital.  Being the good company commander that he is, he goes to sickbay to look in on his soldier.

He is shocked to see the man is covered from head to toe in bandages.

""Son,"" the Captain said, ""What  happened?""

The soldier replied, ""Spotted snakes, sir.""

""Spotted snakes did THIS?""

""Well, you see, sir,"" the soldier stated, ""I had the night watch a few nights ago and I felt one of these snakes crawl into my foxhole.  I did just as you said, sir.  I grabbed that snake with my left hand.  I grabbed that snake with my right hand.  I slid my left hand up, and I'll be damned if I didn't stick my thumb right up that tiger's ass.""",Spotted Snakes,27

He left his hotel early and found a good spot by sun-up. He had the most expensive equipment money could buy.

He missed a few ducks, but then shot one. It flapped a couple times and landed across a fence in a field. He started to cross the fence to get it when a farmer pulled up on his tractor.

""Whoa there, buddy. You can't come onto my land.""

The lawyer said, ""Of course I can. That duck belongs to me and I have every right to retrieve it.""

Farmer Brown said, ""Nope, it's on my property, that makes it *mine*.""

The lawyer immediately got pissed and told him, ""I'll have you know that I'm one of the best lawyers, not only in Chicago, but in the entire state of Illinois. If you do not allow me to get my property I'll sue you and end up owning everything you have to your name!""

The farmer said, ""Slow down, buddy, it's just a duck. We usually settle petty arguments like this around here with the 'three kick rule,' if you wanna try that.""

Lawyer said, ""What's the three kick rule?""

Farmer said, ""That's where we take turns kicking each other three times, then the other person gets three kicks. The one who gives up first loses.""

The lawyer looked at farmer Brown. He thought to himself, ""I go to the gym three times a week, I jog nearly every day, I keep in shape. There's no way this fat old Alabama bastard can beat me at anything physical.""

The lawyer said, ""That sounds fine to me, I'll do it.""

Farmer said, ""Ok. Since it's on my property, I get to kick first.""

The lawyer braced himself.

That farmer reared back his size 12 steel-toed work boot and planted it directly in that lawyer's nuts, giving his family jewels a shock he'd never thought possible. The lawyer dropped to his knees in immediate agony.

The farmer's second kick went right to the lawyer's stomach, and everything inside him came up in a surging stream of regurgitation.

Then the farmer strolled around behind him and kicked him in his ass so hard the lawyer fell face-first into the puddle of his own vomitus, spittle and tears.

That lawyer lay, gasping for breath, for several minutes before he could move. He shakily managed to get to his feet. He wiped the slobber off his face with his sleeve and glared at that farmer until he finally struggled to speak, almost in a whisper:

""Now it's *my* turn.""

The cop is a bit taken aback and asks if there's anything else Caray needs to tell him. ""As a matter of fact, I've got an unlicensed weapon in the glove compartment."" The cop is starting to get worried and asks Caray to step out of the vehicle. Harry does and tells him ""By the way, there's a dead body in the trunk, too."" The cop is frazzled and tells him he has to call in backup to help search the car.

As they're doing so, the backup officer turns to him and says, ""Mr. Caray, my partner said you told him this car is stolen, you've got a weapon in the glove compartment and a dead body in the trunk, and none of that is true.""

Caray then says: ""And I bet that son-of-a-bitch is going to say I was speeding, too!""

Old mate was on a plane, pleased with himself because he was in First Class, when he noticed a bit of a kerfuffle near the doorway. The plane had been delayed a little which added to the curiosity so he is rubber necking a bit when he sees a big hat makes it’s way through the portal. He is astounded to see that attached to the hat is His Holiness, The Pope. 

Not being at all religious old mate is a bit shocked at how much he is Fan-Boying inside, but he resolves to keep it in and be on his best behaviour. 

His Holiness sits down beside the man and they politely greet each other while the plane taxies. After it takes off the pope opens up a crosswords book and starts working through one. It causes him much frowning and muttering under his breath and eventually he asks old mate “*Excuse me my son but perhaps you can help me, pertaining to the female, four letters ending in unt*.”

Now old mate is normally a bit coarse but he’s on his best behavior so instead of providing The Pope with an answer he politely declines. 

About an hour later out of nowhere he starts and says “*Oh, your Holiness. Aunt*!”

His Holiness looks down at his crossword, sucks in air between his teeth and says “*oh. Right. Do you have an eraser?”*","Old Mate meets His Holiness, The Pope.",3

""Fine, I witnessed the theft from inside the lamp, but the rules tend to favor the one who actually rubs the lamp. But, seeing as how it was a real dick move,  I have decided on a solution that may be equitable.""

""I will grant the one who found the lamp the three wishes, and the one who stole the lamp will be given the exact same wishes that are requested...but the effects or amounts will be doubled, since he actually rubbed the lamp and freed me.""

The lamp thief began to protest; but his former friend, the finder, quickly spoke up...

""I want 100 tons of diamonds and gold!!!""

The jinn said solemnly, ""As you wish...""

*POOF!* The man was surrounded by huge stacks of shiny gold bars and piles of twinkling diamonds, and the thief was surrounded by exactly twice as much...200 tons of gold and diamonds!

The thief nodded at his buddie, he was now happy with this arrangement.

""Next, great jinn, I want the love of a beautiful woman!""

""As you wish...""

*POOF!* A gorgeous woman appeared at his side, giggling as she hugged him tight and kissed him on the cheek.

The thief found himself flanked by two equally beautiful women!

""Speak now your final wish!""

The man looked at his old friend the thief, and smiled wickedly.

""Lastly, Mr. Jinn...would you please beat me half to death?""

""As you wish...""","Two old friends were walking down the beach, and one spots an ancient-looking oil lamp.",35

He goes up to the monastery and before he can even ask for help, the monks invite him in, they feed him a delicious dinner, they let him sleep the night, and in the morning, before breakfast, they inform him that they fixed his car overnight. 

But during the night, the man had heard a strange noise coming from deep within the monastery. The noise was beautiful and yet haunting— once he had heard it, he knew he wouldn’t be able to get it out of his head. And the man could not begin to identify in his mind what was making the noise. So in the morning, over breakfast, the man asks the monks:

“Hey, what was making that sound from within the monastery?”

“We’re very sorry,” they reply, “we cannot tell you, because you’re not a monk.”

After a moment of pause the man accepts this. “Well, fair enough, I guess. Thank you so much for everything you’ve done for me.” And, after the monks refuse to accept any form of payment for their hospitality, the man leaves. 

One year later, to the day, the same man, driving the same car, at the same time of night, breaks down in front of the same monastery.

Everything happens as it had the year before. The monks invite him in, feed him, let him spend the night, fix the car, and overnight, the man hears the same sound coming from within the monastery. Hearing it again after all this time, the man now lays awake all night. It’s as if the sound is calling out to him. By the time morning comes, one thing is clear: the man will never be satisfied until he knows what the source of the sound was. 

So in the morning he asks again. And again, the monks tell him that since he is not a monk, they cannot tell him. 

“Alright,” he says, “you’ve interested me. What do I have to do to become a monk?”

“You have to go around the world,” they reply, “without using any type of vehicle that has an engine. And in your travels, you have to count the number of people you see. You do not have to count the number of people in the world— but you need to count the number of people you see, while you go around the world.”

The man sets off. He begins traveling immediately after finishing breakfast. Since he cannot use a vehicle with an engine, he figures that his best bet is to use a bicycle to travel the land distances, but the bulk of his journey would happen using a sail boat. 

He plots his course, and then navigates it. And with every person he saw, he added to his count. Every person he passed while traveling on the road. Every person in every car that passed him. All the people in the port before he set sail. All the people in the port where he landed. And so on. 

Finally, after a great deal of time spent traveling and counting people, he arrives back at the monastery. His car is still parked there. He walks right past it without casting it a second glance, and he knocks on the door of the monastery. 

“Welcome home,” a monk greets him.

“I made the journey,” the man says, “I saw Four hundred and seventy nine thousand, seven hundred and sixty two people, including you.” 

“Excellent,” says the monk, as he embraces the man and leads him into the monastery, “then you are home. You are a monk now. And as such...” the man pulls out a key which he carries on a necklace around his neck, “you can find what you sought.”

The monk hands the man the key and leads him to a wooden door. The door’s surface is worn, but strong. It has been the guardian of the source of the sound for a very long time. The man unlocks the door, and behind the door is a long hallway. Hundreds of yards long, so that it must go deep into the mountain that the monastery sits at the foot of. He begins to walk down it, then he starts to run. He’s almost there. He can hear the sound growing louder. 

At the end of the hallway is a large, steel door. The kind of door that would secure a bank vault. The monk— who the man had not heard running behind him— tells the man the combination. Turn right five times and lan in ninety one. Turn left four times, land on sixty eight. Right three times to eleven. Finally, left twice, landing on zero. 

The locking mechanism clicks and the vault door unlocks. The man turns the handle and pulls back, revealing another, darker hallway. Halfway down this hallway, it opens up into a cavern. But through the cavern, there is a well lit and well worn path— worn by the feet of all those who have seen the source of the sound. The sound, which was growing louder with ever step. He was so close. 

The man arrives at the end of the path. There was a round stone door— similar to the type of door that sealed Jesus’ tomb. The man goes to one side of the door and pushes with all the strength he has left just to make the door budge, but once he has it rolls the rest of the way to the side. 

Exhausted, the man now staggers into yet another, much shorter hallway which is only about fifteen yards in length. At the end of this hallway is a curtain. The man peels the curtain to the side, and is amazed. He’s done it. He’s seen the source of the sound. 

It was a man, with red hair. He wore a suit jacket over a striped shirt. And he was singing:

Pekka is enjoying the party, but after a few bottles of the moonshine he brought, Pekka finds himself in the need of a toilet. He asks the hostess where the toilet might be located. She notices he’s a bit drunk, so she points and explains very carefully:

“Go out in the hall there, take the second door on your right, and be careful, there are three steps down, and there you’ll find the toilet.”

Pekka thanks the lady as politely as he can, and wanders off in the opposite direction. He finds a door, slams it open, and walks straight in without a care in the world, and finds himself tumbling down 17 meters in an empty elevator shaft. A bit confused after the fall, he stands up, brushes some dust off his shirt, and exclaims:

The devil says that there are 3 other people here that have done less bad than Trump, so Trump gets to decide which one goes to heaven so he can take their place.

The devil opens 3 doors, the first door has Richard Nixon in it. Nixon is swimming around a big pool nonstop.

The devil asked Trump if he would like to take Nixon's place.

Trump declined, and said that he was not a very good swimmer, and would get tired way to quickly.

The devil moves on, and opens the second door. Inside this room is Andrew Jackson. Andrew Jackson was running on the treadmill for eternity. The devil once again asked Trump if he would like to take his place.

""NO WAY""!, said Trump. ""I get very dehydrated and my ankles swell up when I run, even if I run for 1 minute"".

So, the devil led Trump to the last room. Inside this room was Bill Clinton, sitting on a chair, arms over his head, legs spread eagle. Also in the room was Melania Trump, sucking Bill Clinton real good.

The devil asked Trump one more time which room he choses, and who he would like to take the place of.

Trump, without hesitation, choses room #3.

Now, the devil snaps his fingers, and Melania floats off into heaven.",Trump dies and goes to hell.,45

""That's okay! I'll do anything for me to see my beloved Marie just one last time!""

As promised, Richard was now turned into a spider. He takes a piece of spider silk from his backside, sticks is to a cloud, and then he jumps off the cloud, slowly making his way towards Earth as he dangles down from his string of silk. 

Nearing Earth, he faintly hears the voice of his wife calling out to him.

""Ri...d""

""Marie! I'm coming to you! I'm almost there!""

But then, the silk string suddenly stops, and Richards remains motionless in the air, still not close enough to his wife.

""No! Not now! I am so close, I must see my Marie just one last time!""

With all his might, Richard starts to squeeze and strain himself, trying to force more string out of him. Little by little, he gets closer towards Earth again, huffing and puffing to force the silk out of him.

""Ric..rd! Ri..chard!"" He hears his wife yelling out to him in the distance.

""Marie! I'm almost there! I'm almost.. there! SO... CLOSE!""

A short time later, a dog trotted up to the window, saw the sign, and went inside.
After going inside, the dog looked at the receptionist and wagged his tail, then he walked over to the sign, looked at it, and whined. The receptionist got the idea and told the office manager. The office manager looked at the dog and was surprised, to say the least. However, the dog looked determined, so the manager led the dog into his office. 

Inside, the dog jumped up onto a chair and started patiently staring at the manager. The manager said, “I can’t hire you. The sign says that you have to be able to type.”  The dog jumped down, walked over to a computer and typed out a perfect letter and then signed his name. The manager was stunned but then told the dog, “I still can’t hire you. The sign says that you have to be good with computers too.” The dog then went over to the computer and typed up a program that ran perfectly on the first test.
By now, the manager was totally dumbfounded and said to the dog, “I realize that you are a very intelligent dog and you have some interesting skills. However, I still can’t give you the job.” 
The dog jumped down and walked over to the sign and put his paw on the part where it said ‘equal opportunity employer’.

The manager said, “Yes, but the sign also says that you have to be bilingual.” 

The dog calmly looked up at the manager and said, “Meow.”",A local business owner was looking for office help.,57

""You really should have asked for directions."",Minny yelled.  

""My GP—"" Van started but was interrupted.  

""IF YOU MENTION YOUR GPS ONE MORE TIME I WILL DIVORCE YOU.""  
 
""That nice lady at Radiator Springs even offered us a map, but you had to babble about your goddamned GPS. And now we're here. LOST."" 

(I used up all my writing skills by this point.)

So, anyway lost in the desert, during the cold night, they have some sexy time to heat things up.

After a few days of being lost, and almost running out of fuel, they finally find their way into a town, have some premium diesel at a restaurant and get back home. 

By now Lighting McQueen is a world sensation and Radiator Springs, the place is his racing team's headquarter. 

Now the events of that fateful night in the desert lead to the birth of our protagonist, son of Van and Minny. Knowing that it was the events at Radiator Springs that led to his birth, Van and Minny name his son Blinking McQueen after Lightning McQueen. 


Now Blinking is a prodigy. He's a genius, top of his class - called the Vanstein, boasts herculean strength, and despite being a van no one can beat him on the track. He's called the next coming of Lighting McQueen, his namesake. 

Everyone expects him to be the next racing sensation. But Blinking doesn't want to. He knows, if he gets on the track he'll always be called the new Lighting McQueen. He'll never be known as himself. He'll only be remembered as someone else's successor.  

So, when he joins the Cricket team in his second year in high school, everyone is shocked. But then again he's a prodigy. Whatever he touches turns to gold. In his first match, a 20 over game, against the seniors' team's, against their captain, a prodigal bowler, the school's gem, he hits six sixes in the first over, going on to hit a century in his first game and singlehandedly winning them the game. 

The very next day, the local cricket team, Yorkshire, playing in the first division, whose coach was there to scout the school team's captain, offers Blinking a long term contract. He needs to play just 6 games during his highschool life, earning 16k a week during that time, if he commits to a 8 year deal. Blinking accepts a deal. And he's just 15 at this point.

He goes through high school like a Lightsaber through butter, topping every class and the nationals before joining with Yorkshire for whom he has 4 centuries and 568 runs in 6 games. 

Now at this point he's already caught the eye of the national team coach, and despite not having played for the U-15s or U-18s, on the recommendation of the National team coach, he gets called up to the England 23s team at 18. The older guys aren't very fond of this and decide to show him the reality of life on the first day of training. But it is them who realise the reality - that that guy is a prodigy, the protagonist of the story and they are just the fringe characters when he sends every other ball they throw at him past the boundary.   

Within 2 months he's called up to the national team, for the Ashes nonetheless. And he destroys Australia, helping England win it an joint record 3-2 scoring a behemoth 734 runs. At 18.

Now he's already a legend. Already being compared to the legendary batsman Sir Donald Broadway.

The world cups comes next. Now 21, he guides England to victory with 678  runs breaking Searching TenderCar's record of 674 in a single tournament.   

At 21 his name is already being touted for knighthood. But it isn't untill the next world cup, where as captain he guides England to a successful defense of the World cup, once again breaking the runs record with 712 runs, that he's knighted.


""For his services to the English National Cricket Team and the sport itself, Blinking McQueen."", the announcer announces.

""Rise, Sir Blinking McQueen son of Van and Minny"", the queen proclaims.

Having been the youngest person ever to receive knighthood, he's asked to speak a few words.

He goes up to the mic and says :

""I am Van genes, I am the Knight, I am Batman.""",Van and Minny are lost in the desert.,0

Curtis’ father was a banker. Curtis’ grandfather was a banker. The banking linage runs as far back in the family as time can remember, ever since Gerald Redmond had emigrated from Killarney back in the 1840’s to escape the potato famine ravaging the emerald isle at the time.

As such, Curtis was brought up in the so called proper way. He was sent to the prestigious Browning School for his studies, and his every need and whim was catered for by a small army of household staff, there to dress him in the morning, wash him at night and even be on hand with a tissue if he even as much as sneezed.

While young Curtis appreciated the life that his parents were trying to make for him, he slowly began to resent the pampered existence he grew up in. His father was never around, always working late in the office, while his mother was more focused on her burgeoning cosmetic business than caring for her developing offspring. While he was a bright kid, as he grew into his, his rebellious streak came to the fore. He started skipping school, instead hanging around the streets of the Big Apple with some of the more undesirable types that his parents had tried to shelter him from. He learnt about different types of upbringing, and that people can make it on their own way, and not follow the set path that their parents wanted but still be happy and successful. However, Curtis felt a little alienated by this environment, due to his upper-class upbringing, and started using the nickname “Red” in an attempt to fit in with his new social circle.

Obviously, his father was not happy with this situation. He had hoped Curtis would follow in the family tradition, and it all came to a head one Christmas Eve, which happened to be Curtis’ 16th birthday. They had a blazing row, and Curtis was thrown out of the family home. Left with nowhere to go, but he just wanted at that time to be as far away from his parents as possible, so using a credit card stolen from his father, he booked the next available flight to Anchorage, Alaska.

However, as previously mentioned, Red was a clever and personable guy. Once in Alaska, he quickly found work and lodging with the Hamilton’s, a loving family of sheep herders on the outskirts of the city. He adored this new lifestyle and the freedom he’d never before encountered in his life. He swiftly grew attached to his new venture and vowed never to return to the city from where he’d been raised.

Red also found love. Alice was the beautiful daughter of the farming family, and Alice and Red married at 18, in a small ceremony on the Hamilton’s farm. Red did invite his parents, but they didn’t even give him the courtesy of responding. The newlywed couple started their own smallholding, and Alice gave birth to their first child, who they named Kai. The new family kindled close friendships within the sheep herding community, and before long young Kai was accompany Red on his farming duties. These often extending into the twilight hours, especially in winter where daylight in Alaska is at a premium, so the majority of the time they and the other farmers were working using flashlights and head-lamps.

Several members of the group challenged this, and back and forth ensued, until an agreement was reached. James would try it himself, without the substance part.

Issue was, the only consumable we had handy was fruit punch. The group began boiling down a small batch to be placed into a snortable less liquidy form. Credit cards were unsheathed, ready to swipe and manipulate the gooey substance into a snortable line. The scene was set and the challenge was nearing.

Donald was very excited that he might get a chance to meet the pope and shake his hand. So he decided to make a plan. He thought that the pope would want to meet the richest man in town. Donald thought that if were somehow able to appear rich, stand by the road, the pope would see him, be impressed, stop and Donald would get to shake the pope’s hand.

So poor old Donny went out and bought a nice new expensive suit that he couldn’t really afford, and on the appointed day, got up early, put on his new suit, went out and got a neat comb-over haircut, and made his way to the edge of the road where the pope would soon be driving by. 

After what seems like an eternity, he finally spots the motorcade, and old Donny boy begins to get tingly with anticipation. As it gets closer and closer, it suddenly stops right in front of him. The pope gets down out of the p-mobile, walks toward Donald, and without even looking at him, walks past him toward a scruffy little guy sitting obliviously against a wall. The little guy is wearing nasty, dirty clothes and is drunk as a skunk. The pope, arms folded, stands silently over the drunk who finally looks up. The pope unfolds his arms, slowly leans down and says something to the drunkard that nobody could hear. The drunkard, smiling stupidly, then gets up and hobbles down the street as the pope makes his way back to his po-mo. 

Donald is momentarily confused, but then it dawns on him. Of course! The pope doesn’t want to meet rich people. He wants to meet downtrodden, poor people! So he goes to plan-b and runs after the drunk guy. When he catches up to him, big Donny offers to swap clothes with him. Of course the man immediately agrees. So they go behind a couple of bushes and proceed with their transaction. Donald is momentarily overcome by the stench of his new clothes, but tells himself that sacrifices must be made and off he runs after the slow moving papal motorcade.

Like F. Gump, he runs and runs and finally catches up to the motorcade. Donny goes a little ways farther, stops and sits down just like the drunk guy did, to wait for the popemobile to pass by. Sure enough, as it gets to him, it stops. Donald is beyond excited as the pope jumps down and walks toward him. Just as before, with arms crossed and with a stern, pious expression, the pope stands over Donald. After a few seconds, he leans down in Donald’s face and quietly snarls, “I thought I told you to get the hell out of here.”",In light of people getting slapped by the pope.,8
