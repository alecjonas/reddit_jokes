one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" 

""Ok,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. 

Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young,beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy. 

He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.""",Ancient Chinese Torture,18

The man thinks about it for a second and asks if he can have a look at both places before deciding. “Certainly”, Saint Peter says and they walk into paradise. Right there on the front lawn, and unattractive, old man is standing naked, and in front of him, a beautiful you woman is kneeling and giving him oral pleasure. “Not bad at all” the man thinks, as they take the elevator below ground to visit hell. As the elevator doors open, the man, to his astonishment sees a scene pretty much identical to the one he saw in heaven. “I guess hell isn’t too bad either” the man thinks, as they head back up. When they get back to the pearly gates, Saint Peter asks the man in which place he prefers to spend his afterlife. “Well”, said the man puzzled, “I’m a little surprised that heaven and hell were so similar.

In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today. Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Right Honourable Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:


1. You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up ""aluminium"". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'favour' and 'neighbour', skipping the letter 'U' is nothing more than laziness on your part. Likewise, you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters. You will end your love affair with the letter 'Z' (pronounced 'zed' not 'zee') and the suffix ""ize"" will be replaced by the suffix ""ise"". You will learn that the suffix 'burgh is pronounced 'burra' e.g. Edinburgh. You are welcome to respell Pittsburgh as 'Pittsberg' if you can't cope with correct pronunciation. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up ""vocabulary"". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up ""interspersed"". There will be no more 'bleeps' in the Jerry Springer show. If you're not old enough to cope with bad language then you shouldn't have chat shows. When you learn to develop your vocabulary then you won't have to use bad language as often.


2. There is no such thing as ""US English"". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take account of the reinstated letter 'u' and the elimination of ""-ize"".


3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard. English accents are not limited to Cockney, upper-class twit or Mancunian (Daphne in Frasier). You will also have to learn how to understand regional accents - Scottish dramas such as ""Taggart"" will no longer be broadcast with subtitles. While we're talking about regions, you must learn that there is no such place as Devonshire in England. The name of the county is ""Devon"". If you persist in calling it Devonshire, all American States will become ""shires"" e.g. Texasshire, Floridashire, Louisianashire.


4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. Hollywood will be required to cast English actors to play English characters. British sit-coms such as ""Men Behaving Badly"" or ""Red Dwarf"" will not be re-cast and watered down for a wishy-washy American audience who can't cope with the humour of occasional political incorrectness.


5. You should relearn your original national anthem, ""God Save The Queen"", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.


6. You should stop playing American ""football"". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American ""football"" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays ""American"" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American ""football"", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005. You should stop playing baseball. It is not reasonable to host an event called the 'World Series' for a game which is not played outside of America. Since only 2.15% of you are aware that there is a world beyond your borders, your error is understandable. Instead of baseball, you will be allowed to play a girls' game called ""rounders"" which is baseball without fancy team strip, oversized gloves, collector cards or hotdogs.


7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 97.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. ""Merde"" is French for ""5hit"". You will no longer be allowed to own or carry guns. You will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous in public than a vegetable peeler. Because we don't believe you are sensible enough to handle potentially dangerous items, you will require a permit if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public.


8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called ""Indecisive Day"".


9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. All road intersections will be replaced with roundabouts. You will start driving on the left with immediate effect. At the same time, you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables. Roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour.


10. You will learn to make real chips. Those things you call French fries are not real chips. Fries aren't even French, they are Belgian though 97.85% of you (including the guy who discovered fries while in Europe) are not aware of a country called Belgium. Those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called ""crisps"". Real chips are thick cut and fried in animal fat. The traditional accompaniment to chips is beer which should be served warm and flat. Waitresses will be trained to be more aggressive with customers.


11. As a sign of penance 5 grams of sea salt per cup will be added to all tea made within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, this quantity to be doubled for tea made within the city of Boston itself.

12. The cold tasteless stuff you insist on calling beer is not actually beer at all, it is lager. From November 1st only proper British Bitter will be referred to as ""beer"", and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as ""Lager"". The substances formerly known as ""American Beer"" will henceforth be referred to as ""Near-Frozen Knat's Urine"", with the exception of the product of the American Budweiser company whose product will be referred to as ""Weak Near-Frozen Knat's Urine"". This will allow true Budweiser (as manufactured for the last 1000 years in Pilsen, Czech Republic) to be sold without risk of confusion.

13. From November 1st the UK will harmonise petrol (or ""Gasoline"" as you will be permitted to keep calling it until April 1st 2001) prices with the former USA. The UK will harmonise its prices to those of the former USA and the Former USA will, in return, adopt UK petrol prices (roughly $6/US gallon - get used to it).


14. You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns, lawyers or therapists. The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you're not adult enough to be independent. Guns should only be handled by adults. If you're not adult enough to sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist then you’re not grown up enough to handle a gun.
15. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.


Tax collectors from Her Majesty's Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all revenues due (backdated to 1776).
Thank you for your cooperation.",The year is 2000. The election in Florida between Bush and Gore resulted in a draw. This was the PSA.,1

Before they get a chance to realize what's going on, they are seized and imprisoned by the local tribesmen. The chieftain explains in broken English that they must die for trespassing on their soil, but since they don't get visitors very often, they will be honored by being able to choose the method of their own death. Their skins will then be leathered and used to make canoe boats. The first guy chooses to be beheaded. He thinks: ""If I'm going to die, I want it to be quick"". He's beheaded and skinned, the skin used to make a canoe. The second guy chooses to be thrown off a cliff. ""If I really must die, at least it will be fun"" His remains are collected and the skin removed. The third guy doesn't say anything, all he demands is a fork. He is given an old, rusty fork (which was washed out by the sea) and without a word, he starts stabbing himself furiously all over his body. A few hours later, he's lying on the ground, exhausted and bleeding profusely from the thousands of tiny stab wounds all over his torso, face and limbs. With all the strength he could muster, he lifts his head one last time, and whispers with his dying breath:

After the fall of the Berlin wall an East German decides to visit West Germany for the first time. He is amazed by how different everything is and decides to take a cab to explore everything.
He enters the Mercedes cab and they drive off. He notices the Mercedes-Benz hood ornament, but doesn't know what it is, because he is only used to Trabbis and soviet cars.

Therefore he asks the driver:""Excuse me, what is this star thing on the car?""
The driver decides to play a joke on him and answers: ""That's a sight. We use it to aim at pensioners, because you get a lot money for killing them that way. We are saving money this way in the long term."" The East German nods calmy and thinks about these strange customs.

A few minutes pass, until the cab drivers sees an old man on a bicycle in the distance. He decides to take the joke one step further, aims at the man, accelerates, but in the last second changes the direction and guns past him.

The East German man remarks: ""That was close!""
""Yes I know!"", the cab driver answers smiling.
The East German looks at him and says calmy: ""Well yeah, if I hadn't reacted fast enough and yanked open the passenger door to hit him with it, we wouldn't have gotten the money for sure!""",A German joke,3

Since he wasn't physically impaired he remained in the Navy and eventually became an Admiral. During his career he was always sensitive about his appearance.

One day the Admiral was interviewing two Navy Master Chiefs and a Marine Sergeant Major for his personal staff. The first Master Chief was a Surface Navy type and it was a great interview.

At the end of the interview the Admiral asked him, ""Do you notice anything different about me?""

The Master Chief answered, ""I couldn't help but notice you are missing your starboard ear, so I don't know whether this impacts your hearing on that side.""

The Admiral got very angry at this lack of tact and threw him out of his office.

The next candidate, an Aviation Master Chief, when asked this same question, answered, ""Well yes, you seem to be short one ear.""

The Admiral threw him out also.

The third interview was with the Marine Sergeant Major. He was articulate, extremely sharp, and seemed to know more than the two Master Chiefs put together. The Admiral went ahead with the same question.

""Do you notice anything different about me?""

To his surprise the Sergeant Major said, ""Yes sir you wear contact lenses.""

The Admiral, impressed thought to himself, what an incredibly tactful Marine. ""And how do you know that?"" the Admiral asked.

The Sergeant Major replied, ""Well sir, it's pretty hard to wear glasses with only one fuckin ear.""",One eared Admiral,256

Golgatha was a grand hill, and as the cross was raised Jesus looked down upon all those gathered before him.

He saw his wonderful mother Mary. He saw gods children. He saw Jerusalem in all its glory. But his eyes finally fell on his good friend and disciple Peter.

""Peteeer....,"" he called through painful breaths, ""Peeteerr....""

Peter, the must loyal of all Jesus's follows, jumped in shock. He began to run toward Jesus.

""Yes my lord?"" Peter replied.

But as soon as he began to get close the Romans roared, ""NO!"" and viciously chopped off poor Peters Legs.

Peter, wallowing in pain, heard his messiah call him again, ""Peeetteeer... peeter,"" growing more faint with each call.

So once again Peter tried, crawling with his arms... pulling as hard as he could.

Suddenly, more sharp Roman swords fell upon him. They took his arms this time, leaving him limbless.

But as he lay there, face down in the mud, Peter heard the Son of God once more, ""Peeteer""

So Peter rolled this time with all his might, reaching the bottom of the cross, ""Yes my lord, Yes, Yes,"" he screamed with anticipation, ""how can I serve you?""

And in his fading breaths, whimpering and quiet, Jesus replied, ""Peeter... Peter... I... I can see your house from here!""",Jesus loves Peter,3

So, the man holds out his hand and opens his palm, saying, “These are the keys to my car, which is sitting out front.”

“Here are the documents, as well,” he says as he hands over a tiny stack of papers.

The loan officer peeks out the window and sees a brand new Ferrari parallel parked directly in front of the bank.

“One moment, please.”

So, after sharing a laugh with the president at this man leaving a $750,000 car as security for a $5,000 loan, the loan officer returns and tells the man that they will happily accept the Ferrari.

An employee of the bank then drives the car into the bank’s underground garage and parks it.

Two weeks later, the man returns and pays the $5,000 plus interest, which comes to $15.41.

The loan officer smiles and says, “Sir, we are very happy to have your business. This transaction has worked out very nicely.”

Then he adds, “But to be honest, we are a little bit puzzled.”

“While you were away, we checked you out and found out that you are a multi-millionaire. So what puzzled us is why you’d bother to borrow $5,000?”

She says, ""2, 4, 6, 8, 10"".

They put the left half back in and removed the right half, asking her to count to 10 again.

She says ""1, 3, 5, 7, 9"".

Finally they decided to just go for it and removed the whole brain. They again asked if she could count to 10.

She responded: hahahahahahahaha!  Just read the articles about me counting to ten.  I didn't not say I couldn't ever not enumerate numbers.  Before you ask me to count to ten, ask the other people to count to ten.  I could count to ten before I couldn't count to ten and after that and before hen too, and I assure you my counting wasn't marked at classified, even it you wipe it with a cloth.

post,4eoojb,2qh72,jokes,false,1460595178,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4eoojb/the_man_named_yuri/,self.jokes,,"There once was a man named Yuri.

Yuri had lived in Russia all of his life, in a small town near Moscow. The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.

Every day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, ""SWIMMING LESSONS"" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.

Yuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, ""If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough..."" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.

Every day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri's.

A few months had passed, and Yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.

Later that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words ""DIVING PRACTICES"" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles.

Yuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.

The practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.

Many people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. ""It is only something I am fond of, a hobby"" Yuri would say. ""I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy."" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.

For yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. ""TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!"" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.

Yuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.

Finally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. ""It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life..."" Yuri would always respond to his fans.

One day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. ""Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!"" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, ""And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!"" Yuri replied, ""Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.""

Yuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.

Unfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. ""Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!"" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.

""It is OK, everybody"" Yuri yelled back. ""I have endured many hardships in my life.""",The man named Yuri...,10

Left with no other choice, she went for it, and the surgery was successful ...when she opened her eyes, she saw a handsome doctor smiling to her, staring at her face which started turning blue. She was raising her hand trying to tell him some thing but in vain and eventually died...

The doctor was shocked and was trying to understand what just happened, til he turned back and saw our friend Mike working as a cleaner in that hospital who had unplugged the ventilator to connect his vacuum cleaner.


If you were thinking that Mike became a doctor, you've been watching too many soap operas.",Mike.,363

As they were walking past, the rich man wasn't keeping an eye on his daughter, who was playing with the bars of the railing and she slipped through and fell in. Not knowing how to swim himself, the man shouted for help. Without saying a word, the hobo got up, took off his clothes, and dove in. Mid-air, he performed three perfect flips, and on entry, made not a single ripple accross the water. Grabbing hold of the little girl he swam ashore to her father.

""Oh my goodness! Thank you so much! I couldn't help but notice that you dive beautifully, I will reward you with $500 if you can do that again."". Without saying a word, the hobo got back on to the bridge and did it again, this time managing to flip four times, with another perfect entry. Astounded, the man says ""I'll double my price if you do it again."" Again, the hobo climbed on to the bridge, dove off and had a perfect entry, not one ripple accross the water.

The rich man paid the hobo and said ""Look, I'm pretty rich, I recently bought a cruise ship and I'm looking for attractions, how would you like to come work for me and show the world your skills? How about we go for a world record for highest dive while we're at it? I'll give you 50% of all I own if you dive off the world's tallest diving platform like you did today."" The homeless man agreed, and he was allowed to live on the ship while the diving platform was being constructed.

When construction began, the platform climbed high into the sky, past the atmosphere, into space, it went past Mars, past Jupiter, slowly got built past Saturn, Neptune, and finally stopped at Pluto. When it was finished the hobo began his climb. He climbed all the way past the atmosphere, into space, past Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and arrived on the platform by Pluto.

By now, the boat was at max capacity and a large crowd had gathered to watch the spectacle, TV cameras televised the event, a whole campaign of cheering people were following this story. The hobo took a minute's rest after the climb and dove off. He began flying down towards the earth, perfect flip after flip. He flipped past Neptune, he flipped past Saturn, he flipped past Jupiter and Mars, all the while maintaining his perfect golden form. He entered the atmosphere and began to straighten himself for entry into the pool aboard the ship.

He dove in, again, not a single ripple made its way accross the pool surface. However, as you would have guessed, the pool was much too shallow, and he continued to go deeper. He dove past the bedrooms, past the cabin crew level, the engine, and through the hull, the ship began to sink and everyone panicked.

As the ship was going under, the rich man swam over to the hobo, too amazed to lament his cruise ship he asked: 
""How on earth did you do that? You're completely unscathed! The entry was perfect! You obliterated the ship!"" After a moment's silence, the hobo finally spoke.

""I'm a hobo, I've been through many hardships in my life""

They put the left half back in and removed the right half, asking him to count to 10 again. 

He says ""1, 3, 5, 7, 9"".

Finally they decided to just go for it and removed the whole brain. They again asked him to count to 10 one more time.

He says, ""Look. I'm great at counting to 10, ok? I love numbers and I have the best numbers. No one has better numbers than I do. My 4th grade math teacher - and let me tell you, she was the best and smartest math teacher in the country at the time - my 4th grade math teacher said to me that I am the best counter she's ever seen.

He looked in the water and there, floating on the top, was a frog.

The retd officer said, 'Are you talking to me ?'


The frog said, 'Yes, I'm talking to you. Pick me up, then kiss me; and I'll turn into the most beautiful woman you have ever seen. I'll make sure that all your friends are envious and jealous, because I will be your bride !'

The retired officer looked at the frog for a short time, reached over, picked it up carefully and placed it in his shirt pocket.

The frog said, 'What, are you nuts ? Didn't you hear what I said ?'
I said, 'Kiss me, and I will be your beautiful bride.'

However what separated this study from others is that instead of only looking at buying trends and per capita purchasing, this study looked into the reasons behind these trends. One interesting trend that was found in this study was that the South West coast of South America was purchasing the most jackets, sweaters, and scarves per capita; this was a strange trend as South America is usually a warmer climate.

She notices a man at the other side of the bar making eye contact with her, and before long the bartender hands her a note saying, ""That gentlemen over there told me to give this to you.""

&gt; Come join me for a drink?

She approaches the man and introduces herself.  He writes another note and hands it to her:

&gt; I am deaf, but I can write notes.  Let me buy you a drink?

She decides to indulge him.  They spend the night drinking and writing notes back and forth. She learns he is a computer scientist, so being deaf doesn't affect his career all that much, and that he lives only a few blocks away.  As they become more intoxicated, he invites her back to his place with a note:

&gt; Let's go back to my place.  I've got a $1000 bottle of wine for us to share and a 10-inch penis.

She thinks to herself *he must be pretty rich if he can afford that bottle of wine* and fantasizes about the size of his dick, so she excitedly agrees.  They split a cab back to his place.  In the cab ride she passes him another note, saying he seems pretty young to be so successful.  To which he writes a note back:

post,4ecqh1,2qh72,jokes,false,1460408074,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4ecqh1/the_gorilla_hunter/,self.jokes,,"An avid big game hunter decided to book a trip to the Congo in order to hunt Gorillas. He had never been to the Congo so upon arrival he asked several locals who the best guide for hunting Gorillas would be. Everyone told him to find a man named Joffe as he was an expert in hunting gorillas. Soon the hunter found Joffe and negotiated a payment for his hunting expedition.

The next day he arrived to find Joffe ready to go holding a leash with a vicious looking dog attached. All of his men had cages on their backs. ""That's odd"" thought the hunter but he had never hunted gorillas and decided not to say anything. Soon they set off into the forest.

After about an hour of walking Joffe suddenly stopped and crouched down. he tapped the hunter on the shoulder and pointed into a tree where a large gorilla was clinging to a branch. The hunter started to raise his rifle but Joffe pushed it down saying, ""not yet, not yet, but be ready and I will tell you when to shoot"". The hunter was confused and stood there while Joffe dropped the leash and ran like a wild man through the jungle. He leaped up into the tree and grabbed the trunk and shook the tree with all his might. The surprised gorilla couldn't hold on to the shaking tree and he fell to the ground. The instant the gorilla fell the dog took off like a shot and grabbed the gorilla's balls in his sharp teeth. Both the dog and the gorilla froze. One of the men came and loaded the gorilla into a cage, pulled it up onto his back and the hunting party moved on.

""This is the craziest damn thing I've ever seen"" thought the hunter, but he knew Joffe was an expert so he held his tongue. After another hour Joffe stopped short and pointed into another tree. Again the hunter raised his rifle but again Joffe pushed it down saying, ""not yet, not yet, but be ready and I will tell you when to shoot"". And like before Joffe ran through the jungle and leapt into the tree, shaking it furiously. The gorilla fell and the dog clamped its jaws around the gorilla's testicles. Again the gorilla froze and one of the men loaded it up into a cage.

At this point the hunter is getting a little frustrated. He came to hunt gorillas after all, not to watch this crazy display. But still he stayed silent and this same series of events happened with Joffe telling him each time to put his gun down but to be ready to shoot.

At this point the hunter was angry and told Joffe, ""look, I came here to shoot! I'm tired of just roaming through the jungle and watching."" Joffe told him not to worry, ""you just be ready and you will need to shoot soon enough."" Just as before the came across a gorilla in a tree and again he was told to be ready. Joffe sprinted across the clearing, jumped into the tree and shook with all his might. But this time the gorilla held on and did not let go, in his anger the gorilla shook the tree back and Joffe lost his grip and started to fall. As he headed for the ground Joffe started shouting, ""QUICK! SHOOT THE DOG! SHOOT THE DOG!!""",The Gorilla Hunter,7

A girl was having a costume party, and decided that the theme of the party was going to be emotions. So she puts one of her friends at the door to make sure everyone coming in is dressed like a emotion. 

Well the party is going on, and the guy is standing guard. A woman comes up, dressed in all pink. The guy standing at the door stopped the girl and goes...

""I'm sorry ma'am, you can't come into the party, you're not dressed as an emotion."" 
She goes, ""Of course I am, I'm pink with passion!"" 

So he lets her in. Another guy comes up, dressed in all green. He stops him and goes...

""I'm sorry sir, you have to be dressed as an emotion to come in.""
The guy goes, ""Of course I'm dressed as an emotion. I'm green with envy!"" So he lets him in. 

The next two people to come up to the door was two guys, who were almost entirely nude, with one of the men having a custard covering his privates, and the other one had a pear with a hole drilled in it for his pecker. 

The man stops the two, and says ""I'm sorry gentlemen, I can't let y'all in. For one you're completely naked. And secondly, y'all aren't dressed as emotions."" 

The two men go, ""Well I will admit that we are naked, but we are most certainly dressed as emotions.""

The first man says, ""I'm fucking dis-custard.""

The second says, ""Yeah, and I'm deep in dis-pear.""",A girl was having a costume party...,115

post,4e70c4,2qh72,jokes,false,1460314105,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4e70c4/selling_the_farm/,self.jokes,,"A farmer and his wife decide to sell their land and move to Florida to retire. 

A prospective buyer comes by and likes the place, but there's a problem: He's deathly afraid of bees and, on a tour of the property, he noticed a lot of them.

The farmer says, ""There's always been bees around here, but in the 30 years I've owned the farm, I've never been stung

I'll tell you what. ""Take off your clothes and let me tie you to that tree over there. 

If you're stung by a single bee, I'll give you the farm for nothing. 

But if you don't get stung, you have to buy the farm at my asking price. 

The guy figures the possibility of a free farm is too good to pass up, so he agrees to the farmer's deal. 

The farmer ties him naked to the tree and goes to work in the fields. 

A few hours later, the farmer returns, only to find the man in a state of total exhaustion. 

He's a complete wreck. His knees are buckling and the only things holding him up are the tiny straps securing him to the tree trunk. 

The farmer is shocked. ""What on earth happened to you?"" You're a mess! Did the bees get you?""

""No,"" says the man, ""but doesn't that Calf have a mother?",Selling the Farm,15

post,4e5rsc,2qh72,jokes,false,1460294668,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4e5rsc/a_bank_robbery/,self.jokes,,"During a recent robbery in Hong Kong, the bank robber shouted to everyone in the bank: 
""Don't move. The money belongs to the Government. Your life belongs to you.""
Everyone in the bank laid down quietly. 

This is called ""Mind Changing Concept"" Changing the conventional way of thinking.
When a lady lay on the table provocatively, the robber shouted at her:
""Please be civilised! This is a robbery and not a rape!"" 

This is called ""Being Professional"" 
Focus only on what you are trained to do! 
When the bank robbers returned home, the younger robber (MBA trained) told the older robber (who has only completed Year 6 in primary school):
""Big brother, let's count how much we got."" 

The older robber rebutted and said:
""You are very stupid. There is so much money it will take us a long time to count. Tonight, the TV news will tell us how much we robbed from the bank!"" 

This is called ""Experience"" 
Nowadays, experience is more important than paper qualifications! 
After the robbers had left, the bank manager told the bank supervisor to call the police quickly. But the supervisor said to him: 
""Wait! Let us take out $10 million from the bank for ourselves and add it to the $70 million that we have previously embezzled from the bank"".

This is called ""Swim with the tide"" 
Converting an unfavorable situation to your advantage!
The supervisor says: ""It will be good if there is a robbery every month.""  

This is called ""Changing priority"" 
Personal Happiness is more important than your job.
The next day, the TV news reported that $100 million was taken from the bank. The robbers counted and counted and counted, but they could only count $20 million. 

The robbers were very angry and complained:
""We risked our lives and only took $20 million. The bank manager took $80 million with a snap of his fingers. It looks like it is better to be educated than to be a thief!"" 

This is called ""Knowledge is worth as much as gold!""",A bank robbery,62
