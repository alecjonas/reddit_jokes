post,82j2du,2qh72,jokes,false,1520374090,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/82j2du/man_wakes_up_in_a_slum_with_no_memory_of_how_he/,self.jokes,,"He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""

""Harry, Harry, how are you?"" he greets his old buddy after getting his attention.

""Not so good,"" says Harry.

""Why, what happened?"" James queries.

""Well,"" Harry says, ""I just went bankrupt and I've still got to feed my family. I don't know what I'm going to do.""

""Could have been worse,"" James replies calmly. ""Could have been worse.""
 

A month or so later, James again encounters Harry, in a restaurant. ""And how are things now?"" he asks.

""Terrible!"" says Harry. ""Our house burned down last night.""

""Could have been worse,"" says James, again with total aplomb, and goes about his business.


A month later, James runs into Harry a third time. ""Well, how goes it?"" he inquires.

""Oh!"" says Harry. ""Things just get worse and worse. It's one tragedy after another! Now my wife has left me!""

Harry nods his head and gives his usual optimistic-seeming little smile, accompanied by his usual words: ""Could've been worse.""
 
This time, Harry grabs James by the shoulders. ""Wait a minute!"" he says. ""I'm not gonna let you off so easy this time. Three times in the past few months we've run into one another, and every time I've told you the latest disaster in my life. Every time you say the same thing: 'Could have been worse.' This time, for God's sake, Harry, I want you to tell me: how in Heaven's name could it have been any worse?""

For $100, the cabby agreed.

Quietly arriving at the house, the husband and cabby tiptoed into the bedroom. The husband switched on the lights, yanked the blanket back and there was his wife in bed with another man.

The husband put a gun to the naked man's head. The wife shouted, ""Don't do it! This man has been very generous! I lied when I told you I inherited money. He paid for the Corvette I bought for you. He paid for our new cabin cruiser. He paid for your season Green Bay Packer Tickets. He paid for our house at the lake. He paid for our country club membership, and he even pays the monthly dues!""

""Well, you see"" says the doc ""his heart needs a little exercise. Scientists have discovered that blowjobs are the prefect exercise to get his heart working properly. With out them there is no chance for him living past the week. We recommend one blowjob a year to keep him alive.  After that plan is in place he would most certainly be able to do chores.  One blowjob a month and he could handle the stress of a full time job, as well. One blow job per week, and he could do chores, work a full time job, plus a part time job, and eat whatever he wanted. Which would certainly make your life less stressful, and quite lavish.""

So the woman jumps up with great excitement. She tells the doctor how happy he has made her, and runs off to tell her husband.

As she reaches the door to his room she is so excited that she can barely contain herself, and she immediately starts to cry. Entering the room she looks at her husband and tells him just what the doctor told her... ""You're going to die... Within a week.""

One day, their good health didn't help when they went on a rare vacation and their plane crashed, sending them off to Heaven.

They reached the pearly gates, and St. Peter escorted them inside. He took them to a beautiful mansion, furnished in gold and fine silks, with a fully stocked kitchen and a waterfall in the master bath. They gasped in astonishment when he said, 'Welcome to Heaven. This will be your home now.'

The old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost. 'Why, nothing,' Peter replied, 'remember, this is your reward in Heaven.'

The old man looked out the window and right there he saw a championship golf course, finer and more beautiful than any ever built on Earth. 'What are the greens fees?' grumbled the old man.

'This is heaven ,' St. Peter replied. 'You can play for free, every day.'

Next they went to the clubhouse and saw the lavish buffet lunch, with every imaginable cuisine laid out before them, from seafood to steaks to exotic deserts, free flowing beverages.

'Don't even ask,' said St. Peter to the man, 'this is Heaven, it is all free for you to enjoy.'

The old man looked around and glanced nervously at his wife.

'Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol foods, and the decaffeinated tea?,' he asked..

'That's the best part,' St. Peter replied, 'you can eat and drink as much as you like of whatever you like, and you will never get fat or sick. This is Heaven!'

The old man pushed, 'No gym to work out at?'

'Not unless you want to,' was the answer.

'No testing my sugar or blood pressure or...'

'Never again. All you do here is enjoy yourself.'

The police found three likely suspects: a local Asian cook, who was single, a Russian construction worker, who had a family of five, and a frail Thai woman, who had one son, and divorced her husband because of the victim.

Each suspect knew each other and each other's families personally. The young Thai son admitted being very close to the murderer, but wouldn't say who. The Russian's family was at the cook's restaurant at the time of the murder, confirmed by security footage.

**Who killed the woman?**

After a long period of investigating, the police detectives came to an unexpected conclusion.

The Russian and his family obviously didn't do it, as they have a confirmed alibi. The cook, too, couldn't have done it - he was busy making food for the Russian at the time. Neither the Thai woman nor her son could have killed the victim, as both were too weak to leave such evidence of force.

However, the police detectives remembered that the Thai woman divorced her husband because of the victim. His son was very close to him, and, because of of the victim, his wife divorced him, sparking his desire to kill the person who caused it. He was a strong man, and could have left the marks. Only after the detectives told the police this were they sure...

...that it was the Thai Dad.",A Whodunnit Riddle,5

The man says “It’s me and my wives anniversary soon. We’re planning a trip to Rome as we've always wanted to go to Italy and really experience some authentic Italian food!”

“Ahh, don’t bother” says the barber. “The whole city is just full of McDonald’s on every corner and there’s nowhere to get authentic Italian food there any more!”

“Oh…” says the man. “Well, me and the wife are also big fans of architecture. We’d love to see the old ruins and remains of ancient Rome and really soak in some of those fantastic sights!”

“Ahh, don’t bother” replies the barber. “They’re tearing all those building down now and it’s just a bunch of ugly steel buildings and nothing special any more.”

“I see…” says the man. “Well, at least we can go to the Vatican and see the Pope! We’re both very religious and are extremely excited to see him!”

“Ahh, don’t bother” says the barber yet again. “It’s usually so crowded that you’ll be lucky if you can just see the tip of his hat! The whole thing sounds like a waste of time to me.”

Despite the barber’s crude warnings, the man takes his wife and they both go to Rome.

A few weeks later, the man goes back to the barber’s to get another haircut and, once again, they start chatting. The man tells the barber that he has just gotten back from his trip to Rome with his wife.

“Oh, and how was the food there?” Asks the barber.

“It was great! There were giants platters full of all sorts of pasta’s everywhere! We had authentic gelato after every meal, some of the best espresso’s I've ever had and more delicious food in that week then I've ever had in my life!”

“That sounds nice” says the barber. “What about the buildings?”

“They were stunning! We barely had time to see half of the amazing sights that Rome had to offer. We saw the Colosseum, walked all around the beautiful Villa Borghese, visited the Capucin Crypts, and we visited all the famous Piazza’s we could!”

“I see!” replies the barber. “And the Pope?”

“Well, we went to the Vatican and there was a huge sea of people. From the Pope’s balcony, we could just about see the tip of his hat. Suddenly, he raised his rod and pointed it right at me and my wife, and the crowd parted in two and made a pathway. He looked right at me and shouted ‘YOU!’ and started to make his way towards me. He then slowly walked right up to my face and said ‘…who the FUCK gave you that haircut?’”

He had tractor models, tractor wallpaper, remote control miniature tractors, tractor board games, even some tractor anime(which is not easy to find mind you). The only thing that even came close to his love for tractors, was the love he felt for his wife. His life long soulmate, who didn't mind his obsession with tractors at all. She didn't even mind the Cosplay at Halloween, where they would both dress as tractors and spend the night driving along the pavement. Sadly his wife was struck one day, a tractor fell off the back of a transport truck. She didn't die until he was at her side in the hospital. Her dying words ""don't blame the tractor honey"" and with that she headed to the big tractor scrapyard in the sky. Unfortunately, he did blame the tractor, he hated them now with all his mind, body, and soul. He went home and destroyed ALL his tractor related items, the toys, his wifes tractor suit, and even his collection of tractor anime. He put it all in a pile and drove over it in his own miniature tractor. What ever didn't burn, including the miniature tractor, was thrown into a woodchipper. He then went inside, rarely leaving his home, for 10 years. Finally on the 10th anniversary of his wife’s death he decided it was time to get back out in the dating world, plus the cute cashier at the grocery store had been asking him out for a while now, he called her out to dinner. The restaurant he choose ended up being quite nice, good food, good service, great decor. But there was one problem, it was EXTREMELY smoky. So smoky that his date, being an asthmatic, was having some trouble breathing. After noticing her displeasure, and trouble breathing, he started breathing in. I mean REALLY breathing in. Inhaling with such force that all the smoke quickly left the dining room, and went into his lungs. When the room was void of smoke he stepped outside and released it all into the night. When he rejoined his date she asked ""how on earth did you do that?"" to which he replied, ""I'm an extractor fan.""","There once was a man who loved tractors,",294

“Look, too many people are getting in. As of tomorrow at 12pm, no one is getting in unless they’ve had a really bad day”

“Hi sir, welcome to heaven, hey new rules... you’re not allowed in unless you’ve had like a really bad day”

The man doesn’t pause before screaming:
“Bad day? A bad day! Let me tell you about my day. I have suspected my wife of cheating on me for a year now and I decided to come home at lunch and catch her in the act. So I go up to my apartment on the 10th floor and I nearly bust straight in. Anyway she’s lying on the couch, naked and screaming at me! I can’t find the guy anywhere, until I go outside on the balcony and there’s this guy, naked, holding on to the balcony floor. And he’s screaming at me too! Well next thing I go into this rage... I just stomp on his hands and he falls the ten storeys. But at the bottom these branches break his fall, and he starts to get up! He’s alive! So I grab the nearest thing, our fridge, and I haul it out onto the edge of the balcony and lever t over the railing, sending it right at him. I don’t know what happened next though cause I gave myself a heart attack while doing it!”

Peter nods “wow yeah that is rough. In ya come”. The next guy in line walks up, naked

“Hey so yeah, new rules, you have to have had a bad day to get in”

“Well let me tell ya. I was home sick from work and I just got out of the shower. Anyway I walked out onto my balcony of my fifteen floor apartment to get some fresh air. A gust of wind whipped my towel off and I reached out to grab it... but I ended up falling over the edge! Luckily I managed to turn mid-air and grab onto this balcony. So I am hanging there, screaming for someone to help me when this god damn mad man comes running out and starts stamping on my fingers! I then fall ten storeys, but I’m saved! All these branches in these trees at the bottom slowly break my fall. I was just getting my bearings when I look up and a fridge is flying at my face”

Peter nods... perplexed... “wow. Yeah. Okay. That sounds rough, in ya go... next”

This other guy walks up, and Peter says “same as the last two, you’ve had to have had a bad day to get in”

The genie looks at him and replies ""Would you prefer a six or eight lane bridge?""",A man releases a genie,24

As he approached Vegas, the voice in his head said, “Go to Caesar’s Palace,” so the man obliged, thinking he had nothing more to lose. 

Once he stepped inside the casino, the voice commanded him to go to an ATM and take out everything he owned. At this point he was already so far into it, he figured this was his chance to risk it all for good.

With the money in hand, the voice said, “Go to the roulette table.”

The man wasn’t about to stop listening now. He approached the table and the worker asked for everyone’s bets. Now the voice said, “Put it all on black.”

So the man put it all on black. The ball rolled around for a bit and finally settled on a red space.

""Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you. You see, I'm a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll Give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for myself."" 



""Wow, that's great!"" the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, ""I'd like a million dollars a year for! the rest of my life.""


""No problem,"" said the genie. ""You've got it, it's the least I can do. And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!"" 


""And now you, young lady, what do you want?"" the genie asked. ""I'd like to own a gorgeous home complete with servants in every country in the world,"" she said. 


""Consider it done,"" the genie said. ""And your homes will always be safe from fire,burglary and natural disasters!"" 


""And now,"" the couple asked in unison, ""what's your wish, genie?"" 


""Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have your wife."" 


The husband looked at his wife and said, ""honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?"" 


She mulled it over for a few moments and said, ""You know, you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?"" 


""You know I love you sweetheart,"" said the husband. 


""I'd do the same for you!"" So the genie and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon. The genie was insatiable. 


After about three hours of non-stop fun, the genie looked directly into her eyes and asked, ""How old are you and your husband?"" 


""Why, we're both 35,"" she responded breathlessly.

Inventions in robotics and engineering were being created almost daily. But this new world came with a downside, the amount of harsh chemicals in the air were causing cancer to develop in people around the world many times more often than it usually does. A cure for cancer was discovered a few years before, a special substance called Lithium Phosphorus Thymine (or LPT for short). But this substance was extremely rare. It costs around 5 million dollars to construct one dose of the chemical. Most patients were required to take the medicine daily for at least a month before being cured. One test subject had to be treated with LPT for an entire year before recovering!

Obviously there was a problem. Humanity needed an easier way to obtain this substance. Millions of lives depended on it. And the answer came with space travel. After exploring an asteroid near earth, astronauts discovered something amazing, an enormous crystal of pure LPT, created by residual chemicals in the meteor reacting with the intense cold of space. Soon, more and more of these LPT-rich asteroids were being discovered and shipped back to earth, and cancer was eventually cured.

It all goes to show that the real LPT is in the comets.","In the year 2030,",7

It breaks down right in front of an oasis. Tired and thirsty he leans down to take a drink. A large snake spirit appears to him stating: “Hello, I am Nate The Snake, the guardian of this oasis. For finding me I will grant you three wishes.” The man considers for a moment then says “One, I’d like to be the richest man on the planet. Two I’d like to find true love, and three I’d like to travel the world.” 
“Done,” Says Nate The Snake “But if you are to travel the world I have one request: that you take my son Sal The Snake with you.” The man, not wanting to sound ungrateful said yes. Together the man and Sal traveled the world. At first they were constantly at each other’s throats, but they soon grew to become close friends during their adventures. After the adventure they bid farewell, and lived their own lives apart for 10 years. The man settled down with a beautiful wife and kids, yet heard nothing of Sal until one day. The door bell rang, the man went to open the door to find Sal, in tears: “It’s my father…” he said “He’s very sick.” Not wanting to let his friend down they traveled back to the oasis where Nate The Snake was found. They rode together in the old Jeep that the man had first used on his travels, at this point it had become a symbol of their friendship. Since old habits die hard, the brakes of the Jeep failed as they barreled towards the oasis. He could see Nate The Snake to the left of the oasis, clearly sick and dying. To the right he saw a large lever. Sal had once told him that his father's oasis had a lever that could end the physical reality as we know it. He assumed that it was the aforementioned level and by using his moral reasoning he swerved to the right saying:
 “Better Nate than Lever.” ",A man meets Nate The Snake,0

He's alone, his guns all jam for some reason, and he only has a whittling knife? This is going to be suicide, but damn it, those are his pals over there and he has to do something. In a string of actions too heroic to even begin to describe, the soldier saves his friends, taking out innumerable enemy units along the way, and makes his way back to base with all of them unharmed. 

He gets the word from the higher ups once the next day: ""You're getting a purple heart, lieutenant"". Happy days. He's done his service to the best of his abilities, going above and beyond not only what is expected, but performing actual heroism, and he's going to get one of the only awards out there that adequately recognizes those who are capable of such great feats. 

He steps off the plane, kisses his wife, and tells her ""I'm getting a purple heart, babe! I told you about what I did, and they're giving it to me at a ceremony later today"". She says ""Honey, me, too! All the teachers have been getting them. Don't worry, the ceremony doesn't take long, and it's just for show anyways, but it's a lovely gesture, I think. Just lovely. ""there's no greater hero than a teacher"", they say"". The soldier's head spins. He's not a man who looks for recognition, but this was to be an honor, something only given to those who absolutely deserved it, devoid of politics, and now.. His stomach twists as he realizes that he can't complain.. He sees a paper with a headline reading ""Blatantly Racist and Sexist Military Awards Now Agree to Enforce Diversity Quotas: A Step in the Right Direction for America"". He pinches himself, because surely this must be a dream

She paused for a second, frowned, and replied. ""No.""

Surprised, Guido reached for her and the rattling resumed. This

Again, after a short pause, she returned his smile, cuddled closer 
to him and softly said, ""No.""

Stunned, but damned if he was going to leave this woman 
unsatisfied, Guido reached for the woman yet again. Using the last of his strength, he barely managed it, but they ended together screaming, bucking, clawing and ripping the bed sheets.

Exhausted, Guido fell onto his back, gasping. Barely able to turn

Barely able to speak, the beautiful blonde whispered in his 
ear..... ""No, I Norwegian!""",Guido and the blonde,101

Drawing on his experience, the gambler immediately thinks of a way to get ahead of everyone else. He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder...

""Want to make a bet while we wait?"" The Gambler asks. ""If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.""

The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins ""reading"" him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.

""Don't be silly, it's just indigestion."" the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line.

Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts.

""This one's easy!"" the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. ""Hold my beer!""

Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line.

Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made.

""Okay, let's see..."" The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes.

The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. ""You ain't taking me alive!""

The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.

The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, ""Fuck the police!""

Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before.

Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. ""I'VE GOT NOTHING!"" He shouts. ""I GIVE UP!""

The man steps aside.",A gambler dies and goes to Heaven...,27692

*Here's her story in her own words:*

 

""While out walking along the edge of a pond just outside my house in The Villages with my soon to be ex-husband, discussing property settlement and other divorce issues, we were surprised by a huge 12-ft. Alligator  which suddenly emerged from the murky water. It began charging us with its large jaws wide open.  She must have been protecting her nest because she was extremely aggressive.*

 

*If I had not had my little Beretta .25 caliber pistol with me, I would not be here today!*

 

Just one shot to my estranged husband's knee cap was all it took. The gator got him easily, and I was able to escape by just walking away at a brisk pace.  

 

The amount I saved in lawyer's fees was really incredible.  His life insurance was a big bonus!”*

Said the vet, but the man was not convinced so the vet brought in a Persian kitty who did much the same as the lab. Sniffed the dog for a minute then sat down with no reaction. ""Told you"" said the vet ""Alright I guess you're right"" replied the man with sorrow in his voice ""How much do I owe you?"". ""250$ plus tax"" said the vet casually ""250!?

A minute or so passes and the bee buzzes its wings. The judge leans forward and angles his ear towards the bee. He nods his head in agreement, lifts his other arm up and points directly at contestant six. 

A voice booms over the audience, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner. CONTESTANT 6...PLEASE STEP FORWARD!!"" 

A barely audible round of applause is heard as contestant 6 waddles her way to the front of the stage. Shes 300lb, a short, hairy, sweaty mess of a woman.

by not wearing anything that would identify them as Priests.

As soon as the plane landed they headed for a store 
and bought some really outrageous shorts, shirts, sandals, sunglasses, etc. 

The next morning they went to the beach 
dressed in their 'tourist' garb.  
They were sitting on the beach chairs, enjoying a drink, the sunshine and the scenery when a 
drop-dead gorgeous blonde in a bikini 
came walking straight towards them. 

They couldn't help but stare. As the blonde passed them she smiled and said 
'Good Morning, Father ~ Good Morning, Father,' 
nodding and addressing each of them individually, 
then she passed on by. 
  
They were both stunned. 
How in the world did she know they were priests?   
So the next day, they went back to the store 
and bought even more outrageous outfits. These were so loud you could hear them before you even saw them! 

Once again, in their new attire, they settled down in their chairs to enjoy the sunshine.   
After a little while, the same gorgeous blonde, 
wearing a different colored bikini, taking her sweet time, 
came walking toward them.   
Again she nodded at each of them, said: 'Good morning, Father ~ Good morning, Father,' 
and started to walk away. 
  
One of the priests couldn't stand it any longer and said, 
'Just a minute, young lady.' 'Yes, Father?'   
'We are priests and proud of it, but I have to know, 
how in the world do you know we are priests, dressed as we are?'

Father, it's me, Sister Beatrice!!",Two Priests decided to go to Greece on vacation,12

One year the helicopter pilot heard the man pleading with his wife to ride the helicopter and decided to butt in.

The helicopter pilot was well trained in doing tricks and stunts to make the rides exciting for his customers, so because his offer, he pulled out all the stops to try and make the man and his wife scream and have to pay for the ride. This included flying in loopy-loops and the such.

Finally, the pilot had done all he could and decided the couple were not going to break their silence, so he told them on the way back to the landing zone that he was really impressed with their silence and would keep his agreement for the free ride.

The vet took one look at the cow, stuck a tube up the cow’s butt, and blew into the tube until the cow’s eyes straightened out. The vet charged the farmer a hundred bucks, and the farmer went home happy. About a week later, the cow’s eyes were cross-eyed again, but this time the farmer figured he could probably take care of it himself. So he called his hired hand over, and together they put a tube up the cow’s butt. The farmer put his lips to the tube and started to blow. Strangely, nothing happened, so he asked his hired hand to give it a try. The hired hand removed the tube, turned it around, put it in the cow’s butt and started to blow.

The cops knock on his windows, and it rolls down. ""Sir, why were you driving without your seatbelt?""

He had heard young Frodo take upon himself the burden of the ring, Sam, Merry and Pippin joining him on the foolish quest. Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and Boromir adding to the fellowship with his long time friend Gandalf.
Bilbo couldn't feel but guilty for letting Frodo take the burden of the ring, so he also stood up and joined the meeting to announce he would take the ring to Mordor instead of Frodo.
After a lot of discussion and Bilbo assuring Gandalf he was up to the task it was eventually setled. Bilbo would take the ring to Mordor.

The fellowship set off on their quest, the odds against them. As they reached Moria they were swarmed by orcs, Bilbo took a hit to the head and was stabbed by a sword but in the end the fellowship escaped. Losing Gandalf in the process to the Balrog and Bilbo being slashed by the flaming whip.
Later the fellowship got ambushed by orcs from Isengard. Boromir died in the ambush and Bilbo got hit by an arrow.

Bilbo and Sam got lost from rest of the fellowship and kept going by themselves towards Mordor.
As the journey went on, Bilbo to Sam's surprise kept up to pace. He didn't even seem to mind his old wounds nor the new ones he got. Being bit by a nazgul's foul flying beast, the giant spider tossed him around the cave and even Gollum attacked them in the end biting two of Bilbo's fingers off.
But Bilbo endured and threw the ring in the fires of Mordor, finally destroying Sauron.

Back in Shire Sam was telling their adventure to Frodo who listened in awe. As Sam finished his story Frodo gazed at Bilbo amazed. ""How did you keep on going? How did you not succumb to the pain?""
Bilbo just shrugged and grumbled to Frodo ""Old hobbits die hard I guess""",Fellowship of the ring,11

Thumb was like the Fingers, but different. Shorter, sturdier. Turns out, Thumb worked quite well with the individual Fingers, and everyone found that they could perform better and do more with Thumb's help.

Thumb became so useful to the Fingers that soon they found they could not live without his help. Thumb began to make demands of the Fingers; first it was just more pay, but then he wanted more and more. A diamond-studded glove, a luxury car, the list of demands became longer and longer. But what could the Fingers do? They resented Thumb's demands, but needed his help far too much to risk alienating him.

Eventually, Thumb was elected King. And if you think regular Thumb was demanding, King Thumb was worse. Soon, all the Fingers began to resent King Thumb, for his rulings were tyrannical, and he never, ever trimmed his nail. The Fingers began to despair, for they feared they would never be able to stand up to King Thumb.

He's talking to his mates at the bar one night about it and no matter what his pals suggest they try he says they've already done it and it just doesnt excite him anymore.

That's when his best mate suggests a trick that may possibly work? Being a farmer he knows all he has to do to get his bull to mate with the cows is stick his fingers up a cow's vagina and rub it under the bulls nose, it drives the bull insane with lust and he fucks every cow in the paddock!

The husband figures he has nothing to lose, may as well try it and see if it works?

So he goes home, it's about 2am and his wife is sound asleep in bed. He crawls into bed and snuggles up then reaches between her legs to finger her a bit then he wipes the juices under his nose.

Sure enough, soon after he's got a raging boner and is in the mood to fuck like mad. He nudges the wife and says ""wake up, I got something to show you!""

The wife wakes up, turns the lamp on and says ""you woke me up in the middle of the fucking night just to show me you have a blood nose?""",The trick to impotency,4

G: Brake fluids, as you know, are categorized by a DOT standard, and the one we've got here is DOT 5, the latest standard. It tastes pretty bitter, so I don't know why [our dog] keeps trying to get at it.

Me: How do you know it tastes bitter, what'd you do, drink it? *kek*

G: No, you know I'm not that stupid. Actually, there have been problems in the past with the flavor of brake fluid. Back in the day, when it was all DOT 4, brake fluid tasted inherently sweet, which prompted the development of DOT 5. There were problems with pets and babies dying off because they were drinking while bottles of brake fluid, thinking it was food. Eventually, they switched to a non-toxic version to keep people from dying while they tried to develop a fix for the sweetness

Me: *thinking this is all legit*

G: I remembers few years ago back when I owned the boat shop, I'd have a guy come in just about every other day and get him a jug of brake fluid. I was wondering what could be leaking so bad that it required such a massive amount of fluid, so I followed him outside one day, to see what monstrosity of a car he had. Instead of popping the hood, he got in the driver's seat, took a nice swig of brake fluid, and left for home.

Me: *still thinking this is legit*

G: Well, next time he came for his brake fluid, I pulled him aside and asked him why why he was drinking all this brake fluid. He'd had to have been inches from death. He told me it just tasted really good, helped him take his mind off things. I told him ""you need to quit kiddo, or you're gonna get addicted to stinking brake fluid. I'd hop on down to the doctor if I were you.""

He looked at me and said ""Naw man, I can stop anytime.""",My grandfather got me with this one.,46

He got a flat tire, and got out to walk for help.After walking for some time, he came to a small stone monastery. He knocked on the door and roused the monks. ""I've got a flat tire. Can I use your phone?"" He asked. 

The monks said they were sorry, but they did not have a phone. ""If you stay tonight, you can get a ride on our wagon into town tomorrow,"" they said. So the man stayed the night, and they put him in a small room in the monastery. 

In the middle of the night, the man was awakened suddenly by a noise. Not just any noise, but the loudest, most wonderful, most terrifying, most hair-raising noise ever. 

He sat there, his heart beating for a few minutes, and he heard it again!Getting out of bed, he went running in the direction of the noise. It came again, making the hair on the back of his neck rise and his skin crawl. Finally, he came to a large door where the head monk was standing. The door was at least 15 feet tall, and made of solid-looking wood and metal. It had chains and bars and locks and a deadbolt on it, and was the most formidable door the man had ever seen. 

""What was that sound?"" He asked. ""What made it? Is it behind that door?"" 

The head monk shook his head. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I can't tell you; you're not a monk."" 

As the man turned away, he heard the noise again. ""You have to tell me what it is,"" he begged. 

""I'm sorry, I can't tell you, you're not a monk,"" said the monk. 

The man tried to sleep, but couldn't get the noise out of his head. In the morning, as he was getting ready to leave, he heard the sound again. It made his ears ring and his mind whirl.""Please tell me what made that sound,"" he said. 

But the monks wouldn't. ""I'm sorry, you're not a monk"" was all they said. 

The man left, and eventually got his car fixed and went back to his life. But he couldn't get the sound out of his mind. After a few months, he got in his car and drove and drove until he found the monastery again. He got out of his car and found the head monk. ""I can't forget that sound from that night I was here. Please, please please tell me what made that sound."" The head monk just shook his head. 

""I can't tell you; you're not a monk,"" he said.""Then tell me how I can become a monk,"" the man said. 

The head monk said ""It's very difficult. Are you sure you want to do this?""The man said ""I've got to. I have to know what made that sound.""The head monk said, ""To join us, you have to perform several tasks. Your first task is to count all of the stars visible in the sky."" 

The man thought about how hard that would be, but he had to know what made that sound. He sat up every night for a year, counting the stars over and over until he was sure how many stars were visible in the sky. He went to the head monk and told him, and the monk nodded. 

""Very good. Your next task is to count all of the grains of sand on the beaches around the world.""The man knew this would be even harder, but he could not get the noise out of his head. He had to know what, what kind of animal, could make that terrible horrible mind-bending sound. So he left on his journeys. He crawled the length and breadth of every beach in the world, counting the grains of sand, and he returned to the monastery years later.The head monk heard his answer and nodded. 

""Excellent. You are almost done. Your final task is to climb to the peak of the highest mountain in the world, and see yourself in relation to the rest of creation."" And the man knew this would be hard, but he outfitted himself, and he went to the highest mountain in the world, and he climbed to the top, and returned months later, older and wiser and more tired than years before when he had first heard the noise, the noise that would not leave his mind and that echoed in his every waking thought.He returned, and the head monk saw that he was wiser, and said ""At last, you are a monk. Come with me."" 

And they walked through the monastery, its twisting and turning halls, and as they went the man heard the noise again, over and over, and he was no longer sure if it was the noise or merely his memory of it.And finally, finally, he stood in front of the door and the head monk opened it up, and the man saw what had made the noise. 

But, I can't tell you what it was. You're not a monk.",A man was driving in the middle of nowhere...,0
