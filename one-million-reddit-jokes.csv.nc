I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running

The two guys reply, ""Well, you know, we're from Buffalo, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy for a chance to warm up a bit, you know.""

The two Buffalonions reply, ""Well, ya know, we don't get too much warm weather up there in Buffalo, we've just got to have a cookout when the weather is this nice.""

The next morning, the temperature is below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere, the people are shivering so bad, they are unable to wail, moan or gnash their teeth.

The young man crawls slowly and deliberately until he is out of sight, the other two hold thier breath in anticipation, praying for an 'all clear'.
Shots ring out and a cry of agony is heard from behind the rock as the solder shouts his final words, ""A BACON TREE!"". Then the world plunges into silence.
The last two solders look at each other silently weeping for the loss of thier friend, and they listen for any more signs of life. The second one makes a gesture then gets on the ground and begins crawling the other way around the rock, hoping that his friends death was not in vain.
The world seems silent once again, and the last solder thinks it's a good sign, his other friend hasn't been shot yet. He listens, but not a thing is heard.
Out of nowhere shots boom and the last words heard from beyond the rock is ""IT'S A BACON TREE!""
The silence returns. The last solder sees no way out of this, both curiosity and agony are getting to him. He begins a careful climb up the top of the rock hoping to have a better chance than his friends. He tries to muffle even his slightest sounds, his heart is ringing in his ears.
When he gets to the top of the rock he sees a glimpse of the field beyond and gets shot in the shoulder, pain ripples through his body and he falls back off the rock.

It was near the end of basic training and all the soldiers were getting ready for the war. A private came charging into his Lieutenant's office and said "" Lieutenant, we don't have enough rifles. What am I going to use for the war?""

""I don't have time to deal with this right now"" the lieutenant thought.

He grabbed a broom, sawed off the bottom, and handed it to the solder. ""Here use this instead.""

""How is this going to work?""

""When you see the bad guys coming at you, just point it at them and say 'Bangity Bang Bang, Bang Bang'"".

So the private ran out with his new ""rifle"". But soon he came running back to the Lieutenant saying ""Lieutenant, we don't have enough bayonets!""

The Lieutenant grabbed a piece of string off of his desk and gave it the private. ""When you see the bad guys coming just throw this at them and say 'Stabity Stab Stab, Stab Stab.'""

So the private was all ready for his war. He was sitting in a fox hole, hating being out there, when he saw an enemy creeping along the top of a nearby hill.

He grabbed his broom, pointed it at the bad guy and said ""Bangity Bang Bang Bangity Bang Bang"" and he fell down dead.

""Wow this really works"" thought the private. He started going through the underbrush when another enemy jumped out and try to gut him - he threw his string at him and said, 'Stabbity Stab Stab!'. The enemy fell down, dead.

Pretty soon, he saw another guy rampaging through the woods. He pointed his broomstick at him and yelled, 'Bangity Bang Bang!' Nothing, so he did it again, 'Bangity Bang Bang!' The guy was stomping he's feet. He threw the string, Stabbit Stab Stab!' The enemy kept stomping towards him and plowed over him, stomping him into the ground.

Then he heard the big guy mumbling as he went past  ""Tankity Tank Tank Tankity Tank Tank.""

The man agreed to help tow the farmer's tractor back to his farm. They agreed that the tractor's left blinker meant speed up and the right blinker meant slow down. While the Ferrari was towing the tractor, a Lamborghini zoomed passed. The Ferrari driver forgot all about the tractor and the farmer and floored it. The two sports cars tore down the high way at incredible speeds. After awhile, the racers passed a police car and the police car radioed ahead about the speeders. 

""Hey yeah, this is Jim. I'm warning you about a Ferrari and Lamborghini racing at 190 mph. But what you really need to be careful about is the tractor trying to pass them on the left.""",You don't see that everyday.,85

Tom put down his fourth bottle of Bud Light. ""Please excuse for a second,"" said Tom. ""I have to use the restroom.""

As Tom was away, the group began to talk about their family.

Laura asked Robert, ""So how is your son doing?""

""My son is doing fantastic,"" Robert said. ""He graduated from law school a couple years ago and now has his own firm. He told me he recently met someone special, and he's thinking about marriage. In fact, he makes so much money, he told me he was able to buy his loved one a brand new boat!""

""That's great,"" Laura said.

""Wow, he sounds like he's living a great life,"" commented Jill. ""What about your son, Laura?""

""Oh I am so proud of him! My son is a successful entrepreneur. He's been traveling around the country promoting his software business. He's still single, but he's been throwing me little hints he met someone special. I don't see much of him these days as he's always traveling, but apparently he's doing well; he told me he just bought a good friend brand new car!""

The group looks amazed. Robert turns to Jill, ""You have a son don't you, Jill?""

""Yes,"" Jill responded. ""My son is one of the top salesman in his company. He's living the dream, going to the most exotic locales often. It's so funny, because my son, too, earned so much commission money last month, he told me he bought his friend a brand new house!""

The group looks astonished. ""Wow,"" they all say. 

""That's great,"" says Robert.

Then, the group sees Tom coming back from the restroom to take his seat.

""Tom!"" shouted Jill. ""We we were talking about our sons and what they've been up to. What about you? I remember you telling us you had a son. What's he doing these days?""

""Well, my son's not doing too well,"" replies Tom. ""He came out of the closet as gay about a month ago, which my wife and I suspected, but that's not the problem. The problem is he is a highly promiscuous sex addict. He will use different guys for sex and then drop them. He has gotten a couple different STDs the past month, and the doctor told him to slow down, but he refuses. My wife and I terribly worried about him.""

""Oh, that's awful."" Said Laura.

""I am so sorry,"" gasps Jill.

We ordered an Uber which arrived shortly after. 

But right when we were leaving the house, the damn cat ran back inside through the closing door. Cat alone at home is a bad idea though because she always tries to eat the birds. 

So my wife got in the Uber and I went inside to hush the cat back out. This took quite some time. 

My wife is a little over-cautious and didn't want the Uber driver to think the house will be empty.  So she told him that I just went back inside to say goodbye to my mother in law. 

A few minutes later I was in the Uber too and apologized for being late. I said to my wife:

""That stupid bitch hid under the bed. So I had to use the broom to shove her fat ass out of there. She tried to run but I grabbed her by the neck and wrapped a blanket around her so she couldn't scratch me. 
I took her down the stairs and threw her in the backyard. Let's just hope she doesn't shit in the pool again.""

Due to the lack of copper he looks towards gold as a replacement. To determine what type of gold is suitable for light bulb filament he sets up a series of experiments to determine this. First, he melts a variety of gold products such as gold watches, gold bars, gold jewelry, and even gold nose rings into usable metal. After getting the raw material, Steven creates gold watch filament lightbulbs, gold bar filament light bulbs, etc with the different metals. Steven then tests for how bright and strong the filament is during stress tests and and discovers that the gold nose ring filament light bulb is in fact the best since it has a excellent heat to light emitted ratio. Thus Steven began mass producing such light bulb and creates a huge fortune off of his product. Millions praise Steven for illuminating the world and bringing light to dark homes. This all ended when suddenly, a year after the implementation of the new lightbulbs, the city Steven was in, and the rest of the world, suffered a unexpected blackout. Panic insued. Riots broke out. There were reports all across the city of Stevens lightbulbs exploding in a glory of sparks for no reason. Steven felt like he let down the entire world and began to cry and tear up. On the floor of his 5 million dollar skyscraper mansion, he curled pathetically, looking through his window at the dark city, lit by riot fire and raging torches rather than Stevens lights. 

As the city fell into chaos, Robert, a good friend of Steven barged into the Stevens bedroom and screamed ""STEVEN YOU DUMBASS WHAT TYPE OF METAL DID YOU CHOOSE FOR THE LIGHTBULBS.""

The Highways Agency found over 200 dead crows on the A421, near the Northampton roundabout recently, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu. A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. 

The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.


The Agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike""",Drivers be aware,106

He takes a sip of the drink, his wife takes a sip and then sets the cup down between them. As he begins to eat his few bites of hamburger, the people around them keep looking over and whispering “That poor old couple — all they can afford is one meal for the two of them.”

As the man begins to eat his fries a young man comes to the table. He politely offers to buy another meal for the old couple. The old man replies that they’re just fine — they’re just used to sharing everything.

The surrounding people noticed the little old lady hadn’t eaten a bite. She sits there watching her husband eat and occasionally taking turns sipping the drink.

Again the young man comes over and begs them to let him buy another meal for them.

As the old man finishes and was wipes his face neatly with the napkin, the young man again comes over to the little old lady who had yet to eat a single bite of food and asks “May I ask what is it you are waiting for?”

It was one he longed for since he was a wee lad. He worked tirelessly for years until he acquired enough money, land, and rights to raise these wonderful creatures.

Bison.

The rancher never truly understood why he held such a prolonged admiration for their kind. He thought perhaps it had to do with the fact that bison are the largest mammal in the United States, that his uncle Kevin conditioned him when he was young by wearing a bison mask and playing dress up with him in the closet, or maybe it was just their cute little bison beards. Regardless, he loved everything about their species, and vowed his life to theirs.

He owned almost two dozen bison, and four calves. Strangely enough, instead of staying together as one herd, they typically formed three segregated groups and stuck to them. No amount of coaxing from the rancher ever brought them together as one.

After observing the groups and their behavior for a time, jotting it down on a scratch pad, he noted that Group 1 was constantly trying to intimidate Group 2. Group 1 would stamp their hooves at them, and sometimes even approach them with their horns lowered, causing them to flee. If Group 1 wanted something, they got it.

Group 3 generally kept to themselves and stayed clear of both other groups.

Over time, Group 2 became increasingly frustrated with their treatment by Group 1, and started displaying more aggressive behavior themselves. Interestingly however, instead of retaliating at Group 1, they turned their sights to Group 3. Group 2's hostility toward Group 3 grew over time from a mild bullying, to just as offensive as Group 1 was to them.

The rancher was amazed by this change in behavior. Instead of fighting back against the bullies, the second group decided to copy their aggressive behavior and treat badly the perceived weaker group.

In light of this discovery, the rancher wrote in his notepad,

""Buffalo buffalo, Buffalo buffalo buffalo, buffalo Buffalo buffalo.""","There once lived a rancher in Buffalo, New York",0

When the banker arrives at the farm he notices a very tame and friendly pig, running around as if nothing's wrong, had a wooden leg. If you didn't know any better you would think the pig was a dog, would help the old farmer out of his truck, hold the spring gate open for him, just a wonderful pig. 

As the farmer explains his planting strategy, watering plans, etc, the banker gets ever more curious about the pig and it's wooden leg, and decides to asks about the pig. 

The farmer explains, ""This pig?! Oh, this is a wonderful pig, early this spring, the chickens were awoken by a fox in the middle of the night, and the pig stormed in there and chased off the fox, such a wonderful pig.""

Mid-way through the season, the banker's curiosity gets the best of him and decides to do a wellness check on the farmer and as he pulled up, noticed the pig had two wooden legs.

The farmer instantly explains about forecasts and how he wouldn't have any trouble paying his loan in full, but the banker isn't interested, and asks again about the pig.

""Oh this pig?!"", exclaims the farmer, ""such a wonderful pig. Just last week, it saved my life. I fell in the kitchen, and he ran 5 miles to the neighbors to get help, just such a wonderful pig"".

Normally, the bank only meets with the farmer annually, but had to know the story with the pig and two wooden legs, he makes up another story to check in on the farmer after harvest time. Upon arrival, notices the same pig, this time with three wooden legs.

He meets the farmer at the gate with his pet pig, and the farmer is confused why the banker is there. The debts are paid up, but the Banker explains, ""Sorry to drop in on you, but before I forget, why does your pet pig have three wooden legs?""

The farmer asks, ""If you had such a wonderful pig, would you eat him all at once?"" ",Farmer meets with Banker annually,12

It was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While she was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on her. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, she began to realize how warm she was getting, as the dung was actually thawing her out. She lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, promptly dug her out and ate her.

**Moral of the story**

1. Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy.

2. Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.

3. And when you’re in deep shit, it’s best to keep your mouth shut.","Lesson 6 of 6: The Bird, the Cat and the Cow dung",828

They're rich enough that they don't have to skimp out on the number of coins they get, so the cashier gives them four rolls of each type of coin--pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters. Sure, maybe it was overkill, but they were in America, where bigger meant better, so they didn't mind.

The Beatles were not a particularly rich sort before their big break, so it may not be surprising that they went from withdrawing no money at the bank to withdrawing a lot of it, leaving no middle room to go there asking for coins. It was, in fact, the first time any of them had seen a coin roll.

""Look at this!"" said Paul, ""That's a bloody line of quarters! A quarter line! And all the other coins are in lines too!"" 

The cashier tried to explain coin rolls, but the Beatles were already so overjoyed with this discovery that they didn't hear and kept on calling them coin lines.

They walk out and get in a car with a driver that was waiting for them--Ringo in the front, George in the back left, Paul in the back right, and John in the middle.

They put the money in the middle of the car, in the little bit of space between driver and passenger seat. There's no pocket there, as the car is from the sixties, but it shouldn't really matter--after all, they're worth a lot more than their money is.

They drive out of the airport when, all of a sudden, a car traveling in the opposite direction identifies them and tries to swerve in front of them to stop the car. The Beatles speed up to counter, and they end up colliding head-on.

Majestically, three of the Beatles are unscathed as well as the driver. But the fourth--John, who was sitting directly behind the money, took the full brunt of the blow. The quarters, nickels, and dimes drove into his chest before bouncing back down to the floor of the car, but the penny rolls were launched in such a trajectory that they lodged themselves into various facial features.

When the initial shock died down, Ringo asked, ""John, are you okay?"" But John couldn't hear or see him--those appendages were blocked off.

""Aaa-argh!"" shouted Lennon, ""Penny lines are in my ears and in my eyes!""",So the Beatles go to America for the first time.,18

He loved his home and his anemone, but underwater Chicago was worse than the one we know, so he had to stay home most of the time. 

Then one day, the ~~inevitable~~ unthinkable happened. Some fish broke into his anemone with a knife!

Barry tried to stop the invader, but  the burglar chopped his fin right off!

Finless and in pain, Barry was left there to die. But luckily his bud Dan found him and brought him to the intensive care anemone. They saved him, but couldn't do anything about the missing fin. Thus Barry had to live a hard life, without his right fin. 

But in the background, the fin, lying there in the crime scene, was swallowed up by the anemone. Thinking it was food, the anemone used it.

A few weeks later, Barry returned home. All was normal... for now. 

Anemones are living things, and they reproduce. So it was no huge shock when Barry, coming back from work one Tuesday, saw a growing anemone baby in the middle of his home!

He decided to take care of it like it was his baby. As it matured, he began to notice the anemone was taking a different shape. 

Before long, it became a very distinct shape. 

""It... it's my fin!"", exclaimed Barry. 

Dan rushed to his house when he got the text from Barry. ""I can't believe it!"", he said.

""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday.""


I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.


My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.


As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said,


""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!""


It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, 

""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.""


I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""



We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.
She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table.


We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.


On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?""


I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""


She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""


After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said,



""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""



""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.


Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy birthday"".


And I just sat there...


On the couch...

The elephant seems distressed so the man approaches very   carefully. He gets down on one knee and inspects the bottom of   the elephant's foot only to find a large thorn deeply embedded. As   carefully and as gently as he can he removes the thorn and the   elephant gingerly puts its foot down. The elephant turns to face   the man and with a rather stern look on its face, stares at him. For   a good ten minutes the man stands frozen - thinking of nothing   else but being trampled.  
  
Eventually the elephant turns and walks away.  
  
For years after, the man often remembers and ponders the events   of that day. Years later the man is walking through the zoo with   his son. As they approach the elephant enclosure, one of the   elephants turns and walks over to where they are standing at the   rail. It stares at him and the man can't help wondering if this is   the same elephant. The man climbs tentatively over the railing   and makes his way into the enclosure. He walks right up to the   elephant and stares back in wonder. Suddenly the elephant wraps   its trunk around one of the man's legs and swings him wildly back   and forth along the railing, instantly killing him.  
  
Probably not the same elephant then.  ",A man saves an elephant.,5

They first month the farmers feed the pig, but all he does is eat and shit, eat and shit, and eat and shit. 11 months go by and the pig still only ways 20 pounds.

The other two think this is a great idea so they they put a cork in the pigs butt. The next month the pig gains almost 1000 pounds! The day of the fair it takes the farmers, their wives, and their children to load the pig into the back of the truck. 

They head off to the fair, certain of victory. But in the way one says, ""What if the judges see the cork? Then what?"" The other farms think for a second. ""Well we should pull it out."" The farmers agree.

""Joe, you do it."" 

""I'm not gonna do it! Jim, you do it""

""I'm not gonna do it! John, you do it!""

""Hell no!""

They think for a second when they have an idea. ""Remember the monkey picking up acorns? We'll get him to do it!"" They agree. They find the farm with the monkey and point to the cork and make a pulling motion. Then they each run away. The first stands 100 yards away, the next 200, and the last at 300. The monkey pulls the cork, the pig explodes, and the next thing the farmers know they are in a hospital. 

Doctors ask the third what he saw. 

""Shit, shit, and more shit.""

Then they ask the second what he saw.

""Shit, shit, and more shit.""

They get to the third and he is crying from laughing so hard.

""What did you see?""

""I saw the poor little monkey try to stick the cork back in!""",Three farmers go out to the State Fair.,13

One day he's by himself, and decides to brave the alley. As he gets to the last house before his church, he hears a voice from an open garage.

""Hey you, kid. Where are you heading?"" the man asks.

""I'm going to church, for Sunday school."" the boy responds plainly.

""Why would you do that? Why not just play outside?"" the man responds. ""It's a weekend, great time to have fun. That's the best part of being an atheist. No pointless traditions.""

""It's not a pointless tradition. I go because I'm a Christian, and we Christians go to Sunday School."" the boy responds matter-of-factly.

""Do you even have a good reason for being a Christian?"" the atheist continues to ask.

""I have two good reasons, in fact. My dad is a Christian, and my mom is a Christian!"" he says.

""Those aren't very good reasons, kid. What if your dad was an idiot, and your mom was an idiot?"" the atheist asks arrogantly.

On a warm day during the following spring, he was outside his cabin making repairs, when he noticed something coming down the the side of the mountain to his north.  The man grabbed his binoculars and scanned across the side of the nearby mountain.

It was another person! He observed that the individual was headed in his direction and was almost to the valley below him. Having spent the past year in seclusion he was excited to have some human interaction.

After a good while, the approaching stranger had made it through the valley and was approaching the man's cabin. Peering through his binoculars once more, the man saw that it was another man, about the same age as him wearing shabby clothing.

More time passed and finally the stranger arrived at the man's cabin. The stranger tipped his hat to the man and stated with a booming voice, ""Welcome to the neighborhood! I came here to invite you to a party at my cabin over yonder on the other mountain.""

The man was stunned. He had no idea that there was another human within several miles of him, let alone enough people to throw a party. The man asked the stranger ""What kind of party can you have in the middle of no where?""

The stranger grinned at the man. ""Oh you're gonna love this kinda party! There's gonna be some eatin' and drinkin' and fightin' and fuckin'!!"" The man's mind ran wild with anticipation and he excitedly took the stranger up on 

The man grabbed his coat and started following the stranger down into the valley below.

Every day, it was the same routine. She got up at 8:00, got dressed in one of three outfits she had laid out, got coffee, went to work, got home, ate dinner at the nearby Chinese place, brushed her teeth, and went to bed. Eing decided she needed a change.

Her life-long friend Rebecca, who had moved from their hometown in Connecticut to stay with Eing, was sorry to see her go. She would have gone with her, but she had just leased an apartment, and she had a contract. Sadly, their communication quickly dropped to near non-existent.

A few months into the move, Rebecca jokingly remarked that she could never remember the name of Eing's new home country, and so she would call it the Land of Tar due to it's chief export being bitumen and pitch. The last communication they had was Eing's response, laughing at the remark, and saying that she had finally found someone, settled down, and was 2 weeks pregnant.

Around 8 months later, Rebecca started wondering about Eing and the baby. Was s/he born? what was the baby's name? Alas, in all of her joking, she had actually forgotten the name of Eing's country. 

She knew the postal address for the major city. (It was a small country, with only 2 cities, the largest one in the center.) The city had the same name as the country, so Rebecca called it the Land of Tar as well.

It had been so many months, and Rebecca couldn't recall where Eing lived, so she took out a column in the personals of the local newspaper she knew Eing read, and, being frugal, she used as few words as possible to communicate the recipient and the message.

Two days later, Eing opened the newspaper to find the following message

The other guy runs to the closet and grabs the broomstick. He runs back and shoves it in there. It takes a second, but he quickly responds.

She tells him to begin and braces herself. The man then notices a basket of corn beside the bed and gets an idea. He inserts the corn several times into the girl and to his surprise, she can't tell the difference.


He tosses the used corn out of the window after she finishes and shakes the farmer's hand. On his way out to receive his promised refuel, his friends are pointing and laughing at him.

As I turn on the hose, I look over at my car and decide it needs washing.

As I start toward the garage, I notice mail on the table that I collected from the letter box earlier. I decide to go through the mail before I wash the car.

I lay my car keys on the table, put the junk mail in the rubbish bin under the table, and notice that it is full.

So, I decide to put the bills back on the table and take out the rubbish first.

But then I think, since I’m going to be near the post-box when I take out the rubbish anyway, I may as well pay the bills first.

I take my check book off the table, and see that there is only 1 check left.

My extra checks are in my desk in the study, so I go inside the house to my desk where I find the can of Coke I’d been drinking.

I’m going to look for my checks, but first I need to push the Coke aside so that I don’t accidentally knock it over.

The Coke is getting warm, and I decide to put it in the fridge to keep it cold.

As I head toward the kitchen with the Coke, a vase of flowers on the worktop catches my eye – they need water.

I put the Coke on the worktop and discover my reading glasses that I’ve been searching for all morning.

I decide I better put them back on my desk, but first I’m going to water the flowers. I set the glasses back down on the worktop, fill a container with water and suddenly spot the TV remote control.

Someone left it on the kitchen table. I realise that tonight when we watch TV, I’ll be looking for the remote control, but I won’t remember that it’s on the kitchen table, so I decide to put it back in the front room where it belongs, but first I’ll water the flowers.

I pour some water in the flowers, but quite a bit of it spills on the floor.

So, I set the remote control back on the table, get some towels and wipe up the spill.

Then, I head down the hall trying to remember what I was planning to do.

At the end of the day:

- the car isn’t washed

- the bills aren’t paid

- there is a warm can of Coke sitting on the worktop

- the flowers don’t have enough water

- there is still only 1 cheque in my cheque book

- I can’t find the remote control

- I can’t find my glasses

- and I don’t remember what I did with the car keys.

Then, when I try to figure out why nothing got done today, I’m really baffled because I know I was busy all day, and I’m really tired.

I realize this is a serious problem, and I’ll try to get some help for it, but first I’ll check my e-mail.",[LONG] The life of an old man.,4

""Captain, captain, what do we do?"" asked the first mate.


""First mate,"" said the captain, ""go to my cabin, open my sea chest, and bring me my red shirt."" The first mate did so.


Wearing his bright red shirt, the captain exhorted his crew to fight. 

So inspiring was he, in fact, that the pirate ship was repelled without casualties.


A few days later, the ship was again approached, this time by two pirate sloops!
""Captain, captain, what should we do?""
""First mate, bring me my red shirt!""


The crew, emboldened by their fearless captain, fought heroically, and managed to defeat both boarding parties, though they took many casualties. That night, the survivors had a great celebration. 

The first mate asked the captain the secret of his bright red shirt.

""It's simple, first mate. If I am wounded, the blood does not show, and the crew continues to fight without fear.""

A week passed, and they were nearing their home port, when suddenly the lookout cried that ten ships of the enemy's armada were approaching!

""Captain, captain, we're in terrible trouble, what do we do?""

The first mate looked expectantly at the miracle worker.

Pale with fear, the captain commanded, ""First mate.... bring me my brown pants!""",There was a treasure ship on its way back to port.,26

&amp;nbsp;

So, there's a man crawling through the desert.

&amp;nbsp;

He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.

&amp;nbsp;

He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.

&amp;nbsp;

He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right.

&amp;nbsp;

He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.

&amp;nbsp;

He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.

&amp;nbsp;

By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.

&amp;nbsp;

As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.
Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.

&amp;nbsp;

He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.

&amp;nbsp;

He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.

&amp;nbsp;

He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.

&amp;nbsp;

Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.

&amp;nbsp;

Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.
As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.

&amp;nbsp;

He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference and keep himself from passing out.

&amp;nbsp;

He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.

&amp;nbsp;

He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills, dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water. Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.

&amp;nbsp;

After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.

&amp;nbsp;

After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.

&amp;nbsp;

He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.

&amp;nbsp;

He walks through the sand.

&amp;nbsp;

After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.
But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.
Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.

&amp;nbsp;

While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape - shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.

&amp;nbsp;

He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.

&amp;nbsp;

Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can't tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look.

&amp;nbsp;

He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune. After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.

&amp;nbsp;

He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.

&amp;nbsp;

So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance.

&amp;nbsp;

He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just keeps crawling.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center, where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area.

&amp;nbsp;

His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface.

&amp;nbsp;

Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.

&amp;nbsp;

He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling.

&amp;nbsp;

It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's hearing. He would swear that someone just said, ""Greetings, traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?""

&amp;nbsp;

He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again. Better this time.

&amp;nbsp;

Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet out of the stone, at an angle.

&amp;nbsp;

And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.
He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from this spot.

&amp;nbsp;

Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.

&amp;nbsp;

Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet - that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.

&amp;nbsp;

He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.

&amp;nbsp;

He tries to clear his throat to say, ""Hello,"" but his throat is too dry. All that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out, almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes out.

&amp;nbsp;

He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips, and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk now.

&amp;nbsp;

He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, ""Hello? Is there anyone here?""

&amp;nbsp;

He hears, from his side, ""Greetings. What is it that you want?""

&amp;nbsp;

He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides to try asking for help.

&amp;nbsp;

""Please,"" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, ""I'd love to not be thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?""

&amp;nbsp;

Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he falls forward, face first on the stone, ""Very well. Coming up.""

&amp;nbsp;

A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped around the tilted white post, still looking at him.

&amp;nbsp;

He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet. He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes - they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been bitten. By the snake.

&amp;nbsp;

""It'll feel better in a minute."" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!
""Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?""

&amp;nbsp;

""Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,"" says the snake. ""That's the way I work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.""

&amp;nbsp;

""You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?""

&amp;nbsp;

""No,"" says the snake, ""I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting around here.""

&amp;nbsp;

The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sit
