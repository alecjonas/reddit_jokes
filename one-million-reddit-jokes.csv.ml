""You know,"" he says to the gorilla, ""we don't get too many gorillas in here.""

""She's in the Ladies' Bowling League, honey. We share lanes with them.""

""Hi Davey. Want your usual table dance, big boy?""

Dave's wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club. Dave follows and spots her getting into a cab. Before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her.

The poor actor tells his sad story to his barber later that day, to which the barber says, ""I know just how you can make love to that beautiful nun!""

The barber responds, ""Every Tuesday night she goes to the local cemetery to pray next to the old pastor's tomb, just paint your dick white, show up that night and claim you are God and command her to make love to you, she surely will.""

The actor, encouraged by that great idea, paints his dick white and sure enough when he shows up to the dark cemetery the nun is there praying.

He walks up to her, in the nude, and with his member painted white, and confidently says, ""I am God, I will make all your prayers come true, but first you must make love to me!""

The excited nun says, ""Oh yes my Lord! But from behind please, I need to keep my virginity.""

She lifts her dress and the actor gets to do his long awaited deed.

A cowboy rides into town and heads for the bar. He asked the bartender “So, where can I get some action in this town”

The bartender replies “Well there’s Miss Lilly, Hellova good time but she’s $100”

The Cowboy says “$100? I can’t afford that”

The bartender says “well there’s always Wang Qi the Chinaman…”

“Yea I don’t go for that shit” says the cowboy.

After an hour, the cowboy asks again. “Anyone else?”

“Well there’s Miss Elsie, not as sweet as Lilly but still fun, she’s $75”.

“$75, still too much for my blood”

“Well, there’s always Wang Qi the Chinaman…”

“yea I don’t go for that shit” again replied cowboy.

Several hours later, the cowboy is getting mighty cranky with no relief.  After a bottle of rotgut, he says “Ok ta Hell with it, Bring on Wang Qi!”

“Ok” says the bartender, “Wang Qi it is!, that’ll be $200...”

“$200!!! To fuck a Chinaman??!” the cowboy asks indignantly.

“Yea” Says the bartender “it takes 4 of use to hold him down, Wang Qi, he don’t go for that shit either”.

""How about me? Would you do me for saving you?"" He shiftily asked while gesturing at his Thomas. 

""What the fuck is wrong with you!? No!"" She yelled angrily.

""We have had great season, Comrade Petrov,"" the farmer says. ""Were we to stack all potatoes together, they would fill entire Kremlin!""

Satisfied, Petrov arranges delivery of the potatoes, and gets back in his car to visit the next farm.

The second farmer, eyeing the two jackboots and their Kalashnikovs, tells a similar story. ""Comrade Petrov, we have had incredible season! Were you to turn all potatoes into Vodka, you could pour river that would cross all of Siberia!""

Petrov notes the farmer's enthusiasm, and bids him a good day. The final farm on his list lies about a mile to the north. Unfortunately, his car breaks down somewhere along the road. He and the secret policemen push the car for the next 20 minutes, before happening across the very farmer they were supposed to visit.

Wasting no time, Petrov stops pushing, and asks him about his potato yield.

The farmer replies, ecstatically, ""Comrade Petrov, we have had unbelievable season! Were you to burn all potatoes as fuel, you could drive to the gates of heaven and race against God himself!""

Satisfied, Petrov notes the farmer's response. ""Very good, comrade, but you forget yourself. This is the Soviet Union, there is no God.""

""That's okay, there are no potatoes.""","The Soviet Union, 1949",2

Exclaimed the genie, throwing his arms wide and his chest out. Before him, an elderly man stood, his fingers still clutches around the lamp. And though wrinkles cut into the man's face, and wisps of grey hair danced around his temple, the genie was his senior by two thousand years. A difficult feat, considering the man himself couldn't remember his own age.

""Well, let's see,"" said the man, stroking his scraggly beard, more wrinkles appearing as he entered heavy thought. ""Whatever shall I choose? I've already chosen my two favorites.""

He smiled, revealing his last two crooked teeth that clutched stubbornly to his gums like trees left after a hurricane. 

""*Those* were your two favorites?"" exclaimed the genie, slapping his head with a heavily ringed hand, ""Surely you have something better! Something exciting, something incredible! A once in a lifetime opportunity you want to see twice!""

""Oh no, oh no,"" the man shook his head, his expression certain, ""Number one surely was the day I met Annabelle. I really can't top that. Impossible, I'd say.""

""Your best memory was the day you met your cat?"" the genie asked, incredulous, ""How about the day you met your wife?!""

""Oh no!"" Cackled the man, ""That's not a good one at all! If you were a regular genie, I'd ask you to scrub that memory away!  And second would have to be that one time at Bellisimos, when I ate an entire deep dish pizza by myself! Oh, the cheese, I still find bits in my beard.  Those two certainly were the best I've ever had.""

""Come on,"" sighed the genie, glancing at his watch, ""If those were the two best ones, surely it shouldn't be hard to find one even better! Hell, you could just go back to Bellisimos, you didn't have to waste a wish on it!""

""Nope, they don't let me in there anymore after I stopped paying,"" the man frowned, ""But it's been a hard life. If I could, I'd relive those two memories forever. Say, what if-""

""No!"" shouted the genie, his face whitening as he realized the next words to come out of the man's mouth, ""Don't!""

""What if I relived this experience, the one I just had with you? Yes, that's my third wish!""",[Long] The Genie's Experience. (Taken from r/WritingPrompts but works on r/Jokes),6

Every day at noon, a man who had the job of ringing the bell would hit it.  A young orphan boy would always go wait around the back of the church to listen to the bells ring.  One day, the priest noticed him. ""What are you doing all alone, here?""
The boy replied, ""I love listening to the bells ring, they should be ringing in exactly one minute!""
The priest smiled and invites the boy in.  He walks him up to the big bell, and offers him the opportunity to ring it. After the priest walks away, filled with excitement, the boy rushes up towards the bell, but trips and falls forward into it.  A powerful ring comes, echoing across town, from the orphan's face slamming into the giant metal bell. The priest comes back running up the stairs, and the boy starts apologizing, saying how he tripped and hit his face on the bell, but immediately after finishing, the priest exclaims, ""That was amazing! I've never heard such a beautiful bell! How would you like to ring it every day, seeing as you already know the timing?""
The boy is ecstatic, and immediately accepts the offer.  He is so dedicated to the job, that he spends all his time in the bell tower, only sneaking out late at night to steal food.  Many years later, nobody in the town remembers him, due to his constant absence.  Shop owners forget his daring thievery, mothers forget the kid playing and running around the street, and the priest forgets him too.  However, one night, as he is stealing a loaf of bread from a bakery, the baker spots him, and reports it to the authorities.  They sketch him as best they can, and ask around town if they know who it is, but no one does.  Then, they go into the old church and ask the priest.  The old man ponders for a moment and says,
""I don't know his name, but his face rings a bell.""",There was this quaint old town . . .,53

Every year, on weighing day and according to custom, the married men would stand their wives on neatly spread animal skins, and the chief of the tribe would come around with a crude seesaw and balance the wives of one man against those of another in order to determine the relative importance of the men. Now Gog had only one wife, who was very heavy, while Gug had two much slenderer wives, and all year the two men argued as to who was the more important, When weighing day arrived, Gog placed his wife on a large hippopotamus skin, and Gug placed his wives on two small gazelle skins 

When the weighing was performed, it was found that Gog’s wife exactly balanced against the two wives of Gug. Thus it turned out that the two men were equally important, since, by the chief’s ruling, “the squaw on the hippopotamus is equal to the sum of the squaws on the other two hides.”

A scientist had two Iarge jars before him on the laboratory table. The jar on his left contained a hundred fleas; the jar on his right was empty. The scientist carefully lifted a flea from the jar on the left, placed the flea on the table between the two jars, stepped back and in a loud voice said, “Jump.” The flea jumped and was put in the jar on the right. A second flea was carefully lifted from the jar on the left and placed on the table between the two jars. Again the scientist stepped back and in a loud voice said, “Jump.” The flea jumped and was put in the jar on the right. In the same manner, the scientist treated each of the hundred fleas in the jar on the left, and each flea jumped as ordered. 

The two jars were then interchanged and the experiment continued with a slight difference. This time the scientist carefully lifted a flea from the jar on the left, yanked of its hind legs, placed the flea on the table between the jars, stepped back and in a loud voice said, “Jump.” The flea did not jump, and was put in the jar on the right. A second flea was carefully lifted from the jar on the left, its hind legs yanked off, and then placed on the table between the two jars. Again the scientist stepped back and in a loud voice said, “Jump.” The flea did not jump, and was put in the jar on the right. In this manner, the scientist treated each of the hundred fleas in the jar on the left, and in no case did a flea jump when ordered. 

So the scientist recorded in his notebook the following induction: “A flea, if its hind legs are yanked off, cannot hear.” ",Found in an old math book,13

In front of him was the most repulsive being you could conceive. The very idea of disgusting. She winked at the man, and said ""Stay with me, or you'll blow up."" Panicking, he went past the woman and climbed up the flight of stairs behind her. He reached another room, with an other hideous lady, but slightly less so than the previous one. Again, she said ""Stay With me, or you blow up."" 

The man took no notice and continued climbing. On each floor, there was a woman more beautiful than the last. However, each said the same thing: ""Stay with me, or you'll blow up."" When he reached the 9th floor, the most gorgeous woman he ever saw was standing before him. Again, she gave him the same warning. 

The man thought: if that woman is te most beautiful woman I've ever seen, the one on the 10th floor must be a goddess... So he walked past her, and climbed the last set of stairs. When he reached the 10th floor, the door locked behind him. 

In front of him, loomed a giant of a man. Impossibly huge, naked save for a leopard-patterned thong, with quite the noticeable bulge. The giant smiled.

""Hi, The name's Up.""

Sorry, this joke doesn't work in English, I had to adapt it.",The girls in the tower,15

I ask the waiter for food, he said food only comes in sets of 10 dishes each. There are three main chefs there and the restaurant is peculiar because they all want to cook only their own set. So I decide to go to the restaurant once for each chef.

The first set I ordered was delicious, all at a reasonable price. It was a bit weird though as every dish on the menu had soy sauce, but I ordered anyway. I asked the waiter why this was. ""Oh,"" he said, ""that is Chinese cook."" 

I left satisfied and came again another time for second set. This time, all 10 of the dishes were pasta. I asked the waiter again about this. ""Oh,"" he said, ""that is Italian cook."" 

I became accustomed to the restaurant's peculiarity. I was especially curious about the third chef. 

The next night, I immediately ordered the third set without looking. It was surprisingly varied and normal, except that only nine dishes came out. After finishing the ninth meal, I asked the waiter where the tenth dish was. 

""That is the tenth dish. This chef skipped the ninth,"" he said. 

Agitated, I asked who the chef was so I could complain personally.

""Oh,"" the waiter replied. ""that is Tim Cook."" ",1/10 would not visit here again,20

""I loved Katy Perry's most recent album!"" said one of the partygoers.

""Katy Perry's music always makes me feel great!"" replied another. 

""Me too! I think her music is *sooo* much better than Taylor Swift's."" chimed in another, not realizing that Taylor Swift was within earshot. 

Pissed off, Taylor Swift started briskly walking over to them, intending to give them a piece of her mind, when someone bumps into her. ""Ahh!"" she squeals, when she sees that her drink spilled all over her dress. Taylor is mad as a hornet now. 

The person who bumped into her looks at her and starts stammering, ""Oh my god, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to-- you're Taylor Swift, right, oh my god, you're Taylor Swift, I'm such a big fan--!!"" Before he could continue to stammer, she looked him sternly in the eye and said:

When she was a child, she would pass by a genetic research lab on her way to school every day. So Ai decided to become a genetic researcher. She stayed up late every night studying and doing homework so that she could move to America and attend Yale, the best Genetics school she could find. Then when she turned 18, her hard work paid off and she flew from her home city of Hangzhou to the entirely foreign city of New Haven, CT. 

On her first day in New Haven, Ai got lost and her English wasn't too good so she couldn't find help. Then a Chinese-American man walked up to her and introduced himself in Chinese as Jack Fun. He gave her directions to where she was headed and they parted ways. Then, when classes started, Ai met Jack again. As it turned out, both of them were students. After a few months, Ai and Jack started dating, and they were very happy. 

However, on Ai's 20th birthday, all her organ systems started failing. She died soon after, but Jack couldn't handle losing her, so he got some of his friends from the Biomedicine and Engineering departments to make a new Ai that was part-human, part-machine and looked and acted almost exactly like the original Ai. The newly dubbed Ai-2 broke down and died a month after her creation. Jack refused to give up. He built another Ai, but she died three months after she was created. The Ais kept dying, but Jack couldn't bear to wake up every day without knowing that Ai would be there. So he kept building them, even after he graduated Yale and moved across the country, losing funding for his projects and plummeting himself into debt.

Eventually, he built a seemingly successful Ai, after six attempts. This one -  after 10 years of total medical stability and on the day after their wedding - went into a coma. Jack's friends heard about this, so they decided to build him yet another Ai so that he could be convinced to pull the plug on the previous one. However, by the time they flew across the country to tell him, Ai-6 died and Jack had committed suicide, no longer able to deal with the grief of losing his beloved six times. 

And that's why Ai Fun-7 has no Jack.",The Tragic Tale of Ai and Jack,2

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them unchaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.
Because i didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, i explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.
""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her arse with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night? The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a very strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know.

If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?

The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk. The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.

The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.

The monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.

He says, Real funny. May I have the key? The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.

The man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end .

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But he can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.
