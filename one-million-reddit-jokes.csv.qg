""Only one"".

The manager's furious. You only made one sale? The rest of my staff make many more than that. Well, how much was it for? 

The guy replies ""$499,565"".

The manager is shocked. You mean you made all that from one sale? What on earth did you sell?

The guy then proceeds to explain how a gentleman came in to buy a small fishing hook so he sold him one. Then he sold him a medium one then a large one. He then asked him where he was fishing and he replied down at the lake so he took him to the boats and sold him a small rowing boat. The chap then exclaimed that he didn't think his car was big enough to tow the boat so he sold him a 4x4 as well. 

The manager is stunned. You mean to tell me he came in to buy a small fishing hook and you sold him a boat and a car?

I was 17 and I was broke -- almost. I had a guitar and a few dollars left. 

My dad gave up the farm and drifted on. My mother went back to her folks, but I could never stand them. I had an uncle in Chicago.  

My family never spoke much about him, except that he was involved in some kind of car business, but I gave him a call. For a minute, he paused when he heard my name. Then, he remembered and warmed up a little. I lay my situation on the line and asked for a job. 

""You know, kepler, I might have something..."", He thought about it. ""Can I call you back?""

I told him, ""Not really, I'm kinda...""

He laughed, ""The hell, take the train. I'll pick you up.""

And that's how I became a hitman. The car lot was semi-legitimate, but all the real money came from the laundering and fencing stolen cars. These weren't the good old days, everybody still remembered the WWII black market. The oldtimers remembered prohibition. But we also did loans.

That's where I came in. There was a guy who'd borrowed more than he'd ever pay back. One of our guys had a soft spot for him, so he'd been given a long leash, but the man was a gambler. A losing gambler who'd taken the leash and hung himself. 

Usually this stuff is about image -- hit him hard enough that people watching think twice about fooling around. But we had orders to take it easy this time.

The gambler got wind somehow and was taking the night train out of town. Can't remember where he was going -- probably nowhere, but I was going with him. I had a fresh face and half a bottle of whiskey. Took a little bag and my guitar so I'd look like a real traveler.

My uncle told me, ""Just show him the bottle. He's a lush and he'll drink it all.""

""what's in it?"" I said.

""whiskey, mostly."" And he didn't say more about it. 

You might be wondering how I felt about this. Mostly, I was worried I'd find a way to screw it up. Killing wasn't real to me, neither was this tired old drifter who'd gambled with his life and lost. At the time, I was more worried what my uncle and the other men would think about me if i turned up yellow. 

I was feeling a little cocky as I bought my ticket, but that changed a little when I got into the passenger car with him. For one second, he glanced up from the window at me, measured me like a tailor does. I was terrified that he could see everything, but he turned to the window again.

 My uncle boarded a minute after I did, looked at the three other passengers. Only one fit the description, but he nodded at him anyway. The gambler wasn't paying attention. 

If there was a moment that almost broke me, this was it. I had to approach this man, act like a friend. Can't tell you what went on in my head at this point, but I did it. Sat down on the bench facing him, with the little table between us. He was still looking out the window, so I did it, too. Wasn't long before the trip started.

We sat like that for a long time. I had the bottle in my hand, but I couldn't say anything.

Presently, he spoke to me. Must have been bored or maybe thirsty. ""Son, I've gotten to be pretty fair at telling what shape folks are in by the way they look. You let me at that bottle, and i'll give you some advice.""

I couldn't move, but he helped himself. Tipped it all back. When he finished, he put the bottle down on the table. I was fully nervous now, and my ears were playing tricks on me, because it got deathly quiet. The noise of the train was just gone, like a radio turned off. 

He turned and looked at me again with expressionless eyes. Then he seemed to relax and he started to tell me about his life. He talked about the tricks he'd played to stay alive and the way he played cards. He spoke for about half an hour as we rode that train, until he crushed his cigarette and turned to the window. 

At some point, he fell asleep. 

When the train pulled into the station, I took my luggage and just left. They had a house for me to lay low in for a few days before I would have headed back to Chicago, but I stayed away. I didn't want to go back, so I kept drifting on. On either the fourth or fifth night after, I pulled into a bar. 

I still had all my stuff with me. When the barman noticed my guitar case, he started hassling me to play. I did and it turned into a really good thing. That gig kept me together for a while until a few of my songs got picked up on the local station. Later, I had a few songs make it onto the country top forty, back when there still was such a thing. 

But sometimes, when the night gets dark and quiet, I still think about the gambler. In his dying words, i found an ace that I could keep. He said, 
You've got to know when to hold 'em. 
Know when to fold 'em. 
Know when to walk away 
and know when to run. 
You never count your money, 
when you're sittin' at the table. 
There'll be time enough for countin' 
when the dealin's done",when i killed a man [long af],1

My girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend? Well, she was a dream! There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. One day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome.

She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me."" I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, ""We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.""

The moral of this story is: Always keep your condoms in your car.

One fateful Sunday afternoon, as the holy men laid on the bank, the river rose up. It washed away the signs and weakened the barriers, and into the clergymen's watery enclave the waves swept a boat brimming with some of the region's most respectable women.

Shrieks ensued from the shore, as the clergymen seized their towels and frantically clutched them to their private parts. All except for one--Father McAllister--who instead threw his towel over his head. The rest of the men were baffled. After the ladies' vessel departed, they asked their clerical colleague to explain his peculiar reaction.

6 weeks later I awoke out of my coma. The noose had partially severed my spinal cord, leaving me paralyzed from the neck down.

""Bgah! Why are you hiding that wand in your sleeve?""

""Hey! Why are all those cards spades?""

Yes, I'm such a great husband. In fact, I'm also a great person. I noticed a guy without food or drink sitting in a chair near the entrance. He had a shaved head, shabby clothes, and while looking a little suspicious, I had some unexpected compassion for him. Why would I consider him when I only wanted to fuel up on caffeine and social media? By the look of this guy, I assumed he is often judged and discounted by others. It quickly went through my mind to go over, strike a conversation, and offer to get him something to eat or drink. You know, to share the Christmas blessing many of us have in a warm home, with a family we love, and way too many presents to know what to do with on this day, Dec 26. After all he's probably been through a lot... Building up courage to go over and talk to him, It was then that I was humbled and quite relieved by the Starbucks batista who interrupted my moment of altruistic thinking. She walked up to the guy, him smiling back and standing up from his chair, they walked right out the entrance holding hands together.

After Day 1, Trump returned with a total of 10 fish, Hillary came back with nothing.

Day 2 finished, and Trump caught another 20 fish, but Hillary once again came back with nothing!

That night, Hillary and her cronies got together and accused Trump of being a “low-life, cheatin’ son-of-a-gun.” Instead of fishing on Day 3, they were just going to follow Trump to spy on him and figure out how he was cheating.

Day 3 finished up and Trump had an incredible day, adding 50 fish to his total!

That night, Hillary and her democratic buddies got together for the full report on how Donald was cheating. Hillary stood up to give her report and said, “You are not going to believe this, he’s cutting holes in the ice!”

And that, my friends, tells you all you need to know about the intelligence on the left side of the aisle!",Donald Trump and Hillary go Fishing....,0

Frank answers heavily breathing and still crushing: ""For fuck sake Carl help me, don't just stand there! We need to destroy these as fast as we can!"". Carl was still confused: ""Why?

Me and my buddy were out along the beach one weekend looking for clams.  We had a nice spot picked out for a bake later in the evening.  But as it started to get dark, we had to head back, with no clams at all.  On the way, we saw a food vendor set up in the sand, and decided that would be our best bet.  So we each ordered a burger.

The lady there reached into a little freezer and pulled out two frozen patties.  She raised her left arm, and put one right in her armpit.  Then she lowered that arm, raised the right, and put the other patty there.  By the time she had the grill ready, both were defrosted and ready to cook.

As we walked away with our burgers, I was grumbling about her method of defrosting our food.  My buddy was quiet a moment, then turned to me and said, ""Well, just be glad we didn't order the hot dogs.""",At the beach,18

So duck under his arm, he walks into town. He walks past a lady of the night who offers her services. He says ""that sounds great but I can't pay you, all I have is this duck"". She's feeling generous, so she decides sure why not and takes him to her room.

After a good long romp she says ""that was the best sex I've ever had, I'd pay you to do that again!"" ""You'd give me my duck back?"" he asks earnestly. She says ""Sure hunny, I'll give you your duck back"" and so they have sex again.

Both fully satiated, he dresses, puts his duck under his arm and walks out. He's walking down the street looking to see what else he can trade the duck for when suddenly this huge Mack truck comes careening around the corner.

There's a split second before he's smashed into goo. He tumbles out of the way at the last moment and the truck narrowly misses him.

But the duck was not so lucky. 

The truck driver is upset. So apologetic he says ""I didn't even see you there. Please let me pay you for the loss of your duck.""

The farm boy tries to decline but the truck driver is insistent. So the farm boy take twenty dollars and figures he's had enough fun for one birthday and so he heads home. 

The farmer is sitting at the dining table and asks about his day. The farm boy thinks for a second and says ""It was pretty good, I guess. I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and twenty bucks for a fucked up duck.""

I've been telling this joke nearly 25 years and I just typed it all out on mobile to make you smile. Hope you have a wonderful day!","Ducktales, woohoo!",190

At the front line there were 2 watchtowers, 1 on each side of the border  and there was one Norwegian and one Swedish solider on watch out duty  on each side of the border.

One day the swede got bored and tried communicating with the Norwegian, he yelled and shouted but could not get the Norwegian solider's Attention. So he figured hell use hand signals instead, while shouting, ARE YOU IN THE AIR FORCE he did notion with his hands imitating an aircraft going down, The Norwegian thought to himself what the fuck? he could not hear him all he saw was the hand notion.

The second time the Swede shouted, ARE YOU IN THE MARINES?  while doing a swimming motion with his arms. 

The Norwegian solider started to get real agitated because he could not hear what he was saying, he could only see the hand signals.

Than the swede shouted ARE YOU IN THE ARTILLERY while shaking his fist up and down.
The Norwegian was at this point furious and vowed to shoot the Swede if he did one more hand gesture

The fourth and final time the Swede shouted, ARE YOU KEEPING AN EYE ON US? while pointing his fingers to his eyes and than the Norwegian. 

The Norwegian lost his cool and shot the swede dead, The ceasefire was broken and all out war resumed, Than a general furious with the Norwegian took him to a bunker for interrogation as why he did this.

The general asked why did you do this?

 The solider replied with

The next night, the same exact thing happens. ""Rawwk! Someone's gonna get laid!"" the parrot squawks. Again this makes the girl freak out and leave in a huff. Again and again the parrot ruins the bachelor's nights. The man sees the pattern and realizes that the parrot is starting to make his lifestyle choice rather difficult. He decides that maybe the parrot is lonely and needs a mate.

So he goes back to the pet store in search of a male parrot. He asks the store clerk if they have any and the storekeeper explains that they're sold out of parrots, but he has a male owl on sale for 50% off. The bachelor buys the owl, goes back home and puts him in the cage with the parrot before going out drinking that night.

That night the bachelor brings a woman back to his apartment yet again with high hopes and they start getting serious in his bed. The parrot squawks, ""Rawwk! Someone's gonna get laid!""

""Hooo! Hooo!"" the owl chimes in.

This hard work is not for me. I'm going to move to the city and get rich.""  So buzzard packed up his things and moved to the city. In fact, he stayed true to his word and made it big.  He bought a luxurious mansion just outside of the big city.

The following summer, rabbit received a letter from buzzard asking how he was and invited him to visit him in the big city.  He also asked rabbit to bring with him a large cart full of manure for his garden.

The next day, rabbit took his bags and cartload of manure to buzzard's condo.  Rabbit rang the doorbell and after a few short moments buzzard's servant answered.  ""Mr. Buz-zard's residence. For whom may I ask is calling?""

Rabbit answered, ""I am here for Mr Buzzard.""

""Mr. Buz-zard is out on the yard.""

""Well tell him Mr. Rab-bit is here with his shit!""

BACK STORY:  My late grandmother used to tell my cousin and I that a long time ago when we were both young children. It always got a laugh out of us at bed time. We were raised back woods where stories like that were the norm. Unfortunately, that was the only one I can recall verbatim.  

I miss her every day since she passed away. She was alway the heart of our family.

The three see the Pearly Gates and begin to approach the massive structure only to be stopped by Saint Peter.

Saint Peter explains, ""The Boss set a new rule, in order to get into heaven, you must correctly answer a question relating to the Bible, or you will be banished to the flaming depths of hell for all eternity!""

The nuns had never heard such a thing in all their years and become very scared.

""Nun # 1,"" Saint Peter boomed, ""Who was the first man on earth?"" 

Nun # 1 looks at the other two nuns as if that was a trick questions and reluctantly utters, ""Adam?""

The Pearly Gates open, Nun # 1 passes through and is greeted by joyous angels on the other side.

The other two nuns let out a small sigh of relief for maybe their questions will be easy too.

""Nun # 2! Who was the first woman on Earth?""

Without hesitation, Nun # 2 says, ""Eve.""

The Pearly Gates open, Nun # 2 passes through and is greeted by joyous angels on the other side.

""Nun # 3, what was the first thing Eve ever said to Adam?""

Nun # 3 cannot believe the question because such a thing is not in the Bible. She stretches her head and looks up at Saint Peter in total fear for her eternal soul.

Without thinking Nun # 3 mumbles, ""Boy, that is a hard one.""

He walks over to her and repeats the story. Money exchanges hands, and he's directed down the hall, first room on the left.

He's never actually been with a prostitute before, so some awkward conversation precludes intercourse. In the act, he manages to get a third of the way in before she starts yelping in pain. He pulls out, apologizes for the inconvenience, and goes back to the Headmistress.

She's a little taken aback, but still proposes a solution -second door, right side.

The man is a more than a little frustrated (and certainly a touch embarrassed), by this point, so no conversation occurs and he gets right into it. A third goes in. Then half. She yelps. He dismounts, and storms back to the Headmistress, not even bothering to put his clothes back on. He demands a refund.

She tells him that she has one last option for him - if it doesn't work, she will gladly refund every penny of his purchase. Last door on the left.

He goes in, and the room is very dark. A woman lies on the bed, waiting for him. He mounts her - a third of the way, half-way, and all the way in. She offers no complaint. Gleefully he begins thrusting, when to his horror (and the dim light) he notices she appears to be foaming from the mouth. In a panic, he runs back to the Headmistress.

""That girl is foaming at the mouth! I think you need to call a doctor!""

The Headmistress rolls her eyes. ""For fuck's sake. Harold! The dead girl is full again!""",The man with a big cock!!,0

My dad passed away last year and my mom doesn't spend much time with me as she's usually very tired after drinking wine. I know that you brought all those rich kids from school plenty of fancy toys last year, but I don't care for these. However, I wish you could bring me a hat, a scarf and a pair of gloves, so I could go out and play with my friends in the snow. That would be the most beautiful day of my life. With love, Johnny"".

A post office employee intercepts the letter, reads if, and is moved by the little kid's story. She decides to go around the office and collect some money to buy little Johnny the gift he's been dreaming of.

After chasing everyone in the office, she manages to gather $13... $14... $15. After work, she goes to a little shop nearby to buy the hat, scarf and gloves. Unfortunately, she only has enough money for a hat and a scarf. Oh well, that should do just fine. She wraps the gift, attaches a letter with it ""Dear Johnny, here is the gift you've asked me for. Enjoy the company of your friends on this very special day. Your friend, Santa"", and sends it to the kid. She feels great - a little kid's dream has been achieved thanks to her and her colleagues from the post office.

One week later, she intercepts another letter from the kid addressed to Santa, and is excited to read about the kid's wonderful Christmas Day: ""Dear Santa. I received your gift, thank you very much. Unfortunately, I couldn't go out and play with my friends and had to stay home with my mom (she gets pretty mean after two bottles of wine), because there were only a hat and a scarf in the box (no gloves), and my mom wouldn't let me go out without a pair of gloves.

post,5kbc8d,2qh72,jokes,false,1482716687,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5kbc8d/the_trip_to_home_depot/,self.jokes,,"I went to Home Depot recently while not being altogether sure that course of action was a wise one. 

You see, the previous evening I had prepared and consumed a massive quantity of my patented 'you're definitely going to crap yourself' road-kill chili. Tasty stuff, although hot to the point of being painful, which comes with a written guarantee from me that if you eat it, the next day both of your butt cheeks will fall off.
Here's the thing. 

I had awakened that morning, and even after two cups of coffee nothing happened. No 'Watson's Movement. Despite the chillis swimming their way through my intestinal tract, I was unable to create the usual morning symphony referred to by my dear wife as 'thunder and lightning'.

Knowing that a time of reckoning HAD to come, yet not sure of just when, I bravely set off for Home Depot, my quest being paint and supplies to refinish the deck.

Upon entering the store at first all seemed normal. I selected a cart and began pushing it about dropping items in for purchase. It wasn't until I was at the opposite end of the store from the toilets that the pain hit me.

Oh, don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about. I'm referring to that 'Uh, Oh, Crap, gotta go' pain that always seems to hit us at the wrong time. The thing is, this pain was different.

The chillis from the night before were staging a revolt. In a mad rush for freedom they bullied their way through the small intestines, forcing their way into the large intestines, and before I could take one step in the direction of the toilets which would bring sweet relief, it happened.

The chillis fired a warning shot.

There I stood, alone in the paint and stain section, suddenly enveloped in a toxic cloud the likes of which has never before been recorded. I was afraid to move for fear that more of this vile odor might escape me.

Slowly, oh so slowly, the pressure seemed to leave the lower part of my body and I began to move up the aisle and out of it, just as a red apronned clerk turned the corner and asked if I needed any help.

I don't know what made me do it, but I stopped to see what his reaction would be to the toxic non-visible fog that refused to dissipate.

Have you ever been torn in two different directions emotionally? Here's what I mean, and I'm sure some of you at least will be able to relate.

I could've warned that poor clerk but didn't. I simply watched as he walked into an invisible, and apparently indestructible wall of odor so terrible that all he could do before gathering his senses and running, was to stand there blinking and waving his arms about his head as though trying to ward off angry bees.

This, of course, made me feel terrible but then made me laugh,.....BIG mistake!!!!!

Here's the thing, when you laugh, it's hard to keep things'clamped down'. With each new guffaw an explosive issue burst forth from my nether region. Some were so loud and echoing that I was later told a few folks in other aisles had ducked, fearing that someone was robbing the store and firing off a shotgun.

Suddenly things were no longer funny. 'It' was coming and I raced off through the store towards the toilet, laying down a cloud the whole, praying that I'd make it before the grand explosion took place.

Luck was on my side. Just in the nick of time I got to the john, began the inevitable 'Oh my Gosh', floating above the toilet seat because my butt is burning so bad, purging.

One poor fellow walked in while I was in the middle of what is the true meaning of 'Shock and Awe'. He made a gagging sound and disgustedly said, 'did it smell that bad when you ate it?', then quickly left.

Once finished and I left the restroom, reacquired my partially filled cart intending to carry on with my shopping when a store employee approached me and said,

'Sir, you might want to step outside for a few minutes. It appears some prankster set off a stink bomb in the store. The manager is going to run the vent fans on high for a minute or two which ought to take care of the problem.'

My smirking of course set me off again causing residual gases to escape me.

The employee took one sniff, jumped back pulling his shirt up to cover his nose and pointing at me in an accusing manner shouted,
'IT'S YOU!', then ran off returning moments later with the manager. 

I was unceremoniously escorted from the premises and asked none too kindly not to return.

Home again without my supplies I realized that there was nothing to eat but leftover chili, so I consumed two more bowls.

The next day I went to shop at Lowes. I can't say anymore about that because we are in court over the whole matter. Creeps claim they're going to have to repaint the store.",The trip to Home Depot,3

After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.

The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. if I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""

So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm.

Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:

1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp. 
2. There are 10 commandments, not 12. 
3. There are 12 disciples, not 10. 
4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.

7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the Spook. 
8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him. 
9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey,don't say he was stoned off his ass. 
10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T."" 
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, ""Take this and eat it for it is my body."" He did not say ""Eat me"" 
12. The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,"" 
13. The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, yeah God.

She was admired for her sweetness and kindness to all.

One afternoon the pastor came to call on her and she showed him into her quaint sitting room.

 She invited him to have a seat while she prepared tea.

 As he sat facing her old Hammond organ, the young minister noticed a cut glass bowl sitting on top of it. 

The bowl was filled with water and in the water floated of all things, a condom!

When she returned, with tea and scones, they began to chat.

The pastor tried to stifle his curiosity about the bowl of water and its strange floater, but soon it got the better of him he could no longer resist.

 ""Miss Beatrice,"" he said, ""I wonder if you would tell me about this?"" pointing to the bowl. 

""Oh, yes,"" she replied, ""Isn’t it wonderful? I was walking through the park a few months ago and I found this little package on the ground.

The next day he finds a group of ethnically diverse young people shooting some hoops and yells at them calling them scum. They have a chuckle and invite him over to play with them. He decides to regularly hang out with these guys.

Finally he approaches a young women  and calls her a slut. She laughs it off and asks him to have a drink with her. He gets her number and agrees to meet her the next day.

But Joseph still isn't happy; he just isn't himself. From deep within his heart he had a yearning to be someone else: Sirius. 

Nervous and shaking Joseph makes the bold trek to the name changing center and changes his name to Sirius.  

The next day he meets his friend at the bar and says ""hey you loser."" And the man breaks down  in tears. 

Joe leaves to the basketball courts and greets them with ""sup you scum traaaaaash"". He is promptly beaten by all the members of the gang.

He then goes to the girl he met's house and says ""hello again whore"" and is met with a crisp slap to the face. He asks her, ""I called you a slut yesterday and you were fine with it, but today you take offense. Why?""
