The worst was when Eric even sensed a bird was around. Because he thought he was a grain of wheat, he would completely panic and run as far as he could. He figured that birds ate grains of wheat and he was therefore in mortal danger whenever a bird appeared!

Finally, his family, exasperated, send poor Eric to a mental health facility. After months of therapy and psychiatric help, Eric seemed cured of this peculiarity.

His doctor wanted to be satisfied that Eric had no delusions of who he was - he asked if Eric knew what he was.

“Yes, my name is Eric and I’m a human man.”

Happy with the result, his doctor allowed for Eric’s discharge.

For months after that, Eric’s family and friends were thrilled! Eric had finally recognised that he was a human man!

One day, whilst they were out in the countryside, Eric and his cousin saw a chicken. Immediately, Eric panicked and ran! He ran as far away as he could from the chicken.

Eric’s cousin was in shock in this reaction. Once he caught up to him, he asked, bewildered, “Why did you run so fast and far! I thought you knew you weren’t a grain of wheat anymore!”

“Yeah!” Came Eric’s breathless reply. “But did the chicken know that??”",A man believed that he was a grain of wheat.,16

A nun walks into Mother Superior's office and plonks down into a chair. She lets out a sigh heavy with frustration.
“What troubles you, Sister?” asked the Mother Superior. “I thought this was the day you spend with your family.”
“It was,” sighed the Sister. “I went to play golf with my brother. You know I was quite a talented golfer before I devoted my life to Christ.”
“I seem to recall that,” the Mother Superior agreed. “So I take it your day of recreation was not relaxing?”
“Far from it,” snorted the Sister, “in fact, I even took the Lord's name in vain today!”
“Goodness, Sister!” gasped the Mother Superior, astonished. “You must tell me all about it!”
“Well, we were on the fifth tee...and this hole is a monster, Mother Superior - 540 yard Par 5, with a nasty dog leg left and a hidden green....and I hit the drive of my life. I creamed it. The sweetest swing I’ve ever made. It's flying straight and true, right along the line I wanted...and it hits a bird in mid-flight !”
“Oh my!” commiserated the Mother. “How unfortunate! But surely that didn't make you blaspheme, Sister!”
“No, that wasn't it,” admitted Sister. “While I was still trying to fathom what had happened, this squirrel runs out of the woods, grabs my ball and runs off down the fairway!”
“Oh, that would have made me blaspheme!” sympathized the Mother.
“But I didn't, Mother!” sobbed the Sister. “And I was so proud of myself!
And while I was pondering whether this was a sign from God, this hawk swoops out of the sky and grabs the squirrel and flies off, with my ball still clutched in his paws!”
“So that's when you cursed,” said the Mother with a knowing smile.
“Nope, that wasn't it either,” cried the Sister, anguished, “because as the hawk started to fly out of sight, the squirrel started struggling, and the hawk dropped him right there on the green, and the ball popped out of his paws and rolled to about 18 inches from the cup!”
Mother Superior sat back in her chair, folded her arms across her chest, fixed the Sister with a baleful stare and said… “You missed the fuckin' putt, didn't you?”.......",The trouble with golf,35

This confuses Bruce, the owner, but a sale is a sale and so he dismisses the thought.

Realizing that he has forgotten about insurance, he immediately heads down to Liberty Mutual and signs up for 12 months.

Now you may not know, but Levy likes to play little tricks on people, and he often gets in trouble for his shenanigans.

The very next Wednesday, Levy dings the car while parking due to his carelessness. Luckily, the insurer covers the costs without any questions.

Puzzled by the quickness of the claim adjuster in processing the coverage, he decides that next month (which would be March, but this detail is certainly not important, so do not worry) he would run a little experiment.

When the day comes, he wakes up and reconsiders his plan at exactly noon. Instead, he will pull off the scheme on purple Tuesday, otherwise known as the last Tuesday in May.

On purple Tuesday, he drives down Main street and ""crashes"" into a Spruce tree. The car is completely totaled, but after carefully explaining the story to the Neanderthals (at this point, he thought the office must be full of morons), he is immediately reimbursed.

Thinking that the employee must be a complete doofus, he buys a new Audi, and shortly after getting home, completely obliterates it with a flamethrower and sledgehammer. 

To his surprise, they gave him back the entire purchase price. At this point, Levy decides to stop the rodeo, and get back to his milder pranks. Surely he has gone too far this time!

Sometime next year, he sees browses Wikipedia and stumbles across an article that explains everything.

The customers are stunned and demand to know where the man got these things. 

The man says, “I know a genie. I could summon him here if you’d like. But I warn you, you only get one wish and you can’t say it out loud, so make it count.”

The man snaps his fingers, and the genie appears and asks, “Who’s first?”

At this point the bartender chimes in. “Me! It’s my bar, after all. The bartender closes his eyes and makes a wish. The genie claps his hands. 

Suddenly, ducks start pouring into all the windows and doors of the bar and eventually fill up and surround the place.

Jack is not normally a drinker, but the drinks didn’t taste like alcohol at all. He didn’t even remember how he got home from the party… As bad as he was feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong. Jack had to force himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table. And, next to them, a single red rose!! Jack sits up and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. He looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotlessly clean. So is the rest of the house. He takes the aspirins, cringes when he sees a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror. Then he notices a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick: “Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to get groceries to make you your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling! Love, Jillian”. He stumbles to the kitchen and sure enough, there is hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper. His 16 year old son is also at the table, eating. Jack asks, “Son… what happened last night?” “Well, you came home after 3 A.M., drunk and out of your mind. You fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door.” Confused, he asked his son, “So, why is everything in such perfect order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??” His son replies, “Oh THAT… Mom dragged you to the bedroom, and when she tried to take your pants off, you screamed, “Leave me alone, I’m married!!”",She LOVES her husband,28

You can reincarnate as either the neighbor's dog or the neighbor's hen."" The man thinks about it for a while and says ""Well I know my wife doesn't like dogs, so I guess I'll go back as a hen."" St. Peter says ""Very well"" and sends him back down into the neighbor's coop.  

The man wakes up as a hen. At first, he's set off by his newfound anatomy and starts flapping his wings around a bit. ""Well, this is weird."" A rooster walks up and says to him: ""Oh, you must be new here, welcome to the coop."" The man's stomach starts to get cramps and rumbles ""Ooh, I don't feel so good."" And then, an egg pops out.

""I implemented social programs like free education, health care and welfare, to serve the people I represented,"" the Democrat replies. 

""Who did these programs benefit?"" St. Peter asks. 

""Primarily the poor,"" was the reply from the Democrat. 

""Excellent,"" said St. Peter.  ""Follow this angel up these stairs to heaven.""

The Republican goes next.  St. Peter asks the same question.  ""It says here that you were a politician.  Tell me, what good things did you do?""

The Republican answers, ""I implemented tax cuts and relaxed regulations to stimulate the economy and make my people more prosperous.""

""Who did these programs benefit?"" St. Peter asks. 

""Well,"" said the Republican. ""The tax cuts were targeted toward the rich, who would then invest the extra money into their businesses, creating more jobs and helping the poor.""  

""Excellent,"" said St. Peter.  ""Follow this angel down those stairs to hell.""

""But why!"" protests the Republican.  ""Why should I go to hell?""

""Oh, it's not that bad,"" St. Peter says.  ""Just like the economy on earth, the economy up here is all interconnected.  Heaven is up those stairs and hell is directly below.

So even though the Lord spends most of his resources in heaven, the benefits of this spending will trickle down to you.""","Two members of Congress, one Democrat and one Republican, die on the same day.",0

The driver agrees: ""You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place.""
 
""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""
 
So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.
But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.
 

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :
 ""Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.""

The detective conducting the interview looked at the three of them and said, ""So y'all wanna be cops, huh?""
The blondes all nodded.
The detective got up, opened a file drawer, and pulled out a folder.
Sitting back down, he opened it, pulled out a picture, and said, ""To be a detective, you have to be able to detect.  
You must be able to notice things such as distinguishing features and oddities like scars and so forth.""
So he stuck the photo in the face of the first blonde and withdrew it after about two seconds.
""Now,"" he said, ""did you notice any distinguishing features about this man?""
The blonde immediately said, ""Yes, I did. He has only one eye!""
The detective shook his head and said,
""Of course he has only one eye in this picture!
It's a side profile of his face!
You're dismissed!""
The first blonde hung her head and walked out of the office.
The detective then turned to the second blonde,
stuck the photo in her face for two seconds, pulled it back, and said, ""What about you ? 
Notice anything unusual or outstanding about this man?""
""Yes! He only has one ear!""
The detective put his head in his hands and exclaimed,
Didn't you hear what I just told the last applicant?
This is side picture profile of the man's face!
Of course you can only see one ear!
You're excused too!""
The second blonde sheepishly walked out of the office.
The detective turned his attention to the third and last blonde and said, ""This is probably a waste of time, but.....""
He flashed the photo for a couple of seconds and withdrew it, saying, ""All right, did you notice anything distinguishing 
or unusual features about this man?""
The blonde said, ""I sure did... This man wears contact lenses.""
The detective frowned, took another look at the picture, and began looking at some of the papers in the folder.
He looked up at the blonde with a puzzled expression and said,
""You're absolutely right!
His bio says he wears contacts!
How in the world could you tell that by looking at his picture?""
The blonde rolled her eyes and said, ""Well, Hellooooooooo! 
With only one eye and one ear, he certainly can’t wear glasses.

Bill asks, ""Peter, what are all of these clocks for?""  

""They are lie counters, Bill,"" Peter responded.  ""Each time a person lies, the second hand moves one tick.""

Bill looks a little closer and sees a clock with Mother Theresa written on the tag.  It was sitting with all three clock hands perfectly on the 12.  

""That is good proof that Mother Theresa never told a lie,"" explained Peter.  

Bill looked around and saw another clock that was marked Abraham Lincoln.  This clock read 5 seconds past noon.  Peter remarked, ""Ah, the famous Abraham Lincoln.  He was a good man, but he was a politician.  He did tell a few lies to get into office!""

After hearing this, Bill started to look around with some fervor.  He searched and searched, but could not find what he was looking for.  Peter noticed this and inquired about Bill's search, ""What are you searching for, Bill?""

""Our population is over 300 millions and yet we have failed to qualify for the world cup, Roberto... How did you manage to do so with such a small country ?""

""You know Dave,"" says Martinez. ""I have a great way of telling how intelligent my players are. I ask them a simple logic  question, and if they get it wrong then I bench them in the next game."" 

""I'm interested,"" replies Sarachan. ""I have some at home who I'm not too sure about. Show me! ""

Roberto Martinez calls in Eden Hazard, one of their best talent. ""Allow me to demonstrate."" The Belgian manager then starts asking to Hazard, ""Eden, I've got a question for you; If your father's son is not your brother, then who is he?""

""Why?"" replies Hazard, ""Silly question, it's ME of course!""

Dave Sarachan was very impressed with this, and decided to try it out. So, when he got back home to America he called Clint Dempsey into his office. ""Clint, I've got a question for you. If you get it wrong then I'm going to fire you from the squad."" 

""Shoot,"" replies Dempsey confidently.  
""If your father's son is not your brother then who is he?"" Unfortunately Clint Dempsey could not manage to get his head around the problem. He stands there in silence for a few seconds, worried about his place on the field. 

""Coach, may I please have 24 hours to think about it?"" he asks.   
Sarachan agrees, ""but if you don't get the answer by tomorrow you're out.""

That evening Clint was having dinner with the young US talent Christian Pulisic. ""Chris, I've got a problem. I've got to answer a question, and if I don't get it right I'll be fired.""   
""What's the question?"" asks Pulisic  

""If your father's son is not your brother then who is he?""  
The young US prospect laughs. ""It's me!"" 

Therefore the next morning, Dempsey went to see Dave Sarachan. ""Well Clint, have you got the answer to the question yet?""  

""Yes I have coach! It's Christian Pulisic!"" 

""No!"" says the manager. ""That's completely wrong. I'm afraid that you're just too stupid to be in my team. I'm going to have to let you go, stupid donkey!"" 

Clint was devastated by this. However, one thing still bugged him. He wanted to know the answer to the riddle which had been the cause of his demise. 

""Okay then Dave. I'll resign. But please tell me, if your father's son is not your brother, who is he?"" 

Dave Sarachan replies: ""IT'S EDEN HAZARD, YOU DUMBASS!!"" ","One day, prior to the world cup, the US national soccer team manager was visiting Belgium",6

He strikes up a conversation with her, and quickly discovers that she is one 
of those ""exclusive"" ladies-of-the-trade.

""How much do you charge?"", asks he.

Mary replies, ""It starts at 500 ringgit for a hand-job.""

He says, ""500 ringgit for a hand-job? No hand-job is worth that kind 
of money!""

With a saucy flick of her eyelashes, Mary says, ""Do you see that Mary 
Restaurant on the corner?""

""Yes.""

""Do you see the next Mary's about another block further down?""

""Yes.""

""And beyond that, do you see the third Mary's, just by the side of the old 
Cathay cinema?""

""Yes.""

""Well,"" says Mary, smiling invitingly, ""I own those.

And, I own them because I give a hand-job that's worth 500 ringgit.""

He then exclaims, ""What the hell? You only live once. I'll give it 
a try.""

They retire to the nearby Marriott Hotel.

A short time later,  he is sitting on the bed realising that he 
just experienced the hand-job of a lifetime, worth every bit of 500 ringgit.

He is so amazed, he says, ""I suppose a blow-job is 1,000 ringgit?""

Mary replies, ""RM1,500.""

""I wouldn't pay that for a blow-job!""

Mary then says, while signalling him to come closer to her.

""Come closer to this window, big boy. Do you see that bank just across the 
junction to Jalan Sultan Ismail?

I own that bank outright. And I own it because I give a blow-job that's 
worth every sen of 1,500 ringgit !""

And poor customer , basking in the afterglow of that terrific hand-job, 
decides to cancel his intended new mobile phone and says, ""Give it to me 
!!!""

Ten minutes later, he is sitting on the bed more amazed than before.

He can scarcely believe it but he feels he truly got his money's 
worth.

He decides to dip into what else he may have left with him for one more 
glorious and unforgettable experience.

He then asks Mary,""How much for some pussy?""

Mary replies, ""Come over here to this other window, I want to show you 
something.

Do you see how the whole city of Kuala Lumpur is laid out before us ..... 
all those beautiful lights, banks .... corporate offices .... business 
houses ..... and big-&amp;-small shops and places?""

""Wowwww !!"" he shouts out in awe, ""You own the whole city ??""

post,8tnltb,2qh72,jokes,false,1529899801,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8tnltb/holy_shit/,self.jokes,,"
The neighbors had been complaining that my dogs had been barking non-stop. I hate the electric zapping bark collars so I purchased a humane citronella collar. When a dog barks, it shoots a blast of citronella under their nose and apparently they don't like it.

This evening I was getting the collar ready and filled it with the citronella liquid. And that's where my evening should have ended. But no, it's me, and I begin to become curious as to “how” the collars actually work.

So I'm standing by my back door ""barking"" at my dog's collar. Nothing happens. I make sure it's turned on, check the fill level, and go through the ""getting started"" check list one more time. Again, I bark. Nothing happens. Now I'm not quite sure why I had this next thought, but I did...I put the collar on. I seriously extended the band and fit the growl box against my throat and barked. Apparently, the collar only works if it feels vibrations, because I immediately received a blast of citronella to the face.

I began coughing, which only caused the effing collar to continue squirting bug spray over and over into my nasal cavity. I'm now on my hands and knees in my back yard trying to breathe, and to make matters worse, the dog is barking. So between coughing and yelling at him to shut up, I've emptied over a dozen blasts of citronella to my face. During all of this ruckus I'm trying to undo the clasp of the collar which has somehow managed to weld shut during this whole fiasco.

I finally get the collar off and threw, yes I threw that inhumane effer across the yard and lay in the grass sucking in the humid evening air. In the middle of thinking this is probably the dumbest thing I've done in a while, I hear laughter. MY NEIGHBOR SAW THE WHOLE THING! He was laughing so dang hard he couldn't breathe.

 Between gasps, he tells me, ""I was gonna come help, but every time I started to climb over the fence, you'd set it off again and then I would start laughing and couldn't make it."" So now, not only are my eyes red, but my face and ears are too. After checking to make sure I was ok, we parted ways and I went in to shower so I wouldn't smell like ode de' Tiki Torch.

Lesson learned: next time (yes, there will always be a next time with me) make sure that:
1. Don't fill the collar before trying to set it off.
2. Remember your neighbor is not a good source of help in a comedy crisis situation.

Little Johnny agreed and the teacher placed two pieces of paper on the floor with identical piles of chalk dust on each one. Johnny dropped his pants, squatted down, farted and blew all but a tiny little speck of dust off the paper. The teacher dropped her panties, lifted her skirt, squatted down and farted but when she was done, there wasn’t a trace of chalk dust left on the paper.

Johnny was astonished and asked if he could see her do it again. She was willing and as she repeated the process, Johnny peeked underneath her skirt.

They continued on and saw another room with a woman in there playing golf. Again, when asking, he gets a reply of, I shouldnt be in here, I should be playing in the PGA. They came upon a third room and inside was a guy naked from the waist down with a can of peanuts on his dick.

The snotty one says, ""OK, put your money where your mouth is: ask our waitress a simple Calculus question, and if she gets the answer right, you win the argument and I'll pay for dinner. But if she doesn't know what you are talking about, you have to shut up and pay up.""   


Our math ""Dude"" quickly agrees, but when the first guy goes to the mens' room, he quickly calls the waitress over and whispers, ""It's not important, why, but I'm going to ask you a question when my friend comes back, and just remember that the answer is 'one third x-cubed.' You don't need to know why; all you need to know is there is a 50 dollar tip in it for you if you give me the answer correctly."" She nods hurridly and paces off with a tray full of dishes.  


Both of them back at the table, the waitress comes by to leave the check, the first guy raises his eyebrows with great significance at the second guy, and our math spokesman says, ""Do you mind if I ask you what the integral of x-squared is?""  


The waitress hems and haws and closely examines the ceiling while apparently trying to shove her tongue through the middle of her left cheek. Eventually she hesitantly says, ""um, one third x-cubed...?""  


Thanked for her answer, she picks up the payment (and hefty tip), and turns to walk away. Two steps away, she stops, turns back to the table, and announces clearly, ""Plus a constant...ASSHOLE!""","Two mathematicians are having dinner in a restaurant, arguing about what the unwashed masses understand about math.",97

He likes growing different plants like flowers and vegetables, and he's gotten very good at it. He recently learned that ants can aerate and help water travel through the soil, so he had recently placed a few colonies of ants throughout the garden.

He had three different ants of various sizes, so he decided to be methodical on where to place them. 

The shortest ants were placed by the plants that required the least amount of water since they would burrow the smallest holes. 

The medium-sized ants were placed in the moderately water-thirsty plant area.

And lastly, he had a patch of plants that needed more water than the rest, so he placed the taller ants there.

As he was admiring his garden, he realized what a nice day it was. The skies were clear, the breeze was perfect. ""Let's sit outside and enjoy a glass of milk in my garden!"" he thought. So he grabbed his chair and his milk and headed to the more water-dependent plants, as it was often a bit more humid near them.

After he finished his milk, he felt nauseous. He needed to vomit and couldn't hold it in. He unleashed a steady but powerful torrent of unusually acidic stomach contents all over his patch of garden knocking down the nearby shovel onto his feet, severing his three smaller toes on his left foot. The milk and stomach acid mixture slowly seeped down into the soil, filling the holes recently made by the larger ants. 

A few years after the incident, the man has taken to gardening again. It turns out, his new neighbor is also an avid green thumb! They begin talking and really kick it off. After a few minutes, the neighbor says, ""Hey, you know what? It's a nice day today. How about we continue this conversation in my garden and I'll grab us a nice glass of milk.""

The man quickly declines and the neighbor asks him why. The man had only one sentence that explained it all.

""Last time I drank milk in my garden is when I made myself lack toes and taller ants.""",Why a man doesn't drink milk,24

“What is that glass container for?”

“We have a game here in this bar that no one has ever beat. To play you must pay $50.”

The man, hesitant, asks for how to play the game.

“Well, first, you must beat up Little John over there.”

The bartender points to a 6’5, 300 pounds wrestler with watermelon sized muscles and biceps.

“Then, you must beat up Little John’s dog and take out one of his loose teeth.”

The bartender points to a 200 pound muscular Rottweiler.

“Then, you must go upstairs and fuck Lil John’s mom, who hasn’t ever had an orgasm in her 70 years of life. If you win, the whole jar is yours.”

The man is initially reluctant, but comes back to the bar later that day. He slowly gets drunk and in his drunken haze he says “Fuck it!”, drops a 50 in the jar, and knocks out Lil John in one hit.

The bartender is awed as no one had ever beaten Little John in a fight.

The man then rushes outside, and after a couple of minutes of loud barking and fighting the bartender hears the Rottweiller let out one small whine before becoming silent.

Bank director: ""So my assistant tells me you want to deposit one million dollars. May I ask how you came in possession of one million dollars?""

Old lady: ""Naturally. I earned them by betting. I actually make a living from betting!""

Bank director: ""I find that hard to believe. Want kind of betting do you do?""

Old lady: ""All sorts of betting. As an example I'll bet you 25,000$ that your balls are squared.""

Bank director: ""Umm... I don't... Umm.. Well. Under normal circumstances I don't bet but this seems so absurd that I'll agree.""

So the bank director and the old lady shake hand and the director asks how and when this bet should be settled.

Old lady: ""Well considering that this is a bet of 25,000$ I'd like my lawyer to be present and when I do the inspection. So how about we meet with my lawyer tomorrow morning?""

The bank director agrees to this, happy to have earned 25,000$ this easy.

Next morning he walks into the office of the locally well respected lawyer and greets the old lady.
Not wanting to waste his time, he unbuttons his pants, pulls down his underwear and as the old lady lifts his balls up for inspection he notices the lawyer banging his head against the wall repeatedly.

Quite startled the bank director looks at the old lady and asks

Bank director: ""What is going on with your lawyer?!""
