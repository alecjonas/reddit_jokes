The Communist then turns to another friend.

""Petya, remember being sentenced in 1937 to 25 years in the gulag? Well, it was me who went to the NKVD. Please forgive me.""

""No hard feelings, my friend. You are forgiven"" says Petya.

""Misha, I must confess to you that I had you sent to the penal battalion in 1942. I am terribly sorry about that day.""

""Please my friend, we all forgive you. You may go in peace"" says Misha.

""Thank you so much guys for being with me throughout all these years"" says the old communist with a tear streaming down his face. ""I don't know where I'd be if it wasn't for you. I never knew you loved me that much despite me being a stool pigeon and a complete dick.""

His friends are visibly touched by his words. Finally, he gathers his last strength and says.

""And in honor of our deep friendship I want you to fulfill my last wish. See that cactus plant on the windowsill? As soon as I die, I want you to take it and shove it up my ass.""

Just as his friends were about to say something, the old communist took his last breath and died.

So Petya rushes to the window, takes the cactus plant off and together they shove it up their dead friend's butt. Suddenly, the friends hear a loud banging on the door followed by a gruff voice shouting:

profanity. 

Steve tried and tried to change the bird's attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think
of to 'clean up' the bird's vocabulary.

Finally though, Steve was fed up, and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. Steve shook the parrot, and the parrot got angrier and more rude! In desperation, Steve threw up his hands, grabbed the bird, and put him in the
freezer! 

For a few minutes the parrot squawked, kicked and screamed... then suddenly there was total quiet! Not a peep was heard for over a minute!

Fearing that he'd hurt the parrot, Steve quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John's outstretched arms and said, 'I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I'm sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions, and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior.'

Steve was stunned at the change in the bird's attitude! As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in
his behavior, the bird continued,

post,blkd3r,2qh72,jokes,false,1557191277,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/blkd3r/everyone_knows_dave/,self.jokes,,"Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Everyone knows Dave.,114

Man: Hay can you please help, my car broke down in the middle of the snow storm

Monk: Yes of course please come in

The man enters the temple and is given food, water and a change of clothes.

When night comes the man tries to sleep but is interrupted with a loud noise coming from inside the temple.

In the morning the snow storm had passed 

Before the man left he thanked the monk for his kindness, but he had one question

Man: What was that loud noise in the middle of the night

Monk: I would tell you but you're not a monk

The man is respectful and leaves it at that


One year later

Once again in the exact same spot at the exact same time the man's car breaks down

The man finds the temple again and is given food, water, and a change of clothes

Once night comes the man tries to sleep, but once again he is interrupted by a loud noise, even louder than before

In the morning the snow storm had passed, and once again the man had a question

Man: what was that noise in middle of the night

Monk: I would tell you but you're not a monk

Man: how do I become a monk

Monk: you must count every rock and grain of sand in the world

Man: I'll do it

And so the man set off on his journey and comes back 30 years later

Man: I have finally done it. There are a total of  548,638,138,643 rocks and 795,632,483,167,890 grains of sand in the world

Monk: Congratulations you have now become a monk

Man: May I learn what that noise is now

Monk: Come with me

The monk leads the man to a brass door, he opens it and it leads to a silver door, he opens that and it leads to a gold door 

Finally what that man found was very much worth the 30 years it took him. It was the most magnificent thing he had ever seen in his life

Are you ready to learn what that man saw?

Then, the Chief took the new Director to the special patient ward.  They walked down the hall and checked in on some patients.  Then, they walked past a patient who was frantically masturbating. 

""What is going with that patient?"" The director asked? ""Why is he masturbating ?""

""Oh, well you see"" the Cheif explained, "" he has a rare condition where if he doesn't ejaculate every 10 minutes, his testicles swell up and become very painful. So he has to constantly relieve himself.""

Satisfied with that answer, the Director and the Chief continued on their tour.  Then, as they arrived at the next room, the Director looked in and saw a nurse giving a patient a blow job.

Genie pops out and says ""Since I'm feeling particularly generous, I'll give each of you 3 wishes!""  

First guy steps up and says, ""I want to be rich!  I want to be the richest man in the world!""  And *poof*, just like that a limousine pulls up behind him, and the chauffeur steps out opening the door for him.  

The second guy says, ""I want to be smart!  I want to be the SMARTEST guy in the world!""  And just like that, *poof* you can see in his eyes as the answers to the universe fill his brain.  

The third guy steps up and says, ""From now on, where ever I go, I want my right arm to spin clockwise, like this!""  And he starts spinning his arm around in a clockwise direction...  The genie looks at him confused, and the other two also stare.  The genie says, ""Are you sure?""  He says, ""Yeah... I've got this.""  So the genie shrugs, and the man's arm continues spinning with no effort on his part.  

Back to the first guy, the Genie asks what his second wish is.  He says, ""I want to be FAMOUS!""  And then *poof* everyone there knows exactly who he is.  He's the famous actor in their favorite movies.  

The second guy says, ""I wish to have a large school, where I can teach my knowledge to the world!""  And *poof* he is the dean of the most prestigious college on the planet.  

The third guy says, ""K... Now... I want my LEFT arm to spin COUNTR clockwise, like this.""  And with his right arm spinning one way, he starts spinning his left arm the other way.  

Genie: ""Are you... Are you sure about this?""  

Guy: ""Yeah... I have a plan...""  

So *poof* the guy's arms are now spinning in opposite directions with zero effort.  

The genie nods to the first guy for his final wish.  He says, ""I want to own my own island!  An island that is huge, and has EVERYTHING on it!"" and then *poof* he is zapped away to his own private island that would fit the richest, most famous man in the world.  

He turns to the professor, and he says, ""I want to live forever!  I want to be immortal right up until *I* decide I don't want to live any more.  This way I can share my knowledge for generations!""  And *poof* the man can be seen to age in reverse, looking like a young 30 year old.  The genie zaps him back to his college which has sprung up in his home town.

He turns to the last guy.

""K.""  He says... ""So here's what I want... I want my head, to bob around like this, all the time."" And he starts bobbing his head around randomly.  

The genie asks, ""Come on now, are you sure about this?""  

The guy answers confidently, ""Yeah, I have a plan...""  

So *poof* the man stands there with arms flailing and head bobbing.  

The genies says, ""Is there anywhere I can... send you?""  

The man replies, ""Nah.  I'm good.""  And he turns and walks away.

Thirty years later, these three men meet back up, running into each other by chance in a bar.  

The First guy says, ""Man, life has been amazing since meeting that Genie.  For the first 10 years, I was a super-playboy, then I won Oscars for every performance I put on, and these days, I'm using my money to bring entire countries out of poverty!""  

The second guy, who hasn't aged a day, says, ""I've also had an amazing life!  After curing Diabetes, HIV and Cancer, I set my sights on a medication that can cure ANY disease!  It's going into production next month!  I've also invented a new food source that will simultaneously stop global warming and worldwide starvation!  It even purifies water!""  

They both turn to the third guy, who's older, and grey, but his arms are still flailing, and his head is still bobbing.  

""Guys..."" he says, ""I think I fucked up.""",3 guys find a Genie...,0

Unfortunately, the Tidder Comets were in a difficult financial situation, and all of the estimates for the cafeteria furniture were way too expensive.  One day before the big meeting, Dr. Amrak told his secretary, Miss Keys, to call his friend Mr. Treenoski, who owned a local tree farm.  He asked Mr. Treenoski for advice.

Mr. Treenoski thought about it for a moment and said, ""Every year, we have hundreds of evergreen trees that are not sold around Christmas.  I can donate the extra trees to your school district, and you can make benches and tables for your cafeterias.""  Dr. Amrak was thrilled, but Miss Keys warned him that it was a bad idea.

The plan was approved at the budget meeting, and the district's maintenance crew worked hard cutting and building the furniture.  When everything was finished, Miss Keys expressed her concerns about the benches and tables a second time.  Once again, Dr. Amrak ignored her.  He planned a huge ceremony to celebrate the first day the students could use the new furniture.  Video cameras broadcast live feeds to thousands of residents on TV and on the district's website.   
Christopher Comet, the district's mascot, made a special appearance at the high school.  Parents and neighbors watched as the students got their lunches and took them to the tables.

Everything was going well until the last few students arrived at their tables.  Sally Silverstein at the elementary school, Brian Goldwater at the middle school, and Peter Platinumowski all sat down at the same moment.  Dr. Amrak watched the live broadcast in horror as the benches broke into a thousand pieces.  Students plummeted to the floor, food flew into the air, and the tables collapsed onto the stunned students.

Dr. Amrak shut off the live feed immediately.  He turned to his secretary and asked how she knew it was a bad idea.  With a sly smile, Miss Keys looked at him and said, ""It was an interesting concept, but I knew the lunch pine would be weak.""","Dr. Amrak, superintendent of the Tidder School District, was nervous about the upcoming budget meeting.",7

So one at a time, each religious head tried to convert the Bear to their respective religions.

A man is walking the strip in Vegas when a fantastic looking hooker catches his eye.
He strikes up a conversation and eventually asks, ""How Much?""
The hooker replies, ""I start at $500 for a hand job.""
The man says, ""$500 for a hand job? Holy crap, no hand job is worth that kind of money.""
The hooker says, ""You see that KFC on the corner?""
""Yes.""
""Do you see the McDonald's in the next block?""
""Yes.""
""And do you see the Wendy's across the street?""
""Yes.""
""Well,"" said the hooker, smiling invitingly, ""I own all those, and I own them because I give a hand job that's worth $500.""
So the guy says, ""What the hell? You only live once. I'll give it a try.""
They go to a nearby motel. A short time later, the guy is sitting on the bed realizing that he has just had the hand job of a lifetime, worth every bit of $500.
He's so amazed, he says, ""I suppose a blow job is $1000.""
The hooker says, ""No, $1500.""
""I wouldn't pay that for a blow job!""
The hooker replies, ""Step over to the window. Do you see those two casinos across the street? Well, I own those, and I own them because I give blow jobs that are worth every cent of $1500.""
The guy, still reeling from the terrific hand job, decides to put off buying a new car for another year or so, and says, ""Sign me up.""
Fifteen minutes later, he's sitting on the edge of the bed, more amazed than before. He can hardly believe it, but he feels he truly got his money's worth.
Deciding to go for broke, he asks, ""So, how much for some pussy?""
The hooker says, ""Come back over to the window. Do you see how the whole city of Las Vegas is laid out before us? All those casinos, with the beautiful lights, the gaming, the showgirls?""
Damn!"" says the guy in awe. ""You own the whole city?""
The hooker says, ""No. But I would... If I had a pussy!""",Vegas sins....,13

Except Jeff.

Jeff loved coke and guessed his favourite beverage correctly every single time. Puzzled, testers decided to ""up"" their game and filled whole floor with cups and gave him only 1 guess. But Jeff managed to find coke with no problem.
Even more surprised, testers decided to fill whole football field with hundreds of cups, but only four of them had coke in it.

Meanwhile this situation grabbed people's attention, lots of people came to cheer for Jeff. And guys at Coca-Cola loved this so much, they offered 10000$ prize money if Jeff guessed the correct cup.

So they started the final test. Jeff casually entered football field, looked around, sniffed air, calmly walked to the very corner of the stadium and picked the correct cup! People started cheering and chanting Jeff's name. Dumbfounded Pepsi owner himself approached him and said: ""Sir, please tell us how did you manage to guess correctly against such odds?""

Jeff loved coke and guessed his favourite beverage correctly every single time. Puzzled, testers decided to ""up"" their game and filled whole floor with cups and gave him only 1 guess. But Jeff managed to find coke with no problem.
Even more surprised, testers decided to fill whole football field with hundreds of cups, but only four of them had coke in it.

Meanwhile this situation grabbed people's attention, lots of people came to cheer for Jeff. And guys at Coca-Cola loved this so much, they offered 10000$ prize money if Jeff guessed the correct cup.

So they started the final test. Jeff casually entered football field, looked around, sniffed air, calmly walked to the very corner of the stadium and picked the correct cup! People started cheering and chanting Jeff's name. Dumbfounded Pepsi owner himself approached him and said: ""Sir, please tell us how did you manage to guess correctly against such odds?""

the brim with $10 bills. He guesses there must be at least ten thousand dollars in it.
He approaches the bartender and asks, ""What's with the money in the jar?""

""Well..., you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar
and the keys to a brand new Lexus.""

The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks,
""What are the three tests?""

""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules.""

So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10
which he stuffs into the jar.

""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do:

First - You have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less,
and you can't make a face while doing it.""

""Second - There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth.
You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.""

""Third - There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex.
You have to take care of that problem.""

The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my $10 -- but I'm not an idiot! I won't do it!
You'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila and then do all those other things!""

""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is.""

As time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says,
""Where's the damn tequila?!""

He grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can.Tears stream
down both cheeks -- but he doesn't make a face -- and he drinks it in 58 seconds!
Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole.
Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a
terrible fight -then, nothing but silence!

Just when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar.
His clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over his body.
He drunkenly says, ""Now..., where's that old woman with the bad tooth?""",A man walks into a bar...,56

""Ok then."" Said the two fishermen, leaving in their boat. 

A third boat eventually came along, carrying food and water.  

The people upon the boat see the priest, who looked very ill if he needed help.

""No, God will save me, I am certain of this!""  The priest replied weakly.

So, the third boat goes on its way and the priest priest dies very soon after.  In heaven, he asks God why he he had not been saved, and God replied:

""What do you mean?  I sent three boats!""","A priest is stranded in the middle of the ocean with no food, water, or any form of communication.",10

An italian, a jew, and a gay guy die and go to heaven. 

God looks at all of them and says, ""Ok, I'll give you all one more chance at life, but you have to agree to my conditions.""

He looks at the italian and says, ""you must give up all italian food"", he looks at the jew and says, ""you are no longer allowed to pick up coins off the street."" Finally, he looks at the gay man and says, ""You must be straight from now on.""

They all agree, and are sent back to Earth in a blinding flash of white light. 

A day later, they are walking down the street and pass by a pizza joint. The italian man ignores God's warning and decides to buy a slice of pizza. He says, ""One bite won't hurt."" He takes a bite and dissapears. 

Later, the two remaining men are walking down the street, when the jewish man sees a quarter on the ground, ""I can't pass up this opportunity!""

This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico. But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost.

The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day.

Their most popular attraction, a gorilla named Jamie, had died unexpectedly in the night. Ticket sales were projected to plummet if this gorilla couldn’t be seen, so the zoo manager decided to hire a man to dress up in a gorilla costume and pretend to be Jamie. 

The manager finds a man suitable for the job and tells him,

 “All you’ve got to do is swing around and lay down for 12 hours a day. Act just as any gorilla would”

The man agrees, puts on the costume, and heads into his enclosure. 

When the zoo opens, people rush to see the legendary Jamie the Gorilla. The man, though nervous at first, starts to walk around like a gorilla normally would. The observers smile at his actions so he decides to kick it up a notch. 

The man grabs hold of a vine and begins to swing from one side of his enclosure to the other. The crowd shows admiration, laughing and pointing at his acrobatic skills. 

The man decides to take things even further and does a backflip off of the vine onto a high tree branch. The crowd erupts with applause, chanting “Jamie! Jamie! Jamie!” at the top of their lungs. 

The man decides he will do one final stunt. He climbs up onto the vine and builds up some momentum, however as he begins to reach a fast speed, his hand slips and he flies over a wall right into the lion enclosure!

Panicking, the man begins to scream,

“Help me! I’m not actually a gorilla, please someone help!”

The lion snarls and pounces on the man and says

  ""Why Hooters?""
 
  ""They have those broads with the big boobs, the tight shorts and the gorgeous legs.""

  At age 42, they meet and play golf again.
 
  ""Where you wanna go for lunch?""

  ""Hooters."" 
  ""Again?  Why?"" 
  ""They have cold beer, big screen TVs, and side action on the games.""
 
  ""OK.""
 
 
  At age 52 they meet and play again. ""So where you wanna go for lunch?""
 
  ""Hooters.
 
  ""Why?""
 
  ""The food is pretty good and there's plenty of parking.""
 
  ""OK.""

She says “What?” 

“And a dollar fifty for a cheese sandwich is ridiculous. It’s two slices of bread with a piece of cheese.

He finally secures a carriage house that’s in the backyard of a house owned by two old women by assuring the ladies that the dog is perfectly friendly, which, of course, it is. The landladies have a rabbit hutch in the backyard which contains two white rabbits. Months pass, and everyone gets along just fine. The man had trained the dog not to pester the rabbits while he’s away at work, and the dog is quite obedient.

One night, though, the man returns from a long weekend away on business. His dog is beside itself with joy to see the master return, but it’s late, the man is tired, so he plops right down in bed and falls asleep, leaving the dog outside. In the middle of the night the man is woken up by the strange sounds that his dog is making outside the bedroom window, a kind of muffled whimpering. When he opens the front door he sees the dog standing there with one of the rabbits in its mouth! After a quick smack or two on the head the dog drops the rabbit on the ground, and the man immediately picks the bunny up and brings it inside where it’s light. The rabbit is brown with dirt but apparently undamaged, so the man rushes to wash it off and dry it. He slips out the door into the dark night, returns the rabbit to the hutch, and brings the dog inside. Thinking the women won’t notice, he falls asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

In the morning, as he’s leaving the carriage house for work, he sees the two old ladies standing around the rabbit hutch, which he must pass by on his way out of the backyard. He figures everything’s alright and the rabbit is unhurt, but when he walks up and says good morning he notices that the women are completely distraught and crying. In fact, one of the women is making the sign of the cross over and over again. The man knows that he’s probably been caught, but he decides to be cagey and asks, “What happened? Did the rabbits die?”

 you a question first. A horse, a cow, and a deer all eat the same

 out a flat patty, but a horse produces clumps. Why do you suppose that is?""

He had people doused in boiling water, he had cut limbs off people without just cause, he had them crucified and more.

He enjoyed watching people suffer. However, his being a sadist didn't stop him from being a coward. He hardly ever actually partook in the tortures he put his subjects through. However, he had cultivated a taste for striking his subjects square on their faces, randomly and without reason.

Wherever he visited, his citizens were subjected to this humiliation. It didn't matter whether it was a man, woman or child -- when the tyrant visited a village or a town, he had the residents all organized in a line and he moved from one to the other, gleefully enjoying the pain in his subjects' faces are they received his blows. Those who flinched were to be subjected to worse torture, which he again enjoyed watching. People had no choice but to quietly receive their hits.

Now that he was defeated by the rebellion, and a fair king sat on the throne, the day soon came for the tyrant to be punished. The new king decided that the tyrant would be publicly humiliated, much like he had done to the citizens of the kingdom and then executed.

On the day of the tyrant's punishment, vast crowds gathered, all eager at the chance to pay the tyrant back for the humiliation they had suffered.

Peter, a frail old farmer from the capital, who had been subjected to the sadistic whims of the tyrant more than once, entered the field where the punishment was being handed out glad to finally get a chance to strike the tyrant in the face. As he entered, he saw long organized lines and in the distance, in a raised stage, the tyrant. The citizens of the kingdom climbed the stage one by one, hit the tyrant and then moved on.

A knight took Peter by the hand and led him to a line that was mostly made up of women and children.

Incensed at being grouped with women and children, Peter tapped the shoulder of the knight and asked, ""What's this? Why am I in the line with the women and children?""

The knight replied, ""What did you expect? You're weak and old.""

""And?"" challenged Peter.

""And... this is the weak punchline.""",A sadistic tyrant was finally defeated and dethroned.,10

It is my favorite joke and I have never seen it posted. It is better with some gesture and noise but I'll try anyway, I'll do my best to translate it in English. (sorry if my English isn't perfect but I have to share this masterpiece) 


A mother tell her autistic son : 


-Tomorrow you are gonna go to school for the first time, you can be like every other kid, but I can't take you to school and you have to take the bus.

The kid goes : Uhuhuhuhu

On the morning he goes to the bus stop, he is sitting balancing himself and making his calming noise, uhuhuhuhu

The bus pass and don't stop.

So the kid start crying while going back to his home and spent the day crying. When his mother came back home after works he tell her while sobbing that the bus didn't stopped to take him.

- Maybe the bus driver didn't saw you, usually there is nobody at that bus stop. Tomorrow you're gonna wave to the bus driver! He will stop!

On the next morning the kid goes to the bus stop and start balancing himself. Uhuhuhuuhuh
The bus pass and the kid is seriously waving his arms while yelling ""uhuhuhuuhuh"" 

But the bus don't stop and the kid goes back home crying again. His mother come back after work and he proceed to tell her that the bus didn't stop.

- Maybe the bus driver didn't know you wanted to take the bus, usually there is nobody at that bus stop. Tomorrow you're gonna wave to the bus driver and go on the road. Like that he will be forced to stop.

So for the third time the kid goes to the bus stop.
He stay on the middle of the road furiously waving his arms while yelling at his maximum
""UHUHUHUUHUH""

*BOOM* The bus didn't stopped and the kid is seriously injured, people came to rescue him and he is sent to an hospital. His mother come visit him and proceed to tell him:

- This is not right! You have the same right as every kid, he have to bring you to school! I'm gonna sue the bus driver!

Few days passed and they're all at the tribunal.

The judge start furiously yelling at the bus driver:

- Aren't you ashamed? This little boy is like every other kid! He have the right to go to school like everybody! What do you have to say for your defense?

The bus driver :
*Furiously waving his arms*
-Uhuhuhuhuh, I don't like when people are mocking me, Uhuhuhuhuh",An autistic child first time going to school,
