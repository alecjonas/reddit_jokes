He went to college, and got a great job as soon as he got his degree. He worked his way up. Every time he was offered a promotion, he said yes. Paul became a wealthy man. And charitable. When the hospital asked for a donation, he said yes. When the schools asked for a donation, he said yes. When a complete stranger asked him to pay for his surgery, Paul said yes.

Then Paul's girlfriend proposed, and he said yes. Being his oldest and closest friend, I was asked to be his best friend. I said ""I'll to it, Paul. But first, I have to ask. Why do you always say yes to everything?""

It’s been a hot day and he just wants to get home. On his way back to the depot, he sees a nun trying to hail a cab. He thinks to himself, “Man I cant leave a nun out here. It’s hotter than hell”. So he picks her up

She gives him the address and then proceeds to ask him about his life. She asks if he’s ever questioned what he’s doing with his life. He’s confused and asks what she means. She pauses and then says “well I’ve pledged myself to God, but I’ve always wanted to know the touch of a man”

The cabbie is flustered by this. She then asks “do you have any children?  Are you married?”  The cabbie replies “no”. She then asks if he would be willing to show her what it’s like to be with a man. The cabbie thinks for a second and then agrees. So they detour to a shaded alley he knows about

As they exit the cab, the nun says “I have to remain a virgin, so you’ll have to put it in my ass if that’s okay”. The cabbie agrees and they start having sex. 

When they’re done, they return to the cab and the nun thanks him. As they’re getting close to the nuns destination, he says “I have to come clean. I wants completely honest with you. I’m actually married. And I have a child”. The nun doesn’t seem to react. So they sit in silence. 

As they reach the destination, the nun says to him while paying the fare “I guess I should be honest with you as well”. The cabbie looks bewildered. 

The nun takes a deep breath and says “my name is Hank and I’m on my way to a costume party”",A cabbie picks up a nun,17

After some discussion with his wife, the man made a visit to the herbalist and handed his voucher over wondering what he was in for. The elderly herbalist handed a potion to the man, and with a grip on his shoulder warned him.

""This is a powerful medicine. You take only a teaspoonful, and then say '1-2-3.' When you do, you will become more manly than you have ever been in your life, and you can perform as long as you want.""

Greatly encouraged, the man turned and started to walk away, then stopped and asked, ""How do I stop the medicine from working?""

The herbalist replied, ""Your partner must say '1-2-3-4,' but when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon.""

Eager to see if it worked the man went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine, and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom.

When she came in, he took off his clothes and said, ""1-2-3!"" Immediately, he was the manliest of men. His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes, and then she asked, ""What was the 1-2-3 for?""

After the first, I thought it was over. I thought nothing of the fact that the Sheriff warned me I would be sentenced to death if it happened two more times. An odd law, to be sure; I just never thought it would end up applying to me. After all, I had been conducting trains for a quarter of a century before I ever accidentally hit someone! I figured the odds were in my favor.

Alas! I was wrong. Here the Warden comes now to ask me what my last meal will be.

""Steak, mashed potatoes, and corn,"" I told him. And I ate it happily. It was the first time I felt happiness for a while, but the feeling was fleeting. Within the hour, I was marching down the hall toward the chair.

They're strapping me in, my skin retreats from the cold metal.

""Any last words?"" inquired the Warden.

To my shame, I couldn't think of any.

My head shook.

The switch flipped.

Nothing.

Silence -- then I opened my eyes.

""What the Devil?"" spake the Warden.

Murmurs echoed throughout the room as they unstrapped me. After a moment of discussion in the other room, the Warden approached me.

""Listen, we've made a decision. Since you're in here on a technicality, if this happens again, we'll let you go. After all, it's only fair. You never meant to kill those people, right?""

""Right,"" I assured him, still in shock.

The next day, I was contacted around supper time. They wanted to know what my next meal would be.

""Steak, mashed potatoes, and corn.""

The Warden seemed suspicious of this. The same meal? Maybe that's why 

I hadn't died, he assumed. Something in the food. He took the precaution of preparing the whole meal himself, and personally delivered it to my cell.

My plate is clean, now I must once more march down the hall.

Seated, strapped, switched...

Nothing.

""I'll be damned!"" the Warden exclaimed. He paced around the room as they removed my restraints.

""Well, a deal's a deal. I'm willing to let you go, but on one condition: How did you do it? Tell me."" The Warden was standing before me now.

I thought for a moment before speaking: ""I don't know, Warden. I guess I'm just not a very good conductor.""",Twenty-five years.,5

**Here's how the scam works;** **Two very beautiful, college-age girls will come over to your car or truck as you are packing your purchases into your vehicle.  They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts.  (It's impossible not to look).  When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say 'No' but instead ask for a ride to McDonald's.**  
   
**You agree and they climb into the vehicle.  On the way, they start undressing.  Then one of them starts crawling all over you, while the other one steals your wallet.**  
   
**I had my wallet stolen November 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, again on the 17th, 20th, 24th, and the 29th.  Also December 1st, 2nd, 8th, twice on the 16th &amp;17th, and very likely again this upcoming weekend**  
   
**So tell your friends to be careful.  What a horrible way to take advantage of us older men.  Warn your friends to be vigilant.**  
   
**Wal-Mart has wallets on sale for $2.99 each.  I found even cheaper ones for $.99 at the Dollar Store and bought them out in three of their stores.**  
   
**Also, you never get to eat at McDonald's.  I've already lost 11 pounds just running back and forth from Lowe's, to Home Depot, to Wal-Mart**  
   
**So please, send this on to all the older men that you know and warn them to be on the lookout for this scam. (The best times are just before lunch and around 4:30 in the afternoon.)**",Old Men Scam,9

Finally, they see a table at the end of the market, where an old farmer is relaxing on an old rocking chair behind an assortment of unassuming fruit and vegetables.

The couple share a curious glance and approach the table.

""See something you like?"" The farmer asks, still leaning back in his chair.

""Well..."" The man says, crossing his arms and eyeing a small pile of misshapen potatoes, ""To be honest, we saw a lot of much more attractive options. Your stuff seems a little...""

""Plain."" The woman says, examining an ear of corn from the table. The farmer chuckles and leans forward to pick up a handful of green beans.

""Yeah, my stuff ain't as pretty as the rest. But they've got something no one else has got."" The farmer tosses the green beans into the air, and suddenly they burst into tiny fireworks of various dazzling colors.

The man stumbles away from the table, flabbergasted. The woman's eyes go wide in surprise. A pleased smile rests on the farmer's face as he leans back in his chair.

""How did you do that?"" The woman asks, taking a handful of green beans to pick through and examine.

""Magic."" The farmer answers, ""My family's farm sits on a place of old magic. All the crops we grow come with all sorts of neat little tricks.""

""Really?"" The man questions, prodding at a motionless squash on the table.

""Yep,"" the farmer says bending forward to grab the squash, ""Everything here has a little bit of something special."" The farmer turns the squash in his hands, the skin shifting colors with each rotation.

""That's so cool!"" The woman grins as she looks at all of the produce on the table in a new light. ""What else can they do?""

The farmer starts pointing to various vegetables and fruits and says, ""Well, the eggplants taste like apple pie, the corn is hard as a brick and heavy as such. The watermelons come back to you if you throw 'em, and the cucumbers sing when they're near running water. The tomatoes bounce like rubber, the beets turn invisible at night..."" 

The couple looks to each piece of produce as the farmer continues, amazed at what they're hearing. Once the farmer is done, the couple start to whisper to each other excitedly about what they're going to get. As they grab their selections, the woman lifts up a watermelon, revealing a small red pepper beneath.

She looks at it curiously and sees it shaking slightly, seemingly shivering. She points to it and asks the farmer,

""What's up with this one? I don't remember you mentioning it.""

The farmer looks at it for a moment and smiles.

""Oh, that one? It's just a little chili.""",A couple go to the new farmers' market just outside of town,23

The woman leaves in a sport car peeling out of the facility wildly while leaving the old man with his golf gear. The old man walks towards the course smiling and seems to be settling up to start his game. The young man walks up to the old man and asks him if he has a partner to play against and if not would he mind if he joined him. 

The old man said sure, and they started to play together. The young man starts off going first, and gets a hole in one. The old man says, wow thats a great shot. The old man goes next and misses, tries again and eventually knocks it in with +8 strokes. The young man tells the old man after seeing it easy it would be for him to win, that he would like to make a bet with the old man to see who would win. The young man says “ if i win you have to introduce your daughter to me!” The old man agrees, he then replies “fine but if i win you have to give me your moms number” the young man agrees laughing at the thought of him losing. They play for an hour and on every hole the young man gets a hole in one, while the old man takes 8 strokes. 

Everytime the young man gets a hole in one, the old man says “slow down, your going to fast, be patient, enjoy the match.” The game comes to an end and its pretty obvious the young man won. The old man looks at the sky, and tells the young man that he won and a bet is a bet. At this moment the attractive blonde walks up to the two men and says “are you ready to come home daddy?” The young man nudges the old man, expectantly. The old man puts his arms around the blonde and reaches in his pocket for his phone. He calls a number and speaks. “Hey honey we will be home soon, a friend of mine wanted to be introduced to you!” And he places the phone on speakerphone and the young man hangs it up and says “quit playing games old man, introduce me to your daughter!” As he points towards the blonde. 

The woman yells in disgust, “i am not his daughter! I am his wife!” And she storms away. The young man shocked asks the old man how he swung that. The old man replied, “ive been telling you all day, slow down, be patient, and enjoy the match. While you have been putting it first try and finishing to your satisfaction. I put in the extra time, and it takes me longer to finish the match than most people.” The young man stares confused, the old man tells him that he doesnt put out quickly unlike the young man, he lasts for 8 hours every time, and all women get satisfaction when with him. The young man doesn’t beleive him and asks for proof. The old man walks over to the young man, takes his phone and makes a call. The young mans mother picks up. The old man puts it on speaker phone and says into the phone. “Carol tell our son, about bingo night, he needs to know how he was born! Also send me your new number, some nudes, and a picture of our old divorce papers.” He passes the phone back to the young man grabs his phone, hears a beep and says “niiiiiiice” before walking away. The young man throws his phone on the ground, then yells loudly, “Mother fucker!”",A old man and a young man play golf,7

Jack asks sadly, ""What is this treatment?""

""Well,"" the doctor explains, ""what we would do is take the muscles from the trunk of a baby elephant and implant them in your penis.""

Jack thinks about it silently, then says, ""Well, the thought of going through life without ever having sex again is too much, let's go for it.""

A few weeks after the operation Jack was given the green light to use his improved equipment. He planned a romantic evening for his girlfriend and took her to one of the nicest restaurants in the city. In the middle of dinner he felt a stirring between his legs that continued to the point of being painful. To release the pressure Jack unzipped his fly. His penis immediately sprung from hispants, went to the top of the table, grabbed a roll and then returned to his pants.

His girlfriend was stunned at first but then said with a sly smile, ""That was incredible! Can you do it again?""

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

There was a McDonalds near by so we decided to ditch the cooking and just go there instead.

We walked around the corner and got to McDonalds but as soon as we got there we saw that once again the line was enormous and was nearly coming out the door. After much consideration we decided we'd just have to go hungry as we hate being late - hopefully there'll be some nibbles on at the party anyway.

So we ditched McDonalds and went to the off-licence (liquor store) to pick up some booze to drink once we got to the party. We arrived there and lo and behold the line was massive again. We were running out of time and we knew the hosts had a large punch bowl for everyone to enjoy so we decided to head straight to the party and would have to apologise for being empty-handed.

Finally after a stressful day we got to the party, everyone was laughing, drinking and having fun. My girlfriend turns to me and says she's heading to the bathroom. 30 seconds later she comes back.

""Oh, really? Darn it!"" said the little old lady. ""I'd better go back and see if I can find them. Thanks for telling me, Officer.""

""Well, now, not so fast,"" said the cop.""Where did you get all that money? You didn't steal it, did you?""

""Oh, no, no"", said the old lady.""You see, my back yard is right next to a golf course. A lot of golfers come and pee through a knot hole in my fence, right into my flower garden. It used to really tick me off. Kills the flowers, you know. Then I thought, 'why not make the best of it?' So, now, I stand behind the fence by the knot hole, real quiet, with my hedge clippers. Every time some guy sticks his thing through my fence, I surprise him, grab hold of it and say, 'O.K., buddy! Give me $20 or off it comes!'

""Well, that seems only fair,"" said the cop, laughing. ""OK. Good luck!

Oh, by the way, what's in the other bag?""

""Not everybody pays.""",Peeing on my flowers,290

Grandpa is a hard worker, always coming into the house dirty and sweaty after a long days work.  

One evening Jeffery decides to watch the sunset over the farm on the porch. Grandpa comes out with a cigar and lights it up without saying a word.  Jeffery looked at his grandpa and asks, “hey grandpa, can I try a puff on that cigar?”. Grandpa replied with the interesting question; “I don’t know Jeffery, is your dick able to reach your asshole?” Jeffery, very confused, replied “n-n-n-no grandpa.. I don’t think so.” Grandpa replies “sorry son you’re just not old enough then.”  

About a week later Jeffery was out on the porch again for the sunset and Grandpa came out to join him.  He sat down in the rocking chair next to Jeffery with an ice cold mug of beer.  Jeffery asked his grandpa without hesitation “Grandpa, can I try a sip of your beer?”  Grandpa responds “I don’t know son, does your dick reach your asshole?” Again Jeffery was puzzled and replied with an annoyed “No” 

Towards the end of the summer vacation, Jeffery sat out to watch the sunset for one of the last times.  His Grandma had baked her famous chocolate chip cookies and brought them out to him fresh as could be.  Grandpa followed the scent of the cookies right up to Jeffery and asked “Wow these smell amazing, let me get in there!” Jeffery Pulled the cookies away and said “wait grandpa!  I need to know something before I give you a cookie.”  Grandpa said “what is it son?”  Jeffery asked “does your Dick reach your asshole?” Grandpa Responds “why yes, yes it does.”  Jeffery responses with “Well Grandpa, why don’t you go fuck yourself then.”

Pete's brother turned to Roy and yelled out: ""Roy, \[hic\]... your wife is so large, that when she fell \[hic\] no one laughed, but the ground started to crack up! ha-ah!""

Everyone laughed except for Roy and he adjusted himself in his seat. The wagon moved around causing everyone to shift around slightly forcing Pete's brother to sit at the rear.

Pete looked over at his brother and placed his hand onto his face shaking his head.

""Whatcha \[hic\] doing? Trying to cover up the UGLY, Pete? ha-ah!"" Everyone including Roy laughed.

""You sir,"" Pete's brother said. ""Look like a piece of horse excrement and \[hic\] you're fatter than Roy's wife ha-ah!""

A roar of laughter shook the wagon and Pete's brother began to topple and eventually fell out the back, but was able to hold on with one hand. He reached out his other hand and begged to be lifted back inside.

Just as Roy was about to reach for his hand, Teri smacked it out of the way. Pete and Roy looked at him and stated that they were only jokes. Teri did not laugh and told them to let him hang there.

The men were upset, but they needed to head to town soon and also wanted to avoid the snake. So they continued on, leaving Pete's brother in the grass.

They move deeper into the woods, and after another five hours, Paddy asks again, “This is a nice spot. Shall we set up camp?”

Mick shakes his head. “Nah, just a little further.”

“Oh shit,” Paddy says. “You forgot to bring the tin opener!”

Mick sighs.

“Head back home and fetch it,” says Paddy. “Otherwise we’ll starve out here.”

...reading this advert As cats often scratch after a period of sleep it may be useful to place a post near a favourite bed. The type of scratching product chosen should include upright posts that are tall enough to allow the cat to scratch at full stretch.

...Oh a cat scratching post should do the trick, ""I'll get one"" clicks the relevant links... next day cat scratching post arrives!

...first day all the cats ignore it!

...second day, all her cats, aim back ends onto it and spray!

...third day, one of her cats named ""Patch"" decides to have a dump at the base of the scratch post!

...day four, all the cats follow suit, all dumping at the base of the scratch post (aswell as scratching the carpet perhaps to cover their poo with carpet matter)

...day five, this continues for another six days and none of the cats are using the scratch post for scratching! ...the housewife contacts the company by email demanding an explanation and refund.

...the cat scratch post company apologize by email stating that a although many commercially available scratching posts are covered with carpet there is no evidence that the cat's scratching habits will generalise to other areas of carpet within the home once the post is used regularly. (we must of sent a sh*t post)

...There are various commercial scratching deterrents on the market that can be sprayed on the damaged area to prevent further approaches but they do emit a strong odour that is offensive to humans too and they need to be regularly reapplied to be effective.

...It's important to remember that your cat is not doing this just to be naughty. If the motivation is claw maintenance then you are punishing a natural behaviour (very confusing for the cat) or if your cat is scratching excessively due to anxiety and insecurity then punishment will add to its distress and probably make the situation worse.

Jeffery figured he had nothing to lose, so he took his urine sample to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:

“You have tennis elbow.
Soak your arm in warm water.
Avoid heavy lifting.
It will be better in two weeks.”

Late that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.

He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited $10.00. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:

Your tap water is too hard.

Your dog has worms.
Get him vitamins.

But when they're still above the ocean, suddenly a terrible thunderstorm hits them. The hurricane scatters them, some of them smash into the cliffs, others hit the waves and drown. Only one last spy, by sheer luck or miracle, manages to survive and reach the shore. He crawls out of the water, numb with cold, fumbles with his straps for what seems like an eternity and finally manages to stand up, dressed in civilian clothes but wet to the bone.

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't even care for his mission at this point. He limps along the beach under the chilling wind, shaking, driven by one thought -- get warm. The rest will wait, he'll sort it out assoon as he recovers from this terrible ordeal. He climbs the cliff, almost blind in the dead of night, barely gets up -- and then he sees a distant light!

&amp;#x200B;

The light is warm and orange, a speck of amber against the pitch-black sky. The spy rushes towards it, still limping, tumbles down, springs back to his feet and keeps running under the pouring rain -- if only he could get warm! As the light gets closer, the spy realizes it's a window, lit with a tender light. Exhausted, he still darts forward, almost slipping on the wet stones, and he sees a pub, a good old Irish pub, homy and welcoming, but above all -- warm!

&amp;#x200B;

He opens the wooden door and walks in, drags himself straight to the fireplace and for a couple of minutes just stands there, reaching out to the fire, soaking up the heat. Only after he's come to his senses a bit, he stumps across to the counter, still trembling, greets the bartender with a weak smile and stutters out:

A single file line consisting of 999 panicked town residents outside the Dr's small clinic was created. Everyone had to go in one by one to take their temperatures via a clinical thermometer found in a flask with the words ""100% Alcohol"" sharpied onto it.

It was nearly sunset with only a handful people left in the line. The Mayor himself, was the last person in the line to check his temperature.

The Mayor notices the flask and was quickly disgusted as the doctor sticks up the thermometer up in the ass of the Mayor's fellow companion. The Dr then puts the thermometer back into the 100% Alcohol solution and says ""next"".

He watches a bit longer before he pulls out $10 and hands it over to the owner. The stranger walks over to the mule, whispers in his ear and then stands back. The mule looks a him and then starts to chuckle. The chuckle turns into a laugh and soon the mule is rolling on the ground kicking his legs in his the air. 

The owner walks over, hands the stranger $100 and asks, “What’d you say to my mule mister?”  The stranger similes, pockets the money, shakes his head and says he can’t tell what he said before he leaves. 

A year later the stranger returns and sees the same man, the same mule, but a different sign. This time the sign says “$20 to make my mule cry. Make him cry and you win $200.”  Again he watches for a while and sees people try all sorts of strange things. After a bit he goes over to the owner again. The owner gives him a wary look but takes his $20. He tells the stranger he can do anything he wants but he can’t physically harm the mule in any way. The stranger asks if he can take the mule behind a nearby shed and promises not to harm the mule. With some reluctance the owner agrees. When the mule sees the stranger, he starts to chuckle and continues to do so as he’s led behind the shed. When he comes back a minute later the stranger is leading a sobbing mule. 

The owner walks over wide eyed holding $200. This time the owner refuses to hand over the money until the stranger reveals how he made the mule cry. The stranger hesitates for a few seconds and then shrugs and smiles. “Last year I told your mule I had a bigger cock than he did. He thought that was funny. This time I proved it to him.”

When the Sex Pistols were busy making Never Mind the Bollocks at Wessex Sound Studios some of the band used to ride pushbikes to and from the sessions.

Apparently Malcolm McLaren, the band’s manager and svengali, used to amuse himself every day by removing various parts from whoever left their bikes at the studio so that they had trouble riding home. 

This went on for quite some time until most members of the Pistols (Rotten, Jones and Cook) reached the end of their tether and instead decided to take a taxi to and from recording every day.

McLaren kept on with his little ruse on the one remaining push bike that kept turning up at the studio....and he progressed from removing parts to trying to hacksaw through the handlebars and wheels, anything to create damage. He would even be found wrapped up inside the frame trying cut through the crossbar and seat post.

It had crafted it's own knife, fork, and plate from two sticks and a flat rock. He had even named them his one-point tool, his four-point tool, and his big flat tool. At feeding time, spectators from far and wide flocked to marvel at the world's smartest chimp and his ingenious tools.


One day, during a supper of sous vide mango with sauteed banana, the chimp had to answer the call of nature. Being the world's smartest chimp he didn't simply shit where he ate, so he excused himself to the lavatory. He returned a few minute later, after thoroughly washing his hands. Immediately he noticed that although his meal, his big flat tool, and his one-point tool were all undisturbed, his four-point-tool was missing! 


The chimp's keen analytical mind quickly suspected foul play. Anybody could tell you that when dealing with the criminal underbelly of the zoo, you had to head straight to the reptile house. 


_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _



The chimp cut straight to the chase with Benny the Boomslang.



""Now listen here Ben, my four-point tool is missing and I think it's you who did it!"" he yelled



""You ain't got nuthin' on me, ya stuck up primate"" taunted the venomous varmint.



""You want King Cobra to find out who Molly Mamba was slithering out on him with?"" threatened the chimp.



""Hey now ya wouldn't do that to a guy wouldya? I don't know nuthin', I didn't take nuthin'! I ain't even got any hands, see!"" pleaded the suddenly desperate reptile.



""What do you know, you legless bastard?""



""I don't know nuthin' I swear! The aviary, boss! You know them feathered assholes know everything that goes on in this place!""



He was right, and the chimp knew it. He didn't like it, but he 
knew he'd have to call in on Bird Town.



_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _



Bird Town, Sauropid City, Wingville, Feathered Gomorrah. Whatever you called it, and however many time he saw its guano-spattered gates, the place sent a dull shiver up the chimp's spine.



""Long time no see, Einstein"" a familar voice croaked from the reeds. 



""Billy the Marabou, you son of a bitch!"" the chimp exclaimed, a smile spreading across his face despite himself. 



""What're you doing in these parts, old friend?"" asked the wizened stork, concern audible in his voice.



""It's my four-point tool, Bill."" he answered. ""Missing for hours with no leads. I know I have to pay my respects if I'm even gonna see it again.""



The stork nodded. ""You'll find him in the flamingo enclosure. Good luck.""


_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _




Alphonsus the African Grey Parrot yawned. Being the eyes and ears of a zoo this size was tiring work. He hadn't reached this position of power through complacency, nor through mercy, but at the ripe old age of ninety he was started to consider showing himself a little of both.



""Someone to see you, boss"" chirped a lorikeet. His name escaped Alphonsus. No doubt he had ambitions of taking his place one day. 



""Send them in""



The chimp emerged through the chains. Designed to prevent much lighter birds from escaping, they did nothing to slow his simian frame.



""Well, well, well. The *wunderkind* deigns to grace us lowly crooks with his presence."" chuckled Alphonsus. ""What do you want, ape!?"" he barked with sudden venom.



""Alphonsus, I know that our debt is settl-"" began the chimp.



""Precisely!"" barked the parrot. ""We have no business with one another! This is not neutral territory! What brings you to my realm?!""



""You know what brings me here, brother.""



""Do not call me 'brother'!"" hissed the ancient grey bird. ""Yes, I know why you are here. He eyed the chimp warily.



""You understand that this favour will place you in my debt once more?"" queried the parrot.



""I understand"" intoned the chimp.



""Very well. Remember this day, ape, for the time will come when you repay this debt in full. Your precious four-point tool is with the big cats.""



The words hit the chimp like a sledgehammer. His face could not hide the dread washing over him. Alphonsus' sharp eyes met the chimp's.



""Fare thee well, ape.""

The air hung thick and close over the big cat enclosure. A bengal tiger that the chimp didn't recognise half-dozed by the entrance. His tail flicked lazily as the chimp approached. 



""Whacha want, monkey boy?"" growled the tiger without opening his eyes.



The chimp ignored the taxonomic inaccuracy. ""I'm looking for my four-point tool."" he answered, his voice wavering.



""Heh."" The tiger gave a chuckle of comprehension. ""Straight ahead, second left. Talk to the jaguar.""



The chimp pressed on, and soon enough found himself staring upon the muscled back of the most fearsome jaguar he had ever seen.



""I smell you, little mammal."" purred the jaguar without turning his head.



""My four-point tool-"" began the chimp.



""What about it?""



""Do you know where it is?""



""I do."" answered the jaguar.



""Well, where is it?"" asked the chimp excitedly.



""I ate it."" answered the cat.



Confusion spread across the face of the chimp.



""Well, why on Earth did you do that! You're a big cat! It was made of wood!"" 



""Ah, well, you see-"" explained the big cat ""-I'm a four-point tool eater jaguar.""","A zoo housed the world's most intelligent chimpanzee,",0

Soon after high school, he got an apprenticeship, and a little while later he got his train-driving liscence and started his career. Oh, the joy! He was having the best time of his life, his dream fulfilled. This went on for a while, until he accidentally crashed the train. Several passengers died, and being responsible for those deaths, was tried for mass homicide. He was sentenced to death by electric chair. When the day came, the executioner asked him what he wanted for his last meal. He replied, ""Just a banana, nothing more."" A little confused the executioner got him his banana, and waited. After the train driver was finished with his banana, the executioner sat him down in the chair, and flipped the switch. Light flashed, electricity went everywhere, and the only lightbulb in the room shattered. After the smoke cleared, to his amazement, the executioner saw that the train driver was in fact still alive. Not one scratch on him. An ancient bohemian law states that anyone who survives execution must be a god, and so shall be set free. So the train driver was let go.

Each of them had been drinking quite a bit since they started their journey since they brought a ton of booze on the trip, but Pete's brother was definitely the drunkest of the bunch.

Pete's brother turned to Roy and yelled out: ""Roy, \[hic\]... your wife is so large, that when she fell \[hic\] no one laughed, but the ground started to crack up! ha-ah!""

Everyone laughed except for Roy and he adjusted himself in his seat. The wagon moved around causing everyone to shift around slightly forcing Pete's brother to sit at the rear.

Pete looked over at his brother and placed his hand onto his face shaking his head.

""Whatcha \[hic\] doing? Trying to cover up the UGLY, Pete? ha-ah!"" Everyone including Roy laughed.

Pete then went into his bag to get some food and bumped into his brother who almost fell out the back.

Pete's brother lifted himself up drunkenly and looked over at Teri. 

""You sir,"" Pete's brother said. ""Look like a piece of horse excrement and \[hic\] you're fatter than Roy's wife ha-ah!""

A roar of laughter shook the wagon and Pete's brother began to topple and eventually fell out the back, but was able to hold on with one hand. He reached out his other hand and begged to be lifted back inside.

Just as Roy was about to reach for his hand, Teri smacked it out of the way. Pete and Roy looked at him and stated that they were only jokes. Teri did not laugh and told them to let him hang there.

Pete's brother's legs were scraping against the dirt as he cried out ""help!""

They all looked at each other and just as Pete decided to help his brother, a snake came out of the grass and startled the horses and caused them to nay and jump around in fright. As the horses sped up, Pete's brother fell off the back and was immediately bitten by the snake and died.

The men were upset, but they needed to head to town soon and also wanted to avoid the snake. So they continued on, leaving Pete's brother in the grass.

Two more days passed and they arrived into town.

They pulled the wagon up to the capital building and got out and started to take their sacks out of the wagon.

One of the members of town government walked up to them and stated ""I thought there were to be four of you coming over with the gear?""

""There *were* four of us,"" said Roy. ""But Pete's brother died from dissin Teri.""",A couple of friends were traveling via wagon towards the next town over,3
