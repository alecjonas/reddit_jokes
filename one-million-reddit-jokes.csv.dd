&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, the doors open and an elegant man comes into the hall.

His suit catches their eyes with incredible quality and tidiness.

Custom made shoes are proudly stepping on the floor.

Man greets the interviewers with all proper manners.

They are getting their hopes up as he opens his sophisticated case and pulls out golden trumpet worth at least a couple of grand.

&amp;#x200B;

He starts blowing into the trumpet and simultaneously, the judges jump on their seats cause the sound coming out of the instrument is the worst melody they ever heard.

Loud, annoying, squeaking is strongly hurting their ears.

The man continues playing, trying to get at least a few different tones, but nothing good comes out of it.

Judges, unable to take it anymore are interrupting the player saying: 

""That's enough, thank you. We'll contact you when we are certain about your admission""

The man leaves the local theatre happily thinking that they liked his performance.

&amp;#x200B;

As he leaves, a homeless man comes into the auditorium.

His stench is felt immediately as he passes the doors. Dirty old clothes hang loosely from his body, pieces of long, neglected hair are falling down onto the floor.

The judges seeing this, are trying to speed up the interview by saying: ""Ok, you can start playing now.""

Out of his shopping bag, the homeless man pulls out an old, cheap, rusty and tarnished trumpet.

""Doc, I just don't feel like doing anything at all, can you help me?""

The doctor seems confident:

""Yes, you've come to the right place, this is exactly what I'm here for.""

He prescribes some meds, and they meet once a month.  After about a year of trying all different kinds, the patient says:

""Doc, this is not working, none of those meds are doing it for me.  I still don't feel like doing anything at all.""

So the doc goes:

""Well, let's do something else. Have you tried doing any sports?""

""Just can't find the motivation, doc.""

""There's this class for people exactly like you. Just show up this address here.""

One month later the doc wants to know how it went.

""I went the first week"", the patient says, ""but I just didn't feel like it, so I stopped going"".

""Well, maybe sport isn't your thing.  There's this group session that meets once a week, you should go.""

The next month the patient says:

""I went to the group like you said, but didn't like it, so I didn't come back.""

""That's OK, group isn't for everyone.  Maybe you just need some structure and social interaction.  There's this day care for people in your situation, with all kinds of activities.  Show up there in the morning.""

At the next appointment, the doctor asks how the day care was.

""Well I didn't like doing any of the activities, so I decided to stay home.  It was all a bit pointless.""

The doctor hears this and answers:

""It sounds like you need more of a purpose, so let's put you in contact with a social worker.  They can help you get a nice job for a couple of hours a week, and they'll make sure it's very low stress. That should be more fulfilling.""

Another month goes by, and the patient quit his job:

""Work just isn't for me. On the third day I just stayed in bed and never came back.""

The doctor can't help but feel a bit irritated at this point.  He throws his hands up in the air and, in an exasperated voice, exclaims:

On the other side of the river lived a guy named Clarence.

Boudreaux hated Clarence and Clarence hated Boudreaux. Every day since they were small children, they'd go down to their river banks and yell at each other across the river. They never really met each other because neither one could swim and neither one had a boat. So for years and years, every day, they'd just cuss at each other across the river.

Boudreaux would scream things at Clarence like, ""Imma gonna come ovuh they one day and whup yuh ass so hard yuh gonna hava sheet otta yuh nose!""

Clarence would scream back, ""yah, you come on ovuh hey and try da whup muh ass and I gonna stomp yuh face intu da ground and make boodan otta yuh head!""

One day, news spread throughout the bayou that the county was going to build a bridge across the river. Boudreaux was extremely happy. In glee, he said to his wife, ""Sha, Imma finally gonna get to go whup that Clarence's ass!""

So, for months Boudreaux anxiously waited for the bridge to be completed until one day a neighbor came over and told Boudreaux that the bridge was done!

So he kissed his wife and said, ""I'm gonna cross dat bridge and whup Clarence's ass and be back by suppa!"" and off he went.

Later that evening, Boudreaux came back to his house looking sad and dejected. His wife asked, ""did you get to whup that Clarence's ass?""

Boudreaux said, ""Nah Sha, never saw him.  I ran away ‘cause it turns out he's ah big, big man. I mean a reeeally big, big man. If Ida gone ova they, he would have whupped me...probably even kilt me.""

Boureaux's wife then asked, ""How d'ya know he's a big man if yuh never saw him?""

Hell was filled with the hungry, tortured by the fact that they were so close to the most amazing food imaginable and yet could not eat it.

Then the man visited heaven and found the same scenario. Long tables, hungry souls, strapped arms, unable to bend their hands to their mouths to eat.

But there was a profound difference.

The souls in heaven sat across from each other, not trying to feed themselves, but trying to feed the person sitting across from them.

He spots a poster for a circus in town.  It mentions the usual circus-y things and ends with: ""And the Amazing Goldstien!"".  

He decides to check it out.  There are clowns, trapeze artists and lion tamers.  Finally the Ringmaster steps into the spotlight and announces, ""Ladies and gentlemen, the act you've all been waiting for!  The Amazing Goldstien!""

A frail-looking small man with wire-rim glasses and thinning hair steps into the spotlight and approaches a table with three walnuts lying on it.  He whips out his massive two-foot long penis, uses it to whack each walnut in turn and cracks them open!  The crowd leaps to their feet and break into thunderous applause!  Our local man is astounded.

20 years later, he happens across the same poster, still advertising: ""And the Amazing Goldstien!"".  ""My God,"" he thinks, ""He was ancient the last time!""

Sure enough, they save the best for last, and Goldstien slowly walks out.  Now completely bald, he is bent over and even shorter than last time.  His glasses are now very thick.

He walks up to a table that has three coconuts on it and repeats his performance from 20 years before.  The crowd goes wild!

Our local guy just has to talk to him, so he finagles his way backstage after the show.  He introduces himself to Goldstien and says, ""Last time, you used walnuts.  Why the coconuts?""

Godstien replies, ""Well, my eyes aren't what they used to be!""",Goldstien at the Circus,7

So their was a pimp walking down a block that he had THREE hoes working on. The THREE hoes were spread apart on the block. Each one of the THREE hoes had a corner of her own.

The pimp walks up to the first hoe and says ""where's my 150 dollars?"". The hoe then says ""150? I only owe you 125 dollars"". The pimp then slaps her and tells her ""bitch! Don't correct me."" The hoe then gives the pimp all the money that she's made.

The pimp now finds his way to his 2nd hoe and says ""where's my 175$?"". The hoe says ""175? I only owe you 150"". The pimp slaps the second hoe and tells her like he did the first ""bitch! Don't correct me."" He takes the money and moves on. 

So now the pimp is at his THIRD hoe and yet again, demands his money. He tells the THIRD hoe ""where's my 200 dollars?"" The hoe says ""200$? I only owe you 175."" Once again just like the others, he slaps his THIRD hoe and says ""bitch! Don't correct me"". Collects his money and keeps it moving.

So now the pimp finds his way to his 4th hoe......

The Irishman gets the attention of the other two.
""Look, lads. It's Jesus!""

Skeptical, the two guys laughingly ask him to go go and ask the man at the bar if he is, in fact, Jesus. 

Brazenly, the Irishman walks up to the man and says. 
""Excuse me, sir. Are you Jesus?"" 

""Yes"" replies the man

The Irishman, knowing his friends would want proof, asks the man to prove that he is Jesus. 

The man orders a water, and turns it into wine. 

""Aye, but that could be a trick"" the Irishman says. 

The man then shows the Irishman the holes in his hands and feet. 

""Aye, but they could be piercings"" says the Irishman. 

Growing tired of the skepticism, the man takes the Irishman by the hand. The Irishman winces at this as his hands had been riddled with arthritis for years. The man holds his hand, and the arthritis disappears. 

The Irishman goes back over to his table.

""Lads, lads. That's deffinetly Jesus. He turned water to wine, has holes in his hands and feet and cured my arthritis"" 

The Scotsman, seeing the Irishman's hands, felt he had to see for himself. He goes up to Jesus and asks him to prove it. Jesus, again, turns water to wine and shows the holes in his hands and feet. The Scotsman then says. 

""Jesus, I've been a plasterer for 25 years and my back and shoulders give me a lot of trouble. Can you do anything about that?""

Jesus holds the Scotsman's hand and rids him of his pain. 

The Scotsman goes back to the table. 

""That's Jesus, alright. He turned water to wine, showed me the holes in his hands and feet and took away my muscle pain!""

The Englishman thinks he's being had on. There's no way Jesus is at the bar. So, he walks up to the man. 

""I heard you were Jesus""

""That, I am."" Replies Jesus

""Prove it"" the Englishman retorts. 

Jesus then repeats the process that he had gone through with the other two. He turns water to wine, shows him the holes in his hands and feet and then reaches out to grab the Englishman's hand. 

The Englishman then yells at Jesus.

‘Great news! The operation was successful, and your father is in a much more stable condition! As I was walking out, he was already strong enough to tell me that he is grateful for my help, and approves of our marriage!’

Months pass, and the father has changed completely. He displays his newfound love for his new son-in-law, showering him with gifts and attention, and loves to refer to him as son. The surgeons now-wife asks her new husband:



‘My dad’s completely changed his attitude towards you! How did you do it?’

‘What can I say? I guess I know my way around people’s hearts.’

Edit: A word","A surgeon is planning on marrying his girlfriend, but her father refuses to allow him to do so.",5

Now for story time (since I can't think of anything else)

I came to the living room with my siblings while watching Total Drama Island and eating, that is when I receive a message from a unknown person (the name of the person shows, but I'm not showing here). This crazy spammed me a few pictures of some chat then asking for my name (which I didn't, I hope it was a smart move) then now accused me of being with her bf (I know this person is a female when she mention her bf, but not telling the name) I was really dumbfounded and confused. How did this crazy gal find my phone number, I didn't have any social media (well, except for here, DeviantArt, and Wattpad) but these site didn't require your phone number (I'm not really sure, lmao). I immediately use the spam report and hopefully will never heard of her ever again

Right now I'm really shook up until the siblings coughed up what happened (they explained that that my lil bro was the one who send the messages)

I know it's not a juicy story, but the prank triggered me badly

""Don't wanna meet yo mamma. I just want you to come-a. Ake-tay it, please.""

""Okay. Well thank you."" Lucy peruses it, and realized it is too short to warm a dwarf.

Lucy shakes a little harder. ""Shake it! Shake it!"" She begins to shake it even harder. ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture!!!""

“What sort of resources do we have available?”

“Only a few Hellcats sir” is the reply

“Wonderful, assign them to D-company, and tell them to attack those ships” commands the general.

“D-company? The people who chose their ranks based on some African antelope? Are you sure?” the lieutenant stammers out.

And why on earth did you give this job to D-company?

“Honey…?”

“Yes baby?”

“You know I love you, right?”

“Of course baby”

“You know I’d do anything for you, right?”

At this point, the girl starts to suspect something.

“Yes…”

“Can we please please please stick it up the ass just once?”

She looks him in the eyes and says, “It’s not the right time.”

The guy is bummed, until he realizes that one day there WILL be a right time.

So five years pass, those two lovebirds are now living together in a nice place in the suburbs. One night, the guy turns to the girl and goes:

“Babygirl...”

“Yes, sweetie pie?”

“We’ve been living together for a year now…”

“Yes?”

“And I love you very much…”

“Yes…?”

“You are my entire world, baby…”

“Yes………”

“Can we please, please, PLEASE stick it up the ass just this one time and that’s it?”

The girl puts her hand on his cheek, looks him in the eyes, and gently says, “It’s not the right time.”

Another twenty years pass, they’re married, they have four children, an entire home and everything is wonderful.

One night, for their anniversary, the guy takes the girl away for a romantic surprise weekend. When in their luxury hotel bed, he turns to her and says:

“Darling?”

“Yes my love?”

“We’ve been together for over twenty years now…”

“I know, I love you very much.”

“We have four beautiful children who I love more than I can imagine.”

“I love them… too…” she’s starting to suspect.

“My entire world is you guys, we built this wonderful home together, just you and me.”

“…”

“Baby…”

“Yes?”

“Can we PLEASE stick it up the ass just this one time and then that’s it I won’t talk about it, won’t mention it, won’t say anything for the rest of our lives!”

She gets closer. She puts the palm of her hand on his neck, and whispers in his ear, “just for tonight.”

He can’t hide his joy. He smiles wide and kisses her all over. That night, they did the thing that for 25 years he wished for. They stuck it up the ass.

After they finish, they turn over, and he lights a cigarette.

She looks at him surprised and shouts at him:

“WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING?!”

He goes, “Shut the fuck up you ass fucker”",So there’s this high school couple who have been dating for a couple of months or so…,0

His bookkeeper is deaf. That was the reason he got the job in the first place.
It was assumed that Guido would hear nothing so he would not have to testify in court.

When the Godfather goes to confront Guido about his missing $10 million, he takes along his lawyer who knows sign language.
The Godfather tells the lawyer, ""Ask him where the money is!"" 
The lawyer, using sign language, asks Guido, Where's the money?
Guido signs back, ""I don't know what you are talking about."" 
The lawyer tells the Godfather, ""He says he doesn't know what you're talking about."" The Godfather pulls out a pistol, puts it to Guido's head and says, ""Ask him again or I'll kill him!"" 
 
The lawyer signs to Guido, ""He'll kill you if you don't tell him."" 
Guido trembles and signs, ""OK! You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed at my cousin Bruno s house.
The Godfather asks the lawyer,
""What did he say?"" 
 
The lawyer replies,
""He says f... you, you don't have the balls to pull the trigger.""

It’s the most beautiful city he could’ve possibly imagined. He goes in and finds cocaine and prostitutes and stays for 10 years.

After he wakes from his euphoric coma he realizes he hasn’t even thought about fertilizer in a decade. He grabs 10 pounds of fertilizer and takes off back over the big hill. 

At the top he can see the most beautiful mansion where he left turtle and buzzard. 

Arriving on the front doorstep he knocks on the door, and (in the most eerie way) the door glides open revealing an average looking butler.

A poor woman who's baby was desperately ill traveled for many miles and came to the base of the mountain. 

There she met a small boy with some drums who told her to take courage, that his name was Benny and that the trek would be hard but the end would be worth it.

So she hiked up the mountain.

A quarter of the way up she met a woman playing a piano who told her. ""My my name is Ethel. Stay strong, you baby will be made well.

So she continued on.

Half way up the mountain she met a little girl who played a violin and said. My name is Emily. Drink from this stream if you're thirsty. It's not far now. Stay strong.

So the woman continued on and on.  A fog rolled in. She despaired and thought about giving up.
Little did she know she was only 5 minutes from the magic cradle.

One guy decides he should throw a rock down the hole to see if he could hear it hit the bottom.  So he throws it in and they listen and listen and didn't hear it hit the bottom.  

""Strange"" the other guy says.  ""How about we throw a big rock down?"". So they proceed to find a sizable rock and carry it together to then throw down the hole.  As they throw it in they listen carefully but still hear nothing.

They are now staring at eachother with a loss for words.  At once they both said ""let's find something bigger"".  They then found a railway tie and threw that in and they still didn't hear anything!  

All of this sudden a goat comes sprinting out of the forest like he was being chased by a bear, right toward the hole and jumps down it.  

Now these two guys were left speechless but couldn't think for too long because a farmer came along.  He said ""Have y'all seen a goat around anywhere?"". They look at eachother and the one guy says ""Funny you should mention that cause a goat just came running out of the forest and jumped down this hole!""

The farmer replied ""Oh good that couldn't have been my goat.  My goat was tied to a railway tie.""",The Goat Joke,1

Slightly embarrassed he explains his situation to the clerk. The clerk tells him that the situation is fairly common, and walks him to the back of the store.   


In the back of the store the clerk shows the man a fence with three holes drilled in it, all of various sizes. He then explains to the man to pick the right size condom, he just needs to put his penis in each hole and he will know which size he needs based on how each hole feels.   


Confused, but still very excited to finally ""get it on"" he nervously puts his penis in the first hole.   


The man is blown away! The first hole feels like the worlds best handjob!  


Not wanting to ruin his upcoming adventure he pulls out and collects himself, and tries the second hole.  


This hole is even better, the man is almost unable to stand! The second hole feels like the worlds best blowjob!  


It takes almost all he has, but again, not wanting to ruin his night, he pulls out, collects himself and moves on to the next hole.  


Inside the last hole, the man feels an amazing feeling that he's never felt before, and he knows immediately that this is what the worlds best sex would feel like.   


Unable to last, he finishes, cleans himself up, and heads back inside.   


When he reaches the front of the store, the clerk asks him if he figured out what size condom he will need.

Harriet: ""Well how much is it?""

Bob: ""$50.""

Harriet: ""Oof that's too expensive. $50 is $50, no matter what. We better not.""

So Bob gets disappointed and they leave.

Some years later they see the same helicopter again. Bob tried to convince Harriet to let them go, but she said ""$50 is $50.""

Bob sulks off again, disappointed.

This cycle goes on for several years, with Bob wanting to ride the helicopter but Harriet saying ""$50 is $50.""

When they're in their 80's, they see the helicopter at the fair again. Bob really badly wants to go and decides to convince her one last time.

Bob: ""Look, we're both old now. We may not live long enough to make it to the next fair. This might be our last chance!""

Harriet shakes her head and says ""Honey, $50 is $50. It's too expensive. I'm sorry.""

Bob's face falls and he mumbles ""okay"" as they walk away.

Now the pilot of the helicopter has been watching this same couple come every year for the past couple decades and decides he wants to help them out. So he approaches the couple and offers them a deal: if they can stay quiet the whole time he's flying, he'll let them on for free. Harriet finally agreed and they go on the helicopter ride.

It was awesome! The pilot was doing all kinds of crazy moves: loop-d-loops, twirls, rolls, all kinds of stuff you thought a helicopter couldn't do.

When they finish, the pilot is surprised. The old couple managed to stay quiet! 

Pilot: ""Wow! I thought for sure you guys would scream, but you didn't! Congratulations, you got it free!""

Bob chuckles and says ""Well I almost said something when Harriet fell out the window, but you know: $50 is $50.""","Bob and Harriet, a middle aged couple, were at the fair",70

post,cmcvt1,2qh72,jokes,false,1565021108,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cmcvt1/the_white_knight_and_the_black_knight/,self.jokes,,"Note, this story was from Gigi Proietti, an Italian comedian who's from Rome, and I must say it loses a lot without the Roman accent and slang, but I'll try my best :D

The White Knight and the Black Knight.

So once there was this teacher, really passionate about his job, who always wanted to inspire students to try their best. Having always teached in high level schools, full of wealthy kids from good neighborhoods, that was honestly not hard. 

One year, tho, the teacher was sent to a school in a really bad neighborhood in Rome, full of mildly poor kids from not so good families. 

So one day the teacher tells the students to find a story as an assignment, which they will have to tell to the class the next day. They can tell whatever story they want, but on one condition: the story must have a moral. 

The next day, the first kid to tell his story is a little white boy, with nice hair, all good dressed and very serious. So he starts telling the story of David and Goliath, and when he's finished he says that the moral of his story is that brain always wins over muscles. ""Very good"" says the teacher, and all the kids go on with telling their stories, everyone bringing good ones, with nice morals.

Then it's the turn of the last kid, with his leather jacket and spiked hair. A kid from a really difficult household, not very good at school.

So he goes in front of the class and starts telling his story.

""So... I wanted to tell the story of the White Knight and the Black Knight. So the White Knight is an honest and good man and a really good knight, who likes to help poor people, and he always wins all the jousts by playing fairly and honestly and never cheating. The Black Knight is a bold young man who doesn't care about justice and always wins his jousts by cheating.""

Noticing the actual efforts the kid is putting in the story, the teacher encourages him, thinking he finally understood that school is important and is finally convinced to try his best.

""So one day, the Black Knight is angry at the White Knight because he wins all the jousts and everyone thinks he's the best knight, so he dares him to have a joust with him. So they do and the Black Knight kills the White Knight.""

""Oh... I didn't expect that."" Says the teacher. ""But nevermind, go on with the story.""

""So the White Knight had three sons, who all challenge the Black Knight to have jousts with them to avenge their father. The Black Knight accepts, and kills all the three of them.""

At this point the teacher is perplexed, but decides to just let the kid go on and see what he has.

""So each of the three sons had three sons, and they all challenge the Black Knight to have jousts with them to avenge their fathers. The Black Knight accepts, and kills all the... nine of them."" says the kid, counting on his fingers.

""So each of the nine sons had three sons, and they all challenge the Black Knight to have jousts with them to avenge their fathers. The Black Knight accepts, and kills all the..."" He starts counting with his little fingers again, but the teacher stops him.

""Dear God, ok, but what's the moral of the story?""

The kid just looks at him for a couple second, his fingers still up in the motion of counting.

""Well, the moral is just don't fuck with the Black Knight!""",The White Knight and the Black Knight.,7

This seemed to satisfy the old priest and things went well, until the priest died at a ripe old age. About a week after the new priest arrived, he visited the Mayor of the town and seemed very concerned.

The priest said, ""You have to do something about the sidewalks in town. When people come to the confessional, they keep talking about having 'fallen.'""

The Mayor started to laugh, realizing that no one had told the new priest about the code word.
Before the mayor could explain, the priest shook an accusing finger at the mayor and said, ""I don't know what you're laughing about, your wife fell three times this week!""",A priest is working in the confessional booth,228

One day, Einstein has to speak at an important science conference.

On the way there, he tells his driver that looks a bit like him:

“I’m sick of all these conferences. I always say the same things over and over!”

The driver agrees: “You’re right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don’t know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place.”

“That’s a great idea!” says Einstein. “Let’s switch places then!”

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won’t be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :

“Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I’m going to let my driver reply to it for me.”",The twin twist,11

One evening the wild rabbit noticed that his cage hadn't been properly closed and decided to make a break for freedom. He invited the lab rabbit to join him. The lab rabbit was unsure, as he had never been outside the lab, but the wild rabbit finally convinced him to give it a try.

Once they were free, the wild rabbit said, ""I'll show you the number-three best field,"" and took the lab rabbit to a field full of lettuce.

After they had eaten their fill, the wild rabbit said, ""Now I'll show you the number-two best field,"" and took the lab rabbit to a field full of carrots.

After they had their fill of carrots, the wild rabbit said, ""Now I'll show you the number-one best field,"" and took the lab rabbit to a warren full of female bunnies. It was Heaven—nonstop lovemaking all night long.

As dawn was beginning to break, the lab rabbit announced that he would have to be getting back to the lab.

She starts off by telling them that this mythical creature is rarely seen because it rarely goes outside at all, and especially stays inside during the day because it's dangerous for it to be in the Sun or to be exposed to too much light.

She then asks the children if anybody knows what the creature might be.

Little Susie raises her hand and says ""Is it a ghost?""

The teacher tells little Susie ""that's incorrect"" and then describes the next clue.

It has a very pale complexion due to the fact that it doesn't go out in the sun and it does not get exposed to light. It also looks very malnourished and often famished due to its eating habits because it only feasts when it can find its type of prey that it most desires.

All of the children look very confused, so instead of asking if any of them know the answer the teacher decides to give them one final clue and then see if anybody can guess.

""Okay children, this is your final clue. The creature were talking about feasts upon the souls of the innocent, and derives pleasure from the misery of others.

Little Johnny raises his hand and excitedly says ""I know, I know, I know, it's a vampire!""

""Oh, so close Johnny. But that's also incorrect.""

He guesses there must be at least ten thousand dollars in it. He approaches the bartender and asks, ""What's with the money in the jar?""

""Well..., you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Lexus""

The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, ""What are the three tests?""

""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules.""

So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10 which he stuffs into the jar.

""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do:

First - You have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less, and you can't make a face while doing it.""

""Second - There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth. You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.""

""Third - There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. You have to take care of that problem.""

The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my $10 -- but I'm not an idiot! I won't do it! You'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila and then do all those other things!""

""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is.""

As time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says, ""Where's the damn tequila?!""

He grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can. Tears stream down both cheeks -- but he doesn't make a face -- and he drinks it in 58 seconds! Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole. Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a terrible fight -- then nothing but silence!

Just when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar. His clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over his body. He drunkenly says, ""Now..., where's that old woman with the bad tooth?""",The Dive-Bar Dare,43

They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, ""Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.""

The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.

The young alien became angry at the lack of response.

The older alien said, ""I'd calm down if I were you.""

The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting.

Again, there was no response.

Pissed at the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, ""Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader or I will fire!""

The older alien again warned his comrade saying, ""You probably don't want to do that!
I really think that will make him mad.""

""Rubbish"" replied the young alien.

He aimed his weapon and opened fire.
There was a huge explosion.

A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien, off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away into a cactus patch.

Half an hour passed.

When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.

""What a ferocious creature!"" exclaimed the young, fried alien. ""He damn near killed me!
How did you know he was so dangerous?""

The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, ""If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his penis over his shoulder and stick it in his ear.""",Aliens!!,43
