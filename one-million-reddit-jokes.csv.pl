They go back to her apartment and things get steamy. While they're getting naked she says to him, ""Can you do something for me, please?""

""Anything,"" he says.

""Will you take a dump on my chest?"" she inquires.

He is a bit taken aback and disgusted, but he's drunk enough that it seems like a reasonable request. So he takes a dump on her chest, and they have sex. It turns out to be the best sex he's ever had.

Before he leaves she asks, ""Will I ever see you again?""

He replies in the affirmative.

The man later shares his experience with a friend. The friend tells him that he's onto a winner and tells him that the next time he should eat lots of laxatives beforehand.

The man takes a whole lot of laxatives then meets up with the woman again. They do the deed again, he takes a dump on her chest. This time there's more shit, it's softer and the sex is even better. The woman asks to see him again.

He goes back to his friend and tells him the good news. The friend suggests that next time he should eat a lot of curry the night before.

The night before he meets up with the woman again he goes to an Indian restaurant and eats a chicken vindaloo. The sex the next day after he takes a dump on her chest is phenomenal. Once again they agree to meet again.

The next time the man decides to go all out and eat two curries the night before and also eat a whole box of laxatives. After all, the looser his stools, the better the sex.

On his way to have sex with the woman, he has an enormous urge to take a shit. He can't make it to her apartment. He stops at a petrol station toilet and empties his bowels. The toilet is splattered with a pile of shit that comes half a foot above the water. It takes numerous flushes to get rid of it.

When he gets to the woman's apartment, things go as before. They get hot and steamy, she takes off her clothes, and it's time for him to take a dump on her chest. Not wanting to disappoint her, he gives it a try. But instead of the previous times when he shat large volumes, he is only able to squeeze out a small pebble.

She sits up in bed and glares at him. Angrily she demands, ""Are you seeing someone else?""

So a plane goes down in the Sahara in WW2. 
The survivors are a lieutenant, a sergeant, a corporal and a private. They have a days rations and are many days out from the nearest town. 

The looty sends the corporal to scout around for anything to help in their predicament. He returns with an old camel. Hot debate pursues about what they should do, kill and eat the camel or ride it  back to civilisation. 

Anyway, they decide to ride it and hope to make it back. 

So in true Brit form the mount the camel in order of rank, looty up front followed by the sarge and finally the private hanging on for dear life at he rear.  

After the first days ride they dismount all very tired and find the poor camel well worn from all the weight it carried that day. They all rest and start out early the next day.  And day two they have finished all the food so they are even worse off. Camel is shagged but still standing so they go to sleep with the hope that tomorrow will be better. 

The start day three and the camel is really slow and battling on and around midday they all start hallucinating and the camel stops. They rest and later all start out again. Late afternoon they see a town and at first consider whether they are hallucinating again but the closer they get they see people coming out to help. 

They are about 800m out (1/2mile for you USA folk)  when the camel collapses dead. Cold stone dead! 
The looty hops off the carcass and scratches his bald head wondering, as only rank can do. The sarge hops off and kicks the camel, because that what makes things move. The corp jumps down and states the fucking obvious ""this camel is fucked"" and the private apologises ""sorry corporal, but that was the only way I could stay on""

The mathematician is next. Being well versed in matters statistical (perhaps she is an actuary), she quickly asks to be placed face up as well - after all, the odds of it happening again are pretty good, especially if the initial conditions are similar.

Finally, the engineer. Not willing to do anything in public that is different from her peers, she, too, requests to be placed face up.

Finally he remembers, ""AMEN!!""

He was so delighted with his purchase he decided to wear them home to show the Mrs. 

Walking proudly into the house, he sauntered into the kitchen and said to his wife, ""Notice anything different about me?""

Margaret, at age 83, looked him over and replied, ""Nope.""

Frustrated as all get out, Bert stormed off into the bathroom, undressed and walked back into the kitchen completely naked except for the new golf shoes. Again he asked Margaret, a little louder this time, ""Notice anything different NOW?"" 

Margaret looked up and said in her best deadpan response, ""Bert, what's different? It's hanging down today, it was hanging down yesterday, and it'll be hanging down again tomorrow.""

Furious, Bert yells out, ""AND DO YOU KNOW WHY IT'S HANGING DOWN, MARGARET?""

""Nope. Not a clue,"" she replied.

“IT'S HANGING DOWN, BECAUSE IT'S LOOKING AT MY NEW GOLF SHOES!”

Margaret replied, ""You should have bought a new hat!""",Bert's new golf shoes,9

She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money. 


After a lengthy discussions the president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '£165,000'. 

The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to amass so much cash. The old woman replied that she was a gambler and her betting paid handsomely.

 ""What kind of bets?"" asked the banker, surprised. ""Do you play the horses?""

""No"" she replied. I make personal bets. Are you a wagering man ', she asked.

""Sometimes"". he replied.

""'Well"" she said ""I'll bet you £25,000 that you have square testicles"" .

The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible wager.

The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, ""Then you can't lose, can you.  Will you accept the bet?""

""Of course"", replied the president.
""There's no such thing as a square testicle.""

""Done"", says the old lady  ""But considering the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.""
  
That night, the president became  nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet. 

The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the  woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the £25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square. 

The president agreed as to the terms. She then asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly. And the banker dropped trou.
 
She  came closer and said she would need to examine his testicles,  to make sure they were, in fact, not square. Reluctantly, he agreed.

 

Reaching out a dainty hand, she carefully examined first one testicle, then the other. As she did so her lawyer began banging his head against the desk.

The banker, astonished,  asked the old woman why he was  banging his head .

""Ah,"" she replied. 

""It's probably because I bet him £100,000 that  by 10:30 this morning I would be holding in my hand the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland.'

He pulls up in front of the house, walks up, and knocks on the door. The guy who lives there answers, and Bob explains the situation: ""I'm Bob the gorilla catcher, and there's a gorilla on your roof. I'm gonna need your help to catch him and bring him back to the zoo.""

So the man agrees and they walk over to Bob's pickup. Bob reaches into the back of his truck and carefully gets out all his gorilla catching gear: A net, a dog, a baseball bat, a ladder, and a shotgun. Then he gives the net and the shotgun to the guy who's helping him.

""Alright, here's the plan,"" Bob explains, ""I'm gonna climb up with baseball bat and knock the gorilla off the roof. The dog'll run up and bite him in the balls, and you throw the net over him. Then together we'll throw him in the back of the pickup. Got it?""

""Got it."" The man replies. After a moment of thought, he asks, ""Hold on a minute, what's the shotgun for?""

He accompanies an officer to check up on them. The warden and officer arrive at the first cell that contained the engineer. To their astonishment, the cell was empty and the wall had a hole in it.

""How is that possible?"" said the officer. ""That wall was solid concrete!""

The warden quietly inspected the cell. After a few minutes, he exited and said, ""He seems to have built a pick out of the eating utensils we gave him and used it to make the hole.""

The warden and officer continued to the next cell that contained the physicist. However, he too was gone and once again there was a hole in the wall. And of course, the warden inspected the cell and returned after a few minutes.

The warden declared, ""According to the papers on his bed, he very carefully calculated the weakest point on the wall and repeatedly hit it with a rock until it broke open.""

Finally, they arrived at the last cell that contained the mathematician. Unfortunately, he lay dead on the cell floor from starvation. The officer sighed. ""After the other two, I would have expected he would have also escaped. He also has some papers on his bed."" The warden entered the cell and picked up the papers. Then he shook his head and chuckled.

""It appears,"" the warden said, ""that he spent several days writing a very detailed proof that it was possible to break the wall.

Then he saw an Envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow that was addressed to 'Dad.'

With the worst premonition he opened the envelope with trembling hands and read the letter.

Dear Dad: It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.

I have been finding real passion with Stacy and she is so nice.

But I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am. But it's not only the passion...Dad she's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy.

She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.

We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy.

In the meantime we will pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Stacy can get better. She deserves it.

Don't worry Dad. I'm 15 and I know how to take care of myself.

Someday I'm sure that we will be back to visit so that you can get to know your grandchildren. Love, Your Son John

PS. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Tommy's house.

I Just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than a Report card that's in my center desk drawer.

I love you. Call me when it's safe to come home.

""Behind each of these doors is a table with 6 marbles,"" the scientist explains.  ""I want each of you to go in a room, and spend ONE HOUR with your SIX MARBLES and show me what you can come up with to impress me and win some of my grant money.""  Each hired subject nods in understanding, and each enters through a door, into their separate rooms.

An hour later, the Scientist begins his study as he opens the first door. He finds the Magician.  All Six Marbles are floating in the air, as the Magician hums a docent tone.  ""Amazing!"" exclaims the Scientist, ""How did you do that?""  To which the Magician slyly replies, ""We never reveal our secrets...""  ""Of course,"" exclaims the Scientist, as he jots down some notes.

The Scientist then enters the 2nd room to find the Engineer has all Six marbles stacked on top of each other, balanced perfectly in a tower.  ""WONDERFUL!"" giggles the Scientist.  ""How on Earth did you do that?"" he prys.  To which the Engineer begins to ramble, ""First I found the center of mass of each marble, to which I factored in the density of the material, of which I hypothesized to be handblown, silicon based - then with the coefficient of friction I was able to calculate resistance of - ""

""WHOA!  WHOA! I get it! You needn't continue,"" the Scientist interjects.  As the Engineer silences himself in agreement, the Scientist winks, ""Very Impressive work!"" as he leaves the room.

Finally, he enters the Contractor's room.  To the Scientist's amazed befuddlement, the Contractor is covered in blood, dirt and sweat; muttering to himself and pacing frantically around the room.  He tightly cradles THREE marbles in his hand.  As the Scientist scans the room further, he sees TWO marbles shattered in the corner.  The SIXTH marble is nowhere to be found.

""WHAT HAPPENED HERE?!?!?!?"" gasps the Scientist.

So they get some food, some drinks, look for a nice spot on a map, and set on. Of course they do not get there immediately, because turtles are pretty slow. One day passes, two days, three days, one week, two weeks, but they do not mind because the scenery is beautiful and they are so excited by the idea of having a picnic together! 

After three weeks, they finally get there. They start setting up the food and drinks, which takes them a couple extra hours - not only because they are slow but also because they want to have everything set very nicely, they do not often get the occasion to have a picnic together and all agree that they should make it special. 

Once they are done, they are so proud of how it looks that they decide to take a group picture, but none of them wants to take the picture and be left out of it! So they argue for a while about who should take the picture and who should be in it, but cannot reach an agreement. This is when one of them, let's call him Frank, suddenly has an idea: ""Hey! My fancy camera at home has a timer, I could go pick it up and this way we would ALL be in the picture!"". 

The other two agree, but Frank is concerned that they might start eating the food while he is gone, which would not only ruin the picture, but also be very rude. He expresses his concern to his friends, and they promise that they will not touch the food until he comes back. So here he goes, back to his home. But after a few steps he turns back and asks them: ""Do you really, really, really promise that you will not touch the food? I don't want to come back here and see that you started without me."". They respond that of course they wont! They are all friends, and friends don't do that to each others!

Frank finally leaves, and the others wait. They do not have much to do, so they are a bit bored, but they keep to their promise and don't touch the food. One day passes, two days, three days, one week, two weeks, three weeks, one month, two months... and Frank is still not showing up. One of the turtles says: ""He should really be back by now. You think he changed his mind and stayed home?"". ""No, "" says the other, ""I see what you are getting at, and I disagree. We promised that we would wait!"".

So they wait some more time. One month, two months, three months, four months! ""Look,"" says the first turtle, ""he has been gone for half a year now, he probably decided to stay home! I am so hungry, can't we just eat some of the crackers?"". The other turtle is pretty hungry too by that time, and finally agrees to start eating: ""Alright, but just a few crackers.""

As they start eating the crackers, they hear some noise coming from a nearby bush. They turn to look at it and see Frank getting out of the bush with a very angry face, yelling at them ""I KNEW IT! I KNEW YOU WOULD NOT WAIT!"".

So, grandpa said "" no beer for you.""

A little later, grandpa lit up a cigar and Billy wanting to be like him asked if he could have some. Again, grandpa stared him down and asked ""Does your dick reach your asshole?"" This time, Billy looked down and said ""no.""

Since grandpa was drinking and smoking all day, they didn't catch any fish and had to stop at the grocery store on the way home. While they were there, Billy asked grandpa if he could have a candy bar.  Grandpa asked him the same question and this time Billy got really upset and embarrassed.  Grandpa realizing his mistake decided to buy Billy his own scratch off lotto ticket to match the ones he had grabbed for him and granny to try to make up for it.

When they got home, they all started scratching the silver off. Granny won $10, grandpa struck out, but little Billy, his card won $10,000. Teasingly, grandpa asked Billy if he was going to share. Little Billy looked him dead in the eyes and asked ""Grandpa, does your dick reach your asshole?"" Granny loses it and sprays coffee all over the place and runs out of the room. Grandpa, maintaining eye contact says, ""Why yes Billy, it does.""

The other two will have to go to hell."" So he snaps his fingers and Satan appears.

Satan says, ""Each of you can ask me one question. If you can stump me on the first try, you win, and you get to go to heaven.""

So first the mathematician steps up to Satan, and he says, ""Give me a complete proof for Squaring the Circle."" Satan snaps his fingers, and a big pile of papers appears in front of the man. He looks over the proof carefully, and finally concedes, looking rather glum, ""This is indeed proof of Squaring the Circle."" In a flash of fire and brimstone, he goes to hell.

Next the philosopher comes up to Satan and says, ""I'd like a written proof that god is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent."" Once again, Satan simply snaps his fingers, and  another stack of papers appears. The philosopher rifles through them, and finally concedes, ""I know we're right outside heaven right now, but I hadn't really though that this proof could exist until I saw it just now."" In a second flash of fire and brimstone, he falls straight down to hell.

Finally the idiot strides up to Satan, looking confident. ""Bring me a plastic chair and a power drill!"" he pronounces. Seeming confused, Satan conjures up the requested items. The idiot takes his drill and wildly drills about a dozen holes in the seat of the chair, in no pattern at all.

He then sits on the chair and farts loudly. He slyly looks up at Satan, then asks, ""Which hole did my fart go through?""

Satan picks up the chair, and holds it up to the light. He turns it this way and that, and pokes his fingers through various holes, and he examines it every way he can. 

Finally, after about five minutes, he sets it down, and confidently answers: ""It went through the second hole on the left. It had to be. The aerodynamics can't have worked out any other way.""

The man jumps up and gleefully exclaims, ""Wrong! IT WENT THROUGH MY ASSHOLE!""","A mathematician, a philosopher, and an idiot come before the gates of heaven.",982

Trump has a heart attack and dies. He goes to Hell where the Devil is waiting for him.
""I don't know what to do,"" says the Devil. ""You're on my list but I have no room for you. But you definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got three people here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.""
Trump thought that sounded pretty good so he agreed.
The devil opened the first room. In it was Richard Nixon and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty handed over and over and over, such was his fate in Hell.
""No!"" Trump said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think I could do that all day long.""
The Devil led him to the next room. In it was Tony Blair with a sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.
""No! I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day!"" commented Trump.
The Devil opened a third door. In it, Trump saw Bill Clinton lying naked on the floor with his arms staked over his head and his legs staked in spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.
Trump looked at this in disbelief for a while and finally said, ""Yeah, I can handle this.""
The Devil smiled and said, ""Monica, you're free to go!""",Trump dies and goes to hell. [long],16

l was so distraught! l pulled a gun out of my pocket and put it to the naked man’s head. Just then, the wife yells “Don’t do it! I lied when I told you I inherited all that money!…”

HE paid for our new cabin in the mountains.

So the Gods decided to create 2 trees to live as partners. The female tree was named Eva and the male Lee. As all other forms of life around, the trees were naked.

Eva was not content with her existence. She accused the Gods of cruelty. Unlike the humans they were not able to cover their nakedness. She lived her days with embarrassment and sadness. Lee on the other hand was an optimistic tree. He loved life and although the nakedness bothered him slightly, he was mostly happy.

Eva asked Lee to request clothing from the Gods. She could not bare another day of shame. Lee was willing to do it because he wanted everyone to be happy.

The Gods, of course, saw everything that transpired on their land and they anticipated the trees' request. When the trees eventually summoned the Gods, the Gods told them,

""We see and know everything. We love our creations and we are saddened to see your misery. We have come up with a solution that will surely placate you, dear Eva. We did, however, take notice of Lee's joyful nature and have decided to award him with the solution first. We are truly grateful for your appreciation of our work, Lee. And now, the time for the final solution has arrived""

And the Gods leafed Happy Lee and Eva after",The Gods decided to create trees...,21

post,5u0fzw,2qh72,jokes,false,1487082098,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5u0fzw/im_afraid_of_graveyards/,self.jokes,,"It was a chilly February evening. I had just arrived home from a long day at work and threw open the door on my house. My Rottweiler jumped on me, and before I even took off my coat we were going on a walk. We passed the graveyard. A fresh grave had been dug immediately adjacent to the entrance, and the family was just departing, leaving the coffin next to the hole awaiting the gravedigger to lower it into the pit. The family must have found it too upsetting. I continued to walk my dog and we reached the park. The sunset was gorgeous, but the sun was already swiftly falling and we had a long walk home. I turn around and begin the walk home, but every block we travel the sun seems to set more and more quickly, and we had yet to pass the graveyard.

I'm not superstitious or anything, but graveyards frighten me. The thought of decaying bodies underneath my feet gives me goosebumps, and my friends knew not to ask me to walk past the graveyard in the dark. Finally, with five blocks to go, the light completely winks out. The street lights, still programmed for summer, would not turn on for another half hour or more. Sprawling on the next block was the graveyard. There was no light except what came from the moon and stars, and the shadows cast were long and full of the possibility of horror. Instinctively walking more briskly, my unfazed dog began to trot beside me. It brought me comfort, having such a large dog. I mean, dogs like bones, right? If any skeletons decide to assault us, she would tear them apart and chew away.

Just as we were passing the large, stone entrance, I noticed the new grave was still open, and a shovel was lying next to the still unburied casket. I stopped and took a few paces towards the graveyard, and looked around for the old gravedigger. He was nowhere to be seen, so I turned my back on the site and returned to the main road, when my dog froze and looked behind us. I turned and say nothing, and turned back around.

“Come on girl. There's nothing there.” I said, but she was not a very skittish dog and it worried me. Then I heard it and turned around.

It was a faint knocking. I thought it might have been the gravedigger returning to finish his job, so I looked towards the small chapel. Nothing moved. The wind breathed through the trees. I turned and began to leave the graveyard again when I heard the knocking again, banging almost. I turned and looked all around.

It was about ten feet away, the coffin, standing up on its bottom. Its shadow cast all the way to the exit of the graveyard. I couldn't tear my eyes away from it. Had the gravedigger placed it there the last time I turned around? There is no way he could have hoisted something so heavy behind me, let alone kept it balanced. Then I heard the knocking again. It was the coffin. It picked up the bottom right corner of itself and shifted it forward, then placed it back down with a thunk. Then it repeated itself with the other corner. It was getting closer.

My dog broke its fear-induced impression of a statue and bolted, which made me even more terrified as she was supposed to protect me. The coffin accelerated, and I could move again. Out of the graveyard I sprinted down the block. The thumping sped up but grew quieter. As I reached the next block, my adrenaline left me. Every stride was accompanied with pain in my thighs and calves, but I couldn't slow down. The coffin grew closer.

I reached my house. The coffin was right behind me but I dare not slow down. My dog is nowhere to be seen. I slam the door to my living room. CRASH! The coffin blasts through my door, leaving wooden splinters everywhere. I blast upstairs, hoping it could not follow, but it jumps after me. I slam the door to the master bedroom and lock it, just before it is immediately decimated by the coffin.  I run into the bathroom. CRASH! Again, the coffin breaks through. It looms in my house, scraping the ceiling. It slows down and slowly approaches me, backed into the corner. Without tearing my gaze away, I struggle with the medicine cabinet behind me. I fling the door open and grab whatever I can to throw at the coffin. I throw a bottle of Advil, leaving not even a scratch on the wood. I throw a thermometer, some loose Band-aid boxes, assorted orange prescription bottles, even the wire metal container the medication was in. The coffin kept coming. It was five feet away now, blotting out all light in the room. I grab the last item in the cabinet, a bottle of Robitussin, tear off the lid, and splash the contents on the coffin.

And the Robitussin made the coughin' stop.",I'm Afraid of Graveyards,4

A young man was in a bar sipping his tequila when he notices a picture of Pancho Villa on the wall behind the bar. Jokingly, the young man asks the old bartender, “Did you know Pancho Villa?”

“Did I know Pancho Villa?” Says the old bartender,  “Let me tell you a story my friend.  I was a young man tending to a herd of cattle when I saw far in the distance a great red cloud of sand and dust coming toward me from the desert.

As the cloud of dust got closer, I was very nervous it was bandits. I heard the sound of hoof beats and at last I saw a great white horse, and it was the great man himself, Pancho Villa riding straight at me!

He got close to me and I saw he had a large silver pistol with an ivory handle.  He drew the pistol and pointed it right at my head. I was very scared.  He laughed out loud said ‘Drop your pants.’

What could I do?  He had his pistol pointed right at me – so I dropped my pants.  Then he said ‘Squat.’  What could I do?  He had his pistol pointed right at me – so I squat down like he says.  Then he said –

‘SHIT’

I did not have to shit, but what could I do?  He had his pistol pointed right at me. I was very scared, so I shit.  Pancho Villa pointed his gun at me and with a deep laugh and sinister grin, said ‘Now eat ze shit.’

‘Crap,’ I thought. It was disgusting, but what could I do?  He had his pistol pointed right at me, so I ate ze shit.  You ask me if I know Pancho Villa, why yes, I had lunch with him one day.

post,5tzepr,2qh72,jokes,false,1487066855,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5tzepr/a_schoolreunion/,self.jokes,,"A man named Chris sits down at a table at his high-school reunion. It's been a while since the last reunion, and he can't seem to remember a single face from the crowd.

Suddenly another guy sits down beside Chris. The man is very tall, about 6'3, and his face is stretched out. As if someone was pulling his face up and down at the same time.

The man introduces himself as John, a childhood friend of Chris. Chris remembers the name very well, but the man sitting beside him doesn't look anything like what he did in high-school.

 No worries, John says. Almost no one recognizes me anymore. I used to be short and chubby, but nowadays I'm tall as a redwood and slim as a twig. This change of appearance happened in only a few months too! John laughs.

Chris seems a bit puzzled, so John tells him a bit more about what has happened in his life during this last year.

 About eight months ago me and my wife lived in a slightly unsafe neighborhood. We were fine with it as we both own guns, and know what to avoid there.
The situation changed when my wife got pregnant. We didn't want to raise our child in an unsafe place, so we decided to move into a gated community.
A few weeks after we made our decision we found out that the CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, was remaking a whole neighborhood into a modern gated community to test prototypes for Tesla.
A lot of people applied to get a house there, and luckily we were accepted. The grounds are very secure, and no one but the inhabitants and different services get in or out.
The only weird thing about living there is that we noticed that we started to stretch out a bit. When i moved there i was a bit below 5'7, but as you can notice I'm much taller now. Same goes for everyone else in the area.

 Well why don't you leave? It seems very weird to live in a place where you mystically stretch out when you move in.

 I guess that is the price of living in an Elon-gated community",A schoolreunion,332

He chooses Argentina and when he gets there they tell him his inheritance is in coffee and and nuts while at the same time the land he would have inherited in Brazil was sitting on a gold mine.
 
Obviously upset but looking on the bright side he chose to take his inheritance while he still had it but they told him he had to choose either the coffee beans or the nuts and he chose nuts. He comes to find out the price of coffee beans goes up while nuts goes down.
 
Left with almost nothing he decides to move back home to the states and is left with the choice between taking the flight to New York or the Flight to Boston. He chooses the flight to Boston but as he's boarding the flight to Boston he takes a sneak peek at the flight to New York and sees that it's a very luxurious plane filled with beautiful flight attendants, sparkling wine and comfortable interior. He then takes a look inside his own plane and sees that it's filled with livestock, torn upholstery, and no food other than the food for the cattle.
 
On the journey to Boston the plane is caught in a terrible storm and the man remembers the story of Jonah and the whale. Feeling guilty for all the lives in the plane he tells the pilot to throw him out telling him that he's the reason for this mess. The pilot agrees but tells him he has to wear two parachutes when he jumps.
 
The man then jumps out the plane with the two parachutes and at the right time he pulls the left cord but it's rusty and won't activate.

""Good thing I have another one!"" says the man as he pulls the second cord.
 
The parachute comes flying out but it's not connected to the backpack at all.
