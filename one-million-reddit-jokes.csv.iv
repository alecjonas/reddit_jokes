The man hops on an elevator and goes downward rapidly for an hour. The elevator opens up to a bigger, more dazzling Las Vegas. Two lovely naked women immediately bring him a glass of rum and a lit cigar. The man looks around, excited but confused.

The Devil approaches him and says, ""Welcome to Hell! Don't believe the stories upstairs, we all have a great time here. And no hangovers, either!""

The man spends the entire day in luxury, everything handed to him by smiling, gorgeous ladies. Finally, he heads back up the elevator to Heaven.

""St. Peter, I gotta say Heaven sounds nice but maybe a bit too quiet. I lived a good, short life - I think I'd like to party it up in Hell."" St. Peter nods and waves goodbye as the man descends back down the elevator shaft.

As he opens the door, he hears tortured screams and crying. Corpses bring him reminders of his dead loved ones and fire extends out to the horizon, instantly making the man sweat.

""What's going on here? Where are all the women and drinks and games?""

The Devil places a red hot hand on the man's shoulder and with a smile says, ""Why my friend, that was just visiting weekend!""

The genie said ""You released me from the lamp, blah blah blah. This is the fourth time this month and I'm getting a little sick of these wishes so you can forget about three. You only get one wish!""   

The man sat and thought about it for a while and said, ""I've always wanted to go to Hawaii but I'm scared to fly and I get very seasick.   

""Could you build me a bridge to Hawaii so I can drive over there to visit?""   

The genie laughed and said, ""That's impossible! Think of the logistics of that! How would the supports ever reach the bottom of the Pacific? Think of how much concrete! How much steel! You're going to have to think of another wish.""   

The man agreed, and tried to think of a really good wish. Finally, he said, ""I've been married and divorced four times. My wives always said that I don't care and that I'm insensitive. So, I wish that I could understand women. I want to know how they feel inside and what they're thinking when they give me the silent treatment. I want to figure out why they're crying, know what they really want when they say 'nothing', and know how to make them truly happy.""

\- I'm sorry man, but how have you kept this bike in such good condition?

\- Oh, I've not done much my man. Here, take this vaseline jar and apply some vaseline to every part of the bike whenever it rains and you'll be fine.

So the boy leaves and meets his girlfriend. They had planned a dinner at her parents house for the first time, therefore he just couldn't decline. He drives them to her parents house but just before entering, the girlfriend says to her boyfriend:

\- You know, honey, my family is a little weird. For example, when we are eating, nobody ever talks. If they do talk, there's a punishment, which is washing the dishes.

They boyfriend then opens the door, they enter inside, introduces himself to the parents and to his surprise, he sees a pile of dishes pretty much everywhere. Despite that, they proceed to the dinner, and while having it, no one says even a single word. Then he thinks:

\- I can't man, having dinner without conversation is strange, I have to do something about this.

So he starts kissing his girlfriend in front of her parents but he can't get a word out of their mouth. Surprised, he puts her on the table, undresses her and has sex with her. The father, although very angry, doesn't react and neither does her mother. The boyfriend then thinks, well, I have to do something more drastic. He sees her mother, you know, a nice lady in her 40s, he grabs and puts her on the table, undresses her and has sex with her. The father, despite being very annoyed, doesn't say a single word. The boyfriend is seemingly very disappointed. Suddenly, he hears thunders from outside and it starts raining. He remembers what the seller told him about the motorcycle, takes the jar of vaseline out of his pocket and then the father says:

Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street

And one says to the other with a twinkle in her eye
See yon sleeping Scotsman so strong and handsome built
I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt

They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as could be
Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see
And there behold, for them to see, beneath his Scottish skirt
Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth

They marveled for a moment, then one said we must be gone
Let's leave a present for our friend, before we move along
As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon, tied into a bow
Around the bonnie star, the Scots kilt did lift and show

Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled towards a tree
Behind a bush, he lift his kilt and gawks at what he sees
And in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes.
O lad I don't know where you been but I see you won first prize!

Since the audience was different each week, the magician did the same tricks over and over again. There was only one problem: The captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the Magician did every trick.

Once he understood, he started shouting in the middle of the show, ""Look, it's not the same hat!"" or, ""Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table!"" Or ""Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?""

The magician was furious but couldn't do anything. It was, after all, the Captain's parrot.

Then one stormy night on the Pacific, the ship unfortunately sank.

The magician luckily found himself on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea, as fate would have it ... With the parrot.

They stared at each other with hatred, but did not utter a word.

This went on for a day... And then 2 days. And then 3 days. Finally on the 4th day, the parrot could not hold back any longer and said...

""Okay, I give up. Where's the ship?""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""Barrack Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At his house, Obama spots Dave walking towards his door and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'

He says no, and reminds her that the last time she borrowed it she didn’t put any gas in and she scuffed the bumper. Despite her pleas and promises, the Dad steadfastly refuses to lend her the car. Since she’s already promised all her friends she’d pick them up, she continues to beg, “I’ll do anything dad! Please?!”

He looks at her and says “give me a blowjob, and you can use the car.”

Disgusted, the daughter is speechless. The dad just stands there, staring blankly at her. After a long silence she finally says “fine, I’ll do it. But only for a minute.”

He pulls it out, and she closes her eyes and slowly approaches it. As she nears she starts to notice that it smells terrible. As she gets closer it becomes unbearable and she backs away, covering her face. “Dad, what’s wrong with you?? Your dick smells like shit!”

“Oh man, I’m so sorry” says the Dad, buckling up his pants. “I can’t give you the car tonight after all - your brother has it!”",NSFW the grossest joke I’ve ever heard,14

The Chief calls for the band and 13 hulking figures appear and gather around the Priest. They begin to beat and sodomize the Priest in ways he had never even dreamed of before.

“You may visit this store only once. There are six floors and the attributes of the men increase as the shopper ascends the flights. There is, however, a catch. You may choose any man from a particular floor, or you may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!”

So, a woman goes to “The Husband Store” to find a husband.

On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 – These men have jobs, and love kids.
 

The second floor sign reads:

Floor 2 – These men have jobs, love kids, and love God.
 

The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 – These men have jobs, love kids, love God, and are extremely good looking.


“Wow,” she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 – These men have jobs, love kids, love God, are drop-dead gorgeous and help with the housework.


“Oh, mercy me!” she exclaims. “I can hardly believe it!” Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 – These men have jobs, love kids, love God, are drop-dead gorgeous, help with the housework, and have a strong romantic streak.
 

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor and the sign reads:

There was a couple of lovers who had a day off work so they went to their favorite ice cream parlor. The boyfriend wasn't that into ice cream but it was the girlfriend's favorite treat, so he always had what she had. The place was mostly quiet since it was a workday. She wanted to share a sundae with him. He told her, ""Good idea. You pick one out while I find us a table."" As she went to the menus on the wall, he picked a table in a booth in the corner. She saw that they had a new sundae topped with mixed nuts that have been crushed to crumbs. He quickly dropped into the seat. Without turning around, not knowing that he sat down, she asked, ""Crushed nut?"" to which he replied, ""Very possibly. I think I just sat down too fast!""",The lovers in the ice cream parlor,9

Even though everyone was respectful, the sheer volume of hair and speed at which it grew was a constant hardship. It interfered with the boy's eating, he would overheat quickly during warmer seasons, hygiene was an issue ... there was no shortage of difficulties stemming from this unprecedented hair growth.

The boy's family tried their best to trim the hair down to more manageable lengths, but within the week the hair grew back in entirety, without fail. Eventually, they resorted to cutting hair away from the most problematic areas - the mouth, the eyes, etc. It seemed like there was no possibility of ever overcoming the hair.

One day, a man happened upon the community. He was a scholar of sorts, and had traveled the world documenting and researching all the wonders of the world. He only came through with the intention of trading for some food and supplies, but something caught his attention:  the hairy boy, of course. The townsfolk thought the scholar meant to gawk at the boy, but he revealed something quite interesting:  halfway across the world, the scholar had encountered another boy sharing the affliction *and they had been cured.*

Plucking and trimming was ineffective, the scholar explained. The only way to stop the hair was to shave the boy, completely. They would need to work together to beat it, but it *could* be beaten. The scholar had business elsewhere, but promised to return within the week to see the boy's transformation.

Over the next several days, everyone in the family took shifts shaving the boy. Night and day, somebody was always shaving hair off the boy. Unfortunately, the growth was so aggressive that all progress made was undone within the day. It seemed hopeless.

Upon the scholar's return, the family accosted him, thinking it was all a cruel joke.

The scholar was confused - he knew the cure worked, he had seen it with his own eyes! He began asking question after question, trying to learn why they were not successful. Surely the blades were dull, some of the hairs had been pulled out instead? Had they missed a spot?

The family insisted they had done just as he said, they had worked for days on end to no avail. There was simply no way for their family to outpace the growth. No matter for feverishly they attacked the hair, it grew faster than they could shave it. At one point they had even tried the entire family shaving different sections of growth simultaneously. Nothing, no improvement.

The scholar chuckled to himself, realizing the problem. The family, even cooperating, was not enough to combat the hair. Everyone in town would need to work together to cure the boy. As the scholar had learned with the other case, it would take the village to raze the child.",A little boy in a quaint town was said to be the hairiest person in history.,5

The husband replied ""Hang on a minute love, so at least I can tell you what happened""

""Go ahead"", she sobbed. "" but probably they will be the last words you will say to me""

And the husband began "" Well, I was getting in to the car to drive home, this young lady here asked me for a lift. She looked so down and out, and defenseless that I took pity on her and let her into the car. I noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty. She told me that she hadn't eaten for three days. So , in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night, the ones you wouldn't eat because you're afraid that you'll put on weight.

The poor thing devoured them in moments.

Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes, so I threw them away.

Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don't wear because you say they are too tight.

I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don't wear because I don't have a good taste.

I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don't wear just to annoy her, and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don't wear because someone at work has a pair of the same.

The husband took a quick breath and continued- ' She was so grateful for my understanding and help and that as I walked her to the door, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said ' Please, do you have anything else that your wife doesn't use?'

That's how we ended up on bed.",The wife came early and found her husband making love with a young attractive woman.,39409

 All of a sudden, he wakes up with an elderly man dressed in a cowl standing in front of his bed.
""What the hell are you doing in my bedroom?......and who are you?"" he asked.
""This is not your bedroom,"" the man replied, ""I am St. Peter, and you are in heaven.""
""WHAT!??  Are you saying I'm dead?  I don't want to die.....I'm too young."" said Harry.  ""If I'm dead, I want you to send me back immediately.""
""It's not that easy"", said St.Peter, ""you can only return as a dog or a hen.  You can choose on your own...""
Harry thought about it for a while, and figured out that being a dog is too tiring, but a hen probably has a nice and relaxed life.  Running around with a rooster can't be that bad.
""I want to return as a hen."" Harry replied.
And in the next second, he found himself in a chicken run,  really nicely feathered.  But man, now ""he"" felt like the rear end was gonna blow........then along came the rooster.
""Hey, you must be the new hen on the farm."" he said.  ""How does it feel?""
""Well, it's OK I guess, but it feels like my rear end is blowing up.""
""Oh that!""  said the rooster.  ""That's only the ovulation going on.  Have you never laid an egg before??""
""No, how do I do that?""  Harry asked.
""Cluck twice, and then you push all you can.""
Harry clucked twice, and pushed more than he was good for, and then 'Plop' and an egg was on the ground.
""Wow""  Harry said ""that felt really good!""  So he clucked again and squeezed.  And you better believe that there was yet another egg on the ground.  The third time he clucked, he heard his  wife shout:
""Harry, for Gods sake wake up, you're sh ! tting all over the bed!""",Choosing what happens in reincarnation,108

The third nun hesitant stepped forward thinking “I’m screwed. I don’t know the second or third people.” She hung her head low.

The Nun paused, she thought it over and was really stumped. Finally she said to Peter “Wow, that’s hard.”

thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I
apparently still looked confused. So she looked all around the store
to see if it was empty. It was empty.

""Just a minute,"" she said, and walked to the door, and locked it.
Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse
and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ""Do these
excite you?"" she asked. Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do
was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on.
As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties
and lay down on a desk. ""Well, come on"", she said, ""We don't have much time.""

So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could
no longer hold back and KAPOW, I was done within a few minutes.

There was nothing they could do to console the gorilla. After awhile even when they fed the gorilla it would refuse to eat and throw its food against the wall.

After this went on for awhile the zookeepers decided to bring a professional in. Once the professional came in he told them
“This is a female gorilla and she is clearly in heat. You need to get a male here to have sex with her.”

The zookeepers were in quite a bind because they didn’t have the money to buy a second gorilla so they decided to reach out to other zoos and see if they could have one flown in for the special purpose. They called every zoo they could and unfortunately no one would give in to their request.

That’s when one of the zookeepers had an idea.
“I’ve got it! You know that big country boy who cleans out the cages? He is almost the size of a gorilla. Maybe he would do it!”

So before closing the zoo that night they approached the man and asked him,
“We know this is a crazy request but we are in dire need. The gorilla we just bought is a female in heat and we need someone to have sex with her. We can’t afford to bring a male gorilla in so we were wondering, would you be willing to have sex with her for $500 dollars?”

The man sat for a minute and said,
“I’m not sure, honestly I’ve never considered something like this before. Can I have the night to think about it?”

The zookeepers were happy to oblige.
“Of course! Take the night to think about it but we need an answer in the morning.”

The next morning the zookeepers came into work and were waiting on pins and needles. Finally they saw the cage cleaner as he came into work and they instantly approached him.

“Do you have an answer?!” 

The man replied,
“I’ve thought long and hard about this and I think I can do it but I have 2 conditions.”

“Of course!” The zookeepers replied, “anything you want!”

“Alright” said the man,
“First, you cannot tell ANYONE about this. I can’t have this get out.”

“Of course, of course!” said the zookeepers, “what is your second request?”

The man took a moment and replied,
“I don’t have $500 on me right now, I’m gonna need a week before I can pay you.”",A zoo bought a female gorilla,232

One of them was known as Sister Mathematical (SM), 

and the other one was known as Sister Logical (SL). 

It is getting dark and they are still far away from the convent. 

SM: Have you noticed that a man has been following us for 
the past thirty-eight and a half minutes? I wonder what he wants. 

SL: It's logical. He wants to rape us. 

SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes 
at the most! What can we do? 

SL: The only logical thing to do of course is to walk faster. 

SM: It's not working. 

SL: Of course it's not working. The man did the only 
logical thing. He started to walk faster, too. 

SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in one minute. 

SL: The only logical thing we can do is split. You go that way and 
I'll go this way. He cannot follow us both. 

So the man decided to follow Sister Logical. 

Sister Mathematical arrives at the convent and is 
worried about what has happened to Sister Logical.

Then Sister Logical arrives 

SM: Sister Logical! Thank God you are here! 
Tell me what happened! 

SL: The only logical thing happened. 
The man couldn't follow us both,so he followed me

SM: Yes, yes! But what happened then? 

SL: The only logical thing happened. I started to run 
as fast as I could and he started to run as fast as he could. 

SM: And? 

SL: The only logical thing happened. He reached me 

SM: Oh, dear! What did you do? 

SL: The only logical thing to do. I lifted my dress up. 

SM: Oh, Sister! What did the man do? 

SL: The only logical thing to do. He pulled down his pants. 


SM: Oh, no! What happened then? 

SL: Isn't it logical, Sister? 
A nun with her dress up can run faster than man with his pants down. 

And for those of you who thought it would be dirty,

I'll pray for you!

“Just a minute,” she said, and walked to the door, locking it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. 

“Do these excite you,” she asked 

Well, I was so dumb struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said that it was the time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties, and laid down on a desk. 

“Well, come on,” she said, “we don’t have much time.” So, I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that I could no longer hold it back, and BOOM, I was done with it in a few minutes. She looked at me with a bit of a frown. 

“Did you put that condom on?” She asked. 

“I’m sure I did,” and held up my thumb to show her.

lyin' in his own piss and vomit, my uncle starts wonderin'

and just drives home.

\- He hears this knockin' at the door.


So he goes downstairs,
pulls the door open-- ""What?"" It's the state trooper

him out to the garage, opens the door.

cruiser is in my uncle's garage.

He was so fuckin' hammered
he drove the wrong car home.

Now Johnny is a pretty hip guy with his own car; when he knocks on the front door, the girl's father answers and invites him in. 

""Carrie's not ready yet, so why don't you have a seat?"" he says. 

""That's cool,"" says Johnny. 

Carrie's father asks Johnny what they're planning to do. Johnny replies politely that they will probably just go to the soda shop or a movie. 

Carrie's father responds, ""Why don't you two go out and screw? I hear all the kids are doing it."" 

Naturally, this comes as quite a surprise to Johnny, so he asks Carrie's dad to repeat it. 

""Yeah,"" says Carrie's father, ""Carrie really likes to screw; she'd screw all night if we let her!"" 

Well, this just made Johnny's eyes light up, and his plan for the evening was beginning to look pretty good. 

A few minutes later, Carrie comes downstairs in her little mini skirt and announces that she is ready to go. Almost breathless with anticipation, Johnny proudly escorts his date out the front door. 

About 20 minutes later, Carrie rushes back into the house, slams the door behind her, and screams at her father: ""DARN IT, DADDY! IT'S CALLED THE TWIST!""",Johnny is very excited to go on his very first date....,48

And this is what I said:

“I’ve thought a lot about it, son, and I don’t think it’s all that complicated. I think maybe we’re here just to teach a kid how to bunt or how to eat sunflower seeds without using his hands.
“We’re here to wear our favorite sweat-soaked Boston Red Soxcap and the Converse sneakers we lettered in on a Saturday morning, with nowhere we have to go and no one special we have to be.
“I don’t think the meaning of life is worrying over what comes after death but tasting all the tiny moments that come before it. We’re here to be there when our kid has three goals and an assist. And especially when he doesn’t.
“See, grown-ups spend so much time slaving toward the better car, the perfect house, the big day that will finally make them happy, when happy just walked by wearing a bicycle helmet two sizes too big for him. We’re not here to find a way to heaven. The way is heaven.

“Does that answer your question, son?”

“Not really, Dad,” he said.

“No?”
And he said, “No, what I meant is, why are we here when Mom said to pick her up forty minutes ago?”",Answer,8

December 8th: 6:00 PM. It started to snow. The first snow of the season and the wife and I took our cocktails and sat for hours by the window watching the huge soft flakes drift down from heaven. It was the perfect picture and it was so romantic we felt like newlyweds again. I love snow!


December 9th: We woke to a beautiful blanket of crystal white snow covering every inch of the landscape. What a fantastic sight! Can there be a lovelier place in the Whole World? Moving here was the best idea I’ve ever had. I started to shovel for the first time in years and it honestly made me feel like a little boy again. I did both our driveway and the sidewalks. This afternoon the snowplow came along and covered up the sidewalks and closed in the driveway, so I got to shovel again. What a perfect life!


December 12th: The sun has melted all our lovely snow. It was such a disappointment. My neighbor tells me not to worry; we'll definitely have a white Christmas. No snow on Christmas would be awful! Bob says we'll have so much snow by the end of winter, that I'll never want to see snow again. I don't think that's possible. Bob is such a nice man I'm glad he's our neighbor.


December 14th: Snow lovely snow! We got 8"" of it last night. The temperature dropped to -20. The cold makes everything sparkle so. The wind took my breath away, but I warmed up by shoveling the driveway and sidewalks. This is the life, but the snowplow came back this afternoon and buried everything again. I didn't realize I would have to do quite this much shoveling, but I'll certainly get back in shape this way. I wish l wouldn't huff and puff so much.


December 15th: The weather channel said there was 20 inches of snow in the forecast. I sold my van, bought a 4x4 Blazer, snow tires for the wife's car, 2 extra shovels and I stocked the freezer. On the way I even saw a reindeer they are so majestic I love them so much. When I went home the wife told me that she wants a wood stove in case the electricity goes out. I think that's silly, we aren't in Alaska, after all.


December 16th: Ice storm this morning. Fell on my ass while walking on the ice in the driveway putting down salt. Shit hurt like hell, and the wife laughed for an hour, which I think was very cruel.


December 17th: Still way below freezing. Roads are too icy to go anywhere. Electricity was off for 5 hours, and I had to pile blankets on me to stay warm. There was nothing to do but stare at the wife and try not to irritate her. I guess I should've bought a wood stove, but I will never admit that to her, because I hate it when she's right. I can't believe I'm freezing to death in my own damn living room.


December 20th: Electricity turned back on today, but we had another 14"" of the fucking slop last night, and like usual there was more shoveling. It took me all day to shovel it because the goddamn snowplow came by twice. I tried to find a neighbor kid to shovel, but they said they were too busy playing hockey. Personally I think they were all lying, so I called the only hardware store around to see about buying a snow blower and they were all out. They said that they might have another shipment in March. Who the hell would want to wait that long when we’re suffering now? Bob said I had to shovel or the city will have it done and bill me. I’m sick of his attitude; he’s starting to piss me off.


December 21st: Bob was right about a white Christmas because 13 more inches of the white shit fell today, and it's so cold it probably won't melt till August. Took me 45 minutes to get all dressed up to go out to shovel and then I had to piss. By the time I got undressed, pissed, and dressed again, I was too tired to shovel. Tried to hire Bob who has a snowplow on his truck for the rest of the winter; but he says he's too busy. I think the fucking asshole is lying, it looks like he likes to taunt me… bastard...


December 22nd: On my way to the store I saw another reindeer, God I hate those animals. I tried to run one over but I unfortunately missed. I wish someone could come and exterminate the pieces of shit.


December 23rd: Well I was pleasantly surprised we only had 2"" of snow today. And it finally warmed up to 0. The wife wanted me to decorate the front of the house this morning. What is she fucking nuts?!! Why didn't she tell me to do that a month ago?


December 24th: We got 6 more inches of the shit today. Snow was packed up so hard by the snowplow that I broke the shovel. For a second I thought I was having a heart attack. If I ever catch the son of a bitch who drives that snowplow, I'll drag him through the snow by his balls. I know he hides around the corner and waits for me to finish shoveling and then he comes down the street at like 100 miles an hour and throws snow all over where I've just been! Tonight the wife wanted me to sing Christmas carols with her and open our presents, but I was too busy watching for the goddamn snowplow.


December 25th: Merry Fucking Christmas, 20 more inches of the fucking slop tonight, and best of all we were snowed in. The idea of shoveling makes my blood boil. God I hate the snow! Then the snowplow driver came by asking for a donation and I hit him over the head with my fucking shovel. The wife says I have a bad attitude. I think she’s fucking dumb. If I have to watch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" one more time, I'm going to fucking murder her.


December 26th: Still snowed in. Why the hell did we ever move here? It was all HER idea... the bitch is really getting on my nerves.


December 27th: Well the temperature dropped to -30 and the pipes froze. I am really starting to hate Canada.


December 28th: It warmed up to above -20, we are still snowed in, and like always the retarded Christmas elf that I live with is driving me crazy!!!!!


December 29th: 10 more inches came down last night. Bob says I would have to shovel the roof or it could cave in. That's the silliest thing I ever heard, how dumb does he think I am?


December 30th: The roof caved in.... The snow plow driver is suing me for a million dollars because of the bump on the head. The wife left me and went home to her mother. Good!! She was really pissing me off.


December 31st: Well I set fire to what's left of the house. Finally there is no more goddamn shoveling.


January 1st: Well some guys came over today and took me somewhere…


January 8th: I feel so good. I just love those little white pills they keep giving me. Why am I tied to the bed???",Diary of a Mad Snow Shoveler,7

Just as she was going to kill the rat, the rat screamed, “WAIT! I’m a magic rat and if you spare me I can grant you three wishes!”


The snake, intrigued, took the rat out of her mouth and held him in her tail. 

“How can I be sure you’re not lying?”


“My magic comes with the condition that i’m never allowed to tell a lie.”


“And I can have anything I want?”


“Well, you can’t wish for more wishes, but that’s the only catch.”


“Alright then. I wish for a nice male snake to come along and be my mate.”


Out of the underbrush slithered a male snake with brilliant scales. The snake eyed her new mate-to-be for a few seconds and then turned back to the rat. 


“I wish for a burrow and nest to already be dug and made right in this forest.”


A hole appeared in the ground, the snake stuck her head under and saw a finely built nest of soft moss surrounded by firmly packed dirt walls. Satisfied, she pulled her head up. 


“Before I have my last wish, can I ask you a few questions?”


“Whatever you want, missus snake.”


“Do you have a family?”


“Why yes I do.”


“Are they also magic?”


“Yes they are.”
