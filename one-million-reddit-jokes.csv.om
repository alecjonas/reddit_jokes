On the first day of the job, a customer approaches him with a cart full of oranges and asks, ""Are these oranges fresh?""

The cashier remains silent, so the customer leaves without purchasing the oranges. His boss, who happens to speak the cashier's native language, walks up to him and says, ""Next time if a customer asks if the oranges are fresh, you tell them, 'As fresh as can be'.""

The next day, a customer approaches him and asks, ""Are these oranges fresh?"" 

""As fresh as can be."" 

""How much do they cost?""

The cashier doesn't know what to say, so he remains silent, and the customer leaves. The cashier's boss walks up to him and says, ""The cost of each orange is one dollar.""

The next day, a customer approaches him and asks, ""Are these oranges fresh?""

""As fresh as can be.""

""How much do they cost?""

""One dollar.""

""Is it really worth it?"" 

Again the cashier is clueless, so he remains silent, and the customer leaves. The boss walks up to the cashier again and says, ""If they ask you whether or not they should buy the oranges, say 'yes'.""

The next day, a customer approaches him and asks, ""Are these oranges fresh?""

""As fresh as can be.""

""How much do they cost?""

""One dollar.""

""Is it really worth it?"" 

""Yes""

So the customer buys the oranges and leaves. At the end of the day, as the cashier is preparing to leave, a burglar breaks in and approaches him, ""How much money you got in the cash register?""

""One dollar.""

""Are you being fresh with me.""

""As fresh as can be."" 

""Do you wanna die?""

""Yes""

He goes up to the roof where he sits and prays. Whilst praying, a jeep passes by the church and people are calling out to him: “Hey priest, get in the car! We can save you!”

To this the priest replies : “No! only God will save me!”

So, he carries on praying as the water begins to rise. Eventually, the water is now almost level with the roof. Soon after, a boat passes by and the man inside the boat yells : “Hey priest, get in the boat! I can save you!”

To this the priest replies again : “**No! only God will save me!**”

Not much long after, the priest is now submerged in the water, struggling to survive but still praying. However, a helicopter soon arrives to save the day. The man in the helicopter shouts out “Hey priest! Get in the helicopter, we can save you!”

The priest replies for a third and final time : “****No! only God will save me!****”

Soon after, the priest dies and finds himself standing outside the pearly gates. God is standing there staring at the priest and out of the silence the priest yelps “God, I prayed and prayed and prayed! Why didn’t you save me?”

Evidently annoyed, God replies “I SENT YOU A JEEP, A BOAT AND A BLOODY HELICOPTER! WHAT THE FUCK ELSE DO YOU WANT ME TO DO???”",How God Works,7

It's getting quite late, their legs are tired, and the bags on their back seem to weigh 10 times what they did at the beginning. They come to a clearing next to the edge of the forest, and right next to a small lake. As they lay their bags down against the soil, the first man spotted a glint reflect into his eyes from the moonlight. Intrigued, he walks over to where the glint came from, and bends down. The second man, walks over to the first, and asks him what he's doing. The first man stands up and turns towards the second man, brandishing a golden oil lamp. The second man is astounded, that in the middle of the wilderness they have found a dirty man made object such as the lamp, when they haven't been on a trail at all for the last 4 hours. Still, they begin to rub along the side of the lamp, cleaning it to see if it works. As the second man begins rubbing the lamp with the bottom of his shirt, the lamp begins to glow, and out of the spout a genie emerges. His skin was tainted blue, and he was wrapped in shawls, that looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a couple thousand years. Once he had finished brushing himself off, the genie looked around, and upon spotting that there were three fully grown men at present, began surveying them. At this point, the third man looked up. He had spent the last 3 minutes trying to untie his boots, and hadn't been paying attention to what the other two had been doing. Finally, after sizing up each man in turn, the genie spoke. 
""Greetings wanderers! You have freed me from an eternity of darkness, and as such, I will grant each of you three wishes!"" He exclaimed. His voice sent ripples down the water, disturbing the once held peace. The genie turned to the first man, and upon the anticipation, the man spoke.
""For my first wish, I would like the most beautiful women that could exist, to be my wife!"" He said confidently to the genie. The genie, smiling, waved his hand towards the lake lazily. A disturbance occurred about 3 metres in, and a woman begin to emerge. Her long frolicking hair was kept around her shoulders, and her beauty entranced the first man, as she flowed into his life, as graceful as Mother Nature herself. The genie, upon giving the first man his first wish, turned to the second man. The second man began to smile, he knew what he wanted, and so he proclaimed ""I wish for all cancer sufferers, and all cancers, to be cured. This world has enough suffering as it is!"". The genie, upon hearing these words spoke back to the second man, saying ""It is done. Your wish is my command."". Now the third man was faced by the genie. With a wild glint in his eye, he looked at the genie and said ""Genie! I wish for my right arm to be eternally rotation forwards!"". The genie, sceptically waved his hand, and the third mans arm began rotating forwards. Once he had finished with the third man, once again he turned to the first man, who spoke and said ""For my second wish, I want to have 2 amazing children, who will have success in life, and be as beautiful as my wife!"". The genie, smiling politely said ""In time, it will be done."". The genie then turned to the second man, who spoke ""I wish for all people suffering from long term illness to be cured, and no one else suffers from them."". And the genie granted the wish. I beauty fell on the world, as everyone who suffered long term illness slowly began to be their normal selves again. The world was happy. The genie then turned to the second man, who spoke with a boyish giggle in his tone. ""I wish for my left arm to be eternally spinning backwards."". The genie sighed, and waved his hand. The mans left arm, began to spin, as so his hands were going in opposite directions. The genie then turned to the first man for the final time. The man said, ""I wish for endless riches, so I can provide for my wife and children and family!"". The genie, nodded and, once again, waved his hand, before turning to the second man. ""I would like for all the countries to be at peace. I do not wish for war, or not needed deaths. I want peace once again."" The second man said. The genie smiled and waved his hand. The world was at peace. For the last time, the genie turned to the third man. Through his right arm rotating forwards, left arm rotating backwards, and his childish giggling he said ""I want for my head to be endlessly rocking backwards and forwards!"". ""It is done"" the genie said, and the mans head began flopping backwards and forwards, leaving his body helpless trying to keep upright. The genie then turned to the three men and spoke again. ""Your wishes have been granted. Use them well."", and in a poof of smoke he was gone. The men settled down for the night, or at least tried to. The next day they set off, and once they had left the dark forest, they parted ways, happy with what they had done. 

A couple of years later, the three men decided to meet up at a coffee shop near to where they all first met. Once they had sat at a table the first man spoke saying ""I have had an amazing life! I can go on all the trips I want to and always be happy! My beautiful wife has given me two wonderful children, and I'm so happy that I got a chance like this!"". Then the second man spoke, ""I am happy as well! My mum no longer has dementia and remember who I am, and my wife was cured of cancer! No Wars have been fought since that day, and the world is a happier place!"". Finally the first two turned to the third man. His right arm, as always was rotating forwards, his left arm backwards. His head was rocking back and forth uncontrollably, and through tears he spoke. ""Guys, I've made a mistake."". ",Three men are walking through a forest.,1

The Manager says, ""Do you have any sales experience?""
The kid says ""Yeah. I was a vacuum salesman back in North Dakota .""
Well, the boss was unsure, but he liked the kid and figured he'd give him a shot, so he gave him the job. ""You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did.""
His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor. ""How many customers bought something from you today?""
The kid frowns and looks at the floor and mutters, ""One"".
The boss says ""Just one?!!? Our sales people average sales to 20 to 30 customers a day. That will have to change, and soon, if you'd like to continue your employment here. We have very strict standards for our sales force here in Florida . One sale a day might have been acceptable in North Dakota , but you're not on the farm anymore, son.""
The kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing him out on his first day. He asked (semi-sarcastically), ""So, how much was your one sale for?""
The kid looks up at his boss and says ""$101,237.65"".
The boss, astonished, says $101,237.65?!? What the heck did you sell?""
The kid says, ""Well, first, I sold him some new fish hooks. Then I sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft.

The driver vented his frustrations to the personnel manager. Then came the offer. ""If you try it just one more week, we'll change your route, give you a new and special bus, and since it is Friday, you can take off the last half of today. How about trying it, for just one more week?"" Feeling somewhat better about the situation, he agreed to try it for one more week. He arrived Monday for work, they gave him his new route, and he was escorted to his new bus. This bus was special in a strange sort of way. It had all these muppet characters all over it, like Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Cookie Monster, and Oscar the Grouch. Even so, he made an agreement, so he climbed into the driver seat, and off he went. At the 1st stop, 2 very heavy women entered the bus. Each introduced herself as ""Patty"". The driver told them to sit down, and they continued on. At the 2nd stop, a lady with a boy named Ross got on the boss. She went on and on and on and on about how great and special her little Ross was to her. The driver, a little impatient now, told them to find a seat, and they drove on. At the 3rd stop, a barefoot man named Lester Sheets walked in. The bus driver reminded him that company policy stated he must have shoes on to ride the bus. Lester begged and begged, saying that the bunions on his feet hurt a lot, and that he had no other way to get to where  he needed to go. The driver sighed, and agreed, and on they drove. 
...The driver look in his rear view and saw Lester picking his feet on the bus. 
...That was it, that was enough for him. He stopped the boss, 
made everyone leave, and returned to the bus lot. He went up to the personnel office, and told them, ""I really am quitting this time, and you can't make me come back."" They asked why. He replied, ""Because you gave me 2 obese patties, special Ross, Lester Sheets, pickin' his bunions on a Sesame Street bus!""","There was a certain bus driver who hated his job, and he figured he was through.

post,66paqv,2qh72,jokes,false,1492782621,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/66paqv/my_name_is_juan/,self.jokes,,"Juan was the custodian at a local grade school. Everyone loved Juan. He was so sweet and compassionate with the kids and did a wonderful job. One day the principal came up to Juan and said:

“You know Juan, you care about this school so much, maybe you should run for the board of education”

And Juan said:

“You know, I’ve never thought about that before, but why not?”

So Juan got up in front of the people in town and gave a speech:

“My name is Juan, I love my wife, I love my kids, and I love my dog”

Now politicians tend to be dishonest, but the people of this town knew Juan, and his statements hit home with them. Juan was elected by a landslide.

Juan worked tirelessy to clean up the schools, day and night, instituting new programs and fixing the curriculum. In a very short time graduation rates doubled and test scores shot up.

Then one day the governer died of a heart attack, and the people who Juan worked with closely on the board suggested Juan run.

Juan said:

“Well I’ve never thought about that before, but why not?”

Juan gave a speech to his state:

“My name is Juan, I love my wife, I love my kids and I love my dog”

The state went wild for such an honest and loveable man and he was elected.

As governer he made his home state a wonderful place to live, businesses boomed, communities were peaceful, crime was down and employment was up. Everyone loved Juan.

Then one day Juan was approached by a political group that endorses candidates for major offices. They asked Juan if he would like to run for president.

Juan said:

“Hmm, I’ve never thought about tbat before, but why not?”

Juan stood before the American people and said:

“My name is Juan, I love my wife, I love my kids, and I love my dog.”

The crowd goes ballistic, the American people lose their god damn minds. No candidate had ever been so universally loved like Juan.

Juan is elected President of the United States.

A few years go by. Juan keeps every one of his campaign promises. Unemployment is down to basically nothing, the economy is booming, the national debt is on its way to being paid off.

Then reality hits Juan.

He has no where to go from here.

Juan becomes depressed. He starts drinking heavily.

One day he is sitting in the Oval office drunk as a skunk when his wife comes in. She wants funding for a new project. Juan doesn’t listen. He pulls out a gun and shoots her. Then Juan’s children come into the oval office wanting the time and attention of their father. He shoots them a well. Lastly his dog comes trotting in looking for a walk or a treat but he shoots the dog as well.

This doesn’t sit well with the American people. He is arrested and put up for impeachment but is able to make bail and get out for a while before the trial, but he’s not allowed back in the white house and he doesn’t have a home.

Juan wandered the streets with a heavy heart when it started to rain. Juan finds a dumpster, lifts the lid and starts to climb in. A homeless man jumps up from inside the dumpster and pushes Juan away.

“This is my dumpster” said the homeless man.

“Please let me share it tonight” said Juan

“No . . . Wait a minute, I know you.” Said the homeless man, “you’re Juan! You’re that sick son of a bitch that killed his wife, and kids, and dog!”

“I know” said Juan “but please, I have nowhere to go”

The homeless man told Juan to go away, but Juan just begged and begged. Eventually the homeless man pulled out a golf gun and shot him.

What’s a golf gun?

Well I don’t know either, but it sure shot a hole in Juan.",My name is Juan,10

Since a Jewish wife is entitled to sexual pleasure, they decide to see a rabbi. The rabbi listens to their story, strokes his beard, and makes the following suggestion:

""Hire a strapping young man. While the two of you are making love, have the young man wave a towel over you. That should bring on an orgasm""

They go home and follow the rabbi's advice. They hire a young man and he waves a towel over them as they make love. It doesn't help, and she is still unsatisfied. Perplexed they go back to the rabbi.

""Okay."" Says the rabbi to the husband, ""let's try it reversed. Have the young man make love to your wife and you wave the towel over them."" Once again they follow the rabbi's advice.

The young man gets into bed with the wife, and the husband waves the towel. The young man gets to work with great enthusiasm and soon the wife has an enormous, room-shaking orgasm.

The husband smirks, looks at the young man and says to him. ""Shmuck, *that's* the way to wave a towel.""",Orgasm,149

The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. 

The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight’s armor. 

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. 

The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. 

And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",Knights and Squires,11

At any given time there are 900,000 people in hospitals.

Leaving 3,300,000 to do the work.

Now, there are 3,299,998 people in prisons.

That leaves just two people to do the work.

You and me.

Being an engineer, I saw that it was radiating huge amounts of energy at very high velocity in the form of incredibly high frequency transversely polarized Maxwellian electromagnetic waves. Normally, Maxwellian waves are invisible, but these waves, I could actually see! The frequency was so high, I am certain that the ionizing radiation could cause cancer, not to mention some very nasty radiation burns. However, it was there, and I wanted to put it to good use. So I purchased a condensed matter quantum physics band-gap based electromagnetic-wave-to-electricity transducer. I used the transduced fusion generated electricity to run my computer to type this post. It works really great...except at night. Or when it's cloudy.

[Edit -- Modified title, and inserted into body. Added a couple adjectives.]

post,66i9oq,2qh72,jokes,false,1492700733,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/66i9oq/the_chili_cookoff/,self.jokes,,"For those of you who have lived in New Mexico , you know how true this is.  They actually have a Chili Cook-off about the time Halloween comes around.  It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the Santa Fe  Plaza .  Judge #3 was an inexperienced Chile taster named Frank, who was visiting from  Springfield , IL . 

 Frank:  “Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off...  The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table, asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in.  I was assured by the other two judges (Native New Mexicans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy; and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted and became Judge #3.”

Here are the scorecard notes from the event:

 
CHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MONSTER CHILI 
Judge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato.  Amusing kick.  
Judge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor.  Very mild.  
Judge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy crap, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway.  Took me two beers to put the flames out.  I hope that's the worst one.  These New Mexicans are crazy....

 

CHILI # 2 - EL RANCHO'S AFTERBURNER CHILI 
Judge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork.  Slight jalapeno tang.  
Judge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.  
Judge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain.  I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver.  They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.

 

CHILI # 3 - ALFREDO'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI 
Judge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chili.  Great kick.  
Judge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers.  
Judge # 3 -- Call the EPA.  I've located a uranium spill.  My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano.  Everyone knows the routine by now.  Get me more beer before I ignite.  Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest.  I'm getting sh*t-faced from all of the beer.

 

CHILI # 4=2 0- BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC 
Judge # 1 -- Black bean chili with almost no spice.  Disappointing.  
Judge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans.  Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.  
Judge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it.  Is it possible to burn out taste buds?  Sally, the beer maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills.  This 300 lb woman is starting to look HOT ...  Just like this nuclear waste I'm eating!  Is chili an aphrodisiac?

 

CHILI # 5 - LISA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER 
Judge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili.  Jalapeno peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick.  Very impressive.  
Judge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato.  Must admit the jalapeno peppers make a strong statement.  
Judge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes.  I farted, and four people behind me needed paramedics.  The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage.  Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher.  I wonder if I'm burning my lips off..  It really ticks me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming.  Screw them.

 

CHILI # 6 - VARGA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY 
Judge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili.  Good balance of spices and peppers.  
Judge # 2 -- The best yet.  Aggressive use of peppers, onions, garlic.  Superb.  
Judge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames.  I crapped on myself when I farted, and I'm worried it will eat through the chair.  No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally.  Can't feel my lips anymore.  I need to wipe my butt with a snow cone.

 

CHILI # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI 
Judge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.  
Judge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment.  **I should take note that I am worried about Judge #3.  He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.  
Judge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing.  I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water.  My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth.  My pants are full of lava to match my shirt.  At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me.  I've decided to stop breathing.  It's too painful.  Screw it; I'm not getting any oxygen anyway.  If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.

 

CHILI # 8 - BIG TOM'S TOENAIL CURLING CHILI 
Judge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili.  Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.  
Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili.  Neither mild nor hot.  Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself.  Not sure if he's going to make it.  Poor fella, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?
Judge # 3 -- No report

After an examination, the doctor says, ""Well, I've got some good news and bad news. The good news is that we can fix. The bad news is that it's caused by your penis being too big. It's so big that it's pulling on your vocal chords. The only way to fix it is to surgically shorten your penis.""

""WELL, WHATEVER IT TAKES, DOC.""

The surgery goes well and the man's voice is normal. ""Thank you, doc,"" the man says as he leaves the hospital. He is happier than ever with his voice. 

About a month goes by when the man's wife says, ""Honey, it's just not the same. I miss the old you. I need you to get your full dick back or we will have to get a divorce.""

Distressed, the man decides to go back to the doctor so he can get his full dick back and save his marriage. 

""Doc,"" the man says, ""I'm sorry to have to come back. I've been so happy with my voice but my wife says she's going to divorce me if I don't get my full dick back. Please, I need you to reverse the surgery and put it back the way it was.""

The doctor looks at the man, clearly distraught and says with an unusually deep voice, ""WELL, I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS,  I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST OF YOUR PENIS...""",A man goes to the doctor,45

The barman gives him a drink.  The Texan looks at the drink and commenting on how small it is, he says that they are 10 times bigger in Texas.  In the interest of good relations, the barman gives him another 9 drinks free of charge.  Later the Texan comes up and orders a bag of peanuts.  When given the small bag, he again comments on the size of it, and the barman again gives him 9 free.  The Texan is pleased with the service he got and notes some positive feedback on a card as he leaves.

A few weeks later, in recognition of his good deeds, the barman is given a special award for his services to local tourism.  He is given a monetary prize.  With his prizemoney, he books a holiday in Texas.  He walks into the hotel bar and orders a drink.  To his surprise the barman puts up a huge drink in front of him.  He then orders some nuts and is given a huge packet.  Looking around at the massive bar and thinking about all he has seen he concludes that his own customer was right and that everything is bigger in Texas.  After eventually finishing his drink he staggers up to the bar and asks where the toilets are.  The barman points to a door and says that he should go through it and he'll find them near the end of the corridor.

'OK,' says the girl, 'I charge 20 an hour.'

'..ist goot, but I must varn you, I am a little kinky.'

'No problem,' she replies cautiously, 'I can do little kinky.'

So off they go to the girl's flat, where the German produces four large bedsprings and a duck caller.
'I vant zat you tie ze springs to each of your hans und knees.'
The girl finds this most odd, but complies, fastening the springs as he had said, to her hands and knees.
'Now you vill get on your hans und knees.'

She duly does this, balancing precariously on the springs.

'You vill please to blow zis kwacker as I make love to you.'

She finds it odd, but figures it's harmless (and the guy is paying.) She finds the sex is fantastic, as she is bounced all over the room by the energetic German, all the time honking on the duck caller.

The climax is the most sensational that she has ever experienced and it is several minutes before she has enough breath to say 'That was totally amazing, what do you call that position ?'

'Ah,' says the German 'dat is de Four-sprung Duck technique'",A German guy approaches a lady of the night.,4

As he is being escorted by the warden and his guards past a hallway of rooms, he notices that each and every patient behind the doors is just sitting on their beds with their arms and fists pointed forwarded, revolving like they're revving up a motorcyle and shouting ""VROOM VROOM VROOM!""

As he approaches the very last room, he asks the warden why didn't they let him see one of the dozens of patients they passed by. The warden simply says, ""This one's the only guy who'll actually **talk** to you.""

The student enters, and sees the patient lying back and reading a book. When he inquires why he's not ""VROOMing"" like everyone else in the hallway, the guy tells him that while he does need help, he still retains his sanity. Intrigued, the student interviews and eventually becomes very fascinated by the patient's story, like how he was abused by his stepmother and how he survived juvy etc.

After recording and taking notes, the student gets up in a hurry in order to quickly get back to his office to begin transcribing the audio and include it in his research. Seeing the rush, the patient asks, ""why the hurry?""
