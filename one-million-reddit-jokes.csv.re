post,5a9y7r,2qh72,jokes,false,1477881323,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5a9y7r/purple_curtains/,self.jokes,,"A little boy is at school one day and starts to daydream during his teacher's lecture. He is startled out of his daydream when the teacher's ruler slaps his desk.

""Why aren't you paying attention?"" she asks him.

The boy blushes and says, ""I'm sorry, I guess I was daydreaming.""

""Oh? And what were you daydreaming about?""

""Purple curtains?""

The teacher's mouth drops open and she's speechless for several seconds before she yells, ""Go to the principal's office! You should be ashamed!""

So he gets up and walks to the principal's office, and when he's sitting in the office the principal says, ""so why are you here?""

""I was daydreaming in class and my teacher kicked me out of the classroom.""

""That's not good. What was so important that you couldn't pay attention? What were you daydreaming about?""

The boy sighs, ""purple curtains.""

The principal stands up from his chair so quickly that it topples backward. ""Get out of here!"" he yells, ""I have half a mind to expell you!""

The boy runs out of the office and the school and walks home. When he gets home his mother is in the driveway washing the car and she asks, ""Why are you home so early?""

""Well,"" he says, ""I was daydreaming in class so my teacher kicked me out of the classroom, and then the principal kicked me out of the school!""

""Goodness! What were you daydreaming about?""

""I was just daydreaming about purple curtains!""

His mother smacks him across the face. ""Get out!"" she shouts. ""You're not welcome in my home anymore!""

The boy is too shocked to cry, so he walks away. He isn't sure where to go, but he remembers learning that police are friends, so he goes to the local police station and asks to speak to someone. The police chief sits him down and asks him what's wrong.

""I was daydreaming in class and so my teacher kicked me out of the classroom, then the principal kicked me out of the school, and when I told my mom what I was daydreaming about she kicked me out of my house!""

""What *were* you daydreaming about?""

""Purple curtains!""

Without saying anything, the police chief cuffs the boy and takes him to city hall to see the mayor. The mayor is confused and asks the chief what's going on.

""Tell him,"" the police chief says to the boy.

""Um, I was daydreaming in class and I got kicked out of my classroom, then I got kicked out of my school, then I got kicked out of my house, then when I told the police what was wrong they brought me here!""

The mayor looks at the police chief and asks, ""What on earth was he daydreaming about?""

""Purple curtains,"" the police chief whispers.

The mayor puts his face in his hands for several seconds before he looks up and asks the chief to remove the boy's handcuffs. When the boy is cuffless, the mayor looks him in the eyes and says, ""You're going to walk out of this office, out of this building, down the street, and when you reach the end of town you're going to keep walking. I'm giving you the chance to leave now because I don't want a public embarrassment on this town, but if I ever see you within city limits again I won't hesitate to have you locked up for the rest of your life.""

So the boy does what he's told and walks out of the mayor's office, out of the city hall, and down the street until he reaches the edge of town. He then begins walking down a gravel road until he reaches an intersection and sees a hobo walking along the other road.

""Hey kid!"" The hobo says in greeting, ""what's got you way out here all by yourself?""

The boy tells his story, explains how he was only daydreaming in class and how everyone hates him for it.

""You weren't daydreaming about purple curtains, were ya?"" asks the hobo.

""How did you know?""

""I was in a similar position once. Why did you think I had to become a hobo?""

The boy says, ""I don't understand what I did wrong.""

""Listen, kid, I can't do anything to help you get your life back on track, but I know of a place that can explain the situation better than I can."" The hobo takes a piece of scrap paper out of his pocket and a pen out of his bindle and writes down an address. ""Go east here and you'll come to another town, don't talk to anyone until you get to this address.""

The boy thanks the hobo and heads down the road. He avoids everyone in the next town and after a little time wandering the town he finds that he's right across the street from the house he needs to go to to get his answers.

The boy steps into the street and is hit by a truck.

Moral of the story? Look both ways before you cross the street.",Purple Curtains,0

He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favour of it. The doctor set the pain transfer dial to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before.

But as the labour progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and bump it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. 

The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%.

The husband continued to feel quite well. Since it was obviously helping out his wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. 

The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.

She and her husband were ecstatic. 

When they got home, the mailman was lying dead on their porch.

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

She'd even killed her own father this way.

The Queen was desperate to remove this terrible curse and thus announced a challenge to the entire land: Whoever managed to find some sort of object that would not melt in her own hands and use that object to cover her entire hand as a form of protection would receive a grand reward. They would earn half the entire kingdom's treasury while suitable males could marry her.

Many came and failed horribly. Some of these things included steel gauntlets, diamond blocks, rare artefacts from the whole world and even a block of strange material provided by a wizard who said it could withstand being thrown into a volcano.

One day, a strange blinding light appeared in the throne room, where the princess and queen were. Whn the light died down, a strange-looking man in extremely simple clothes appeared. The guards were about to arrest him, but the queen gave them orders not to. She had hopes this was the person who could neutralise the curse.

""Who are you?"" asked the queen.

""I heard your request from the other end of the earth, Your Majesty. I don't care about your rewards, just let me show you this.""

The man took out a even stranger pair of rainbow-coloured gloves. It appeared to be made of many small beads all joined together somehow.

""Please put it on, princess.""

The princess stepped forward nervously as always and reached out her palms towards the man, who then dropped the gloves on her.

One...

Two...

Three...

It did not melt.

The queen was absolutely delighted (and so were the guards) to see this success, but curious on how this was achieved.

""Pardon me, but what is the secret behind these gloves? What are they made of?""

""Your Majesty, these gloves are made of this.""

He pulls out a brown packet of the materials used to make the gloves.

""I call it M&amp;M's. They melt in your mouth, but not your hand!""",The Princess with the cursed hand,380

The second guy, realising the stranger was delusional, was about to move away when the man threw himself over the edge. 
Shocked, the second guy ran to the railing and saw the man plummet to the ground, only to rebound up and land safely back on the observation deck.
""Incredible! I've never seen anything like it! Is it safe?"" The astonished man enquires.
""Completely."" The stranger replies, ""I helped design it. You should try it, it'll be quite the tale to tell your friends'!""
So the second man climbs the railing, takes a deep breath, leaps from the edge, falls a hundred stories and....splat. He becomes pavement pizza.

He is on the second hole when he notices a frog sitting next to the green. He thinks nothing of it and is about to shoot when he hears, 'Ribbit, 9 Iron.' 
The man looks around and doesn't see anyone. 

Again, he hears, 'Ribbit, 9 Iron.' 

He looks at the frog and decides to prove the frog wrong, puts the club away, and grabs a 9 iron. Boom! He hits it 10 inches from the cup. He is shocked. He says to the frog, 'Wow that's amazing. You must be a lucky frog, eh?"" 
The frog replies,  'Ribbit, Lucky frog.' 

The man decides to take the frog with him to the next hole. 
'What do you think frog?' 
'Ribbit, 3 wood.' 

The guy takes out a 3 wood and, boom! Hole in one. The man is befuddled and doesn't know what to say. By the end of the day, the man golfed the best round of golf in his life and asks the frog, 
'OK where to next?' 

The frog replies,  
'Ribbit ... Las Vegas.'

They go to Las Vegas and the guy says, 'OK frog, now what?' 

The frog says,  'Ribbit, Roulette.' Upon approaching the roulette table, the man asks, 'What do you think I should bet?' The frog replies,  'Ribbit, $3,000 ... black 6.' 

Now, this is a million-to-one shot to win, but after the golf game, the man figures what the heck. 
Boom! Tons of cash comes sliding back across the table. 
The man takes his winnings and buys the best room in the hotel.He sits the frog down and says, 'Frog, I don't know how to repay you. You've won me all this money and I am forever grateful.' 

The frog replies,  'Ribbit, Kiss Me.' 

The man figures, why not, since after all the frog did for him, he deserves it. With a kiss, the frog turns into a gorgeous 18-year-old girl. 'And that, your honor, is how that girl ended up in my room, so help me God ... or my name is not William Jefferson Clinton.'",LUCKY FROG,13

""Oh, don't worry dear, just practice on a ketchup bottle!"" Advises the stylist. The wife does just that.

He decides to go look around in that shop and spots an old mirror. Looking into it, he exclaims, ""Well I'll be damned! It's a picture of me pappy!"" He buys the mirror immediately and starts heading back up to his home.

On the way, he remembers that his wife always hated his father and figures it'd be best if he hid the mirror in his work shed. Every morning for the next few days he gets up early and sneaks off to admire the ""portrait"". 

The wife starts getting suspicious of his behavior, as it's not like him to be getting up and sneaking around like that, and she begins to wonder if he's hiding evidence of an affair. 

One morning, while the old hillbilly is out working on his land, the wife sneaks over to the work shed and spots something unusual hidden under a tarp in the corner.

She lifts the cover, looks into the mirror and screams, ""So that's the ugly old bitch he's been runnin' around with!?""

The others in the car also found this curious and so we agreed that I should begin to accelerate and see how many Centuries there were. Amazingly, after we passed the first few there were even more.

The mechanic said we had a small leak in our oil tank and we'd need to replace both the tank and the oil. We all chipped in some cash, but found we didn't have enough to both buy the new tank and fill it.

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

She fainted.",How to wear a condom?,96

He recently decided to build a new pool for his house. Of course, being a Texan it couldn't be just any pool. He decided to build the biggest pool of anyone he knew. I don't know exactly how big it was, but it had to be at least a couple hundred yards long.

The things, my uncle's also got a bit of an eccentric streak to him. I don't know if it was the money, or Texas, or just something about him, but the end result was that he decided to add some excitement to the pool. So he purchased some dangerous animals. Eels, Sharks, Gators, you name it.

Then, once he gets all that done, he decides he needs to show it off. So he invites all his friends and family to come down and take a look at his brand new pool. Once he has everyone there and gathered around the pool, he starts talking:

""Friends, Family, I've got a proposition for you. As you all know, I've built the finest pool around, but a pool's no good if no one swims in it. So, the first person to swim the length of this here pool will get one of three rewards:

""1. A million dollars
""2. Half my land
""or 3. My daughter's hand in marriage""

Well, no sooner does my Uncle finish saying this, there's a splash at one end of the pool. Everyone looks, and there's a young man, probably early 20's bobbing around in the shallows. Well he gets himself together pretty quickly, and he starts swimming. It's a hard fought swim, too. I don't know if I ever seen one man go through so much. Finally, though, beaten, battered, and bruised he makes it to the other end of the pool and climbs out. My uncle goes up to him and says:

""Son, I gotta admit, I didn't think anyone was gonna be able to do this. That's a damn fine thing you done. So what do you want? The million dollars?""

""No, sir""

""Well, is it half my land?""

""No, sir""

""Ahaaa, you want my daughter's hand in marriage?""

""Uh, no sir. No.""

""Huh. Well, that's all I was offering, but I tell you what, if you could have anything in the world, what would it be?""

""Sir, if I could have anything in the world, I'd kill to have the name of the guy who pushed me in back there.""",I have an uncle in Texas,22

He is picked up at the airport by a professional driver with a nice Bmw M5. Usually it's a limousine but lately pope enjoys more like sports cars.  He looks at the beautiful car and says to the driver, ''You know brother, I hardly ever get to drive. Would you mind?'' 
The driver is confused and hesistant and says, ''I'm really sorry Pope, but I don't think I'm supposed to do that.'' 
"" I have clear orders to transport you safe""
But the pope persists, ''Kid, i do understund that, but i really would like to drive besides who do you think gave the orders for you to show up here today??'' Pope with a serious voice.
The driver then thinks that he really cannot get in trouble, i mean it's Pope. When i don't let him drive this might as well be by last day of work or he thinks. 
So the pope takes the wheel  everything is smooth. Pope tells the driver to tune in some music as they drive towards the highway just one intersection ahead with a red light. Pope then says quietly ""oh my god how long i wanted to do that"" ""Whats that?"" driver asks as he did not hear what pope sayd. Pope says nothing. 
They stop at the red light and then out the blue when green light hits pope takes off like a race driver -1st gear 5000rpm-2nd gear 6000rpm-3rd 7000rpm-engine roaring madly then forht and fifth gear as he hits the gas and goes over 100 mph  still in a 45 zone.
Driver is shocked and at first he could not get a word out to say anything as he was worried to look at the road. 
Finally driver is able to speak and he almost screams at pope to stop the car ""Oh relax kiddo"" says pope as they take off into highway where pope then really puts the car into test and within seconds they hit 150mph. Pope has a big smile as driver near him is almost crying. With all the thoughts that what could happen as he remembers the contract he signed before coming to pick up Pope. *An absolute safety was required* and if anything happens with Pope he was guaranteed to go away for life.
A policeman notices speeding car and takes off to stop it. Pope and a driver notice red flashing lights catching up in rear mirror. Driver then again almost screams that this is police after us and you must stop now! Pope looks not to be bothered and continues. Cop car now gets really close and over the loud speakers gives instructions to pull over. Still nothing. Then again from loud speakers cop commands to pull over or shots will be fired. Driver is now crying as he thinks that hes life is over. As pope sees him crying he then start to slowly break and pulls over. 
 The cop walks up and asks the pope to roll down the window. Startled and confused, the young officer asks the pope to wait a minute and he runs back to the car.  
He and radios the chief. 
Cop: ''Chief, I have a serious problem.'' 
Chief: ''What sort of problem?'' 
Cop: ''Well, you see, I pulled over this guy for driving way over the speed limit but it's someone really important.'' 
Chief: ''Important like the mayor?'' 
Cop: ''No, no, much more important than that, I think i fucked up sir.'' 
Chief: ''Important like the governor?'' 
Cop: ''Wayyyyyy more important than that sir.'' 
Chief: ''Like the president?'' 
Cop: ''More more more sir. I believe im in so much trouble, pleaee chief you have to help me""
Chief: ''Who's more important than the president?"" chief then angry and confused at the same time.
Cop: ''I don't know chief, but he's got the pope DRIVING for him!''",close to Dave's joke with a Pope,13

The waitress brings the food and is once again stunned as the man eats everything on his plate. She asks if they want dessert. The guy says ""I'll have chocolate cake and apple pie with a big bowl of ice cream."" And the ostrich says ""Me too!""

The man, again, cleans his plate. The waitress can't believe what she is seeing.

She brings the man the check. The man pulls out his wallet, and without even looking at the check or his wallet, pulls out exactly as much cash as he needs to pay the bill, plus a healthy 20% tip.

Finally the waitress can't stay quiet any longer. ""Excuse me sir.... I just have to say, this is been the most unusual meal that I've ever seen anyone have here.""

""Oh yeah,"" says the man. ""I guess it might seem pretty strange.""

""Strange?"" says the waitress, ""That was a huge meal, and you ate it all! But you're so fit! And then you paid exactly what you needed to for the meal without even having to count it or even know how much it was! And, you have a talking ostrich! What in the world is going on?""

The man nods his head. ""Well, a few weeks ago I was in an antique store and I found this old lamp. I rubbed it, and a genie appeared and told me I could have three wishes. So for the first wish, I wished that I could eat anything I want and always maintain a great body.""

""Wow, what a great wish!"" she said.

""Then for my second wish, I wished that I would always have enough money in my wallet to pay for anything I would possibly want.""

""My goodness!"", she said. ""That's so smart! If you had wished for a million dollars, or ten million dollars, you might eventually run out of money, but with that wish you'll never run out!""

There's a long pause as she stares at the man.

Finally she says, ""But why do you have a talking ostrich?""

The man sighs. "" I told the genie I wanted a chick with long legs who would agree with everything I said.""",A guy walks into a diner with an ostrich.,127

Man: Well uh you don't have any ears sir.


The CEO got livid and was yelling and cursing him forcing the man to leave. The man sat in the waiting room outside of the CEO's office thinking to himself what went wrong, he later saw another person being interviewed. 


The CEO asked the same question and the person also gave the same answer, the same aftermath. Later, another person was about to walk in and the man stopped him and said ""hey don't mention anything about his ears, he's very sensitive about them."". The person thanked him and walked in.

He asked for it once more while we were having lunch, and when I responded negatively again, he took his plate and ran into my treehouse. His parents make me go check on him.

Little did he know, you were able to remove the treehouse ladder, and since I was 12 at the time, I removed them and went to go get icecream in the house. I'm forced to ask him if he wants some, but when I leave the house, he's there and he thinks he's controlling me because I came to see him twice already, so he tells me to run around like a chicken.

A girl raises her hand and says,

""I think George Washington was the greatest man that ever lived because he is the Father of our country."" The teacher replies, ""Well...that's a good answer, but that's not the answer I am looking for.""

Another young student raises his hand and says,


""I think Abraham Lincoln was the greatest man that lived because he freed the slaves and helped end the civil war.""


""Well, that's another good answer, but that is not the one I was looking for.""

Then the Gujju boy raises his hand and says, ""I think Jesus Christ was the greatest man that ever lived."" The teacher's mouth drops open in astonishment. ""Yes!"", she says, that's the answer I was looking for.""

They are told that all three of them will die before the day is out. Their bones will be shaped into tools and weapons, their teeth made into necklaces, their skin sewn together to make canoes, and certain more intimate regions of their body will be dried, crushed up, and used in magical potions and poultices. And of course, what's left will get eaten.


However, tradition demands that each individual select the method by which they will die. In this way, the spirit will leave the body peacefully and not linger to cause mischief. 


The Frenchman is the first to be given this decision. He thinks for a long time, stalling, hoping that maybe he will be able to think of a way out of this mess. But the cannibals grow impatient and tell him that if he does not choose soon, they will just start eating him alive. Mortified by this, the Frenchman immediately exclaims, ""Sword! I... I wish to die by the sword. My father died by the sword, his father died by the sword, and now I will die by the sword."" The cannibals go to the hut in which they were keeping the men's belongings and bring the Frenchman his sword. He raises it high above his head and shouts, ""*Viva la France!*"" and slits his throat. A fountain of hot red blood immediately begins pouring from the wound. He collapses and, after a minute of drowning on his own blood, goes limp. Two of the cannibals drag his body off to be broken down into its constituent parts.


The cannibals look to the Englishman and, seeing him marinated in his French friend's *au jus*, begin licking their lips. The Englishman for his own part, sensing the cannibals might not wait as long to let him make a decision, and being rather uncomfortable as he is drenched to the bone in his friend's blood, arrives at a hasty decision. ""Well, I would much rather a more dignified death than all that. Could I die by gunshot, perhaps, is that a bother?"" The cannibals go and retrieve his gun, and, after awkwardly bumbling around in his anxiety, manages to get the thing loaded. ""Well, this is it I suppose. *God Save the Queen!*"" The Englishman brings the gun to his temple and pulls the trigger. 


Huge chunks of brain and skull are sent flying all over the American, who has been standing motionless during this whole ordeal, his squinting eyes locked on the chief. From his expression, you would not quite be able to tell if he had just stubbed his toe or if there were some terrible smell nearby. Before even being asked he mutters, ""Bring. me. a. fork."" The cannibals look confusedly at each other, but decide that if this is how his spirit has decided to leave him, then that is the way it must be. They go and bring the American a fork. He raises the fork above his head and with a cry of, ""*'Murica!*"" he begins stabbing himself repeatedly with it. This goes on for several minutes. And then an hour. And then more hours. By this time the sun is beginning to set. The other two men have been completely deconstructed. And the cannibals, despite their appetites, are beginning to become a little sick by the display. Loose folds of skin and muscle are flapping violently around as the American continues to stab himself repeatedly, never breaking tempo, and never breaking eye contact with the chief. Suddenly, he coughs a huge puddle of blood and collapses. As the few cannibals who hadn't broken away to be sick walk up to collect his mangled corpse, they hear him whisper, ""*Try making your goddam canoes out of that, you commie sons of bitches!*""

To test the theory, 100 men were fed 6 pints of beer each within a one hour period. It was then observed that 100% of the men exhibited the following behaviors: gained weight, talked excessively without making sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed to think rationally, argued over nothing, had to sit down while urinating and refused to apologize when obviously wrong.


No further testing was considered necessary.",Scientists for Health UK confirms that beer contains female hormones,5

'Very good! Who said 'Government of the People, by

more about our history than you do.'

'Who said that?' she demanded. Chandrasekhar put his

gonna puke.'

Chandrasekhar jumps out of his chair waving his hand and
shouts to the teacher, 'Bill Clinton, to Monica

Over the years, less and less people were donating to the monastery and the friars that lived there started to fret about lack of funds. The friars sat night after night, brainstorming into the wee hours of the morning. Finally, they decided that in order to raise money they would start selling flowers. News of this plan reached the local florist, but he paid it no mind.

About a month after the friars started selling flowers, the florist noticed a decrease in sales. People preferred giving their business to these men of god over him, despite owning the only florist shop in town for years. Even his tried and true customers were taking their patronage to the friars! Something needed to be done. He went over to the friars' shop and asked nicely that they choose a different business venture. They kindly refused. So the florist went back the next day. Same answer. After one last failed attempt at convincing the friars to change their minds, the florist knew he needed to resort to other measures.

After searching around, the florist was able to find a man with a reputation. His name was Hugh and he was the biggest, meanest son of a bitch for miles around. The florist met with Hugh and laid out the job: he was to destroy the friars' flower shop and put an end to the competition without hurting the friars themselves. Hugh accepted the job.

The next day Hugh stormed into the friars' meager flower shop. He destroyed bouquets, broke pots and spilled their fertilizer on the floor. He marched up to the head friar and told him he would never sell flowers in this town again. The friars took the hint and packed up their remaining goods, hoping to find a source of fundraising elsewhere.

What is the moral of this story?

post,59tdpv,2qh72,jokes,false,1477643203,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/59tdpv/the_fly_at_the_lake/,self.jokes,,"There was once a fly buzzing around a lake.

""If I come down three more inches,"" he said buzzing around sporadically, ""I can finally get me a drink of water.""

Just beneath the surface was a fish watching the fly buzz around.

""If that fly comes down three more inches,"" he said with one eye looking up, ""I can leap from the water and have me a tasty snack.""

Wading in the lake nearby was a bear watching the fish watch the fly.

""If that fly comes down three more inches,"" said the bear smacking his lips, ""that fish is going to leap up to catch the fly and **I** will have a tasty meal.""

On the shore line near the lake was a hunter watching the bear watch the fish watch the fly.

""If that fly comes down three more inches,"" said the hunter as he loaded a bullet into his gun, ""that fish is going to jump up to eat the fly, and that bear is going to swipe at the fish and **I** will have a new fancy rug in my cabin.""

Behind the hunter was a tiny field mouse watching the hunter watch the bear watch the fish watch the fly.

""If that fly comes down three more inches,"" the mouse said as he cleaned his dirty paws, ""That fish is going to leap from the water, the bear will lunge at the fish and the hunter's gun will knock that tasty sandwich from his pocket and **I** will have a meal to bring back to my starving little mice.""

Sitting in the bushes was a bobcat watching the mouse watch the hunter watch the bear watch the fish watch the fly.

""If that fly comes down three more inches,"" she said as she inched closer and closer, ""the fish will spring from the lake, the bear will paw at the airborne fish, the hunter's gun will fire as his sandwich falls from his pocket making the mouse leap onto it and **I** will finally be able to eat.""

Without fail everything happens.

The fly swoops down to drink some water, the fish jumped from the lake, the bear swiped at the fish, the hunter shot the bear, the sandwich fell from his pocket, the mouse leaped onto it and the bobcat sprung from the bushes but tripped and fell into the water.

What's the moral of the story you ask?

Well, if a fly comes down three inches there is going to be a wet pussy.",The Fly at the Lake,10

post,59s6pq,2qh72,jokes,false,1477622463,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/59s6pq/the_tale_of_quinn/,self.jokes,,"There once was a man with the very unique name of Quinn Zition. His name being rare is important for this tale, but for now it's irrelevant, so let's move on.

Quinn grew up in a very small, heavily conservative town smack dab in the middle of the Bible Belt. Now, the problem is that Quinn was a in-the-closet gay, which is look down on greatly by his family and peers. Quinn was in the closet for 5 years, terrified of coming out for fear of being disowned and looked down by his town. But Quinn refused to change, and often visited gay bars far from out of his area. He even had relationships, but they never lasted. Quinn always cut them off for fear of his secret coming to light.

But then he met him...

About a month ago, Quinn visited one of his favorite spots for hookups. He liked this particular place because it was very heavy on privacy. This is where Quinn met the man of his dreams, a solid 10/10 Spanish guy, who was also still in the closet for fear of being casted away from those who love him, just like Quinn. They began to date, and Quinn gets comfortable with him. They both decide to take the relationship to the next level.

But that's when Quinn makes his mistake.

Quinn got lazy, and decided to meet his secret lover at a hotel in his own town. He was thinking with the wrong head, and was blinded by love. The day comes, and they meet at the hotel. This is when Quinn makes his second mistake. He checks into the room using his real, very unique name. Quinn also failed to remember that a good family friend worked at this hotel. So Quinn and his Spanish lover get down to business, and Quinn decides to bottom.

Then, out of nowhere, the door flings open with no warning, the good family friend standing in awe at what she sees! Quinn soon realizes his mistake. She saw his name on the sign in list, and decided to pop in to say hi. But to her surprise, she instead witnessed him taking a Spanish sausage!

Quinn knows he is doomed.

Word spreads fast in a small town with little going on. Everyone is shocked. No one would ever expect this. Quinn has no stereotypical gay traits. He played football in high school. He worked on cars. Even his closer friends and family are crushed.

The news is so shocking that it even makes the front page of the local newspaper. Quinn, devastated, with nowhere to turn, decides to read the article to see what it says about him. He puts his money in the machine, opens the hatch, grabs a newspaper, and looks at the headline, which reads:

""Nobody expects the Spanish in Quinn Zition""
