The guys decide to walk over to the farm to see if there is anyone who can help. A nice middle aged man greets them at the porch, offers them a tow with the tractor and takes a look at the car. 

"" Now I reckon it will be a while before this car is running again"" the farmer says, ""Now you boys are welcome to stay the night here under one condition, don't touch my daughter, don't speak to her, don't look at her, got it? ""

The 3 nod in compliance and get washed up for dinner. Afterward they all head to bed for the long day tomorrow. Sometime during the night one of the guys wakes up to use the bathroom and on his way back to the bedroom he hears a ""pssst"" coming past one of the rooms. He peers in and sees the farmers daughter on the bed, naked, and man she is a BABE! Blonde hair blue eyes, big boobs the whole nine yards. They have wild sex and when they're done he runs back to the spare room and wakes his friends to tell them what happened. The other two follow suite and one after another, sneak into the farmers daughters room and bang.

The 3 guys wake up to a shotgun being cocked and the farmer standing over them pointing the barrell in their faces. ""I know you 3 sons of bitches slept with my daughter"" The farmer drags them out in their boxers to the middle of his crops where they are all sitting on their knees, sobbing and pleadings for their life. 
""You three, go out there in my fields, 'N bring back ten of whater fruit or vegetable you find and bring it back here.""

The 3 of them run off and are gone for a few minutes. 
The first guy finally gets back and he has 10 apples.
The farner says, ""Now put all 10 if those apples up yer arse, If you make a sound, show any pain, or even make a different face, i'll shoot you dead. If you get all ten up with no reaction, you're free to go""
The guy gets 4 in before he goes ""ow"" BAM dead.
The second guy comes back and he has strawberries. 
The farmsr repeats the rules and ge starts to put the strawberries in his ass.
He gets to 9 and just before he gets the last one up he drops to the ground rolling with laughter. Kicking and screaming, red in the face. The farmer is really confused, baffled, scratches his head but  nonetheless, BAM! 

So the two of them are in the after life, the first guy asks,"" What happened man? One more and you were home free! Why did you start laughing what the fuck happened?""
Still laughing he catches his breath for a moment and says, ""I saw Dave coming with pineapples""

Quickly realizing my husband would probably wake up, I cuckooed another 9 times. I was really proud of myself for coming up with such a quick-witted solution (even when totally smashed), in order to escape a possible conflict with him. The next morning my husband asked me what time I got in, and I told him midnight. He didn’t seem disturbed at all. (Whew! Got away with that one!).

Then he said, “We need a new cuckoo clock.” When I asked him why, he said, “Well, last night our clock cuckooed 3 times, then said, “Oh, crap,” cuckooed 4 more times, cleared its throat, cuckooed another 3 times, giggled, cuckooed twice more, and then tripped over the cat and farted.”",The other night I was invited out for a night with “the girls.”,181

John had heard through the grapevine that the men of his town would soon be called upon to fight a battle in a neighboring state.

As a retired military strategist, he couldn't help but feel that they didn't have the numbers to stand a chance against their adversary. He told the general of his feelings, who laughed and refused to acknowledge John's military expertise. So John refused to cast a new clapper for the bell. 

As a result, the soldiers couldn't be alerted quickly enough. They had to be rounded up by word of mouth which caused massive delays.

By the time they arrived their foe had moved on, but judging by size of the camp they left behind, they were clearly outnumbered by at least 10 to 1. 

It would have been a complete massacre if they had arrived on time. John's actions saved the lives of humdreds of men, and although it was an act of insubordination, his efforts were eventually recognized.

He was awarded the no bell piece prize.

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. 

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. 

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. 

He made it out, but a single person died. 

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. 

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. 

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. 

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. 

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. 

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. 

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. 

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. 

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. 

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. 

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. 

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. 

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. 

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" 

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. 

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. 

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living...,2807

I'm the head of the family, so you can call me the President.

We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you the People.
The nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class.
And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. 
Now think about that and see if it makes sense.""

So Little Johnny goes off to bed thinking about what Dad said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that his brother has a poopy diaper.

So Little Johnny goes to his parent's room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed.

The next morning, Little Johnny says to his father, ""Dad, I think I understand what politics is.""

The father says, ""Good, son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.""

So she takes him to her house and the priest asks her son to go outside for a minute. Then, he turns to the mother and says "" now we shall find out what kind of future he will have""
The priest then takes out four items; a dollar coin, a playboy,  a bottle of jack Daniels with a shot glass, and a bible. He then places them on a nearby dresser and tells the mother to hide in the bathroom. 
Once in there, the woman asks ""why are we hiding and what was with those four items?"" The priest then says ""The four items are there to test the boy. If he takes the dollar, then he will be a successful business man but betray all his friends and colleagues just to make a buck. If He takes the playboy, then he will be a womanizer and never show an ounce of respect for women. If he takes the whisky, then he will be an alcoholic and find solace only in the bottom of a bottle. Finally, if he takes the Bible, he will be a man of god and act on behalf of the church."" 
As the pastor finished his explanation, the son walked in, looking for the two of them. He sees the four items on the dresser, looks around, then stares at the items while his mother and pastor watch in anticipation. After a couple more moments, the boy moves towards the dresser and makes his choice.
First he grabs the dollar coin and puts it in his pocket, then he pours a shot and drinks it, finally he takes the playboy, puts it in the Bible, and walks out of the room to find his mom and the pastor. 
The pastor is stunned and speechless at what he just saw. Then his mother exclaims ""OH MY LORD, he's going to be a politician!!!"" ",A mother is concerned about her sons future,29

One day they sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight. They would have five years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and whichever side's dog won would be entitled to dominate the world.

The Soviets found the biggest, meanest Doberman and Rottweiler bitches in Russia and bred them with the biggest, meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from each litter, removed his siblings, which gave him all the milk. 

After five years' continuous breeding, they came up with the biggest meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars five inches thick and nobody could get near it.

When the day came for the dog fight, the Americans showed up with a strange animal. It was a nine foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for the Americans because they knew there was no way that this dog could possibly last 10 seconds with the Soviet dog.

When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of it's cage and slowly waddled over towards the Soviet dog. The Soviet dog snarled and leaped out of it's cage and charged the American dachshund. But, when it got close enough, the Dachshund opened it's mouth and consumed the Soviet dog in one bite.

There was nothing left at all of the Soviet dog.

The Soviets came up to the Americans shaking their heads in disbelief. ""We don't understand how this could have happened. We had our best people working for five years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves.""

""That's nothing,"" an American replied. ""Do you know how much plastic surgery it takes to make an alligator look like a Dachshund?""",The USA and USSR decide to end the cold war with a dogfight,24

There were also trees on the left, and bunkers in the middle. Mandela used his driver and shot it 250 meters straight down the middle of the fairway, hopping over all the bunkers.

""Excellent shot, but watch this!""

Kimler pulled out his 3 wood and set the tee in the ground before firmly placing the ball on the tee. Then the ball fell off the tee so he placed it back on the tee. He took a swing, a practice swing. Then after much deliberation, he finally hit the ball. The ball swung around every bunker and every tree in the most convoluted path. It zigzagged, it went left, it went right, it zipped and zopped and it finally bopped a squirrel and slowed down, right next to Mandela's ball.

Then they started walking, but a dues ex acceleraretur instantly brought them to their balls. Mandela's ball was on the left and slightly behind, so he hit first. It went down right to the green. It rolled and rolled. The green was a LR double breaker, so the ball first started rolling left. It looked like it could roll left all the way off to the bunker and into trouble. Then the ball started rolling right, as if it could roll all the way right off of the green and into another bunker. The ball finally came to rest in a bunker on the green.

""My turn!"" exclaimed Kimler. Kimler pulled out a wedge and took a practice swing. Then he took out his other wedge, which was also a wedge by the way. With this wedge, he took only 1 practice swing. Then he took out a 3rd wedge, a sand wedge. He took 2 practice swings with this wedge before laying the club on the ground. Then he pulled out a 3 iron, which is not a wedge if you must know. With the 3 iron he took 3 practice swings, one for each oxidation state of...you guessed it - zinc! Each of his 2 putters were made out of zinc. Then he was about to reach for his 5 iron, before Mandela said ""Hurry up and shoot the damn ball already! It's taking you longer to smack a Titlest than it did to serve my jail sentence!"" So Kimler hit it on the green.

""It's about time"" proclaimed Mandela who pulled out his wedge, and then pulled out his phone to speak to the manager about the bunker that was sitting on the green where it wasn't supposed to be. Mandela then started eating his sandwedge. He took out his sandwich and gave the ball a hard smack and it rolled right to the edge of the hole. The ball was tapped in for a delicious 4.

Kimler took out his zinc-bohrium alloy putter, which he had been using impeccably well so far, for a total of 0\0 excellent shots. He tapped the ball ever so slightly and then furiously whacked it over the green and into the hole, through the bunker we go. Kimler also recorded a 4 with his lucky 2 putt.

Mandela exclaimed, ""Well, we both got a 4 on the first hole!""

Kimler: ""Yes, we both start off with +0, no birdies no bogies.""

Now that's what I call **a par, tied**",Nelson Mandela was playing golf with Gobrevich Kimler.,2

Paddy, not wanting to pass up this unique opportunity, obviously did not have any whips on hand, but in a flash of inspiration, he opens the window, snaps the antenna off his van and proceeds to whip Colleen until they both collapse in ecstasy. 

About a week later, Colleen notices that the marks left by the whipping are starting to fester a bit so she goes to the doctor. The doctor takes one look at the wounds and asks, ''Did you get these marks having sex?'' 

Colleen, a little embarrassed that she has slept with Paddy [let alone that she allowed the kinky boy to whip her] eventually admits that, yes, she did.

The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy prosperous people. The second kingdom is more humble, but it has its fair share of wealth and power too. The third kingdom is struggling, poor and barely has an army.

The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as its a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armor and each with their personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armour and a dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime with his own personal squire.

The night before the big battle, the nights in the first kingdom drink and make merry partying into the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off but still have their own supply of grog and drink late into the knight.

In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.

The next morning the knights in the first two kingdoms are hung over and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight, the battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing-the squire from the third kingdom.

This goes to show that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of squires of the other two sides.",3 kingdoms battle over a lake,17

And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.
For example… One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed.

Well, the passion started to heat up, but then she said ""I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.""

I said ""WHAT??!! What was that?!""

So she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...""You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.""

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, ""Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?""

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.

Let me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, ""That's fine, honey.""

She appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, ""I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.""

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No honey, I don't feel like it.""

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, ""WHAT?""

I then said ""Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.
You're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.""

And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?""

&gt; Holy crap, no woman can take all of this!

The alien seems not to bother with her reaction, and proceeds:

&gt; Oh, you like it small?

Then he twists his left ear until his cock shrinks down to 2 inches. 

The woman chuckles timidly, and says:

&gt; Well, this time you went far too small!

In no time, the ET guy twists his right ear and his schlong grows again to the 6 inch mark. 

""That's fine, the way I like!"", exclaims the woman in excitement. They lie on the bed and proceed to enjoy theirselves.

In the following morning, the human couple start discussing their experience. The husband asks:

&gt; How was your night with that alien guy, honey?

The wife is enthusiastic:

&gt; Well, it takes some time to get used to this big eyes and the grey skin, but overall that was great! What about you?

The husband looks a little confused and replies:

He had finally been granted R&amp;R and was on a train bound for London. The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat.

The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog. The war weary soldier asked, “Please, ma’am, may I sit in that seat?”

The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, “You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can’t you see my Little Fifi is using that seat?”

The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.

Again he asked, “Please, lady. May I sit there? I’m very tired.”

The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, “You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!”

The soldier didn’t say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.

The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, “You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road.

“And now, Sir, you’ve thrown the wrong bitch out the window.”",(Long) Old anecdote about an American on a train.,841

Finally, the door to the bar opens, and the drunk is back. He looks a fright. His parka is ripped, one of his arms is dangling at a crazy angle, and he's got blood all over his face.

He takes his retirement and moves out to the country, and immediately goes to a local market in order to purchase animals to start his farm with.

He sees a stand with hens. He thinks, ""Well, wouldn't be a bad idea to get a hen, as they lay eggs."" 

""How much for that hen?""

""Oh, you mean this pullet?""

""Pullet?""

""That's what we call them.""

""I'll take it.""

He then thinks, ""It would be wise to get a rooster to breed with the hen. More chickens just means more eggs and meat!""

He sees a stand selling roosters and he says, ""Hey, I'd like to buy a rooster.""

""Oh, I got this cock for sale.""

""What's that?""

""Around these parts, we call 'em cocks. He should do you just fine.""

""I'll take it.""

So he walks away happy as can be, figuring if nothing else he can sell eggs or chickens. But as he walked past a donkey stand, he wonders if he could use the donkey to run a plow so he could produce vegetables.

He approaches the stand, and being short on cash at this point, he asks, ""What's the cheapest and most efficient donkey you've got?""

""Well, I got this ass. He's a bit fussy. Sometimes, he just won't go. But the trick is, just scratch him behind his left ear, and he starts going. He can pull like crazy, when in the mood.""

- You know, you should not really be telling political anecdotes just like that. KGB has every room wiretapped here.

The man thought for a while about what wish to ask for and said,

&gt;“You’re out of your mind. Think of all the technical problems! How would the supports ever reach the bottom of the Channel? Think of how much concrete needs to be poured...how much steel! No, I can’t offer you this wish. You have to think of something else.” 

The man said that he understood the impossibility of his wish and tried to come up with another good one. After much thought he said,

As is often the case in young adolescents. However, Jason was from a devoutly religious family, and as such it was very much a taboo subject. At first it was simply from the magazines his mom would leave around the house. After a while though, this became boring and Jason began to search somewhat earnestly for more inspiration (so to speak). Through a combination of internet research and recommendations from friends, Jason began to build up quite the database of pornographic material. After several months this took up a considerable amount of space on his computer’s hard drive. After a long day of arm wrestling the limbless snake while his parents were out, Jason closed his computer and left it on his bed, while he went to hang out with his friends for the afternoon. Shortly thereafter, his parents returned home.

“Jason is always playing on his computer, I really don’t think it’s good for him” Jason’s mother said.

“His school grades have definitely suffered since we bought him that” the father said in agreement.

“Perhaps we should confiscate it to teach him a lesson”.

“Agreed”. Going into Jason’s room, the father picks up the laptop and opens it, revealing Jason’s desktop. 

“What’s he doing on here anyway?” Clicking the start menu, the father finds himself confronted with the most recently used folders. Entering the first one, he is greeted by a smorgasbord of hardcore pornography.

“Honey, get in here, you really need to see this.”

“Jesus Christ, it’s Jason’s Porn”

They approached Jim and his rancher buddies and made it clear that they were looking for a fight. Jim and his buddies were tough  and grizzled from a lifetime of working outdoors on horseback. They stood up and approached the biker gang, everyone in the bar fell silent as they held their breath in anticipation.

post,5yfmza,2qh72,jokes,false,1489073005,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5yfmza/a_boy_genius_and_his_frog/,self.jokes,,"A man is driving his car down a country road. The weather is horrible outside. Suddenly he hears a loud pop and his car begins to veer wildly. He gets out of the car in the pouring rain to see that one of his wheels has popped off because all of the nuts holding it in have cracked and broken. He has a spare tire but no nuts to now hold that tire in place. 


As he tries to figure out what to do he hears a shout from a young boy sitting on a nearby wall. 


‘Hey Mister, Hey Mister, C’mere and I think I can help’


The man walks over and the boy tells him that if he takes one nut from each of his other tires it will hold the newest tire in place for 4 miles before the stress causes it to break. The nearest garage the boy tells him is three miles away so he will make it there. 


The man is flabbergasted and asks the young boy how he could know this.


The boy smiles and tells him ‘Ah geez Mister that’s nothing so it ain’t, basic engineering. I’m something of a boy genius, a prodigy you might say. This was simple but if you want to see my latest project I’d be happy to show you’ 


The weather has started to clear up so the man agrees and takes a seat on the wall next to the boy.


The boy pulls out a box with a frog in it and places the frog on the wall. He then takes out a measuring tape and brings the tape measure up to one foot.


‘Frog jump one foot high’ he says, and the frog jumps exactly one foot high. 


The boys brings the tape up to two feet ‘Frog jump two feet high’, and the frog jumps exactly two feet.


The boys brings the tape up to four feet ‘Frog jump four feet high’, and the frog jumps exactly four feet.


The man can’t believe it, ‘That’s incredible’ he exclaims, ‘how did you get him to do that?’


The young boy smiles, ‘Ah shucks Mister that ain’t nothing, that’s just training ain’t it, real easy to do, here is the project’ and suddenly he rips the legs off the frog!


He repeats his previous steps.


‘Frog jump one foot high’ he says, and the frog lays still, legless.
 

The boys brings the tape up to two feet ‘Frog jump two feet high’, and the yet again does not move.


The boys brings the tape up to four feet ‘Frog jump four feet high’, and the frog remains motionless.


The man is perplexed, ‘I don’t understand’ he says, ‘What are you trying to show’


‘Ah’, says the boy, ‘It’s all pretty complicated but my basic theory is that when you tear the legs off frogs they go deaf’

post,5ydc3k,2qh72,jokes,false,1489037840,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5ydc3k/childhood_friends/,self.jokes,,"So I grew up in a small town. Like really small, we're talking 900 people. So small that you know basically everyone in town. So when you grow up in a town that small, with a rather *aged* population, you don't really get to pick your friends. There were 6 boys my age in town, so those boys ended up being my friends, for better or for worse.

As time moved on, I grew wiser (as wise as  a teenager can get, I guess). I saw what was happening around me. Now, what I noticed about small town USA is that you really had to get out when you were young, or risk never really getting out at all. That's just the way that small town life can be, it sort of lulls you to sleep and suddenly you're 32 with 2 kids and never really get out of that style of living.

I have no qualms with that, but it just wasn't for me. I got out the first chance I got, and that chance was college. I now live a very happy, and very different life. I love the bustle of the city, the life and excitement it brings, but sometimes I look back at that small town life.

Not all of my friends made it out of that small farm town. In fact, only 1 other guy did.  I still keep in touch with them, but heading back home is a very rare occurrence for me; I work and go to school in the city now, not to mention the long trek back home. This results in my only heading home a couple, maybe three times a year.

I still love my friends, though, and I always make sure to get the gang back together whenever I come home. I mean, these guys basically were my childhood. All of our shared memories and experiences, the stories to recall and exploits to tell, we never have a dull moment when we get back together. 

And without fail, every single time, the first thing we do once we're all back together is all get in one of our cars. Make sure we lock all the doors, and plug in some of our best tunes. Finally we slide it into reverse, and boy does it bring me back.",Childhood Friends,0

I mean, this guy has slept with hundreds of different girls, even his teachers.  However, near his college career, he wants to settle down.  He asks one of his best friends, Tracy, if she would be willing to date him.  Of course, Tracy agreed.  Now, this girl wasn't amazingly attractive, like about a 7, but their personalities fit together perfectly.  Like, they could finish each other's sentences and were always enjoyable to talk to.  Everyone thought that Tracy and Luke were the perfect couple and stay together long past college.  However, Luke was the type of guy that was used to hooking up with multiple girls.  So, one the side, he began seeing a really attractive girl, a 9.  This girl, Bella, wasn't the smartest or the best fit for Luke, but he didn't care.  As things got more serious with Bella, he finally decided that he couldn't keep this from Tracy any longer.  He tells Tracy the truth, and she starts to freak out.  She starts stalking him and calling him in the middle of the night until Luke can't handle it any more.  He then takes advantage of an opportunity the college provided to study abroad.  He studies in Europe for a few months, calling Bella multiple times a day.  Once he feels like Tracy has cooled down, he boards a plane to go back to his college.  However, as he drives to his residence he discovers many policemen waiting for him.  Confused, as he has done nothing wrong, he pulls up and asks what's wrong.  The lead officer informs him the his girlfriend Bella has been murdered earlier that day, and as her boyfriend, Luke is the top suspect.  Luke cooperates and is led to an interrogation room.  He proves that he was on a plane during the time of the murder through his passport and is released.  As he left the complex, he turned around and asked how Bella died.  The officer shifted uneasily and asked if he really wants to know.  Luke responds that he does, and the officer tells him that the cause of death was cannibalism.  Luke then walks back to his car in utter disbelief.  Then it dawns on him:

 Then he saw an envelope propped up
prominently on the center of the pillow.

It was addressed ""Dad"".
With the worst premonition,
he opened the envelope and
read the letter with trembling hands :-

Dear dad,

 It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you,
but I'm leaving home.

I had to elope with my new girlfriend Rosy because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.

I've been finding real passion with Rosy and she is so nice to me.

I know when you meet her you'll like her too even with all her piercings and tattoos.

But it's not only the passion Dad,
She is pregnant and said that
She wants to have the kid and
that we can be very happy together.

Even though Rosy is much older than me (anyway, 42 isn't so old these days is it?),
and has no money, really these things shouldn't stand in the way of our relationship, don't you agree?

It's true she had other boyfriends as well but I know she'll be faithful to me in her own way.

She wants to have many more children with me and that's now one of my dreams too.

In the meantime,
we'll pray that science will find a
cure for AIDS so Rosy can get better;
She sure deserves it!!

Your loving son,
Rocky.

At the bottom of the page were the letters
""PTO""

Hands still trembling, his father turned the sheet,  and read:

PS: Dad, none of the above is true.
I'm over at the neighbor's house.

I just wanted to remind you that
there are worse things in life than
my report card that's in my desk center drawer.

Please sign it and call when it is safe for me to come home.

I love You!",Things can be worse !,30

But there was one glaring problem, all that came out of the mother was a giant ear. No torso. No legs. No arms. Just one giant ear the size of a baby.

The parents were no doubt confused and alarmed, but remained overwhelmed with unconditional love for the child they had been blessed with. Not surprisingly, the doctors and nurses quickly took the baby into a separate room to examine it for medical concerns, promising to allow the parents to hold their child for the first time as soon as possible.

Three hours later, the doctors and nurses returned to the parents with deep sadness on their faces. The head physician approached them and said slowly, ""I'm deeply sorry to give you this news...
