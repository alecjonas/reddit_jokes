The patron decides to call his bluff. ""Oh, bull shit. Here, I'll make you a bet. If your dog can talk I'll give you $1000 on the spot.""

So the dog's owner takes him up on it. He kneels down next to his dog and asks him a question. ""Georgie, tell me: who's the best baseball player of all time?""

The dog immediately barks ""Ruth! Ruth!""

The patron rolls his eyes. ""Fuck you and your bullshit. You're not getting a penny from me,"" he shouts, walking away.

The owner shrugs and looks down at his dog. The dog looks back up and says ""DiMaggio?""",A man walks into a bar with his dog,84

The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires.The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons.

The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner.

The third kingdom was very poor and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a noosed rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. 

The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. 

The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.

And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.","There were three kingdoms, each bordering on the same lake.",85

Curious, Mick and Paddy watched them for a while until the bloke dangling from his ankles began to scream ""Pull me up, pull me up quick!""

The other man instantly pulled his friend up, and in his hands was a massive fish, at least one and a half metres long!

Naturally, Mick turned to Paddy and exclaimed:

Mick: ""That's brilliant! Imagine the kind of money we'd get selling that!""

Paddy: ""Too right mate. Tell you what, let's go to the next bridge and do the same thing. Since you're stronger than me, you hang me over the edge, I'll stick my hands underwater and I'll tell you once I catch one!""



The pair nod to each other and march down to the next bridge a little ways away. As discussed, Mick hauls Paddy up and dangles him over the edge.

An hour passes.

Mick: ""Anything yet?""

Paddy: ""Nope, not yet.""


Another hour goes by.


Mick: ""What about now?""

Paddy: ""Still nothing.""


By this point, Mick's just about had it until suddenly Paddy starts screaming.


Paddy: ""Oi, pull me up! Pull me up quick!""


Excited, Mick hauls Paddy over the edge, glee in his eyes.


Mick: ""Well, did you get the fish?""

Paddy: ""Nah, there's a train coming.""",So the other day Mick and Paddy were walking down the road...,5

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

As per usual he goes to the post office to pick up his bag filled with mail and off he goes on that oh so familiar path one last time. 

As he stops by the first house, the entire family who lived there have gathered to wish him good luck with his future endeavours and they had a small gift prepared for him as a token of appreciation for his service. 
John was so happy and grateful about it, he couldn't imagine his last day on duty would be so wholesome. 

At the 2nd house he is again met by the entire family wishing him all the best and saying how they'll miss him, and they also had a present for him, he couldn't believe it, he was so happy about it.


As he approached the 3rd house he sees a gorgeous blonde standing on the porch wearing very provocative clothes, waving at him. As soon as he gets on the porch she grabs him by the hand and takes him up stairs in the bedroom where they have fantastic sex for nearly 3 hours! Once done she takes him down in the kitchen and fixes him up some breakfast. Bacon, eggs, toast and a cup of coffee. Still in disbelief about the unfolding situation John grabs the mug to take a sip of coffee, upon lifting the mug he sees a $5 bill tucked underneath. 


Even more confused he asks:


- Excuse me miss, the sex was fantastic and the breakfast looks delicious, but what is the $5 for ?


- I was talking to my husband about what to get you last night, and he said ""Oh fuck John, just give him a fiver"" and the breakfast was my idea.",It's John the mailman's last day on duty.,23

They knock at the rabbit's door, the rabbit opens and looks fearful as he recognizes the two. The bear asks: ""Do you have a pack of cigarettes?"" Of course, the rabbit does not have cigarettes and replies with a trembling voice: ""Erm... no?"" So the bear and the fox gloat and beat the shit out of the rabbit again.

On the third day, the bear suggests: ""Let's visit that lil' shithead again and ask for a drink. If he offers us one with ice, we won't touch him. If he offers it without ice, we will beat the shit out of him!"" They knock at the rabbit's door, the rabbit opens and sheer panic is in his eyes as he recognizes the two. The fox asks: ""Do you have a drink for us?"" Almost crying the rabbit replies: ""W..w..with or without ice?"" The fox and the bear look at each other and pause a moment.

When Officer Harris enquired around the area they were last seen, he was informed that they had taken refuge at a relative’s place in the hills, an Aunt Ann.


Upon approaching the house, the aunt ran out covered in blood and tried to attack Officer Harris, who promptly shot her dead.


Looking inside the house, he found evidence of cannibalism, the half-eaten bodies of two teenagers and a lot of religious items and texts.


He concluded that the aunt had eaten them because she believed that eaten human flesh would gain her favour with whatever deity she worshipped.


Returning to the station, he had his assistant attempt to reach the parents to inform them of the events that transpired and the motives behind them.


It turned out the only method of reaching them was by fax machine. When the assistant asked Officer Harris for the message to tell the parents, he simply replied:


“Fax ‘Ann ate your fucking kids for the love of God.’”",Officer Harris just closed up a gruesome case.,3

Now the man is smart, so he knows that the genie will twist his wishes around on him. He's also depressed, so he doesn't mind *too* much if things go really bad. So he decides to se if he can use some reverse psychology on the genie.

""I won't lie,"" the man said, ""I came to this beach to kill myself. I wish I was dead.""

""Your wish is my command,"" says the genie, and he snaps his fingers.

The next thing the man knows he is crossing the street and he gets hit by a bus. Everything goes black.

Later on he wakes up in the hospital. He is in bad shape. The nurse tells him he was dead for five minutes before the paramedics were able to restart his heart. The nurse ends up being assigned to the man for physical therapy. They fall in love and get married. The nurse's brother is a lawyer and takes the man's case, winning millions from the transit authority. He and his new bride buy a big house and fancy cars.

One day the man finds the lamp in his back yard. He rubs it and the genie emerges, telling him he has two more wishes. The man figures his plan is going pretty well, so he decides to try something similar.

""I wish that I were penniless.""

The genie snaps his fingers. The next thing the man knows he is walking out of a casino. He looks in his wallet and sees nothing but a two dollar bill. He goes to an ATM and sees that his accounts are all empty. He checks his email and sees that he borrowed against the equity in his cars and his house to finance his night of gambling. His credit cards are maxed out.  Without really thinking about it he walks into a convenience store and spends his last two dollars on the lottery. Calculating the odds of winning, he realizes that his present net worth is less than a penny.

That night the lottery draws winning numbers. The man wins a cool Billion dollars.

A few days later the man finds the lamp in a park. He rubs it and the genie tells him he has one more wish.

The man racks his brain. He tries to think of the most awful, horrific thing he can imagine. He puzzles over it for a long time when the answer occurs to him. He looks at the genie.

He also tells the guy that he must feed this porpoise baby seagulls to insure it's longevity.

So the guy builds a pool suitable for his porpoise and goes out to capture his first baby seagulls. 

After the porpoise arrives, everything goes great. The two bond quickly, the guy is happy as he's ever been, and has no worries about losing another pet. He even calls his therapist to thank him for the great advice.

It isn't too long, however, before he's having to go further and further out to find baby seagulls to feed the porpoise. They become nearly day long journeys.

One day, when he's going out farther than he's ever gone before, a lion escapes from the state zoo. Not a local zoo, but the state zoo that is close to his house.

The guy gets back to his house, baby seagulls bagged and slung across his shoulder only to find a freaking lion lying across the sidewalk going up to his door, sound asleep.

Not knowing what to do, but knowing that he's wickedly late on feeding time, he girds his loins and tries to quietly step across the lion. 

He gets one foot down when a cop car pulls up with it's sirens blaring and lights flashing. The cops jump out of the car, guns drawn, and immediately tell him to, ""FREEZE! You are crossing the state lion with underage gulls for immortal porpoises!""

At the age of 5, he had already mastered reading, and had grown bored of all the literature he could find, fiction or not. Oliver Tin took this boredom as an obligation to produce works of writing unmatched by everything before and anything to come. He wrote a tale of fiction over the course of a week, and within a year he was published and had won both the Pulitzer and Nobel Prizes.

Oliver couldn't help from feeling, however, that this is not what he wanted to do.

At the age of 10, he started to learn the piano. Within a month, he was playing pieces composed by the likes of Bach and Ticheli. Young Oliver Tin participated in competitions around the world showcasing his talent, and of course, he placed first in every competition.

Oliver couldn't help from feeling, however, that this is not what he wanted to do.

At the age of 15, he had developed an interest in the biological sciences, with a focus on the physiological processes. He enrolled in University in order to further supplement this interest, and within 2 years, Oliver Tin had learned everything he felt he needed to. In order to test himself, he took the UKCAT, and scored within the 99th percentile.

Oliver couldn't help from feeling, however, that this is not what he wanted to do.

At the age of 20, he felt that he had been too cautious in his life, and wanted to put himself in a less predictable environment. He decided to further develop his driving skills, learning everything to be a truly versatile driver. Oliver Tin spent hours driving to the country to distance himself from other drivers, and was able to make his way back without ever dropping below 100 kmh.

Oliver couldn't help from feeling, however, that this is not what he wanted to do.

At the age of 25, he realized that his horizons were not broad enough, and he started training himself to be in peak physical form. When not exercising, he devoted himself to understanding the history and sciences of the universe, and was able to make several observations that had never been made before. After being approached by the ESA, Oliver Tin spent 100 days in the ISS before returning to Earth. 

Oliver couldn't help from feeling, however, that this is not what he wanted to do.

At the age of 30, he started to feel tired, and felt that he should relax. He just stood around all day, changing his location so he wouldn't be bored by his relaxation. Eventually, Oliver Tin became such an accomplished stander that he was given a tall fuzzy hat and a fancy red coat. After several months The Queen herself commended Oliver Tin's efforts, both in standing and his other endeavours, and made him into a Knight of the Order of the British Empire.

At last, Oliver knew that this was what he wanted to do.

The waiter replied, ""Yes. We had an  efficiency expert here that determined that 17.8% of our diners knock  the spoon off the table. By carrying clean spoons with us, we save trips  to the kitchen.""  


The diner ate his meal. As he was paying the  waiter, he commented, ""Forgive the intrusion, but do you know that you  have a string hanging from your fly?"" The waiter replied, ""Yes, we all  do. That same efficiency expert determined that we spend 21.4% of our  time washing our hands after using the men's room. The other end of that  string is tied to my penis. When I need to go, I simply pull the string  to get my tool out of my pants, go, and then return to work. Having  never touched myself, there is no need to wash my hands. Saves a lot of  time.""  


""Wait a minute,"" said the diner, ""how do you get your  penis back in your pants?"" ""Well, I don't know about the other guys, but  I use the spoon.""

The husband gives it a try but with all the yelling, hectic drive and stress of the situation, he cannot get an erection. The doctor says, ""With both your permissions, I can perform the procedure.""

Fearing that the wasp can do damage in there, they both readily agree. The doctor pulls down his scrubs, smears himself with honey and gets instantly hard. He slowly inserts his honey covered penis a few inches into the wife's vagina. Withdraws an inch, slides back in a couple inches, withdraws a few inches. ""There he is... no, lost him... I think I got him. No, no. Lost him again...""

Over the next 20 minutes, the doctor's comments has turned into grunts and pants. He now has sweat dripping from his face, while pumping the wife viorously. The wife is moaning wildly, and has locked her legs around the doctors hips. The husband is on the edge of his seat and screams, ""Doctor, tell me what's happening!? What's going on in there!""

There once was a sculptor who made beautiful pieces of work. His specialty was beautiful women. He'd toil away for hours on end, immortalizing the prettiest women in plaster and granite. But one day, he realized that his work was no longer in demand. Distraught, he called over his closest friend, an Italian art critic, and asked their advice.

""Your-a works are phenomenal,"" he said, ""but it has-a nothing to set it apart. That is why your work is no longer in demand-a.""

The sculptor thought about this for days, weeks even. Finally, he decided that he'd sculpt the faces of beautiful women out of blocks of cheese. That's be what would set his work apart.

He wasted no time. He found the prettiest woman in the city and got to work. A few days later, he was done. He called his friend over to inspect the masterpiece. 

""Well?"" he asked. ""What do you think?""

His Italian friend looked over the cheese sculpture for several minutes. 

Finally, he shrugged. ""It's-a pretty gouda.""",You guys ever heard the one about the sculptor and his Italian friend?,6

Inside was something he was not expecting to see. He opened the door and saw the most extravagant party he had ever seen in his entire life. Even bigger than anything he has ever seen in any movie he's ever watched. There was an olympic sized indoor pool, a dj who was playing music by Earth, Wind, and Fire. And There was also a buffet with the most amazing looking food in the land to feed the umpteen hundred guests in the temple. He was greeted by a pujari, who had the widest smile and happiest demeanor. The American asked the pujari, ""What does this party have to do with the teachings of Hinduism?"" So the Hindu teacher said, ""Well, look at the pool, the depth represents eternity, which is what truth is. 
""Ah"" said the American.
""Do you hear the music being played by the DJ?"" Asked the pujari. ""We Hindus believe in being connected to nature, thus our choice of Earth, Wind, and Fire!""
The American makes another sound of agreement.
The teacher continues, ""That huge buffet obviously showcases our belief that our actions affect our karma. So we feed our hundreds of guests and we will be blessed with food for ourselves in the future! We won't ever be hungry!""  So the American says, ""Wow, this makes so much sense!"" The pujari informs his new guest that there will be more activities and such arriving at the temple very shortly. The American confused thinks to himself what else could this beautiful party need? So after a few hours of enjoying himself at the party, swimming, dancing, eating, and mingling with many of the guests he started to feel thirsty. He looked and he searched but could not find anything to drink. So he found his buddy, the good ol' pujari and said, ""I've been here for this long and have been searching high and low for a drink and if I don't see a punchline soon I'm going to be extremely frustrated!"" So the pujari looks at the man with a sly grin and says, ""Hindu time.""",An American man studying Himduism traveled to Nepal,24

And off in the bushes there was a hunter and they were looking at the bear looking at the fish looking at the fly and thought 'if that fly drops 2 inches the fish will jump up to get the fly the bear will get the fish and it will be distracted long enough for me to shoot the bear' and about 2 foot away from the hunter there was a mouse looking at the hunter looking at the bear looking at the fish looking at the fly and thought 'if that fly drops 2 inches the fish will jump up and get the fly and the bear will get the fish and the hunter will get the bear and I'll get the hunters cheese because he will be too focused on the bear' and off on the top of a hill there was a cat looking at the mouse looking at the hunter looking at the bear looking at the fish looking at the fly and thought 'if that fly drops two inches the fish will get the fly the bear will get the fish the hunter will get the bear the mouse will get the cheese and I'll get the mouse.

post,9sbac9,2qh72,jokes,false,1540801918,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9sbac9/a_sanguine_tale/,self.jokes,,"Jake and Ruth were blood analysts in a hospital. Given the proximity of the hospital to the highway, really gruesome motor accidents were quite common. So the hospital decided to house a huge supply of blood for emergencies, and these two were employed full time to analyse blood which they got, and discard unsuitable blood.

Put two young people in a room with a bunch of boring stuff, and eventually sparks fly. They started dating after a while, and they were one happy couple. Alas, not all good things last. Their relationship did go through a lot of strain due to a variety of reasons, and it culminated when Ruth caught Jake with an other girl in his apartment. This was the final straw, she thought. She walked right out of the door, without confrontation. She couldn’t bring herself to, for she wasn’t entirely innocent. She had come to Jake’s apartment to tell him that she was seeing someone else for the last few weeks and that she wanted to end things.

The next day at work, when Ruth walked in, she could see a huge bin with a biohazard sign between their two seats, filled with all the discarded blood packets. Jake was already there, slogging away, and he didn’t say a word of apology. ‘Perhaps he knew?’, Ruth thought. She couldn’t bring himself to confront him either, and her pride didn’t let her apologise.

Jake could see Ruth entering from the corner of his eye. He did not not want to acknowledge her presence. ‘At least, she could have broken up with me’, he pondered. As soon as he walked in that morning he hauled the biohazard bin and placed it between them, so that he could never see her face over the 4 foot tall bin when both of them were seated. Or did he want to hide his face in shame, because what he did was just as despicable? He did not know. And now his mind was clouded enough to make any attempt at rational thought futile.

Months passed like this. Both of them continued to work, and neither of them caught anything more than a glance of each other over the tall bin, where they were constantly discarding faulty blood samples. Neither of their ‘flings’ materialised into anything; as they still had feelings for each other. ‘If only we communicated’ Ruth thought as she was traveling to work one morning. Maybe we should try now? Maybe it isn’t too late? She was determined to try, as she was happiest when they were together. Just as she was outside the door of the lab, she took a deep breath (Jake being the more punctual one would definitely be there) and entered with trepidation.

She was however quite surprised to see the huge bin moved across the room, and Jake waiting for her in his chair. He had drawn her a chair as well. “I think we should talk”, he said. 

And they spoke their hearts out. They both spoke about what they wanted in the relationship, how each was not available enough for the other, how each hurt the other with their nonchalance, and how each expected something more. They spoke, and they spoke at length. 

At the end of few hours, they apologised and embraced. Still holding on, Ruth said, “Maybe go out for dinner tonight?”

“I’d love that”

And thus they began a new life with the promise of a new beginning. Will their story have a happily-ever-after? It does not matter. Because now, at least…they don’t have any bad blood between them.",A sanguine tale,121

Milk The only cow in a small town in Ireland stopped giving milk. The town folk found they could buy a cow in Scotland quite cheaply. They brought the cow from Scotland. It was wonderful, produced lots of milk every day and everyone was happy. They bought a bull to mate with the cow to get more cows, so they'd never have to worry about their milk supply again. They put the bull in the pasture with the cow but whenever the bull tried to mount the cow, the cow would move away. No matter what approach the bull tried, the cow would move away from the bull and he was never able to do the deed. 

The people were very upset and decided to go to the Vet, who was very wise, tell him what was happening and ask his advice. ""Whenever the bull tries to mount our cow, she moves away. If he approaches from the back, she moves forward. When he approaches her from the front, she backs off. If he attempts from the one side, she walks away to the other side."" The Vet rubbed his chin thoughtfully and pondered this before asking, ""Did you by chance, buy this cow in Scotland ?"" The people were dumbfounded, since no one had ever mentioned that they had brought the cow over from Scotland. ""You are truly a wise Vet,"" they said.

""How did you know we got the cow from Scotland ?

The Vet replied with a distant look in his eye: ""My wife is from Scotland.""

It is then, halfway through the drive, that he notices he's forgotten his wallet. He frantically searches his pockets, but all he finds is a 20 dollar bill.

He asks the taxi driver ""What's the fare to the airport?""
The driver looks back and goes ""50 dollars""
""I only have 20-"" the man says pleadingly ""-but I promise to pay you the rest as soon as I get my wallet back."" 
""Not a chance, it's 50 dollars, if you can't pay you can't ride."" the driver replies.
""I can give you my phone number!"" the man says back, growing increasingly desperate ""I can give you my home adress and full name! I just need to get to the airport!"" 
The driver looks back at the man, and without a word he grabs the 20 dollar bill out of the man's hand, and throws the door open, kicking him out and leaving him to walk the rest of the way in the pouring rain.

Some months later, the same man walking down the street looking for a taxi, when he notices a long row of them parked near the sidewalk, and at the very end is the man who kicked him out those months ago. The man walks up to the first cab and asks: 
""How much is it to the airport?"" 
The driver replies ""50 dollars sir."" 
The man then pulls out a 100 dollar bill and whispers ""I'll pay you double if we can stop halfway there and have some fun in the bushes..."" 
Instantly, the driver jerks the man away from his window with his arm, rolling it up and locking the doors as he stares back in disgust. The man then walks over to the second cab in line, and asks the driver: 
""How much is it to the airport?""
""Fifty bucks."" The driver replies.
The man then pulls out a 100 dollar bill, and repeats his offer, barely missing a punch to the face as the driver rolls up his window as well.
The man continues down the row of Taxis, until he ends up at the window of the man who had driven him earlier. He leans over and asks, once more. ""How much is to the airport?""
The driver looks over and says ""50 dollars, same as before.""

A man named Luigi sees a “Help Wanted” sign while walking in his city’s downtown area. He decided to approach the storefront and read the rest of the sign.

“Entry level job, no prior experience needed”

Luigi exclaims, “This is wonderful!” and walks inside for an interview. He approaches the front desk about the job opening and gets sent to the CEO’s office.

Luigi and the CEO shake hands, and Luigi is graciously welcomed into the office.

“Alright Luigi, this is an interview like no other,” says the CEO as he hands Luigi a piece of paper and a pencil. Luigi keeps a confident look on his face. “Now Luigi, I want you to represent the number 9 without using letters or numbers on this piece of paper.”

Luigi grabs the pencil, draws 3 trees on the paper, and sets the pencil back down.

The CEO is confused, laughs and says, “how does this represent 9?” And Luigi replies with, “Tree plus tree plus tree = 9.”

“Impressive!” Says the CEO with a chuckle. “Now I want you to represent the number 99, still without using letters or numbers.”

Luigi picks up the pencil again and just scribbles on each of the 3 trees.

The CEO says, “How in the world does this represent 99?”

Luigi tells the CEO, “Here we have dirty tree, a dirty tree, and a dirty tree. I’m pretty sure that equals 99.”

The CEO tells Luigi he’s quite clever. “This last one will stump you! No one has ever been able to complete this task. Now I want you to represent the number 100.”

Luigi grabs the pencil again and draws a small dot next to each tree, drops the pencil, and leans back in his chair, hands behind his head.

The CEO is confused as ever, and tells Luigi, “How could you think this completes the final task? I think I’ve finally stumped you Luigi.”

Luigi sits back up and points at the paper, “Boss, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’ve clearly drawn a dirty tree and a turd, a dirty tree and a turd, and a dirty tree and a turd. Now do I get the job or what?”",A man named Luigi sees a “Help Wanted” sign while walking in his city’s downtown area.,99

""Morning,"" the barman answers. ""I'd like to have three black coffees."" ""Three?"" ""Yeah. One for me, one for you, and one for that slutty wife of yours!"" The barman is taken aback, as he realizes he's never seen the man before. He's a little angry, but decides to let it go.

The following day the same man enters the bar again. ""Morning"" — ""Morning"". ""I'd like to have three black coffees: One for me, one for you, and one for your dick-riding cunt wife!"" An outburst of anger fills the barman's body, and just when he's about to react, he realizes that the man may simply be crazy. He's never seen him, after all, so either this guy's demented or this is all some kind of complex joke plotted against me, he figures. Better grin and bear it.

Another day goes by and the same man shows up once more. ""Morning,"" he grunts. ""Morning!"" says the barman, feeling what's coming. ""I'd like to have three black coffees. One for me, one for you, and one for that cock-sucking bitch you call your wife!"" The barman, despite knowing something along those lines would happen, just can't take it anymore: He jumps over the counter, grabs a chair, and smashes it right into the man's face. As the man is lying on the ground, the barman channels his rage through his fists and gets a couple clean shots on his jaw and nose. Eventually, the man regains consciousness and, dripping with blood, makes his way to the exit.

It's day four now and the barman is talking about what happened with a couple of friends at the bar, even bragging about his newly found fighting skills a bit. But while he's talking, a familiar figure walks into the bar. A moment of silence follows, then the man and the barman lock eyes. The man is obviously still recovering, with bruises and scars pretty much all over his face and body. He gets to the counter limping. ""Morning,"" he utters. ""Good morning,"" the barman says, with a voice that tries to make it sound as if nothing had happened. ""What can I do for you?"" ""I'd like to have two black coffees,"" the man says. The barman starts laughing, then turns to his friends and says ""Did you hear that? I'm not usually one for fighting, but it appears that in this case a lesson's been learned!"" — he then looks back at the man and asks: ""...and who are the two coffees for?""

A duck farmer had three boys. The family was real poor, so he sent the boys to town, each with their own duck to sell. As the boys came to the edge of town, the eldest said “I want to stop at this whore house and see if I can sell my duck.” He wanders on in and upon seeing one of the ladies politely asks “Ma’am, would you like to buy a duck?” She replies “I can only give you $5 for it.” Excited, he runs out to his awaiting brothers and exclaims “I got $5 for my duck!”

The second brother says “I want to see what I can get.” He runs into another lady and asks “Would you like to buy a duck?” “I can only give you $10 for it.” Off he goes shouting “I got $10!” so proud that he outdid his brother.

The youngest brother was kind of slow, so the guys didn’t expect much from him. He walks in shyly, seeing one of the girls inquires “La-la-lady, do you wanna buy a duck?” She smiled and said “I can’t afford to buy it, but I will fuck you for it.” They go off to do the dirty deed. As he is about to leave, he runs into a lady that already bought a duck. “Hey there, I don’t know what I am going to do with a duck. If you take it back, I will fuck you for it.” Off they go to do the dirty deed. He opens the door about to walk out and his duck escapes, runs into the road and is hit by a semi. The driver was so upset, he gave the boy $50. The youngster gets back to his brothers nonchalantly. “So, what did you get?” the both asked together.

“Well, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck and fifty bucks for a fucked up duck.” ",The Duck Farmer,17
