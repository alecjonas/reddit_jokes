The birth was a regular vaginal birth, and to the relief of everyone, it was much less complicated then the one in 1776. Anyways, now it was time to give name for the new born nation. The British Empire tired from the labour and delivery, decided to leave the naming responsibilities to the founding fathers. The 3 founding fathers each had a name they liked and quarrelled with each other for some time. Then they decided to use the same tactic they used in naming the older brother, USA. The three of them would each pick a letter from a hat and the 3 letters would become the name.

First founding fathers picks a letter from the hat, ""C, eh.""
Second goes, ""N, eh.""
And finally the third goes, ""D, eh.""",How Canada was named,33

A man walks Into a bar with a full-grown ostrich behind him. The waitress asks for their orders. The man says, “A hamburger, fries and a beer,” and turns to the ostrich, “What’s yours?”
“I’ll have the same,” says the ostrich.

A short time later the waitress returns with the order. “That will be $18.95 please,” and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment.

The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, “A hamburger, fries, and a beer.” The ostrich says, “I’ll have the same.”

Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. 

This becomes routine until, the two enter again.

“The usual?” asks the waitress. “No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and a shot of Tequila,” says the man. “Same,” says the ostrich.
Shortly the waitress brings the order and says, “That will be $20.” Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. 

The waitress can’t hold back her curiosity any longer. “Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?”

“Well,” says the man, “several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.”

Awesome says the waitress. “Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you’ll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!”

“That’s right. Whether it’s a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there,” says the man.

The waitress asks, “But, sir, what’s with the ostrich?”
The man sighs, pauses, and answers, “My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.”",A guy walks into a bar with an Ostrich,20101

A young woman who was several months pregnant boarded a bus. When she

noticed a young man smiling at her she began feeling humiliated on

account of her condition. She changed her seat and he seemed more amused. She

moved again and then on her fourth move he burst out laughing. She had

him arrested.

When the case came before the court this was the man's reply when asked 

why he acted in such a manner: ""When the lady boarded the bus I couldn't

help noticing she was pregnant. She sat under an advertisement which read

""Coming Soon: The Gold Dust Twins"", then she moved under one that read

""Sloans Liniments remove Swelling"". I was even more amused when she sat

under a shaving advertisement which read ""William Stick Did The Trick"".

Then I could not control myself any longer when on the fourth move she

So the first drunk says, ""Hey, I've got an idea - we put our money together and buy a hot dog.""

The second drunk, looking at him puzzled, says, ""What the hell? I don't want a hot dog; I want a goddamn drink!""

The first says, ""I know. We buy the hot dog, stick it down the front of my pants, go into a bar and order our drinks. When the bartender tells us the price, you drop to your knees and suck the hot dog like you're sucking my dick - and the bartender will throw us out and we won't have to pay for anything!""

The second drunk says, ""Well, it sounds like a good enough idea to me.""

So they buy the hot dog and the first drunk sticks it down his pants. They go into a bar, order two whiskeys, and when the bartender tells them the price, the second drunk drops to his knees and sucks on the hot dog. The bartender throws them out and tells them not to come back.

The drunks go on to hit 19 bars. Finally, the second drunk says, ""We've got to switch places 'cause my knees hurt from dropping to the floor.""

The first drunk says, ""You think that's bad? I lost the hot dog in the third bar!",One night two drunks were wandering the town trying to get drinks,97

The server now extremely angry takes him to the cops. The officer looks at him and says, ""son, those are really bad words to use and you need to be punished.""

Little Johnny looks up innocently and says, ""Bad words, I didn't say any bad words, all I said was please piss, which meant -please Put in Some Sugar and while leaving I said bye cunt, which meant Bye, C U Next Thursday""

Both the server and the police offer are embarrassed and say ok Little Johnny you can leave. While walking out the door, he looks back and says ""F-U-C-K-Y-O-U""

Fast forward to the wedding and they are the happiest people to ever exist. Mr Paul Yankee and Mrs Wendy Yankee decided to go to Jamaica for their honeymoon. As a surprise for his wife, he got a tattoo on his penis to demonstrate his undying love and loyalty for her. When it's erect, it says WENDY, and when flaccid it says WY, her initials.

Night time arrived on the first day, and as Paul disrobed, Wendy's jaw dropped. She loved the surprise so much and they had sex for three straight days, surviving on room service and bar snacks.

Finally they decided to hit the beaches. It was a really hot day and after enjoying the cool ocean water, they decided to sit at the bar under the straw hut.

They started to knock back a few Long Islands and other refreshing cocktails and they had a great time.

Good ol' Paul excused himself from the missus and decided to take a leak. The queue for the restroom by the bar was too long, so he ran further up and saw the Department of Tourism building.

 He was about to burst, and hopping side to side, he asked the receptionist where the restroom is. ""Take a left turn down there"" she barely said in her thick Jamaican accent before Paul jetted off and entered the restroom.

At the urinal, he noticed that this tall dark Jamaican man has on his penis, the letters WY tattooed. 

""How peculiar"", thought Paul.

Curiously, Paul told the gentleman that he is on his honeymoon and as a surprise for his newly wed wife, he had her name on his penis tattooed to show his undying love and eternal loyalty to her. Paul then asked him ""So do you also have a wife named Wendy?"".

The man replied,  ""No, I work in the Tourism department, so it says WELCOME TO JAMAICA, ENJOY OUR BEACHES AND HAVE A NICE DAY""","So there's this guy, let's call him Paul Yankee.",8

Wouldn't you know it, a door-to-door baby photographer came by half an hour later, hoping to make a sale. Mrs. Jacobs answered the door. 'Good morning, ma'am. You don't know me, but I've come to...' 'Oh yes, I know why you're here. Harry told me you'd be coming soon.' 'He did? But I...' 'Come right in! No use wasting time .' 'Very well, then.'

The photographer took out his briefcase and sat down. 'As you may already know, I've made a specialty of babies.' 'Good, I'm glad,' said Mrs. Jacobs. 'That's just what Harry and I were looking for.'

'I usually like to try two in the bathtub, one on the couch and perhaps a couple on the bed,' said the photographer. 'The living room floor is fun too...you can really spread out.' 'Bathtub? Living room floor? No wonder it never worked for Harry and me.' 'Well, ma'am, none of us can guarantee a perfect one every time, but if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven different angles, I think you'll be quite pleased with the results.'

'I certainly hope we can get this over with quickly,' Mrs. Jacobs gasped nervously. 'Ma'am, in my line of work a man must take his time. I'd like to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure.' 'Don't I know!' said Mrs. Jacobs.

The photographer pulled out a portfolio of his pictures. 'This one was done on top of a bus in downtown London,' he said, showing Mrs. Jacobs the picture. 'Oh my God!' exclaimed Mrs. Jacobs, tugging on her handkerchief.

'And these twins turned out exceptionally well when you consider the fact that their mother was so difficult to work with.' He showed Mrs. Jacobs another picture. 'She was difficult?' questioned Mrs. Jacobs. 'Extremely,' said the photographer. 'I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the job done right. People were crowding around, four and five deep, just to get a good look.' 'Four and five deep!' Mrs. Jacobs was amazed. 'Yes,' said the photographer. 'And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling. I could hardly concentrate. Then, it started getting dark and I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels started nibbling on my equipment. I just packed it all in.'

Mrs. Jacobs leaned forward. 'You mean the squirrels actually chewed on your, um...equipment?' 'Yes, ma'am. Thank God, no real damage was done.

Well, we'll get to work as soon as I set up my tripod.'

'Tripod? ' Mrs. Jacobs looked extremely worried now.

'Of course. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much to big for me to hold while I'm getting ready for action. Uh... ma'am???'","After Mrs. Jacobs found out her husband was sterile, the couple decided to hire a proxy father to start their family.",53

Immediately, Steve replies confidently, ""No way! We just created two jobs and $40,000 worth of GDP!""

A man suffered a serious heart attack while shopping in a store. The store clerk called 911 when they saw him collapse to the floor. The paramedics rushed the man to the nearest hospital where he had emergency open heart bypass surgery. He awakened from the surgery to find himself in the care of nuns at the Catholic Hospital. A nun was seated next to his bed holding a clipboard loaded with several forms, and a pen.

She asked him how he was going to pay for his treatment. `Do you have health insurance?` she asked.

He replied in a raspy voice, ""No health insurance.""

The nun asked, ""Do you have money in the bank?""

He replied, ""No money in the bank.""

""Do you have a relative who could help you with the payments?"" asked the irritated nun.

He said, ""I only have a spinster sister and she is a nun.""

The nun became agitated and announced loudly, ""Nuns are not spinsters! Nuns are married to God.""

The patient replied, ""Perfect. Send the bill to my brother-in-law.""",Send the Bill to my brother in law,5

On the first Friday the teacher asks: ""How many grains of sand are on the beach?"" needless to say, no one could answer.

The following Friday, the teacher asks the class: ""How many stars are in the sky?"" and again no one could answer. Frustrated little Johnny decides that the next Friday he would somehow answer the question and get a 3 day weekend.

So Thursday night Johnny takes 2 ping pong balls and paints them black. The next day he brings them to school in a paper bag. At the end of the day just when the teacher says, ""here's this week's question,"" Johnny empties the bag onto the floor sending the ping pong balls rolling to the front of the room. The entire class starts laughing.

The teacher says, ""Okay, who's the comedian with the black balls?""

Immediately, little Johnny stands up and says, ""Bill Cosby, see ya on Tuesday!""",Little Johnny,58

-WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING, MEHMET???
-Well hello sultan, I'm trying to fuck myself of course. But as you can see, it's not so easy.
-WHAT ON EARTH IS IT YOU'RE SAYING? WHY WOULD YOU DO SUCH A THING? 
-Well you see sultan, everyone I've fucked have become rich and famous, and here I am, still a merchant. I though it was time for me to live the good life. 
-ARE YOU INSANE? WHAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR SEXUAL ACT WILL LEAD TO FORTUNE?
-Dear sultan, for starters, I fucked all your 20 advisers only days before they became your advisers and now rich and famous. Just ask them if you dont believe me. 
Confused and baffled by this, the sultan goes back to his palace and gathered his advisers, and asked them if indeed what Mehmet told him was true. 
The advisers denied it at first, but when the sultan threatened them, they all admitted they had been properly fucked by Mehmet only days before they got rich and famous. 
The sultan felt sorry for Mehmet who is trying to fuck himself for richness, and demanded the advisers to share their wealth with Mehmet immediately. So they gathered 100 golden bricks and loaded them on a donkey which a servant was ordered to bring to Mehmet. 
The following day, Mehmet is still trying to fuck himself, almost able to enter himself when he sees a donkey approaching, filled with gold on its back. 
Jumping out of joy, Mehmet exclaimed ""I can't believe I got all of this gold from just the tip!","NSFW Mehmet and the sultan long (on mobile, sorry for formatting)",7

(Blaise) Pascal and (Pierre) Fermat were there; Blaise playing  the jester and making bets with passers-by about the craziest things  you could imagine, and Pierre taunting the English as usual. The  Descartes were renowned for these parties which usually went on well  into the night, and were especially famous for Madame Descartes’  elaborate dessert creations which were always immaculately presented  every hour exactly on the hour.

Midnight  came and went, and the remaining guests started to gather as Pierre and  Rene struck up a friendly debate about the nature of existence. A hungry Blaise casually wandered over towards Madame Descartes' famed croquembouche pastry, even as he remained engrossed in the  intellectual spectacle taking place before him. Rene caught a glimpse of  Blaise out of the corner of his eye. ""Quelle horreur!"" he thought to  himself; Blaise was about to grab a profiterole and disturb his wife's creation, unwittingly causing a minor scandal! As a  gracious host, he couldn’t interrupt his vigorous repartee with Pierre to shout out a warning to Blaise (thereby embarrassing both his  friends), so his mind furiously raced for an alternative. As Pierre kept  on talking, Rene surreptitiously grabbed Fermat's book from the table (A copy of Diophantus), tore out some paper from the generous margins, scribbled down a note, and hurriedly directed his servant to  pass it on to Pascal. Just as the profiterole was about to reach  Blaise’s lips, the servant arrived and handed him the crumpled piece of paper.

Blaise looked down upon the note; it simply read “I THINK THEY’RE FOR  1 AM!”",A Late Night Party,2

The ugly chav woman stopped swearing long enough to say, ""Don't be fucking stupid. Of course they aren't twins. The oldest one's 9, and the other one' s 7. Why the hell would you think they're twins? Are you blind, or just stupid?""
I replied, ""I'm neither blind nor stupid, Madam. I just couldn't believe someone fucked you twice. Have a good day and thank you for shopping at Asda.""

Their main gimmick was that they employed only the best 20 lawyers and for anonymity only referred to them by their number, 1 through 20. 

In the height of their reputation there was a massacre; 300 people dead by a fire in an apartment building. While normally considered an accident, it was found that all 18 exits of the building were simultaneously blocked so none of the tenants could escape. Standing trial for this horrendous crime were 18 young men, all teenagers. To again respect anonymity, the press didn’t release any of the accused individuals’ names and simply referred to them by number.

As this case was deemed “un-loseable” by the DA, 20 to Life was called in to help sentence these teenagers to the longest possible prison sentence. Without delay, Lawyer 13 was sent out to consult on the case.

After looking over the suspects, Lawyer 13 noticed something suspicious about of on the supposed criminals: Teenager 15 had lost both of his parents and his little brother in the fire. Thinking that there’s no way a teenager would murder his entire family, Lawyer 13 went to meet with Teenager 15 to get his side of the story before the trial. At this meeting, Teenager 15 broke down, saying that he was falsely accused of the crime along with two of his close friends: Teenagers 12 and 7. With alibis and witnesses to back up this claim, Lawyer 13 felt awful. How could he possibly be responsible for condemning three innocent boys to life in prison? 

Without a moment’s hesitation Lawyer 13 called the firm manager, Lawyer 1, and refused to prosecute the eighteen teenagers. Lawyer 1, furious, reprimanded Lawyer 13 for not upholding the firm’s reputation. After a long scolding, Lawyer 1 angrily asked Lawyer 13 why he would possibly throw the case.

With a shaky voice came the response of 13: “For Teen 15.”",There was once a reputable law firm,0

“Shit, is this the tip jar for today?”

The bartender, cleaning a glass, shakes his head before looking up at the man.

“No, that’s our prize money.”

“Prize money?” The man asked. “What competition did this bar compete in?”

The bartender shook his head and sighed, giving a monotone response. “No, that’s the prize money for anybody who’s able to complete the challenge we have set up in here. It’s been there for years, and nobody’s been able to complete it.”

The man, now with his interest piqued, asks the bartender, “Well lemme hear it. I bet whatever it is, if I’m leaving with a fat wallet it’ll be worth it.”

The bartender, gives the man a serious look in his eyes. “You sure about this?”

The man nodded. “I’m ready.”

The bartender then began explaining the challenge to the man. “There’s three parts to this challenge. Sitting on that ledge there is a bottle of Jack Daniels. First, you have to chug that, no pausing, no burping.”

The man, listening closely, gives the bartender a nod.

“Second,” the bartender continued, “There’s a rabid dog out back. You have to wrestle it and pin it within fifteen minutes. Naturally, this is where most people fail.”

The man, slightly nervous, nods yet again. “Go on.”

The bartender continued. “Lastly, there’s an Eskimo Woman upstairs. If you can get her to have sex with you, the money is yours.”

The man, now intent on getting the money, immediately runs over to the ledge, opening the bottle of Jack Daniels. He chugs it down as the rest of the bar silently watches, before slamming the empty bottle back down with watery eyes. The bartender points him to the back door, where he stumbles over to before heading out back.

Before long, the horrible sounds of the man yelling and groaning can be heard, only drowned out by the louder barks and growls of the rabid dog. The sounds go on for about ten minutes as the bar patrons and the bartender all watch the back door intently, prepared to dial 911 before everything in the back goes silent and the man stumbles back inside, his clothes torn, covered in blood and bruises. He looks at the bartender, and asks with slurred speech:

On his shoulder was the monkey, he went not far. 

Shooting pool all day long was what the man did,

The monkey watched as balls cross the table slid. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then in a flash the small monkey ran down,

Then he picked up the cue ball and swallowed it down. 

The bartender couldn’t believe his great fall,

No one would play pool if there wasn’t a ball. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Your monkey must leave!” The bartender shouted. 

But the man stayed calm while the bartender pouted. 

“Don’t worry good man.” Was the player’s remark. 

“I’ll get your ball back, and there won’t be a mark.”

&amp;#x200B;

The player then left while the bartender cried. 

Surely the ball was gone ‘till the monkey died.

Sadly, he went and closed the bar for the night. 

Tomorrow maybe, he’d find cocks for a fight. 

&amp;#x200B;

But when the morning sun came, so did the man,

And with him he brought a shiny ball in his hand. 

“Here is your ball, nice and clean.” He said proudly.

The bartender took, and looked at it fondly. 

&amp;#x200B;

“My friend, I am saved!” He shouted gleefully. 

Then he told the good player, “All your drinks are on me!”

The player sat down at the freshly cleaned bar,

The monkey watched peanuts in a small jar. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, in the blink of an eye, the monkey did rush

Down the man’s arm, to the jar, his hand he did thrust. 

Then removing a peanut, he looked at it closely,

Thrust it up his butt, pulled it out, and ate, mostly. 

&amp;#x200B;

The bartender, frightened by what he had seen,

Looked at the monkey and thought it a dream.

Then the monkey returned to his perch up above.

The bartender stared, he’d not even used a glove!

&amp;#x200B;

Then in a flash, our brave monkey did fly,

Back down the man’s arm to where the peanuts did lie.

Then repeating the process of peanut and butt,

The monkey was content to dine on the nut. 

&amp;#x200B;

This time the bartender could stand it no longer,

What was wrong with this dirty little monger? 

Finally, he worked up the courage to ask,

“Why is that monkey of your so damn crass?”

&amp;#x200B;

The pool shark just looked at his monkey and smiled,

He said, “I’m sorry, did that get you all riled?”

The bartender smiled, knowing that was the worst.

“Well, after that cue ball, he checks everything first.”

He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong.

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk. “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”",A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,581
