‘About 32,’ is the reply.’

‘Nope! I’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily.

While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.

He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is weak. Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra. Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

All passengers die except for Michael, Brad and Philip. They wash ashore on an unfamiliar island in the middle of the ocean. As they stand up and recover from the rough crash a 100 cannibals emerge from the bushes.

They capture the 3 friends and drag them to their camp in the middle of the island.

The chief of the cannibal tribe speaks to the 3 friends:

We intend to eat you. But if all 3 of you manage to accomplish a task we will set you free.

The first part of the task is: all 3 of you go into the bushes and find yourself 10 pieces of the same fruit, but every one of you must pick a different fruit.

The 3 friends rush into the bushes and Michael is the first to find a cherry three. He quickly gathers 10 cherries and returns to the chief.

The thief looks at Michael and his 10 cherries and tells him the second part of the task:

You must shove these 10 fruits into your bottom without crying or even showing a single teardrop.

Michael cannot believe what is being asked from him, but this seems his only chance of surviving so he starts to put the cherries in his butt. Michael goes through tremendous pain but he tries to hide any facial expression. As he reaches the 10th cherry he fights his tears but he manages to insert all the 10 cherries into his anal cavity.  
 The chief looks surprised and impressed at the same time and he tells Michael he is a free men.

Just as Michael finished the 10th cherry Brad arrived with 10 peaches. The chief turns to Brad and tells him:

You must shove these 10 fruits into your bottom without crying or even showing a single teardrop.

Brad is stunned and looks at his 10 peaches. Michael turns to Brad and yells at him: Come on Brad! You can do this!

Brad lowers his pants and starts inserting the peaches while he tries not to think of the pain this causes. With each peach his butt starts to hurt more but he continues to insert the peaches. When reaches the 7th peach his butt is bleeding and he wonders if he’s going to get in another 3 peaches. He inserts another peach and is in true agony. He fights his tears as he inserts the 9th peach. And finally as his shaking hands insert the 10th peach he bursts out in laughter.

He told the farmer, ""I need to inspect your farm for illegally grown drugs.""

The farmer said, ""Okay, but don't go in that field over there..."", as he pointed out the location.

The drugs squad officer verbally exploded saying, ""Mister, I have the authority of the Government with me.""

Reaching into his rear trouser pocket, he removed his badge and proudly displayed it to the farmer. 

""See this badge?! This badge means I am allowed to go wherever I wish. On any land!! No questions asked or answers given!! Have I made myself clear. Do you understand?""

The old farmer nodded politely, apologized, and went about his chores.

A short time later, the old farmer heard loud screams, looked up, and saw the drugs squad officer running for his life, being chased by the farmer's big ferocious-looking bull.

With every step the bull was gaining ground on the officer, and it seemed likely that he'd sure enough get gored before he reached safety. The officer was clearly terrified.

The old farmer threw down his tools, ran to the fence and shouted at the top of his lungs, 
“Your badge!! Show him your BADGE!!”",A drugs squad officer stopped at a farm,41

He sees him step on the spiders, and runs behind him until he gets near the X under the water. He swims behind the drunk and sees him get eaten by piranhas. So when all the drunks guts and blood come out of him, he rushes through and gets to the X, with a breathing hole within it.

post,bh1raa,2qh72,jokes,false,1556149662,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bh1raa/onions/,self.jokes,,"There's an onion, and he's studying law at a prestigious college. He's in his third year, and after a particularly tough day, he gets an invite from one of his onion-friends to a party they're having that evening. Being tired and weary, the lawyer-onion isn't sure whether to go, but decides he needs cheering up. So he dresses smartly, puts on his favorite aftershave, and heads over to his friend's.
He gets to the party to find it quite a packed affair, and heads over to the bar - fighting through crowds of reveller-onions - to get a drink. As he gets to the bar, he notices in one corner a slightly out-of-place female onion. She looks a bit sad, and being the compassionate onion that he is, he heads over to talk to her.

This is quickly affirmed as a good move, as they hit it off immediately; she was abandoned by her friends shortly after arriving, and had been minding her own business ever since, but over a night of drinks and talking, they quickly fall into an infatuation and soon end up spending an oniony night of passion together.

When they awake in the morning, they don't find it awkward, and a steady relationship between the two is struck. This lasts a good while, having its ups and downs like any college relationship, but eventually the day comes when they both graduate. The two couldn't be happier! They both get jobs close to one another and move into a flat together.

One day, the partner-onion is anxiously awaiting the lawyer-onion at home. She's been ill all day, and checking has confirmed her suspicions. She tearfully - and joyfully - breaks the news to the lawyer-onion; they're going to have a tiny baby-onion together. A shallot, if you will. A few days later, this prompts the lawyer-onion to propose to his heretofore girlfriend-onion. They are soon wed, having a fantastic wedding-day, and husband and wife-onions are on top of the world.

The day comes of the birth, and no complications - a tiny, healthy baby onion is born to two proud parents. Seeing this little bundle of oniony love in their arms causes them to fall deeper in love than ever.

Over the next few years, husband-and-wife-onions' lives are fantastic. He's prospering at work, she's really enjoying taking some time to raise the baby-onion, and over time the baby-onion grows into a hale and hearty toddler-onion, who then becomes a child-onion.

One day, the idyll of the onions' lives is shattered when tragedy strikes.

The lawyer-onion (now a partner-onion in a prestigious law firm due to chance and hard work) is at work, and mother-onion is washing dishes and watching her child play in the yard. She glances away to take another plate, and turns her vision back to the yard just in time to see her child wander into the adjacent road and get hit by a massive freight lorry.

She screams, runs out, and calls an ambulance.
The ambulance comes and rushes the frail child-onion to the Onion Hospital. Being in such a critical condition, he is rushed straight into the operating theatre, and mummy-and-daddy onion can do little but wait outside the theatre hoping for some news.
After an agonising five-hour wait, the weary-looking doctor-onion emerges in surgical garb, ready to impart news.

""So, Mr and Mrs Onion. Would you like the good news or the bad news?""

The couple ponder it for a moment, and then decide: ""The good news, please.""

The doctor-onion regards them briefly, and then says, ""Well, the good news is we've managed to stabilise your child. The bad news is... he's going to be a vegetable for the rest of his life.""",Onions,140

Not because it is complicated, but because it goes like this:

**""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""**



And then approximately an hour an a half later it goes like this:



**""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""**


And then there's a round of applause and everyone take their bows and and exits stage right. The conductor had a great idea though, and the basses practiced this in the weeks leading up to the concert. The would play their first note 

**""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""**


And then they would quietly lay down their basses on provided carpets, and exit the stage - waiting patiently to return an hour and a half later to play their final note:


**""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""**




The night of the concert arrives, everyone is dressed to the nines (as is appropriate of course). The basses are shined and everyone is relaxed and ready. The conducter taps on his conducter's stand to get attention, raises his hands and with a gallant downstroke the basses play the ever living shit out of their note


**""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""**



And then quietly lay down their instruments on the provided carpets and step behind the curtain. This is where things go awry,

""Hey guys,"" says the lead bass ""I have a great idea. There's a bar across the street and we have at least an hour and a half before we play our next note. Let's slip across and have a couple pints!""


Everyone thinks this is a fantastic idea, so the entire section hops along to the bar and downs a couple pints. One of the second basses after a while gets a little conserned and asks the lead bass if it was time to go back. ""No, we got time. See, I tied a string to the last page of the conductors score attached to a transciever. When he gets to that section I'll get a buzz on my phone and we can head back.""


Everyone thinks that this is brilliant so they knock back a few more pints before suddenly the lead bass stands up and announces it's time to go. They bounce back across the street, through the musicians entrance, and up to the curtain to peek through and sure enough, they're right on time. So they slip through, pick up their instruments and look up at the conductor and...he is angry.

Super angry. 


Ready to bust a blood vessel angry.



But you would be too wouldn't you? It was the bottom of the ninth, the basses were loaded, and the score was tied.",The New York Philharmonic was conducting a rendition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony,2360

Cop: Sir do you know why I pulled you over?

Driver: No sir officer, what seems to be the problem?

Cop: I noticed you were speeding and driving all over the road. The cop glances and sees the open beer bottles in the passenger seat.

Cop: Sir have you been drinking before or while driving today?

Driver: No sir. I’m not allowed to.

At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.
That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. ""Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!"" The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head.

&amp;#x200B;

One day a woman is out shopping for a gift to give her friend for her birthday.  Her friend had tons of things and liked really weird items, the kind of things that most people would just look at and shake their heads.  So while the woman was out looking around she came across a store of oddities and figured she might just find something there for her friend.

&amp;#x200B;

She went inside and started to look around.  After a bit a little old lady came out of the back room and with a odd little accent asks if she needs any help.  The woman explains the situation and the little old lady says she may have just what she is looking for.  Soon she comes out with a little shrunken head and explains how it was made by a tribe in the jungles of West Africa.  The woman looks at it and then explains that her friend actually had one that she picked up a few years ago while in the Peace Corps.

&amp;#x200B;

The little old lady is unperturbed and starts looking around and then comes up with a didgeridoo.  She plays a little tune and then tells the woman about how she received it from a shaman of an Aborigine tribe.  The woman thinks about it for a second and then remembers seeing something very similar in the corner of her friends apartment.  It was slightly larger than this one and not wanting to chance buying another one she turns this one down as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Before long the woman is almost ready to leave as she just isn't finding anything that catches her eye.  Just as she is about to leave the little old lady comes out of the back room with a small cage.  She stops the woman and says before you leave I want you to have a look at this.  I have had it a very long time but I am old and really no longer have a need for it.  The little old lady sets the cage down on the floor and opens the door and a little odd creature walks out.  He had blue and green mottled fur with a little red tuft on the top of his head with a small set of horns.  The woman asks what it is and the little old lady explains.  She says, This is a fuckmonster it is a most unique creature and will certainly not be something your friend has already.  She then looks at the fuckmonster and says, Fuckmonster, buffalo.  The little monster stands up and from out of nowhere grows a huge penis and goes over and starts hammering away at a stuffed buffalo.  The woman buys it on the spot.

&amp;#x200B;

On her trip home the little monster is riding along on the front seat of her car.  It was a little bit of a drive and before long she looks over at the little guy and an idea pops into her head on how to make the trip more interesting.  She then says, Fuckmonster, me.  The little guy stands up and slides under the steering wheel grows his big old hard on and starts pounding away at her.  She is in unbelievable ecstasy  having orgasm after orgasm as the monster works his magic.  

&amp;#x200B;

The trip was much more interesting but she happened to hit a couple parked cars along the way and before long a police officer pulls her over.  At the point the little fuckmonster was sitting on the seat again and she had mostly straightened herself up.  The officer walks up to her window and in a deep burly voice asks the woman if she knows why she had been pulled over.  She says she does and was very sorry and was planning to go back and leave her information on the cars but found it very hard to stop.  Then she proceeds to tell him why that was and all about the fuckmonster.  She finishes and asks him for leniency and he just shakes his head and states, Fuckmonster my ass....",Fuckmonster....,128

The man says, ""I'm going to Des Moines, a ride would be appreciated, sir."" 
The trucker then tells him that he would have to ride in the trailer with his cargo, which happened to be hundreds and hundreds of bowling balls. The man accepts, and hops in the back with his bike.

About thirty minutes later, two sheriffs pull the trucker over, one a deputy, and one a lieutenant. The deputy tells his lieutenant that he wants to take this one alone. The deputy walks up to the cab, asks for license and registration, and then asks if he can look at what the trucker is hauling. Of course, the trucker opens it and lets him check inside. Almost immediately upon opening it, the deputy slams it closed and says to the trucker, ""Get out of here, I never want to see you around here again!"" 

The deputy returns to the car and sits down in the passenger seat. The lieutenant turned to him and asked, ""What exactly happened up there?""

Pete replies: “Just feeling a little off lately.”

Doctor: “Well, we’ll get you worked over and find out what’s up.” Then he proceeds to take a history, examine him, listen to his breathing and draw blood. On his way out, he makes an appointment. 

Two weeks later Pete goes in for his appointment. There’s a new gal working at the desk, and she’s a ten. Pete finds himself sneaking glances at her the whole time he’s waiting to be called in. 

Pete gets called in, and the doctor comes into the room. 

“Well Pete, I have good news and bad news, which would you like first?”

Pete asks for the bad news first. 

“Well Pete, your labs show unusually high levels of cancer markers, from the examination last time, and the blood draws, I would estimate you have 2-3 months left to live.”

Pete kind of freaks out.  “Bad news? That’s fucking terrible news! What could possibly be good news after that?”

“The neighbors went to the show today and said the tightrope walkers were doing the Hokey Pokey right up there on the wire! Can you even imagine?”

“I’d love to take you,” said the man. “But the boss’ll be mad if I don’t get this project finished.”

The following night the wife gushed about how the paperboy told her about how a dozen clowns had popped out of this tiny car and did the can-can in bloomers and it was about the funniest thing he ever saw.  The man was starting to feel a little bad that he couldn’t take her, but work was work. 

The night after, the wife was downcast. 

“My book club said last night the lion tamer and the girl who rides the elephants did a waltz and it was just perfectly romantic,” she said. “It feels like we’re the only people in town who haven’t seen the show yet and they only have one more tomorrow! Oh please can’t we go?”

The man thinks it over and decides that this might be the only opportunity for them to see such a thing, and maybe work can wait. He calls his friend to ask him to cover for him at work the next day, and the man and his wife go to bed excited about seeing the show. 

The next day at work the boss notices the man is out and inquires about it with the friend. 

“Oh,” says the friend. “He can’t come in today due to four unseen circus dances.”

There was once an actor who did Shakespearean plays, but had aged and long past his peak! After many years, he finds himself in the Halifax Theater in Canada, where they are prepared to give him a chance. 

The director says, “This is the most important part, and it has only one line. You walk on to the stage carrying a rose. You hold the rose to your nose with just the fore finger and thumb, sniff the rose deeply and then say the line : _“Ah, the sweet aroma of my mistress!”_ 

The actor is thrilled. All day long before the play he was practicing his line over and over again. 

Finally, the time came. The curtain went up, the actor walked onto the stage, and performing the sniffing action as told with one fore-finger and thumb, he delivered the line: “Ah, the sweet aroma of my mistress.” 

The theater erupted, the audience was rolling with laughter and the director was steaming! “You bloody fool!” He cried, “You have ruined the show!” 

The actor was bewildered, “What happened, _did I forget my line?_

The Cubs fan takes of his hat and covers her left breast. The Royals (my team) fan takes off his hat and covers her right breast. The Yankees fan takes off his hat and covers her crotch.

The police arrive. The detective walks around the scene and writes in his little book. He lifts the Cubs hat, looks underneath, sets it back down and writes in his little book. He lifts the Royals hat, looks underneath, sets it back down and writes in his little book. He the lifts the Yankees hat, looks underneath, starts to set it back down, stops, does a double-take, sets the hat back down slowly and starts to write in the little book.

The Yankees fan is upset by this. He asks, ""What was that? Haven't you seen one of those before?"" The detective replies, ""You misunderstand. Normally when I look under a Yankees hat, I see an asshole.""",Three sports fans leave a bar...,867

Terry is gobsmacked. She’s beautiful, and just about to fall out of the robe. He introduces himself and starts to stammer out his sales pitch about the peaches he has for sale. 

“These peaches are at their peak of flavor, firm, ripe, and fuzzy.”

Noticing that Terry is struggling, she decides to have some fun at his expense. 

“Hmm, firm peaches, huh Terry? Are they as firm as this?” And she grabs his hand and places it on her butt. 

“No, this is real nice, the peaches aren’t that firm.”

“And are they as ripe as these?” She asks, taking both of Terry’s hands in hers and placing them on her breasts. 

“Oh no,” Terry replies, “these are really fine.”

“And fuzzy? Would you like to feel something fuzzy?” She asks as she starts to untie her robe and guide his hands downward. 

At this point she hears a door opening. 

“I hear someone coming, get in here,” and not wanting the neighbors to talk about what she was doing on the landing, she grabs Terry and pulls him into the apartment.

Peaches, engineered for your taste!  
Only 10 miles! 

Mildly intrigued, the driver decides to check out what this means.  ""Engineered for my tastes,  what bullshit!"", he says. 

Driving for the next couple miles, he finally comes across the turnoff to the restaurant. He parks, gets out and enters.  The cozy atmosphere catches him if guard, and he is greeted my a grandmotherly figure.  

She spills her usual rhetoric:

""Welcome to our restaurant, where we have engineered peaches to become everything and more!  Using genetic engineering, we have been able to make peaches taste like nearly anything you can think of! ""

The truck driver, doubting all the bullshit he had heard so far, decides to ask for a steak dinner. The old woman doesn't miss a beat and asks how he would like the steak, and which two sides would he want. 

He says in a disbelieving tone,  ""Medium rare, mashed potatoes and cornbread""

The old woman jots this down and tells the trucker it will be a few minutes, then promptly heads to the back towards the kitchen. 

After about ten minutes she come out of the kitchen holding a plate with the steaming peaches...

Nothing else,  just peaches...

This is set down in front of the trucker, the old lady nods, smiles and leaves. Curious, the trucker decides to try one of the peaches. He picks up the peach labeled steak and takes a big bite...

Immediately, he tastes what seems to be the best steak he has ever tasted. Juicy, flavorful, even a slight charred flavor.

He then tries the mashed potatoes peach. Buttery, garlicky, perfectly spiced. 

The cornbread peach next, just amazing. 

As the trucker is marveling upon what he has just experienced, the old lady notices that he is finished with his meal and asks what his favorite dessert is. He tells her that he had always loved creme brulee.  Once again the old lady doesn't miss a beat, jots it down, and heads to the kitchen. 

Yet when his dessert came out, it was not carried by the kind old lady, but an old man. 

He approached the table, set down the last peach, and started talking...

""Everything you have tried tonight has been my life's work. Any taste can be replicated thru my method, which i have developed over the last 40 years. Everyone thinks the billboard is a joke, but you actually gave us a shot.""

He was then momentarily silent, before producing another peach from his pocket. He scanned the room looking for his wife, the old lady, and then whispered...

I have a peach I've been developing, that tastes exactly like pussy. Would you like to try it? 

Fuck it, why not, thought the trucker. 

He grabbed the peach from the old man, took a huge bite, and immediately spit it out.

This tastes like shit!!!, said the trucker

The old man just replied,  ""turn it around.""",A trucker is driving down a random stretch of highway,36

Then the front door opens again and it’s the father. The mom’s lover panics and hides in the closet. As the kids parents are talking the boy talks to the man.

Man: “Sure is.”
K: “You know I have a baseball glove I’ll sell you for $300.”
M: “what I’m not buying your glove”
K: “ You know my dad is right out there and all I have to do is scream.”
M: “Alright fine” and he buys the glove

A week later the same situation happens again and the man and kid are in the closet again.
K: “It’s dark in here”
M: “Sure is”
K: “You know I have a baseball”
M: remembering the last time “Alright how much?”
K: “$200”

K: “I can’t I sold my glove and ball”
D: “You sold it! For how much?”
K: “$500”
D: “Whoa that is too much! I can’t believe you would con your friends like that. We are going to church so you can go and confess.”

They drive to the church and the dad throws the kid into the confessional and orders him to tell the priest what he’s done and slams the door.
After a minute of silence
Kid: “It’s dark in here.”

What the fly doesn't realize is that there's a fish watching him. The fish thinks, if that fly drops six inches, then I'm gonna get the fly.

 What the fish doesn't realize is that there is a fisherman watching him. Fisherman sees the fly and thinks, if that fly drops six inches then the fish is going to get the fly and I'm gonna get the fish. 

What the fisherman doesn't realize is that there is a bear watching him. The bear sees the fly and thinks, if the fly drops six inches then the fish gets the fly, the fisherman gets the fish and the bear will get the fisherman. 

What the bear doesn't realize is that there is a hunter watching him. Hunter sees the fly and thinks, if that fly drops six inches then the fish is going to get the fly, the fisherman is going to get the fish, the bear is going to get the fisherman and I'm going to get the bear.

What the hunter don't realize is there is a mouse watching the sandwich he brought for lunch. The mouse see the fly and thinks, that if the fly drops six inches then the fish is going to get the fly, the fisherman is going to get the fish, the bear is going to get the fisherman, the hunter is going to get the bear and the mouse is going to get the hunters sandwich.

The mouse, however doesn't see a cat watching him. The cat sees the fly and thinks, if that fly drops six inches then the fish is going to get the fly, fisherman gets the fish, bear gets the fisherman, hunter gets the bear, mouse gets the hunter's sandwich and I'll get the mouse.

So the fly drops six inches.... Fish gets the fly, fisherman gets the fish, bear gets the fisherman, hunter gets the bear, mouse gets the hunters sandwich but the cat fucks up and falls in the water.

The pigfarmer is pretty skeptical about the whole thing, but finally convinced he loads all the pigs in the truck, drives then into a forest and goes at it with the pigs for 4 hours. He drives home, eats dinner with his wife and goes to bed early.  
  
The next day he goes to check if the pigs are pregnant - they will show by lying on their sides, twitching their legs... none do. He angrily calls the hog place and yells a bit. The guy from the hog place calms him down, and they finally figure out the problem - 4 hours is not enough at all. The farmer loads the pigs in the truck, drives to the forest and goes at it with the pigs for 8 hours. He drives home, skips dinner and goes to bed directly.  
  
The next day he gets up early to check on the pigs, but none are on their side, twitching their legs. He makes a final, furious call to Hog Place Inc, and the same thing happens - he finally calms down, and after some arguing accepts to give it a final go at 12 hours. The farmer loads the pigs in the truck, drives to the forest and goes at it for 12 hours, no pauses. He drags his bruised body and the pigs back to the truck, drives home and falls asleep after parking. His loving wife carries him up to bed and gets the pigs back in the pen.

I ran inside, grabbed a hammer, and started smacking his hands and fingers with it!

Saint Peter let out a faint chuckle, and since it was a crime of passion, he decided to let this poor soul in.

Another man came walking up to the pearly gates and Saint Peter told this man the same thing, that in order to get in he had to make St. Peter laugh. The second guy told him about how he died.

Luckily, I landed in some bushes but then this guy dropped a freaking refrigerator on me!”

Saint Peter chuckled again,  let the second man into heaven, and decided he could really start to enjoy his job. A third man came walking up to the pearly gates.

“Tell me about the day you died”

It has only recently come to light that he had a mistress as well. The composer would sneak away from his ""ball and chain"" every chance he had, and spend a few blissful hours in the arms of another woman. Constanze soon grew suspicious, and did her best to keep a watchful eye on Mozart. This did little to help matters, as the composer was quite crafty! 


One day, Constanze decided to throw a costume ball. Mozart took the opportunity to invite his mistress in the hopes that they could sneak off for some alone time. ""You are a naval officer's daughter,"" he said to her. ""Come dressed as a ship, so that I will recognize you, mask or no mask!""


This is precisely what the cheating couple did. The mistress arrived to the ball, rubbed elbows with the other guests to shake off suspicion, and proceeded to sneak off to the pantry with Mozart. Before long, they were all over each other, knocking over several of the delicious pizzas Constanze had prepared for the occasion. The ship costume became covered in cheese and sausage, looking like a pizza itself at this point, but the lovers were beyond care!


Unfortunately, Constanze happened to pass by the pantry and heard the ruckus. She angrily ran over, calling Mozart's name! ""My love, give me your clothes,"" said the mistress to Mozart. ""If you do this for me, I could change out of my costume, sneak out the window, and hide among the guests!"" Mozart, not having a better idea, quickly complied, and out the window she went.


When the furious Constanze found Mozart naked beside the filthy ship costume, she had only one thing to say.


""Whoever this girl is, she is a real *Mozartfucking pizza ship.*""",Mozart's Mistress,1

""See that ladder over there?"" he asked them, pointing to an ornate golden ladder reaching up out of the flames and into white fluffy clouds beyond.

""If you can make it to the top without laughing, I'll let heaven have your soul.  But!  If you so much as chuckle while climbing it, I'll remove your manhood based on your father's profession.

The three men scratched their heads, thinking it quite odd, but agreed.

The first man started to climb.  After what seemed like days, he finally started to approach the top, and he became so excited he started laughing with joy.

The devil brings him back down and exclaims, ""Well!  Having a laugh are we?  Let's just see what daddy's line of work was.""

He proceeds to search through a large tome and finds that the man's father was a barber, so he produces a razor and slices his penis off.

""Next!"" he exclaims.

The second man goes up the ladder.  When he was halfway to the top, he looks down at the first man, writhing in pain, and couldn't help but laugh at his misfortune.  The devil brings him down immediately.

""You won't be laughing soon!"" says the devil, thumbing through the old book and learning his father was a mobster.  He then produces a Tommy gun and shoots off his member.

The third man was up, but started laughing before even starting to climb.

""What's so funny?"" asked the devil.

The third man answers, ""My dad sold popsicles, now you have to blow me!""",The devil was feeling generous one day,120
