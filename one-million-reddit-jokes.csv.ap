So he's there on the Green, about to head his ball, when he hears, ""Ribbit!  Nine-iron!""

He looks down and there's a little frog next to his foot.  ""What did you say, little frog?""

And the frog repeats.  ""Ribbit!  Nine-iron!""

So the man shrugs, figures what the hell, switches clubs to his 9-iron.  He lines up his shot, swings, and it is a beautiful shot.  The ball sails through the air and when it lands if falls 5 ft from the hole.

""That's amazing!""

""Ribbit! Told you!""

So the man scoops up the little frog, puts it on his golf cart, and drives towards his ball.  And with the little frogs help he golfs the greatest game in his life.  He's lowered his handicap by 5 strokes.

Then he gets an idea.

He travels with the frog to Las Vegas.  He sits down at a blackjack table, and with the little frogs help he plays hand after hand.

""What do you think, little frog?""

I'm a little frog response, ""Ribbit!  Take a card!"" or ""Ribbit! Stay!""

And in very short order the man is up twenty grand.  So quickly in fact that the hotel and casino comps him a room.  The penthouse, in fact.

And the man gets another idea. He orders room service, and with the little frogs help he picks out the most fantastic meal he's ever had in his life.

""Ribbit! T-bone steak!""

The food comes to the room, he eats it, and he is completely satisfied.  He lies down on the bed, the little frog on the pillow next to him, and he says, ""Thank you so much, little frog. This is one of the greatest days of my life. And it was all thanks to you. How can I ever repay you?""

And the little frog says, ""Ribbit! Kiss me!""

The man is taken a back for a second.  ""I'm sorry, what did you say, little frog?""

And the frog just repeats.  ""Ribbit!  Kiss me!""

I saw the man balls over it for a moment, figures what the hell, the frog has given him a really good day so what exactly does he have to deny this frog?

he leans in, and he kisses the frog, at which point the frog in a big puff of smoke turns into a gorgeous -- although completely naked -- 15 year old girl.

*""And that, Your Honor, is how she got into my hotel room!""*",So this guy decides to take off work to go golfing.,112

Turns out the can was actually a lamp with a genie inside. The Genie appears with a woosh. 

“Aww man. Not again. Look man. I’m a bad genie. Whatever you wish for I’m gonna do it. But I’m gonna make sure it’s bad. You really don’t want to wish for anything man. “

The guy says “oh no you don’t get it. I hope this is bad. The worst. My wife’s mother lives with us and all she does is nag nag nag. I wish she would move out and be free from interfering in my life. “
 
The genie shrugged and snapped his fingers. The man pocketed the can and walked home hopefully that things would change. But when he got there he saw his wife crying and his mother in law getting into a car. “She’s leaving. “ his wife cried. “She told me she couldn’t stand the sight of me and you anymore so she leaving to try and start a new life. “ 
Two days later they got the phone call. The plane her mother was on has gone down. No one had survived. 

His wife cried and cried. Seeming to never get over the loss of her mother or the way she had left. She sank into a deep and dark depression rarely leaving the house or taking care of herself. The husband found the genie in a can he had hidden and rubbed it.  “For fucks sake not again. “ the genie mumbled. “Didn’t you already see what happens when i use my powers? Hello! I’m a bad genie. Whatever you wish for I will ruin. “ 

The husband: I know I know, but it’s my wife. She hasn’t been able to be happy since her mother left and died. 

Genie: I told you not too make any wishes man. 

The husband: I get it. But I don’t think you can make this one bad. I wish my wife was happy.”

The genie said okie doolie. And he snaped his fingers. The husband rushed back inside the house looking to see his wife. Their eyes met and it was like they were teenager again. His wife was full of energy and joy the complete opposite of the week before. But days later her enthusiasm and lust for life was growing insatiable. A week had gone by and She had stolen the car, and gone to town to fulfill some of her more hedonistic and complicated fantasies. A week after that and she still had not come back. 

The man sat inside his once full now empty and lifeless house and spiraled into his own depression. He pulled the can out from his pocket and rubbed it. 

Genie: shit man. You’re still at it?

Husband: I know I know. You’re a bad genie.  But this is my last wish. And I know you won’t be able to make it bad. I wish... I really wish... I wish I was good. 

Okay said the Genie. You asked for this. He snapped his finger and with a puff of smoke and upper body strength he bent the husband over the table tore his pants off and mounted him yelling loudly. “OH YOU’RE GOOD! YOU’RE SOOO GOOD! I MEAN REALLY GOOD!”",Bad Genie says don’t make that wish,1

 “im the greatest bear hunter there ever was” 

2 of the 3 friends disagree and say
 
“no way i am” 

an argument breaks out until the 4th man who said nothing pipes up and says 

“i have never been bear hunting, maybe we should all go to see whose best at it?”

The friends agree go home and wait until the next day, they all get in a car and drive the forest while they are in the car one friend turns to the bear hunting novice and says

When hunting a bear be very quiet, unless it sees you then you either get big and tall to scare it or you run, it will chase you until you get to saftey”

The man noted this and they got to the cabin they rented for the hunting trip, they set up and search around for hours hunting bears, but they find none, they head back to camp and fall asleep

When they all awake they notice that the bear hunting novice is gone so they get up look around until they head outside, they start to call his name but no answer, they grab their guns and walk a little till they hear the sound of running

The novice is running at full speed towards the cabin with a giant black bear behind him, the other 3 friends pull him into the cabin and shoot the bear dead, the friends all curious and angry with the novice asked

“What the hell were you doing?”

And finally after the novice catches his breath he says

“Hunting, now stay here im gonna have a drink of water, and ill go get you another one”

He made sure they looked their best and dropped them at school.

Coming back home, he cleaned the house, did some laundry and before long it was time to pick up the kids from school.He prepared them some food, helped them with some homework and projects, and then had to start prepping the evenings dinner.

He had the kids take bath, and was relived when he got done for the day because he was exhausted, sat on the couch  and hardly long in came the hubby (now the being the wife), whom clearly had a rough busy day and needed some soothing and of-course some attention.

Officer: May I see the registration for this vehicle?

Driver: That's right. But come to think of it, I think I saw the registration in the glove box when I was putting my gun in there. 

Officer: There's a gun in the glove box? 

Driver: Yes sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed the woman who owns this car and stuffed her in the trunk. 

Officer: There's a BODY in the TRUNK?!?!? 

Driver: Yes, sir. 

Hearing this, the officer immediately called his Captain. The car was quickly surrounded by police, and the Captain approached the driver to handle the tense situation: 

Captain: Sir, can I see your license? 

Driver: Sure. Here it is. It was valid. Captain: Whose car is this? 

Driver: It's mine, officer. Here's the registration. The driver owned the car. 

 Captain: Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if there's a gun in it? 

Driver: Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it. Sure enough, there was nothing in the glove box. 

Captain: Would you mind opening your trunk? I was told you said there's a body in it. 

Driver: No problem. Trunk is opened; no body. 

Captain: I don't understand it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you didn't have a license, stole the car, had a gun in the glovebox, and that there was a dead body in the trunk.

*This ancient joke pre-dates the Internet. It is from the South and is best told with a southern accent.*

I was deer hunting in the mountains of North Carolina. After about four hours I shot a nice 400lb buck. While I was hauling the dear back to my truck, I was stopped by the game warden, he wanted to see my hunting permit. I showed him my N.C. permit, after which he proceeded to stick his finger up the deer's asshole. He pulled his finger out and smelled it. The warden told me that the deer was a Virgina deer, and he wanted to see my Virgina permit. I had hunted in Norfork, Virgina about two months ago, so I looked through my wallet and showed him my Virgina permit.  He was very upset because he got some enjoyment from handing out fines to hunters without permits.

About one week later I was out hunting again on the same property. I was in a tree stand for almost seven hours before I spotted my first deer. I had a clean shot, and popped the deer right in the neck. While taking the deer back to my truck, the same perverted warden came up and insisted he be allowed to inspect the deer. He stuck his finger right up the deer's ass and then smelled and licked his finger. I was about to throw up. He told me that the deer was from South Carolina and he wanted my S.C. permit.  I ran back to my truck and got the S.C. permit out of my glove compartment.  This time the warden seemed even more upset then he did the last time. Of course he could not give me a ticket and he had to let me go.

I shot three more deers during the rest of the season, and every time he did the same thing. He stuck his finger up the deer's butt and told me that I needed I license from Georgia, Alabama, and then West Virgina. I had a permit for every state. He was so mad when I showed him my permit from West Virgina, I thought he was going to kill me. He said "" Boy, you got a permit for every damn state in the South, Where the hell you from?""

I pulled down my pants and bent over, and then told the warden, ""why don't you tell me!""","An old, gross joke about deer hunting",123

The very next afternoon three young boys, full of youthful, after-school enthusiasm, came down his street, beating merrily on every trash can they encountered. The crashing percussion continued day after day, until finally the wise old man decided it was time to take some action. The next afternoon, he walked out to meet the young percussionists as they banged their way down the street. 

Stopping them, he said, ""You kids are a lot of fun. I like to see you express your exuberance like that. In fact, I used to do the same thing when I was your age. Will you do me a favor? I'll give you each a dollar if you'll promise to come around every day and do your thing."" 

The kids were elated and continued to do a bang-up job on the trash cans. After a few days, the old-timer greeted the kids again, but this time he had a sad smile on his face. ""This recession's really putting a big dent in my income,"" he told them. ""From now on, I'll only be able to pay you 50 cents to beat on the cans."" 

The noisemakers were obviously displeased, but they did accept his offer and continued their afternoon ruckus. A few days later, the retiree approached them again as they drummed their way down the street.

The only thing that was missing was a good quarterback. He had scouted all the colleges and even the Canadian and European Leagues, but he couldn't find a ringer who could ensure a Super Bowl win.

&amp;#x200B;

Then one night while watching CNN he saw a war-zone scene in Afghanistan . In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Afghan Muslim soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand-grenade straight into a 15th story window 100 yards away.

&amp;#x200B;

KABOOM!

&amp;#x200B;

He threw another hand-grenade 75 yards away, right into a chimney.

&amp;#x200B;

KA-BLOOEY!

&amp;#x200B;

Then he threw another at a passing car going 90 mph.

&amp;#x200B;

BULLS-EYE!

&amp;#x200B;

""I've got to get this guy!"" Coach said to himself. ""He has the perfect arm!""

&amp;#x200B;

So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football. And the Bears go on to win the Super Bowl.

&amp;#x200B;

The young Afghan is hailed as the great hero of football, and when the coach asks him what he wants, all the young man wants is to call his mother.

&amp;#x200B;

""Mom,"" he says into the phone, ""I just won the Super Bowl!""

&amp;#x200B;

""I don't want to talk to you"", the old Muslim woman says.""You are not my son!""

&amp;#x200B;

""I don't think you understand, Mother,"" the young man pleads. ""I've won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans.""

&amp;#x200B;

""No! Let me tell you!"" his mother retorts. ""At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and I have to keep your sister in the house so she doesn't get raped!"" The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says, ""I will never forgive you for making us move to Chicago !!!!",So the Bears were looking for a new quarterback.,6

""Now remember....that's all original leather. You can't let it get too wet. If it starts raining and you don't have anywhere to shelter it, make sure you keep a tub of vaseline with you. Rub it all over the seat so the water will just bead off.""

The guy takes his new bike and goes to pick up his girlfriend. The girlfriend invites the guy over to her parents house for dinner. This will be the first time he's ever eaten with her family.

""I should let you know the rule of the table"" she said. ""There is no talking allowed. The first person to talk at the table has to clean the dishes.""

The guy doesn't think this is that big of a deal until he arrives at the family's house and looks in the kitchen. There must be at least three months worth of dishes inside. They are stacked up to the ceiling, stinking and rotting of mold and old bits of food everywhere. The guy almost throws up at the smell and sight of such a disgusting state of affairs.

Dinner begins, and no one is saying a word. The tension is starting to get to the boyfriend, so he concocts a plan to make someone else speak first.

The guy drops his fork, goes over to his girlfriend at the table, throws her up on top and just starts fucking her in front of everyone. The father and mother are obviously mortified. But even with their jaws on the floor, no one says a word.

The guy stops and thinks to himself ""This is going to be harder than I thought...."" then he gets another idea.....

Without hesitation, he runs over to the mother throws her up on the table and fucks the shit out of her, right in front of the father.

The dad is staring daggers through the boyfriend and turning bright red in anger. But still says nothing. The girlfriend is becoming teary eyed and covering her mouth with her hands, but doesn't make a peep.

The boyfriend stops fucking the mother and sits back down at his seat, completely flustered. He takes a gander out the window, and notices a sudden heavy rain has settled in. He then realizes that his vintage motorbike is parked on the street, uncovered.

The boyfriend pops out of his seat and grabs his tub of vaseline.

The dad jumps out of his chair and yells out, ""ALRIGHT, I'LL DO THE GODDAMNED DISHES!""",The vintage motorcycle.,35

&amp;#x200B;

His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.

&amp;#x200B;

""Welcome to heaven,"" says St.. Peter. ""Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.""

&amp;#x200B;

""No problem, just let me in,"" says the Senator.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from the higher ups. What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Really? I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,"" says the Senator.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm sorry, but we have our rules.""

&amp;#x200B;

And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell.

&amp;#x200B;

The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course.

&amp;#x200B;

In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the

expense of the people.

&amp;#x200B;

They played a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and the finest champagne.

&amp;#x200B;

Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who is having a good time dancing and telling jokes.

&amp;#x200B;

They are all having such a good time that before the Senator realizes it, it is time to go.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises.

&amp;#x200B;

The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens in heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him, ""Now it's time to visit heaven.”

&amp;#x200B;

So, 24 hours passed with the Senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time

and before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now choose your eternity.""

&amp;#x200B;

The Senator reflects for a minute, then he answers: ""Well, I would never have said it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in hell.""

&amp;#x200B;

So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell...

&amp;#x200B;

Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls to the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulders.

&amp;#x200B;

""I don't understand,"" stammers the Senator. ""Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drank champagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?""

 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The devil smiles at him and says,

 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Yesterday we were campaigning,

I turned to her and said, 'Do you want to have Sex?'

'No,' she answered.

I then said, 'Is that your final answer?'

... She didn't even look at me this time, simply saying, 'Yes..'

So I said, ""Then I'd like to phone a friend.""

And that's when the fight started...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I took my wife to a restaurant.

The waiter, for some reason, took my order first.

""I'll have the rump steak, rare, please.""

He said, ""Aren't you worried about the mad cow?""

""Nah, she can order for herself.""

And that's when the fight started.....

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My wife and I were sitting at a table at her high school reunion, and she kept staring at a drunken man

swigging his drink as he sat alone at a nearby table.

I asked her, ""Do you know him?""

""Yes"", she sighed,

""He's my old boyfriend. I understand he took to drinking right after we split up those many years ago, and I hear he hasn't been sober since.""

""My God!"" I said, ""Who would think a person could go on celebrating that long?""

And then the fight started...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

When our lawn mower broke and wouldn't run, my wife kept hinting to me that I should get it fixed.

But, somehow I always had something else to take care of first, the shed, the boat, making beer.. Always something more important to me.

Finally she thought of a clever way to make her point.

When I arrived home one day, I found her seated in the tall grass, busily snipping away with a tiny pair of sewing scissors. I watched silently for a short time and then went into the house. I was gone only a minute, and when I came out again.

I handed her a toothbrush. I said, ""When you finish cutting the grass, you might as well sweep the driveway.""

The doctors say I will walk again, but I will always have a limp.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My wife sat down next to me as I was flipping channels.

She asked, ""What's on TV?""

I said, ""Dust.""

And then the fight started...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Saturday morning I got up early, quietly dressed, made my lunch, and slipped quietly into the garage. I hooked up the boat up to the van and proceeded to back out into a torrential  downpour. The wind was blowing 50 mph, so I pulled back into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that the weather would be bad all day.

I went back into the house, quietly undressed, and slipped back into bed. I cuddled up to my wife's back; now with a different anticipation, and whispered, ""The weather out there is terrible.""

My loving wife of 5 years replied, ""And, can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that?""

And that's how the fight started...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming anniversary.

She said, ""I want something shiny that goes from 0 to 150 in about 3 seconds.""

I bought her a bathroom scale.

And then the fight started......

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After retiring, I went to the Social Security office to apply for Social Security. The woman behind the counter asked me for my driver's License to verify my age. I looked in my pockets  and realized I had left my wallet at home. I told the woman that  I was very sorry, but I would have to go home and come back later.

The woman said, 'Unbutton your shirt'.

So I opened my shirt revealing my curly silver hair.

She said, 'That silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me' and she processed my Social Security application.

When I got home, I excitedly told my wife about my experience at the Social Security office.

She said, 'You should have dropped

your pants. You might have gotten disability too.'

And then the fight started...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My wife was standing nude, looking in the bedroom mirror.

She was not happy with what she saw and said to me,

""I feel horrible; I look old, fat and ugly. I really need you to pay me a compliment.'

I replied, ""Your eyesight's damn near perfect.""

And then the fight started........

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I rear-ended a car this morning...the start of a REALLY bad day!

The driver got out of the other car, and he was a DWARF!!

He looked up at me and said 'I am NOT Happy!'

So I said, 'Well, which one ARE you then?'

That's how the fight started.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

One year, I decided to buy my mother-in-law a cemetery plot as a Christmas gift...

The next year, I didn't buy her a gift.

When she asked me why, I replied, ""Well, you still haven't used the gift I bought you last year!""

The bartender, who's new in town, is shocked to see everybody get up and run out. He grabs a patron by the bar and asks, ""What' happening?"".

""D-d-didn't you hear, man? Big Jake's comin' to town!""

The bartender is confused, but rolls with it. But, since he doesn't want people coming and looting the salloon, he decides to stick around.

Just then, the meanest, tallest, ugliest son-of-a-bitch the bartender's ever seen bursts into the room. He slams the door so hard it falls clean off its hinges. He's eight foot tall, and nearly as wide. Every inch of his face is either scarred or tattooed. His ears are pierced with two massive railroad spikes. He picks up a table and throws it straight down through the floor, just to show that he can.

He walks up to the bar and slams his fist down on it so hard that it splits clean in two. ""**HEY, BARKEEP!**"", he yells. ""**GIMME THAT BOTTLE O' WHISKEY!**""

Shaking, the barkeeper hands the bottle over. In one massive gulp, he downs the entire bottle before smashing it over his own head. ""**NOW GIMME THAT BOTTLE O' TEQUILLA!**""

Again, the barkeeper hands over the bottle, which the stranger downs in a single gulp before breaking the bottle over his head. He scoops up some of the glass and eats it, just to show how tough he is.

Wanting to stay on his good side, the bartender asks him, ""I-i-is there anything else I can get you, sir?"".

The stranger says ""**THANKS PARDNER, BUT I GOTS TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE, FAST! I HEARD THAT BIG JAKE'S COMIN' TO TOWN!**""",Big Jake,9

After a few minutes he realized how stupid he was being. “I could kill myself, or go to prison!” He thought. He decided the best thing to do would be to pull over and hope he just got a ticket. 

He slowed down and pulled over on the side of the road, waiting for the police officer to come up to his window. After a few tense minutes of waiting, he saw the officer get out of his car and walk up to his window. 

He unrolled the window to speak with the officer. “Look son,” said the officer “I’ve had a long day and my shift is nearly over. If I have to arrest you, I’ll be doing paperwork for hours. I’ll tell you what; if you give me a reason why you were running that I’ve never heard before, I’ll let you go.”

The man thought for a moment and replied “A few months ago my wife ran off with a cop. I thought you were trying to give her back.”
