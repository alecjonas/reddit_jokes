One day, they decided to meet up in person and introduce themselves to each other for real. After some friendly chit chats and a couple of drinks at the hotel bar, they started talking about how they used sex instead of political influences to get things for free.

The New Yorker started, ""Last week I gave a waiter a nice hand job and I got my dinner for free.""

The friend from Chicago, wanted to top the story, said, ""Well, that's nice but yesterday I gave a bartender a blow job and let him come all over my face. I got free drinks for myself and all my friends.""

Don't want to be left behind, the Seattleite said, ""When my plane landed this morning, I give the captain a blow job and I swallowed all his cum. Now I have free first class ticket back to Seattle.""

The Washington D.C. friend, wanting to trump all the stories, said ""Well, I let the hotel manager here fuck me and come into my asshole earlier, so all of our rooms and meals are comped.""

At this point, Debra is thinking, ""oh boy, I am I going to top this?"" She excused herself to the restroom to buy her some time to think. On her way there, she runs into Bill Clinton.

Upon returning to her friends at the bar, she said, ""well, guess what? I just ran into ex-President Bill Clinton and we fucked in the bathroom and I let him come into my pussy. Now I can get almost any favors I want because I can blackmail him by threatening to tell the news media what happened.""

All of her new friends are in shock and impressed. They said in unison, ""Well, Debra, I guess you win. None of us can top that because none of us has a pussy.""





","Debra is topper and because of her attitude, she doesn't have a lot of friends in real life.",0

I honestly answered, ""No.""
So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped over her thumb, She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So she looked all around the store. It was empty.
""Just a minute,"" she said, and walked to the door, and locked it.
Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ""Do these excite you?"" she asked.
Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said, it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and laid down on a desk.
""Well, come on"", she said, ""We don't have much time.""
So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and hwoogluh, I was done within a few minutes. She looked at me with a frown. ""Did you put that condom on?""

The farmer's cat heard the singing and scooped the bird out of the pile and ate him.

There are three morals to be drawn from this tale:

    Not everyone that poops on you is your enemy.
    Not everyone that pulls you out of the poop is your friend.

Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.

""Ok... Dale you do have lung cancer. Third stage and its aggressive.""

Dale, stunned by the news lowers his head to his hands, obviously deeply troubled by the horrible news. You can hear the despair in his voice. ""Jeez Doc. Well that's just terrible. Don't know how I'm gonna tell the wife."" 

After a few moments of silence, Dale, trying to act normally gets his wits together and says, ""Well that's been said and its done. What's the bad news? Pretty sure I can take anything now Doc.""

The doctor looks back up at Dale and tells him, ""Dale you also have Alzheimer's Disease.""

Again, Dale is stunned and not taking the news well. His head goes back to his hands and after a little thinking, he looks up at the doctor and says:

He decided to travel to Melbourne, Australia for a week in the best city ever built. (trust me this is true statement - not a joke at all).

Anyways, he is in his room at the Hilton Hotel watching TV when the TV announcer states that DUCK HUNTING SEASON OPENS TODAY.

""Cor blimey!!"", says Dirk to himself.
""Here is me, the numero uno Duck Hunter in the world...on hols in the best forking city this side of the Moon....and duck hunting season is on!!!""

So he goes down to Europcar Car Rentals and hires himself a car and a box trailer, then down to the Gun Shop to hire a gun and a box of bullets.....then off on his duck hunting travels he goes.

After a week of hunting he realises that his holiday time is almost at an end. ""Time to head back to Melbourne, the best city on Earth"", he says to himself......and he tarpaulins up the trailer and heads back towards the greatest city in the Solar System.

Anyways, as he is driving he hears a siren blaring, ""Eeeeee.....orrrrrr...eeeeee...orrrrr.....eeeeeee...orrrrr"", and a biker cop (you know.. the ones with the tight leather pants, wrap around sunglasses - poofters) pulls him over.

The cop says, ""What you got in your trailer, mate?""
""Ah Mr Policeman, I have been duck hunting this past week, and all me ducks are in the trailer"".
The cop replies, ""You do know that you are not allowed to shoot ducks from Sydney, yeah?""
""Oh Mr. Policeman I know that, and I have not shot any ducks from Sydney.""
The cop, being a diligent prick, says, ""I tell you what. I'll test a few ducks out. If they are okay, you can go on.""

With that the copper picks up a duck, licks his forefinger, and slides it into the arsehole of the duck. He then extracts his finger and sniffs it.... ""Ah, this here is an Adelaide duck"", he says.

He picks up another duck, licks his forefinger and slides it into the ducks arsehole. He then extracts his finger and sniffs it.....""Ah, this here is a Darwin duck. Mate, you are looking good. I will test one more duck, and if it tests good you can go"".

So the cop picks up another duck, licks his forefinger and slides it into the ducks arsehole. He then extracts his finger and sniffs it....has a concerned look on his face.....and sniffs his finger again....
""'Ere mate..this here is a Sydney duck!!!"" Where are you from??""

To which Dirk turns around, pulls his pants down, parts his arse cheeks and says, ""You're such a smart arse.....you tell me!!""

post,4jtjqc,2qh72,jokes,false,1463524559,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4jtjqc/a_young_girl/,self.jokes,,"There once was a little girl named Lucy who loved to read, particularly fairy tales. Her mother was sweet and her father was a clown (literally). For a long time, the little girl would read these books of hers, and eventually came to the conclusion that trolls were her favorite creature of them all. She sometimes was bullied for loving trolls so much, but Lucy didn't care, as long as she had her tales.

Flash forward a few years to Lucy's first year of middle school, where she takes a mandatory Tech-Ed class. She's reluctant at first, but soon grows to love the class where she learns to weld, work with wood, design and paint furniture, etc.

On her 13th birthday, Lucy's father says to her: ""Lucy, get up right now, I'm teaching you to ride a unicycle for the circus."" 
Lucy, confused at first, happily agrees. It takes some time for her to ride the unicycle properly, especially as it is an Extra Large Man's Size Unicycle, but she gets it eventually and starts to become very good.

Although she doesn't love unicycle riding, Lucy decides to make it a bit more enjoyable by designing her unicycle to look like a troll: her beloved fairy tale creature. Using some welding techniques from tech-ed, she is able to attach beautiful horns and paints the unicycle to look like a troll.

However, while practicing unicycle riding with her father, Lucy gets her first period. Lucy's father, unaware of what to do in this situation, uncomfortably says, ""Alright dear, let's ride to the Pharmacy and get you, ah..."" Lucy, seeing her father's discomfort, agrees to go with him to the near-by pharmacy.

The two arrive at the pharmacy, and Lucy's father tells her to go inside and get what she needs while he guards the unicycles.

A few minutes pass by, and a man, obviously fascinated by Lucy's unicycle, asks the father: ""My, what is that? I'm not sure I've seen anything like it!""
Lucy stomps out of the pharmacy with a furious look on her face and a plastic bag.
""That?"" says Lucy's father, ""That's a Men's Troll Cycle.""",A young girl...,6

post,4jrdah,2qh72,jokes,false,1463497866,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4jrdah/the_pink_gorrilla/,self.jokes,,"This is the story of the pink gorilla. 
There's these two guys. They're both teachers, and they work at the same school. One is an Anthropology teacher. The other is a Historian. They are both given a sabbatical. For those of you who don't know, a sabbatical is a paid vacation for teachers. They are paid to take time off teaching, but they have to do research to better their knowledge, to better their teaching. 
Got it? 
Good. 
So, both teachers are given a sabbatical. And, they're very good friends. So, they decide, on this sabbatical they will travel to far reaches of Africa to do some History research and some Anthropology research (Anthropology is the study of human nature). They decide that's what they're going to do. So, they go running down the stairs in their apartment building. *clop-clop-clop-clop* They get into a taxi-cab. *err...err....err* They get to the airport. They go through security. *beep-beep-beep-beep* And all that stuff, you know? They get on the plane. *woosh* Now they're in Africa. They get off the plane. They get on a little plane. *pt..pt...pt...pt* They fly over this tiny little village. The get off the tiny little plane, and there's this Jeep waiting right there for them - with their name on it. So, they get in the Jeep. *zh-zhoom* And they start driving down the road. They're going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...They're seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. Then, they get to this little pygmy village. So, they get out and ask the pygmies, ""What is something just great to see here, where we are?"" They say, ""Well, our rather hit attraction would be a pink gorilla."" ""A pink gorilla?! No way! You're totally lying!"" The pygmies are like, ""No, actually you just go down this road, take a left turn, then turn right into a big cave."" So, they get back in the Jeep (which starts right up). *zhoom* So they're going down the road; they're going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...They're seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. They make their left turn. They're still going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...They're seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. They get to this cave! It's got this giant steel door. So they open the steel door. There's this big wooden door. They open the wooden door. There's another wooden door. They open that wooden door. There's this long row of colored doors - orange, purple, pink, chartreuse, salmon, every color you could ever think of. So, they start going through all these doors. They're going open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close. They get through all the doors. There's a big pool of water, and right next to it is some scuba gear. So they put on the scuba gear and dive in. So, they're swimming....swim, swim, swim.....deep water.....swim, swim, swim....very deep water....swim, swim, swim....very, very deep water....Finally, they see another way out, so they swim towards that and get out of the water. 
They see the pink gorilla! 
All it's doing is sitting there, completely still. And so, they're observing the pink gorilla. They're taking pictures of it. They're writing down every move he makes - which isn't very many 'cause all he's doing is sitting there, completely still. It's kinda boring, but hey - it's a pink gorilla! The entire time they're watching the pink gorilla, there's one little thing the pygmies said that keeps flashing through they're mind. ""Don't touch the pink gorilla."" Now, they're like, ""Why can't we touch the pink gorilla? All he's doing is sitting there, completely still."" But, the Historian was rather smart. The Anthropologist, on the other hand, was like I wish I could get my hands on this thing. I could make a lot of money! So, the Anthropologist walks up and he's about to touch the pink gorilla. And the other guy grabs his hand and says, ""No! You heard what the pygmies said, 'Don't touch the pink gorilla.'"" But, the Anthropologist is just like, ""What could it do?"" The Historian manages to talk him out of touching it, and they keep taking pictures and writing notes about it's behavior - but there aren't very many 'cause all it's doing is sitting there, completely still. Finally, they're ready to leave. They put the scuba gear back on, and get back in the water. So, they're swimming again....swim, swim, swim.....very, very deep water.....swim, swim, swim....very deep water....swim, swim, swim....deep water....Finally, they see original surface, so they swim towards that and get out of the water. They start going through all the colored doors - orange, purple, pink, chartreuse, salmon, every color you could ever think of. So, they start going through all these doors. They're going open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open and close wooden door, open and close second wooden door, open and close steel door. They get in the Jeep, and it starts right up. *zhoom* They're going down the road; they're going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...They're seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. They make their turn. They're still going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...They're seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. They go through the pygmy village. They get to the little airport, get on the little plane. *pt..pt...pt...pt* It takes them to the bigger airport; they get on the bigger plane. *woosh* They get to back to the airport near home. They hail in a cab. They get in the cab. *err...err....err* They go up the stairs in the apartment building. *clop-clop-clop-clop* They're home!

Well, the next semester, the Anthropologist, who is the more gutsy of the two, is awarded another sabbatical. So, in his devious mind he's thinking haha! I'm going to return to Africa, capture the pink gorilla, and make millions of dollars!
So, he goes running down the stairs in the apartment building. *clop-clop-clop-clop* He gets into a taxi-cab. *err...err....err* He gets to the airport. He goes through security. *beep-beep-beep-beep* And all that stuff, you know? He gets on the plane. *woosh* Now he's in Africa. He gets off the plane. He gets on a little plane. *pt..pt...pt...pt* He flies over this tiny little village. He gets off the tiny little plane, and there's this Jeep waiting right there for him - with his name on it. So, he gets in the Jeep. *zh-zhoom* And he starts driving down the road. He's going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. He goes straight past the pygmy village. After all, he already knows where he's going. So he's going down the road; he's going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. He makes the left turn. He's still going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. He gets to the cave! He opens the steel door. He opens the big wooden door. He opens the second wooden door. He goes through all the colored doors - orange, purple, pink, chartreuse, salmon, every color you could ever think of. So, he's going through all these doors. He's going open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close. He gets through all the doors. He puts on the scuba gear and dives into the water. So, he's swimming....swim, swim, swim.....deep water.....swim, swim, swim....very deep water....swim, swim, swim....very, very deep water....He gets out of the water. Okay...I've got to get this thing out of here. So, he reaches out towards the gorilla. The whole time the pygmies' warning is playing in the back of his mind. Don't touch the pink gorilla. He hesitates. 
And then...
He touches the pink gorilla! The pink gorilla goes mad. He's like tearing the place apart! The guy screams. So, he throws on the scuba gear and jumps back into the water.....swim, swim, swim.....very, very deep water.....swim, swim, swim....very deep water....swim, swim, swim....deep water....The pink gorilla's swimming behind him! Finally, he gets out of the water. He starts going through all the colored doors - orange, purple, pink, chartreuse, salmon, every color you could ever think of. So, he's going through all these doors. He's going open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open and close wooden door, open and close second wooden door, open and close steel door. The pink gorilla is just bashing through all the doors. He jumps in the Jeep, and it starts right up. *zhoom* He's going down the road; he's going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...he's seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. The pink gorilla is just running along right behind him. He makes the turn. The gorilla turns, too. He's still going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...he's seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. The pink gorilla is just running along right behind him. They go through the pygmy village. The pygmies are like, ""haha! We told you not to touch it!"" He's still going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...he's seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of - including a pink gorilla in the rear-view mirror. The pink gorilla is just running along right behind him. And all of sudden...the car sputters to a stop. So the guy jumps out of the car and starts running. He's going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...he's seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. The pink gorilla is running along right behind him going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...Finally, the guy collapses. He just can't run any farther. He's just like, ""Whatever you do, just kill me quickly."" The gorilla walks up to him, reaches down, touches the guy, and says, ""Tag! You're it!"" and runs off down the road. ",The Pink Gorrilla,4

""I'll have a 16oz Steak with all the trimmings and a bottle of champagne."" The man says.

The waitress nods and turns towards the ostrich, who seems confused.

""Oh! Uh, I'll, um... I want, uh, I dunno, uuuuuuhhhhhhhhh, I'll just have what he had."" 

Writing down the order again she looks to the cat.

""Yeah I'll have the same. But I'm not paying for it! I won't pay a single penny."" He said as he turned his nose up at her.

The waitress smiles and walks off to the kitchen. She appears again later with three huge meals and 3 bottles of champagne.

After the man and his companions finish their meals the waitress returns to the table to ask him if there was anything else. The man said no and she went to fetch the bill.

""That'll be £166.95 please.""

The man reaches into his pocket and pulls out £166.95 exactly in cash and places it in the waitress's hand.

Her eyes widen as she looks down at the pile of cash and change in her hands. She looks up at him in amazement.

""How could you possibly have the exact money ready for me?""

""Oh thats a funny story actually, I found an old lamp the other day. After I rubbed it a Genie promptly popped out and proclaimed he could grant me three wishes."" Explained the man.

""And?"" Urged the waitress.

""My first wish was to always have the exact money in cash readily in my pocket whenever I needed it."" Said the man, triumphantly.

""And the second and third wishes?"" Inquired the waitress.

He stumbles upon a strange house and feels a deep sense of relief as he notices a light is on.

He knocks and a peculiar looking old man opens the door.

""Please. Please. I am lost and hungry, do you perhaps have a phone and some food for me?"" John desperately begs.

""I am afraid not"" replies the well dressed man ""for you see this is top class establishment. People come here for the isolation, so we have no phones, no modern technology and our food is of the highest quality; not to be simply given away. However, I could consider offering you a room and food for the night if you complete me 3 challenges - completion of them shall be considered payment for your stay. In the morning you can leave. Either way I can still point you in the right direction to get home but I must warn you it will be a days hike.""

John, too desperate to turn down the offer asks ""What are the challenges?""

""The challenges are as follows:

1) You must drink this bottle of tequila, in under one minute, for no challenge can be complete without drinking.""

""OK""

""2) a guest of mine has brought their pet, an alligator. It is being stored downstairs but requires dental work. You will go down there and remove its bad tooth using these pliers. Do not worry, it is a small alligator, you should be able to overpower it easily. You will have 5 minutes to complete this challenge.""

""That sounds dangerous but preferable to starvation, OK""

"" 3) upstairs, one of our older guests has requested someone to lay with. You will be the one to lay with her. You must go upstairs and give her the best orgasm she has ever had. For this challenge you have 20 minutes.""

""I can think of worse things to do, I accept your challenge"" 

John is invited in and instructed to the location of each challenge. He picks up the tequila and prepares himself. The timer is started.

John downs the bottle, painfully slugging it down. he finishes it with mere seconds to spare. The effects already kicking in powerfully.

He runs downstairs, stumbling as he goes, his fatigue is already showing. He closes the door behind him and a struggle is heard. The noises from downstairs are quite alarming but the hotel owner stands by the clock counting the minutes. Nashing and Growling and screaming are all heard, thrashing around and scratching. 

Triumphantly, John emerges from the room, clothes ripped, battered and bruised. He stumbles up the stairs confused, looks to the hotel owner and drunkenly asks him:

""So....hhrrr..... where is the *hic* alligator with the bad tooth?""

""how do you boil eggs without cracking them?""

I got the following response comment with 0 answers:

&gt; Mod here. This is a cooking website and eggs cracking is not related to cooking. However, as an exception I will allow this question for you and lets see what responses we get. A little more details would be appreciated

So I modified the question to ""How do you boil an egg without cracking it? I'm using standard hen eggs that can be purchased at local egg shops."".

&gt; mod here. Please describe which species, texture and color.

So I did some research and modified the question to ""How do you boil an egg without cracking it? I'm using standard hen eggs that can be purchased at local egg shops. These are the white eggs from the white leghorn chicken"".

&gt; Please mention how you're boiling it, which vessel, for how long, how much water.

I now modified the question to ""How do you boil an egg without cracking it? I'm using standard hen eggs that can be purchased at local egg shops. These are the white eggs from the white leghorn chicken. I'm boiling them in a kettle, with enough water to submerge the eggs. Have boiled them for around 8-10 minutes"".

&gt; Mod here. It would be great if you could provide a link to the bird species and upload a screenshot for your kettle. Please ignore this if you don't think that this is necessary.

I replied that I didn't think it was necessary.

&gt; Mod here. I have edited your question anyhow and provided a link for the hen's species. I have also added a generic image showing a kettle and the boiling egg and deleted all previous conversations.

I replied ""okay cool. It looks good so far. I hope someone replies to it"".

&gt; Mod here.  This question has received 1 vote for closing as ""too subjective"". This question is too vast and cannot possibly be answered by anyone.

Meanwhile my question already had a couple of upvotes and I received the following answer -  ""Are you sure you didn't shake the egg before boiling it? Maybe you were trying to spin them to check whether they were boiled but in the process upset the albumen structure.""

That's it! I chose the answer as the right answer and marked my question as answered.

&gt; Mod here. This question has been closed as ""too subjective"" based on 5 votes. There is no way of answering this question. Please modify your question so that it's less subjective and it relates to the community.

He  attempted to completely squash all churches, monasteries and friaries that remained devoutly Catholic.  While for most he could simply cut off their ability to function by seizing their assets, but the Friaries in England were mostly self-sufficient with large gardens where the Friars grew the majority of their own food while sustaining the rest on the patronage of their followers.  In protest to the King, the Friars started gifting their patrons with beautiful flowers - creating a symbol of resistance against the edicts of the King.  

Furious, Henry made a Royal decree barring Friar's from growing or gifting flowers, but the decree was completely ignored by the Friars and in fact the symbol of the flower grew more powerful.  Desperate to put an end to it, Henry called upon the most feared man in England - Hugh the Executioner.  Hugh was a special import who had made a name as a effective killing machine in France, and had been brought to England for the execution of Anne Boleyn.  A couple things made Hugh unique.  For one, he had a massive stature, but more importantly Hugh opted to use a long-sword instead of the Axe which was more common at the time.  Most terrifying of all, Hugh did not wear an executioners mask, but instead enjoyed the fact that people could recognise him as the face of death.

The king sent Hugh around to the Friaries with his royal decree, and with each Friary Hugh would bang the hilt of his long-sword against the door before attaching a copy of the decree with a sharp dagger.  Within days, the flowers disappeared from the streets and the Friaries began to shutter their doors.

What is the moral of the story?

One day, he sees a group of students in a circle whispering amongst each other. He steadily approached the group to get even a hint of the conversation, may he attempt to chime in. The group hears his awkward footsteps and simultaneously pierce him with their smug faces. Still, the boy musters his strength, swallows his spit, and asks what this secret conversation was about.

For some reason, the head of the group was not reluctant to tell him the secret. He was baffled by that.  The head of the group replied that they were speaking of a *purple cornflake*. However, to the new student's dismay, he was instructed to never speak about it anyone, ever. As soon as he was briefed the group dispersed like the creatures that disperse from under a rock when exposed to sunlight.

The new student, had alredy decided, quite hastily that he would embark on whatever endeavor needed to find the origin of the abominable *purple cornflake* that dare not be mentioned to anyone, ever! The student later on raised his hand in the middle of class and asked to approach the teacher's desk. She acknowledged, and he ran up to her. His little quivering, immature lips spit out a broken phrase of what sounded like but was definitely like, ""what's a *purple cornflake*""? The teacher, instantly enraged, told the new boy to take himself to the principal's office, and such behavior is unforgivable.

The student walked to the school's main office, and it was there in the front office, in front of everyone, he encountered the sad and cliche working class man. The principal got his rocks off by disciplining kids, and put the child on blast. He asked, "" why did your teacher send you here, boy?"" The boy replied, ""becuase I asked my teacher what a *purple cornflake* was....What's a *purple cornflake*? 

The principal instantly became enraged while deeply sickened to the point of vomiting. The principal then called the police and told him what kind of sick little monster they were dealing with. The captain himself, came down, running into the main office of the school with guns drawn. They tasered the boy and beat him tightly to break his already broken spirit. It was only till the boy awakened in his cell with the captain sitting right outside. The captain asked the boy, just why...why the child had decided to say and think such horrible things. The student persisted in saying he asked his teacher and principal what a *purple cornflake* was. He looked up at the captain with trembling eyes and asked, "" what's a *purple cornflake*?"" 

The captain stood up, opened the cell door walked up and grabbed the boy by the neck like he were a rag doll. He exclaimed that he couldn't even stand the sight of the boy, that his words made his stomach turn. The captain said he didn't even want him in the jail. 

The boy is faced with tough decisions at this point, pursuing a pointless and insignificant dream. No, he persisted that he was looking for the truth. Freedom. However, he couldn't return to his family with such shame that society had stigmatized him with. No, he stumbled into an alley where he crawled into a box with a homeless man who immediately offered his services for drugs. The child wasn't even phased, he asked the homeless man what a *purple cornflake* was with utmost prestige and confidence that surely only a war hero could possess. No, it was he, that day who possessed this pride. The homeless man put his maggot rotted hobo cheese dick back in his pants, looked up in that unforgettable disgusted face he had seen in so many others. The homeless man screamed, ""get the fuck out my box, you can't stay here, sick fuck!""

He hears an eerie voice. *""No... you are not fucked. I am the guardian spirit of this forest. Pick up a rock and throw it at the tribe's leader when they approach you. Do as I say, human.""*

Knock, knock. Who’s there? A scientist trying to find out what makes jokes funny.

A young boy enters a barber shop and the barber whispers to his customer. “This is the dumbest kid in the world. Watch while I prove it you.” The barber puts a dollar bill in one hand and two quarters in the other, then calls the boy over and asks, “Which do you want, son?” The boy takes the quarters and leaves. “What did I tell you?” said the barber. “That kid never learns!” Later, when the customer leaves, he sees the same young boy coming out of the ice cream store. “Hey, son! May I ask you a question? Why did you take the quarters instead of the dollar bill?” The boy licked his cone and replied, “Because the day I take the dollar, the game is over!”


Two campers are walking through the woods when a huge brown bear suddenly appears in the clearing about 50 feet in front of them. The bear sees the campers and begins to head toward them. The first guy drops his backpack, digs out a pair of sneakers, and frantically begins to put them on. The second guy says, “What are you doing? Sneakers won’t help you outrun that bear.” “I don’t need to outrun the bear,” the first guy says. “I just need to outrun you.” 

A guy is sitting at home when he hears a knock at the door. He opens the door and sees a snail on the porch. He picks up the snail and throws it as far as he can. Three years later there’s a knock on the door. He opens it and sees the same snail. The snail says, “What the hell was that all about?”

A guy meets a hooker in a bar. She says, “This is your lucky night. I’ve got a special game for you. I’ll do absolutely anything you want for $300 as long as you can say it in three words.” The guy replies, “Hey, why not.” He pulls his wallet out of his pocket and one at a time lays three one hundred dollar bills on the bar, and says slowly. “Paint…my….house.”

A guy dies and is sent to hell. Satan meets him, shows him doors to three rooms, and says he must choose one to spend eternity in. In the first room, people are standing in dirt up to their necks. The guy says, “No, let me see the next room.” In the second room, people are standing in dirt up to their noses. Guy says no again. Finally Satan opens the third room. People are standing with dirt up to their knees, drinking coffee and eating pastries. The guy says, “I pick this room.” Satan says Ok and starts to leave, and the guy wades in and starts pouring some coffee. On the way out Satan yells, “OK, coffee break’s over. Everyone back on your heads!”

t’s game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final, and a man makes his way to his seat right at centre ice. He sits down, noticing that the seat next to him is empty. He leans over and asks his neighbour if someone will be sitting there. “No,” says the neighbour. “The seat is empty.” “This is incredible,” said the man. “Who in their right mind would have a seat like this for the Stanley Cup and not use it?” The neighbour says, “Well actually the seat belongs to me. I was supposed to come with my wife, but she passed away. This is the first Stanley Cup we haven’t been to together since we got married.” “Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that. That’s terrible….But couldn’t you find someone else, a friend, relative or even a neighbour to take her seat?” The man shakes his head. “No,” he says. “They’re all at the funeral.”

Two old actors are sitting on a bench. One says, “How long has it been since you had a job?” The other actor says, “Thirty two years – how about you?” The first actor says, “That’s nothing. I haven’t had a job in forty years!” The other one says, “One of these days we have got to get out of this business!”

post,4jhhxl,2qh72,jokes,false,1463339731,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4jhhxl/are_you_a_monk_yet/,self.jokes,,"There was a little boy who lived in a far away land. Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.

Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there. 

One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

That night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.

The next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.

He honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.

""Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

""Well, then can I become a monk?""

""Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.""

So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk."" 

So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.

""Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?"" asked the new monk.

The head monk replied, ""The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.""

""Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.""

Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. 

Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!

Over the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.""

The new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.

Eventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. 

The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!
He had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.""

The monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.

Eventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.

Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! 

Over the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

He had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.

Slowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. 

Shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!

So, Reader, do you me to tell you what is was?

They are in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings.

The teacher asks Mr. Trump if he would like to lead the discussion of the word “Tragedy.” So he asks the class for an example of a tragedy.

One little boy stands up and offers: “If my best friend who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that would be a tragedy.”

“No,” says Mr. Trump, “that would be an accident.”

A little girl raises her hand: “If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.”

“I’m afraid not,” explains the exalted businessman. “That’s what we would call a great loss.”

The room goes silent. No other children volunteer. Mr. Trump searches the room.

“Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?”

Finally at the back of the room, a boy raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: “If a private jet carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.”

“Fantastic!” exclaims Mr. Trump, “That’s absolutely right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?”

“Well,” says the boy, “because it wouldn’t be a great loss and it probably wouldn’t be an accident either.”",Trump asks what a tragedy is...,2910

One day the dog starts chasing butterflies and before long the dog discovers that he is lost. So, wandering about, he notices a leopard heading rapidly in his direction with the obvious intention of having lunch.

The dog thinks, ""Oh boy, I'm in deep stuff now."" Then he notices some bones lying nearby on the ground and immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat.

Just as the leopard is about to leap, the dog exclaims loudly, ""That was one delicious leopard. I wonder if there are any more around here?""

Hearing this, the leopard halts his attack in mid-stride, and slinks away into the trees. ""Whew"", says the leopard. ""That was close. That dog nearly had me."" 

Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard.

So off he goes. But the dog sees him heading off after the leopard and figures that something is amiss. The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans about the dog's ruse and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard. The leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says, ""Hop on my back, monkey, and see what's going to happen to that conniving canine. ""Now the dog sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back, and thinks, ""Oh boy, it looks like I've really had it now.""

But instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to the leopard and the monkey and pretends that he hasn't seen them. And just when they get close enough to hear him, the dog says...  ""Where  is that monkey? .. I sent him off an hour ago to get me another leopard and he's still not back.""",The dog &amp; the leopard,1406

""I remember back in '44', we went on a lion hunting expedition in Africa. We were on foot and hunted for three days without seeing a thing. On the fourth day, I was so tired I had to rest. I found a fallen tree, so I laid my gun down, propped my head on the tree, and fell asleep. I don't know how long I was asleep when I was awakened by a noise in the bushes. I was reaching for my gun when the biggest lion I ever seen jumped out of the bushes at me like this, 'ROOOAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!......'
Well... I just shit my pants.""

The young men looked astonished and one of them said,
""I don't blame you, I would have shit my pants too if a lion jumped out at me.""

The old man shook his head and said,
""No, no, not then, just now when I said
'ROOOAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!'""",The Hunting Story,57
