The pastor was deep in prayer when the old man started to struggle. The old man could not talk but managed to scribble down a note and place it in the pastors breast pocket, as that was all he could reach. The man died before the pastor finished his prayer. When he finished, he decided to not read the note till the man's funeral, as the old man would have wanted.
Weeks pass and the funeral finally arrives, that the pastor was invited to. The pastor begins talking and the time comes when the pastor takes out the old note. The pastor unfolds the paper and prepares to read the old man's last words for the first time.

* Warm her up first. She's not a lawn mower that you can just turn on and off with the push of a lever.

* Touch her gently - she's a delicate flower.

* But not too gently - she wants a confident man, not a timid boy.

* Give her a masculine squeeze.

* But not too hard, you'll hurt her.

* After a while, she'll be warmed up. This can take anywhere from 30 sec. to 15 min., depending on the woman and the situation.

* Read her mind to determine when she's ready.

* Now you can move your fingers down south.

* But some women don't like that, in which case you should use your tongue instead.

* But this maneuver might make her terribly self-conscious, in which case you'll ruin everything. 

* Read her mind to determine which course of action to pursue.

* Now, if using your fingers, read her mind to determine how many fingers to utilize. 

* The preferred number is different for each 
woman, though getting this wrong can be catastrophic.

* Gently caress her.

* But don't be too gentle, you'll bore her.

* But don't be too rough, you'll hurt her.

* Alternate clitoral caressing and penetration with a frequency determined by Schrodinger in the 1942 Vienna experiments.

* If using your tongue, follow the above steps with the obvious alterations.

* Eventually, she'll be sufficiently lubed for you to penetrate her with your penis.

* When penetrating her, start with gentle, slow thrusts.

* But not too gentle and slow. Remember, a woman isn't stimulated as easily as is a man.

* Generate some significant friction.

* But not too much friction. This isn't a porno, and you don't need a hospital bill.

* Gradually increase your frequency of thrusting.

* Read your woman's mind to determine the preferred acceleration. Remember, this is rocket science.

* Magically bend your penis upward at a 45 degree angle to stimulate the G spot.

* IMPORTANT: Do not finish before her. This means that you'll have to enjoy the stimulation as little as possible until she's climaxed. 

* You'll find that, if you're good at this, you will be able to essentially numb your own pelvic sensations.

* After she's climaxed, and now that you're good and numb to the sensations, you'll have to (by some physiological miracle) enjoy the 
stimulation again so as to finish yourself.

* You must finish. Remember, if she doesn't climax, it's your fault, and if you don't climax, it's your fault.

Do you think I could stay the night?” The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. 

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. 

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?” The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.” 

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.” 

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.” The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.” 

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?” The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.” The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound. But he can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.","A man is driving down the road, and his car breaks down near a monastery",70

You’re not a monk.” The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?” The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.” The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.” The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.” The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.” The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?” The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.” The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.
The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.
After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.
So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Two men and two women faced each other. One woman was a very wealthy and sophisticatead 70 year old lady who was decked out in the finest of furs and jewelry. Next to her sat a beautiful young woman, nineteen years old—who looked like something right off the cover of a fashion magazine. Across from the older lady was a very mature looking man in his mid-fifties who was a highly decorated colonel in the air force. And next to the colonel sat a young private fresh out of boot camp.

As these four strangers travelled, they talked and chatted about trivial things until they entered an unlighted tunnel, and there they sat in complete darkness and total silence, until the sound of a distinct kiss broke the silence; following the kiss a loud slap could be heard throughout the cabin.

In the ensuing period of silence the four strangers sat quietly with their own thoughts.

The older lady was thinking, Isn’t it wonderful that even in this permissive day and age there are still young women who have a little self-respect and dignity?

The young woman, shaking her head and greatly puzzled, asked herself, Why in the world would any man in his right mind want to kiss an old fossil like that when I’m sitting here?

The colonel, rubbing his sore face, was outraged that any woman could ever think that a man in his position would try to sneak a kiss in the dark.

And the private, grinning from ear to ear, was thinking, What a crazy and mixed up world this is when a private can kiss the back of his hand and then smack a colonel in the face and get away with it!",Four strangers travelled together in the same compartment of a European train.,21

Then I started twisting the door knob.

But, I never opened it because I knew my mom would get mad.

One day, my mom was distracted with chores, and I thought this would be the perfect time to see what was on the other side of that door.

So, when I was certain that my mom was on the other side of the house leaning the kitchen, I ran over to the door.

I'll admit I was pretty nervous, but I slowly turned the doorknob and peeked through to the other side of the door.

I saw beautiful things that I had never seen before: Trees, grass, the sun, the sky....

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.

One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today.

Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.

With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. This gives two possibilities.

1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.

2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

So which is it?

If we accept the postulate given to me by Theresa during my freshman year that ""It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,"" and we take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over.

The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Theresa kept shouting, ""Oh my God.""",A chemistry student was asked to explain if heaven or hell exists on a test...,779

3) That it was small enough to make me feel cozy and at home.

post,46mxud,2qh72,jokes,false,1455917633,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/46mxud/why_i_changed_my_name/,self.jokes,,"Well, for my story to make any sense, I need to clarify that I'm somewhat of a celebrity in my country. I think even internationally people have heard about me, though I'm not too sure about it (fortunately the people who know about me also tend to be technologically a bit behind the curve, so you don't find too many of them on the internet).

Anyway, unlike many celebrities I never actually wanted to be famous - I always just wanted a quiet life, to be treated normally, have a loving family - that's basically the dream.

The worst is that I don't even have anything to say when it comes to my fame, it pretty much started out from something my parents did. I know, when you say 'celebrity' most people think of rockstars and actors or something, but that's not really my situation.

My homecountry had a bit of a terrorism problem, which you might think you understand from reading about terrorism a bit in the newspapers from time to time, but it's something entirely different when you live near it. People were scared. People were forced into the ranks of this terrorist group, they could choose, either join or die tortured and with the knowledge that you also sealed the death-sentence for your entire family. It was a pretty fucking dark chapter, that you can believe.

Well, my parents were scared aswell. They were young, still in their twenties, and were targets of this terrorism just like everyone else (maybe even more so, because my mother was an educated woman from a minority of the population). But unlike the other people they didn't back down. When asked to join and or not to oppose, they fought back, when attacked the kept on fighting, and when threatened of getting them, their family and all friends murdered, they still didn't back down.

That's the kind of people they were.

Were, because reality sadly isn't as fantastic as fiction, and reality doesn't care for its heroes. Shortly after I was born the danger became too much, they had to go into hiding, but the defense against terrorism is only as strong as the weakest link, and the weakest link in this case was a friend who caved in under the pressure. Looking back I think he was simply scared for his life and hoped that the protection offered in return for his betrayal would allow him to survive this whole mess, but I guess I'll never know. Anyway, they were found and executed.

Now, without parents I had to grow up with some relatives. But the damage was already done - my parents, their opposition to the terror in the country had given the people hope, and the death of one of leaders of the terrorists around that time only helped this sentiment. Their name, my last name, it was known all around the country, as a symbol of hope to fight against the fanatics killing the people and poisoning our nation.

So, pretty big name to live up to, right? Well, there's the thing I regularly do, but feel bad about: I disguise myself and introduce myself with a pseudonym, so people don't recognize me on the streets. I know it dishonors my family a bit, and I tried for the first 18 years of my life not to do it, but the stares I received from everyone simply grew too much to handle.

And that's why sometimes I use the last name of my godfather instead of my own, and introduce myself as 'Harrold Black' instead of 'Harry Potter'.

But yeah, what else is a person supposed to do in a situation like mine?",Why I changed my name,14

So he decides to go to the top of the World Trade Center (this is an older joke) to this famous bar to have a couple of beers and check out what must surely be, a gorgeous view.

As soon as he sits down at the bar, some guy sits right next to him, and starts talking to him..

He goes, “Hey, how you doin’?”

The tourist, a little weirded out goes, “doing good, how about you?”

“Good. You don’t look like you’re from around here..”

“Uh..yeah. It’s my first time in New York”

“Oh really? Well, I guess you haven’t heard about this bar then”

“Uhhh..well…I have, I mean..I’m here, aren’t I?”

“Yeah, but that’s not what I mean” 

Pointing at the stool the tourist is sitting on, the man says “You see that stool you’re sitting on?”
Tourist looks down.

The man says “that stool.. is from the Titanic, the ship, the actual one..”

Tourist genuinely surprised goes “Oh really?”

Man says, “Yeah. Yea.. Also, have you seen the bathroom yet?”

Tourist a little weirded out again goes, “uh..yeah”

Man says, “..well you remember that giant rock by the door? That rock..is a moon rock. It’s from one of the original Apollo missions”

Tourist genuinely surprised again now and actually happy he learned this little factoid goes, “Oh wow..that’s actually really cool, thank you for telling me”

Man says, “Yeah don’t mention it, this bar is famous because the owner likes to collect really unique and random historical artifacts and he places them all throughout his bar”

Tourist genuinely unaware of this and again happy to have learned this goes, “Oh wow, that’s awesome. I actually didn’t know that.”

Man says, “Yeah, cool right? You see that window over there?”

Tourist unsure of where this one is going, says “uhh..yeah”

“If you jump out that window…you’ll fall 10 stories, and come straight back up again through the window”

Tourist now chuckling and shaking his head to himself goes, “funny”

“No really!”

“Come on man, get the fuck outta here, I may be a tourist, but I’m not an idiot”

The man, really determined now goes “you don’t believe me? Watch this..”

The man steps up to the window, and without any hesitation jumps out..he falls 10 stories…and sure enough, he comes right back up again through the window”

The man goes to the tourist, “you see?”

The tourist genuinely flabbergasted and thinking what the fuck is going on here goes, “Wow that’s awesome, that was actually pretty cool, but obviously you have it rigged somehow. That’s impossible”

The man goes, “Still don’t believe me, huh? Ok, do this. Tie my hands together, tie my legs together, and throw me out..and watch what happens”

So the tourist ties him up, and throws him out again, and the same thing happens. The man falls 10 stories, and comes straight back up again.

The man again goes, “You see?”

The tourist is now convinced. He walks up to the window, looks down and thinks to himself, what the hell. The tourist jumps…he falls 10 stories…he falls another 10 stories….he falls ALL the way to the bottom and BOOM, he’s dead.

The man now goes back to the bar, sits on the Tourist’s stool, and finishes the rest of the Tourist’s beers and the bartender looks up at the man and goes, “You know what Superman? You’re a real jerk when you’re drunk..”

The man then pulls out of his bag a tiny piano and tiny piano player who proceeds to play Beethoven's Fur Elise.  The bartender, dumbfounded, has no other recourse except to admit that what he has just seen is indeed the most amazing thing he has ever seen in his life and tells the man that he will let him drink for free for the rest of the night.

The bartender, still completely confused by what he has just seen says to the man ""that definitely is the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life, I have to ask, where did you find this tiny piano and piano player?""

The bartender eagerly takes the lamp and rubs it, the genie pops out and says to the him ""thank you for freeing me from the lamp, I will now grant you one wish"".  The bartender says ""okay great, I wish for a million bucks"".  

Within a minute the bar is filled to the ceiling with ducks, one million of them to be exact.  The bartender, now quite annoyed exclaims ""what the heck?!

The women looked confused, but accepted the the agreement. ""How hard could it be to not step on a duck? I went decades on Earth and never stepped on one,"" said one of the women.

When the gates opened and they entered Heaven, their jaws dropped with the sight of ducks filling almost every available space in Heaven. So very carefully, they walked through Paradise on their toes, trying not to step on any ducks.

They didn't get very far before one woman stepped on a duck. Saint Peter appeared before her and said, ""I just told you we had only one rule. Like, it's only been five minutes, how did you forget already?"" And he handcuffed her to one of the most ugly men she had ever seen. The two then set off on their own, leaving the other two women to continue on.

After a few successful days (they have days in Heaven, right?) the second woman steps on one of the infinite ducks that cover Heaven. Right on cue, Saint Peter showed up and handcuffed the woman to the most hideous creature of a man she ever laid eyes on. They then went their separate ways, leaving only one woman left. 

After a solid, non-duck stepping on week, Saint Peter showed up, hastily handcuffed her to a man, and vanished once more. She looked up at her new partner to see the most gorgeous specimen of a man. Her eyes lit up and she said, ""Oh my! What did I do to ever deserve being attached to you?""

It's a scorching hot Summer day; the ceiling fans in church are on full blast, no drink to be found and many regretting the decision to don their Sunday best. The Pastor pauses to clear his dry, parched throat and continues with his sermon.  
  
Fia, sees a bulge in the Pastor's pants pocket, her eyes grow big in anticipation. Knowing exactly what it is, Fia stands up in the middle of sermon and walks up to the Pastor. She quietly asks ""escuse me Pastor sir, is soo hot, an my mouf is try. Can you kiff me a cum, please?""  
  
The Pastor, puzzled, politely asks Fia, ""I beg your pardon, my dear Fia?""  
  
Fia, becoming irate from the heat, lifts an eye brow. ""I need cum. Please kiff me. I see in your pocket"" making a poking motion with her pointer finger to her gaping mouth.  
  
The Pastor, surprised and blushing, asks Fia to calm down. ""Fia, I'm sorry, but I...this is not appropriate in the house of God"" says the Pastor.  
  
Already frustrated, Fia shouts ""TONE...BE...A..STUPIT! You know what I talk about! I see in your panty! Is *this* lonk (long), is firm, you take out to put in mouf to make it wet!"" The Pastor, trembling in disbelief grabs the podium as he falls to his knees.  
  
Fia, losing all of her patience grabs the Pastor at the crotch. ""Kiff me now! Creedy man, be Holy in front Cod an share you cums!"" The Pastor faints and tumbles down the stairs to the floor. The entire assembly and choir standing erect in shock and horror of everything unfolding in front of them.

They loaded their camels to the point where they could hardly walk and then filled their own pockets to the brim. As they exited the tomb and cleared the last of the treasure, they uncovered some hieroglyphics scrawled menacingly by the side of the entrance. It read: ""Cursed shall be all who disturb this sanctum"". Choosing riches over some bullshit warning, they scoffed at the message and left with their treasure. 

The first brother immediately bought his way into the higher echelons of political power and had more authority and power than he could ever dream of. However, after a fortnight, his dessicated remains were found in his chambers, with no explanation of what happened. 

The second brother took the treasure and traveled the world. A month after the first brother died, the second brother's dessicated remains were found in a brothel thousands of miles away. 

The third brother, wary that the curse was indeed real, used his money to create a massive fortress with the strongest walls the engineers could build and the most security money could buy. Late one night in his chambers, he heard wailing and screaming coming from the entrance to his compound. Peering through the small slit in the window to his bedroom, he saw the guards fleeing and a massive black shape hovering slowly through the air. As it reached the door, it smashed through the front entrance without slowing down at all, still hovering. As the third brother scrambled towards the rear of his chambers towards the bathroom, he saw that the floating object was a sarcophagus; the same one from the tomb they robbed. He cried and screamed out helplessly as the coffin soared in the air towards him, his back now in the very rear of his bathroom. Frantically, he reached around for anything to throw at the object and he grabbed everything from his comb to the wastebasket to ripping the mirror off the wall, but the object still sped towards him. Finally, he grabbed a cough drop from the edge of his sink and threw it at the coffin and the coffin stopped.",Three Egyptian brothers raided a tomb...,0

We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except …” said the old man, and then he stopped. “Except what?” asked the businessman. “Nothing, nothing,” said the old man. “C’mon, tell me! I need something!” protested the businessman. “Well, sir, I don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘voodoo dick,’” the old man said. “So what’s up with this voodoo dick?” the businessman asked.  The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols.  He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo.  The businessman laughed, and said, “Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!” The old man said, “But you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.” He pointed to a door and said “Voodoo dick, the door.” The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole.  The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle.  Before the door could split, the old man said, “Voodoo dick, get back in your box!” The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more. The businessman said, “I’ll take it!” The old man resisted and said it wasn’t for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash.  The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, “Voodoo dick, my pussy.” He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.  After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny.  She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said “Voodoo dick, my pussy!”  The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping.  It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting.  She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked.  Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off.  So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help.  She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo.   On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman.  He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink.  Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn’t been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn’t stop screwing. The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, “Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!”",Voodoo Dick,40
