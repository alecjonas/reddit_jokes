Golgatha was a grand hill, and as the cross was raised Jesus looked down upon all those gathered before him.

He saw his wonderful mother Mary.
He saw gods children.
He saw Jerusalem in all its glory.

But his eyes finally fell on his good friend and disciple Peter.

""Peteeer"", he called through painful breaths, ""Peeteerr"".

Peter, the must loyal of all Jesus's follows, jumped in shock. He began to run toward Jesus.

""Yes my lord?"", Peter replied.

But as soon as he began to get close the Romans roared ""NO!"", and viciously chopped off poor Peters Legs.

Peter, wallowing in pain, heard his messiah call him again, ""Peeetteeer...peeter"", growing more faint with each call.

So once again Peter tried, crawling with his arms...pulling as hard as he could.

Suddenly, more sharp Roman swords fell upon him. They took his arms this time, leaving him limbless. But as he lay there, face down in the mud, Peter heard the Son of God once more, ""Peeteer"".

So Peter rolled this time with all his might, reaching the bottom of the cross. ""Yes my lord, Yes, Yes"", he screamed with anticipation, ""how can I serve you?""

And in his fading breaths, whimpering and quiet, Jesus replied

""Peeter...Peter...I..I can see your house from here!"".

Quick as I can I run straight back to the park, find the same rock and there he is, so I start to apologise ""Mate, I'm so sorry, I had no idea frogs could be magic, I checked the numbers and you were right!! I'm so sorry, can you find it in your heart to forgive me, and tell me next week's winning numbers?""

I can get them, whatever you want, I'll do it!"" The frog seems pleased and says ""What about a wee stroke, will you give me a wee stroke on the head?"" I'm like ""Of course mate! Anything you want"" and give him a wee stroke on the head. He's like ""That was great, thanks. Now how about a wee kiss on the head? Would that be ok?"" I'm like well this is a little weird but fvck it it's lots of money so I give him a kiss on the head, and he says ""Right that was fantastic. One last thing, and I'll tell you all the lottery numbers you want - I want you to fvck me. Really fvck me"" Okaaaaay. Well, this isn't what I'd planned, but, it's a roll-over jackpot, it would change my life, for like 5 minutes of weirdness we're talking overnight multi-millionaire, right fvck it I'll do it!

Now, this king had a daughter, the most beautiful young woman in the entire world. As she grew to the age when suitors started appearing, the king grew paranoid that she would be whisked away by some secret lover in the dead of night, never to be seen again.   
To stop this happening, the king stationed three guards outside her door every night to watch over her.  
However, he began to grow suspicious of the guards themselves, thinking that they were sleeping with his darling girl. He was correct - every night, the guards would go in to the princess's chamber one by one, have crazy, vigourous sex with her and then leave to allow the next guard in.  
The king came up with a failsafe plan to catch the guards. One night, he slipped his daughter a temporary sleeping pill at dinner and put her to bed, soundly asleep. As he was tucking her in, he placed ground glass shards inside and around her vagina, hidden from view. He then left, stationed the guards outside her door, and went to bed.  
As soon as they were sure it was safe, the first guard went inside the room, and a few moments later the two guards outside heard an agonised scream from inside. The guard came stumbling out crutching his crotch. Too proud to admit what had happened, and not wanting to be the only one, he told the other two that he'd never had better sex, that it was absolutely incredible tonight.  
The second guard rubbbed his hands in excitement and went in. The same thing happened. A few moments later, he let out a muffled, agonised scream and came running out of the room, also holding his crotch. As the first guard, he was too proud to admit what had happened, so he told the third guard (who by now was super excited) that she was feeling super freaky tonight and it was an incredible experience.  
The third guard ran in, and the other two stayed outside, waiting for the scream, but there was nothing. Just absolute silence.

The next morning, the king called all three guards to his throne room. He asked the first guard to drop his pants. He did so, and his penis was covered with glass, blood, completely shredded. The king smiled, and ordered his head be cut off.  
Then the king called up the second guard, and told him to drop his pants. The same thing happened - but worse. His penis was actually fully split down the middle, covered in shards of glass and blood. The king smiled, and ordered his head be cut off.  
Finally, the king turned to the third guard, and told him to drop his pants. Fully expecting to see another mangled penis, the king was taken aback when he saw a perfectly intact specimen of a penis, gloriously free of blood and glass. Furiously, the king screamed ""HOW DID YOU MANAGE THIS?! WHAT DID YOU DO!?""  
The guard just looked mornfully at him, and replied ""Mmmff mfffmmff mmfff...""",[LONG][STORY][NSFW] The King's Daughter's Guards,11

""How much?"" the accountant asked. 

""100 euros."" 

The accountant was stunned and the look of shock registered with the street-worker. 

""See that hotel? It's mine, I bought it with money from giving hand jobs. Want to take a look inside?""

The hotel was impressive and the accountant couldn't say no. 

The hand job was spectacular. He erupted and lit a cigarette; he had never smoked before. They stood at the open window smoking when curiosity got the better of the young man.

""How much for a blow job?""

""500 euros.""

""That's absurd. No way."" 

""Look out the window. See all the nice buildings on this street? I bought them with money from blowjobs.""

The accountant did the math. The blowjob was truly out of this world. It was several minutes before he could muster the energy to ask:

""How much for sex?""

""Let's go up to the roof.""

The Genie grants him his wish. When the Mexican gets home he gets a glass out of the cupboard and pisses in it.

 He looks at the glass and it's clear. Looks like tequila. Then he smells the liquid. Smells like tequila. So, he takes a taste and it is the best tequila he has ever tasted. 

The Mexican yells to his wife, ""Consuelo, Consuelo, come quickly!"" She comes running down the hall and the Mexican takes another glass out of the cupboard and pisses into it.

 He tells her to drink, it is tequila.? Consuelo is reluctant but goes ahead and takes a sip.

 It is the best tequila she has ever tasted.

 The two drink and party all night. The next night the Mexican comes home from work and tells his wife to get two glasses out of the cupboard.

He proceeds to piss in the two glasses. The result is the same, the tequila is excellent and the couple drink until the sun comes up.

 Finally Friday night comes and the Mexican comes home and tells his wife,

 ""Consuelo grab one glass from the cupboard and we will drink tequila."" 

His wife gets the glass from the cupboard and sets it on the table.

Suddenly, a coyote ran into the road ahead of her!  Slamming on the brakes, the woman was astounded to see a man come running from out of the darkness toward the coyote.  In one smooth motion, the strange man took his pants down, grabbed the coyote by it's back legs and began furiously sodomizing the poor creature.  Shocked beyond words, the woman went around the man as quickly as possibly and drove on.  
Speeding toward some lights in the distance, she discovered a bar with a sheriffs  car parked outside.  
""It figures"", she thought, and resolved to go inside and file a complaint.  On a rocking chair near the door, an old man was sitting and masturbating openly.  Horrified, she stomped into the bar and straight away went up to the sheriff, who was sitting at the bar.  She shouted at the sheriff:  
""What sort of town are you running here?!  You've got people running around the desert fucking coyotes, and- and just outside there was an old man masturbating openly!  How can you explain this?!""  
The sheriff sipped his beer and said, ""Ah well, you can't expect him to catch a coyote at his age""         ",The worst joke I can remember [nsfw] Warning: this joke is long and terrible,6780

Later, Barry was getting into bed when he realized he now had only eight

She agreed, then afterward she rolled over and fell asleep.

Barry, however, heard the clock ticking in his head, and he tossed and
turned until he was down to only four more hours.

He tapped his wife on the shoulder to wake her up. 'Honey, I only have 
four hours left! Could we...?'

Let's rather read up on the victims instead, appreciate what they were living for, and cherish the fact that we are lucky enough to have yet one more day to live and love. The day we put ourselves in one's shoes is the day we learn to care for one another (unless their shoes were blown away by blast).",#prayfor hashtags,0

Arnaldo mulls this over and retorts ""I don't really know what to ask for... But I have always wanted to touch your wife's breast.""

Giuseppe, in an angry outburst yells ""I can't help you with that!""

""But Arnaldo, that is my wife! I couldn't possibly let you do that.""

""It is the only request I can think of! What of I offered you $5000 to touch-a your wife's bazooms?"" replied Arnaldo

""No, that is simply asking too much.""

""Fine... How about $10,000 to touch your wife's breast?""

Giuseppe thinks about this, 10 grand is a lot of money

""It is still too much"" he decides

Arnaldo decides to pull out all the stops
""I will give you $25,000, in cash, to touch your wife's breast!""

So Giuseppe brings in his beautiful wife, tits absolutely spilling out of her top. He talks her into filling his brothers dying wish to which she agrees.

She takes of her shirt and bra, leans over Arnaldo and let's him fool around. 

Arnaldo is loving it, but after a bit he started looking upset and saying ""I don't know... I don't knowwwww...""

About ten seconds into this odd respond, Giuseppe finally screams at his brother ""Arnaldo! Why do you keep saying 'I don't know, I don't know'?!""

The same happens with her as the first woman, except some mornings he almost catches her. This continues for a week, at the end of which he, as suspected, he weighs 15 pounds less. 
Excited about this success, and the thoights of maybe catching up on one of the beautiful women, he decides to do The Master Program! But before he signs up, he is required to sign a waiver and is warned about the intensity of this plan. 
Still he signs up.

Lauderdale made a wrong turn and came nose to nose with a United 727. An irate female ground controller lashed out at the US Air crew, screaming: “US Air 2771, where the hell are you going? I told you to turn right onto Charlie taxiway! You turned right on Delta! Stop right there. I know it’s difficult for you to tell the difference between C and D, but get it right!” 

Continuing her rage to the embarrassed crew, she was now shouting hysterically: “God! Now you’ve screwed everything up! It’ll take forever to sort this out! You stay right there and don’t move till I tell you to! You can expect progressive taxi instructions in about half an hour, and I want you to go exactly where I tell you, when I tell you, and how I tell you! You got that, US Air 2771?”

“Yes, ma’am,” the humbled crew responded. Naturally, the ground control communications frequency fell terribly silent after the verbal bashing of US Air 2771. Nobody wanted to chance engaging the irate ground controller in her current state of mind. 

Tension in every cockpit out around Gatwick was definitely running high. Just then an unknown pilot broke the silence and keyed his microphone, asking: “Wasn’t I married to you once?”

At one of several social conventions held to further this goal, a human couple and an alien couple meet and discuss their common traits. They eventually decide to swap mates for the evening; the human man going home with the female alien, and the human woman going back to her hotel room with the male alien. 

Upon arrival, the human woman and the male alien disrobe... and with some dismay, the woman sees that her companion has an incredibly small penis.

""I don't think this is going to work,"" she says. ""It's just too short.""

The male alien grins. ""That's no problem!"" He smacks himself in the forehead a few times... and with each blow, his member extends by several centimeters.

""Wow!"" the woman replies. ""Only, now it's far too thin.""

Once again, the male alien offers a smile. This time, he pulls on his ears, and his shaft swells in circumference with each tug. Thoroughly impressed, the woman leaps onto the male alien, and the two of them spend the night in ecstasy.

The next morning, the human woman joins her husband for breakfast. 

""So,"" he asks, ""how was it for you?""

""I'm not going to lie,"" the woman responds, ""it was pretty amazing. How was it for you?""

The man seems to wince at the memory. ""Honestly, it was pretty bad. All I got out of it was a headache and sore ears.""","First ""Contact""",16

The driver is a real jerk, steps out of his car and comes striding toward the officer, demanding to know why he is being harassed by the Gestapo!

So the officer calmly tells him of the red light violation. The motorist instantly goes on a tirade, questioning the officer's ancestry, sexual orientation, etc., in rather explicit offensive terms.

The tirade goes on without the officer saying anything.

When the officer finishes writing the ticket he puts an ""AH"" in the lower right corner of the narrative portion of the ticket. He then hands it to The 'violator' for his signature. The guy signs the ticket angrily, and when presented with his copy points to the ""AH"" and demands to know what it stands for.

The officer says, ""That's so when we go to court, I'll remember that you're an asshole!""

Two months later they're in court. The 'violator' has a bad driving record with a high number of points and is in danger of losing his license, so he hired a lawyer to represent him.

On the stand the officer testifies to seeing the man run through the red light.

Under cross examination the defense attorney asks, ""Officer is this a reasonable facsimile of the ticket that you issued to my client?""

Officer responds, ""Yes, sir, that is the defendant's copy, his signature and mine, same number at the top.""

Lawyer, ""Officer, is there any particular marking or notation on this ticket you don't normally make?""

""Yes, sir, in the lower right corner of the narrative there is an ""AH,"" underlined.""

""What does the ""AH"" stand for, officer?""

""Aggressive and hostile, Sir.""

""Aggressive and hostile?""

""Yes, Sir.""

""Officer, are you sure it doesn't stand for asshole?""

""Well, sir, you know your client better than I do.""

The doctor leads Smith into emergency room where his newborn baby is lying on a hospital bed. The doctor lifts the baby an inch above the bed and drops it.

Smith: Hey what the hell man!

Doctor: No no I swear he can fly, watch.

The doctor lifts the baby again, this time a couple feet above the bed and again, drops the baby.

THUD

Smith: That's enough of this doc, your starting to piss me off.

Doctor: I swear to you he can fly, just watch.


This time the doctor opens the window and throws the baby from the window into the parking lot. The baby crashes into a windshield, shattering it with a loud crash.

Smith grabs the doctor by the collar, fuming with anger. Just as he swings his fist back the doctor bursts out in laughter.

Doctor: Hahaha I'm just joshing ya, it was a stillborn.","A man is at work when he receives a call from the hospital, where his pregnant wife is.",11

The guy sitting next to him can’t believe what he just saw. He’s more surprised when, 10 minutes later, the same guy walks back into the bar and sits down next to him.

The astonished onlooker asks, “How did you do that? I just saw you jump out the window, and we’re hundreds of feet above the ground!”

The jumper responds by slurring, “Well, I don’t get it either. I slam a shot of tequila, and when I jump out the window, the tequila makes me slow down right before I hit the ground. Watch.” He takes a shot, goes to the window and jumps out.

The other guy runs to the window and watches as the guy falls to just above the sidewalk, slows down and lands softly on his feet. A few minutes later, the jumper walks back into the bar.

The other guy has to try it, too, so he orders a shot of tequila. He slams it and jumps out the window. As he reaches the bottom, he doesn’t slow down at all. SPLAT!
The first guy orders another shot of tequila. The bartender shakes his head. “You’re really an a**hole when you’re drunk, Superman.”",Not everything is as it seems!,0

I notice Bob, one of our residents, is feeding a dollar into the change machine. ""Jackpot!"" he says as he collects his quarters. This goes on pretty much all day. Bob even came up and turned in about $100 worth of quarters into dollar bills throughout the day. Each and every time he'd feed in a dollar, we'd hear ""Jackpot!"" ring out with glee. It was awesome at first, seeing how excited he was, but it got a bit annoying towards the end of the day. He must have finally either emptied the machine, or gotten tired towards the end of my shift, as he finally stopped. 

The next day, when I came into work, I saw a tech working on the change machine. I asked him if anything was wrong. He says to me, ""I would hope so. The damned thing has been giving out 8 quarters for every dollar!""

So he went up the high mountains where he found three older shepherds with a big flock of sheep, and asked them to show him the ropes. The shepherds agreed.
 
The young man spent a week with them. One evening by the fire he asked casually,""So how do you guys get by with no women around here?"" Said one of the men,""Why, with so many sheep around, who needs women?"" The youngster shuddered: ""Yak!  How horrible!  How can you...?"" The three men only smiled and said nothing.

Another week passed and one morning the young man realized that the tension in his groin had grown unbearable. He remembered what the men had said, and looking at the sheep, thought, ""Hmm, why not after all..."". He chose a moment when none of the older shepherds were around, and grabbed one of the nearest sheep. However, the others showed up in a minute, and seeing him with the sheep burst out laughing.

""What? What?!!"", shouted the young man, blushing. ""You told me that's what you did yourselves, didn't you??!""

He had finally been granted R&amp;R and was on a train bound for London. The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat. 

The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog. The war weary soldier asked, ""Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?"" 

The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my Little Fifi is using that seat?"" 

The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog. 

Again he asked, ""Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired."" 

The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!"" 

The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat. 

The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, ""You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road.

Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.

The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:

You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.

Late that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled.

He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.

He went back to th
