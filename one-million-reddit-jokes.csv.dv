My genitals are so sweetly intoxicating, I was able to convince Cornel West and Camille Paglia to violently disrobe and vigorously copulate with me in a Chablis-fueled, mind-bending threesome that made the seraphim in paradise blush with a mixture of shame and desire! 

My genitals are so leviathan that Ahab himself, if he were rendered a non-fictional creature, would surely stand upon his masts crows nest and lob mighty harpoons at me! 

If the teaming masses were to behold my juggernaut-like genitals, surely Marx's concept of the End of History would be nigh. 

My genitals are of such behemoth proportions, it is to the world of genitalia what Noam Chomsky is to the study of global activism! 

My genitals are so mammoth in size, that if inches were words, my member could fill every page of one of Ayn Rand's epic Objectivist tomes! 

A fine 1997 Chateau-La Cardonne Bordeaux would go well with my robust and flavorful genitals, even after the third helping! 

My genitals are so bursting with sexual magnetism, I could single-handedly seduce and defile the entire lesbian population of Sarah Lawrence University! 

My genitals bloat with such passionate force, that upon arousal, I barely have enough epidermis to purse my lips so that I may recite Shelley's immortal poem ""Ozymandias""! 

If Philip Glass wrote an ambient opera in honor of my genitals, the title of the epic collection of random notes and sounds would be ""Phantasmagoric Ode To Big Dong Number Five.""! 

Hemingway''''s lost book about my genitals began thusly: ""His organ was big."" 

My virility is so profoundly cosmic, that in the event that every human male were to cease to be, my limitless supplies of genetically super-human semen could impregnate the remaining female population, thus siring a perfect race of confident, and impressively endowed men! 

Tired Freudian references aside - your mother played my mighty skin flute like a surf crowned sea nymph trying to rouse Poseidon from his watery slumber! 

Kurt Anderson secretly admires the cultural relevancy of my genitals, which have supplied artists and writers alike the inspiration needed to create great American works, and this admiration turned to sour envy when he ignored my zippered muse and wrote that appalling ""Turn of the Century"" that many have mistakenly referred to as a ""novel""! 

So colossal are my genitals, that they compelled Stephen Hawking to theorize that my sexual gravity is such that a tablespoon of it would weigh more than an entire LA club full of amorous, cocaine-addled, Prada-clad Casanovas! 

My genitals are comparable to Harvard University’s endowment - both are the largest of their kind, both are institutions that demand the respect of academics and undergraduate trollops, and both cannot be seen or used by anyone of low birth or intelligence, unless they work very hard to prove they are worthy.",Highbrow Genital Humor-oldie but a goodie,6

The father searched high and low for a red Mercedes and he couldn't find one, so he bought his son a blue Mercedes and his son was happy.

The father again searched everywhere for a red Mercedes bu he couldn't find one so he got his son a purple Mercedes. Now the son was getting angry as to why his father couldn't find a red Mercedes anywhere.

The son got extremely pissed off as to why his father could not fulfill his one request and he started rebelling and wasting his family's money. The father also went into depression because of his failure to satisfy his son's desire and it affected his work and it wasn't long before he drove his empire to the ground and became broke.

There was a Mercedes showroom across the road and a red Mercedes was on display. They decided to get a closer look at the car that had destroyed their lives.

See, he'd spent the last 25 years cataloging every single dance performed by every group in the world. Polish Bogarodzicas. Sioux Buckskin dances to Seminole Green Corn dances. Inuit dances to the whales, Ghanaian Kpanlongo, Finnish step-dance. All of it. And he's found himself in Australia, recording the last one of all. A Wungubal in the north, performed by a small group of Aborigines. He taped it. He wrote it down. He was finally finished.

He's had a few beers to celebrate this, and the bartender asks what he's celebrating. The professor tells him, and also decides to buy the bar a round.

A quiet man in a black suit and a bowler hat comes up to the bar, puts his hand on the anthropologist's shoulder, and whispers into his ear...

""You seen the *Butcher* dance yet, mate?""

The professor admits he hasn't. But since he's seen every dance, he's sure he's taped it somewhere. The gentleman in the hat says, ""Noooooo, my friend. If you've seen it, you would remember it. It's only performed by this one tribe. Deep, deep, deep in the bush. Done by the Barrabarra tribe.""

""But the Barrabarra have been extinct for half a century!""

""No, mate. There's 30 of them left. And they're the last ones to do the Butcher dance.""

The professor puts down his beer, runs to the car to get his film crew, and they ask the man for directions. He just NEEDS to see the Butcher dance. The directions are long and winding, and they tend to go on geological features instead of any compass readings. Pages and pages of directions.

""Pass a stone shaped like a dead woman's hand. Climb into the valley cut by the knife of the gods. Walk 20 miles by the light of the brightest star..."" etc.

They begin their trek. Days pass.

The better part of their sound equipment falls and shatters while they're climbing a gorge. After two weeks, he loses his first cameraman. Taipan bit him, and they were too far out to get any antidote. This utter tragedy only inflames the professor's desire, the price he must pay to see the mysterious Butcher dance. Their nights are freezing, their days are burned by the sun. And they finally come upon a fire within a circle of walled stone, surrounded by 30 shadowy figures.

The head of the tribe approaches, a gleam in his eye. His speech is thick and hypnotizing, an accent never heard on this earth.

""Youuuu....want to seeeee....the *Butcher dance*, hey?""

The professor nods.

""We do the Butcher dance. We did it last night.""

They start to set up the camera. The chief says, ""but. We only do it. Once. Per. Year.""

A hush.

I mean, the professor knows not to argue. He knows he shouldn't make a scene. He's done this thousands of times. But he's never lost a friend, he's never come this far, he's never been this sunburned. With heavy heart, he stalks away in silence.

He gets a flight home. He sees his wife and children. He gets on with his life.

Months pass, but the dreams don't stop. He knows he will live a life of hollowness, a life of filling an unending hole, unless he can see this dance.

Against the advice of every friend he's ever had, he books a flight to Australia the next year. He even gets some of his old crew to come along. They're excited, they're ready, there's the spirit in the air of ""well, we've come this far!""

And the excitement fades when they begin their trek.

It's every bit as hard as last time. In fact, due to a sudden sandstorm, they are delayed a full day. There's the chance that they'll miss it, that the dance won't be performed for another year.

Covered in bites and sand and blood, they stagger into the circle of walled stone. There are the 30 figures. There is the fire. A drum is pounding, pounding up to the stars. The chief sees the professor and grins.

""We doing it tonight. I thought I'd see you. Prepare....for the *Butcher dance.*""

The cameras are set up.

The sound is rolling.

The drums reach a monumental crescendo, mingling with their fevered heartbeats.

The chief pulls out a massive machete. He grabs a chicken that had been running around and he whocks off its head. He takes the still-moving body and slides the neck up his right arm. Bright crimson blood shines in the fire light. He does it on his other arm. He does it on his forehead. The drums fall silent.

The chief begins to sing. He sings...

...""Yooooooooou....""

...

...""Yooooooooou....""

It said “Chinese torture number 2: Rock tied to right testicle.” The man started to panic. He decided to jump out the window with the rock because a few broken bones is better than a castration.

""This hotel has an Olympic-sized pool, a gymnasium, a sauna and a huge conference centre, which are all available for use,'' he said.
""But I didn't use them,'' she protested.

""But I didn't go to any shows,'' she protested again.
""Well, you could have,'' the manager replied.
Since the manager would not be moved, she wrote out a cheque and handed it over.
""But madam,'' said the manager,""this cheque is made out for only $200.''

&amp;nbsp;
  
Once their pirate ship was alongside the merchant vessel however, the pirates wouldn't then go all cannons and cutlass on their prey. Instead, they would signal over to the merchant vessel, offering to repair the damage to their ship for but a small fee. Having barely survived the storm and taking in more water than they could bail, the crew of the merchant vessels would readily agree.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
Once payment had been made, the Pirate Captain would send five of his own crew to board the merchant vessel, along with a large wooden crate of tools. They would then proceed below decks and start work.

&amp;nbsp;

Unbeknownst to the crew of the merchant vessel, two of the Captain's most stealthiest pirates were hiding in the large wooden crate of tools. Once below decks, they would pop out and get to work too, raiding the hold of the merchant vessel and taking all the valuables, jewels and gold pieces they could get their hands on. 

&amp;nbsp;

Quickly tossing their spoils into the large wooden crate, the other two would then work alongside the other five once the crate was full. When the repairs were complete and the seven crewmen had returned with the crate full of booty, the pirate ship would depart as swiftly as it had arrived, before the the crew of the merchant vessel noticed anything was missing.

John has three kids named Carl, Sally, and Paul. John also has a wife named Suzan. Unfortunately, Suzan, Carl, Sally, and Paul don’t like John very much. John also has no friends. John is a very lonely man. He does have this one thing going for him though, he is SUPER rich. John is absolutely loaded. He has so much money he doesn’t have to work and is set for life. So since John is loaded he decides one day he is going on vacation to the Sahara Desert. He buys a ticket and flies out to the desert where he rents a dune buggy and a bottle of water. So, John goes out on his top of the line dune buggy and starts having the time of his life going up and down the sand dunes. He’s going so fast up and down the dunes but then, it goes wrong. He accidentally veers off course and tips his buggy. He starts rolling down the hill at super high speeds. When John gets to the bottom of the sand dune he gets thrown from his now upside down dune buggy. When he gathers his bearings and tries to stand back up. He realizes he now has a concussion and he can’t see very well. He also has hurt arms and legs. But, he’s not an idiot right? So he gets up besides the pain and he starts walking. He doesn’t make it very far however and he eventually falls to his hands and knees and he starts crawling just trying to get any where but there. He eventually collapses to his stomach and just can’t carry himself anymore. So he starts dragging himself on his stomach. The next time he looks up he sees this big white pillar with a white lever on it. On the lever he sees a big green snake. The snake starts to speak and this is what he says... 

Snake: Hi I’m Nate the snake. I’m here to help you John

John: Oh great now I’m hallucinating. What’s new?

S: No your not hallucinating. I’m real and I’m gonna help you. I’ll give you three wishes

J: Yeah yeah sure, what’s the catch?

S: There are two rules. The first rule is you can’t wish for a materialistic item. It can’t be something you can physically hold. The second rule is that if you want the wishes you have to promise to come back here sometime before you die and flip this big lever. The lever will end all of humanity. Do you want the wishes?

J(still thinking it’s a hallucination): Sure why not. My first wish is to not be thirsty anymore. 

S: Ok John. I will do you one better. You don’t have to drink water anymore as long as you eat your fruits and vegetables you’ll get all the water you need just from that. 

J: Wow that’s great! I don’t feel thirsty any more! My second wish is to not be injured anymore. 

S: I’ll do you one better. I’ll heal you up so well that you will love for as twice as long as you would have before. 

John stands up and stretches his arms and legs a little bit

J: Wow this is incredible! I feel fantastic! Ok my last wish is to not be lost because I have no idea where I am

S: Ok I’ll do you one better. You will know never be lost ever again no matter where you are

J: Wow this is the most amazing thing I’ve ever see! Thanks Nate the snake. 

John turns to leave with newfound hope and energy when Nate the snake stops him. John turns back around and asks Nate the snake what’s wrong. 

S: Man I’m so lonely out here I don’t have any friends. Will you be my friend?

John quickly agrees to be his friend since he saved his life. Then they exchange numbers and John leaves on his merry way. 

A few years later John gets a call from Nate the snake. 

S: John I need a favor. My son Sam the Snake is with me and I can’t be a good father to him while he’s with me. I’m stuck out here and I was wondering if you would use your huge stacks of money to take him on a vacation around the world?

J: Sure I’ll take Sam the snake on an adventure around the world. You are my only friend after all. 

S: Thanks man I appreciate that. 

So John flies back out the Sahara Desert, picks up Nate the snakes son, Sam the snake, and leaves again. They go all around the world to places like Beijing, Tokyo, Los Vegas and other new and amazing places. John and Nate the snakes son, Sam the snake are having so much fun together when they get an unexpected call. John answers the phone and it’s Nate the snake again!

S: Hey John I need you here. I’ve got this weird snake disease that’s gonna kill me, and I want you here with me when I die.

John quickly tells him he’ll be there and rushes towards the nearest airport with Nate the snakes son Sam the snake. They buy a ticket to the desert and fly out. When they get there John buys the fastest dune buggy he can and starts flying out over the sand dunes again. In his rush however, John accidentally speeds up too much and is about to lose control of his dune buggy for the second time. This time however he knows not to turn the wheel too fast. Then John sees the pillar in the distance. John obviously doesn’t want to hit the lever or he’ll end humanity. So what he decides to do is slowly turn the wheel to avoid the lever. Then, however, John sees something he didn’t see before. Nate the snake has moved himself from the big lever, to a tree growing next to it. John realizes that he has to make a choice. Does he end humanity? Or does he kill his best friend Nate the snake? John has to decide, humanity or his friend? He doesn’t know what to do, and Nate the snakes son, Sam the snake is crying in the seat next to him because he knows what’s happening too. Then John comes to a realization. He made his choice and he says to himself:

He figured he'd be fine, but the sand made his engine lock up.

After it had passed, he went out in search for help. The storm disoriented him and blew away his car tracks. He figured he couldn't be that far from any town, so he started walking.

He walked for hours. The sun started setting, and he was no closer to civilization. He couldn't see his car anymore, and figured he'd be better off waiting till morning to continue. He found a shady spot and layed down. When he woke up he was even more disoriented. He kept going, hoping he'd find something soon.

Eventually he found himself in a large flat empty plain. He saw something in the middle of it, but he couldn't tell what it was. He kept walking towards it until it was clear; in the middle of the desert was a large tilted pole, on top of which was a snake.

""Who are you?"" he asked, examining it.

""I am Nate the snake. I am the guardian of this lever."" he replied.

So it's a lever, he thought. He couldn't tell if this was a hallucination. It felt real. He wasn't dead. But more pressing, he was talking to a snake, and even worse, the snake spoke!

""You can talk!?""

""Of course I can. I was placed here eons ago to guard this lever.""

He had many questions. Who placed him there? Why? What does the lever do? How does he talk? Where am I? But all he could think of was,

""So your name is Nate?""

""That's right.""

It has to be heatstroke, he thought. No way is a snake here talking to me! But it was, and he was healthy as a horse. A little dehydrated, but nothing fatal.

""Are you real?""

""Of course I am."" the snake replied.

""So why are you on top of this lever?""

""Well, it's the lever that kills all of humanity. Must guard it from the wrong hands!""

""How does that work?"" He asked.

""I'm not sure. All I know is that if it's pushed, all humans will perish."" Nate the snake replied.

At this point he figured it was time to head on, he didn't exactly have a need to kill all humans.

""Do you know where the nearest town is?""

""Of course. It's about 10 miles that way"" he said, pointing with his tail.

""Alright, well, thank you."" he said, before heading off.

Sure enough, there was a town not 10 miles from where the snake was, where he found a local tow truck rental that would allow him to rescue his car. The next morning, after sleeping at a local inn, he set off in a small tow truck to find if the snake had been real. Personally, he'd like to thank him for saving his life, as he wouldn't have found the town otherwise.

As he summitted the last dune, he could see the snake in the distance, 10 feet away from the pillar, devouring a small animal. Just then, the sand started to give way and his tires lost all grip. He was sliding down at an alarming rate, and knew he only had time to make a split second decision, as he was aiming directly for the lever! So he ripped the wheel to the side, and with all his might, hit the gas, moving his trajectory away from the lever, but now he was aiming towards the snake! All he could think to say in this tense moment was,

""Better nate than lever!""

Thank you",A man was offroading in the desert.,10

Not quite satified he decides to see if the second hole will have similar results, so he moves to the second hole and again he's gripped tight and the feelings wash over him, 30 minutes later he's released but still not satified.

Knowing what is in store he moves over to the 3rd hole and shoves his dick in, instantly he's gripped much tighter like he couldn't pull away if he wanted and the feelings of bliss roll over him, he loses count of the amount of times he ejaculates and after an hour and a half is released and he falls into the more peaceful sleep he's ever experienced.

In the morning the farmer comes to wake him and his dick has swollen to 3 times the size and is black and bruised, ""Put your dick in the holes didn't ya?""

But suddenly the conversation took a turn, and things started getting weird...

She goes on to explain in great detail as to why she does not have her wallet and is unable to pay for the bus ticket. Evidently she had an unstable living situation and had to flee her home with just the clothing on her back and her phone. Her story seemed legit, so I asked her how much the ticket was.

""It'll be about $3.50."" she replies. 

It was about at that time I realized that she was not at all the young lady I thought she was, but rather an eighty foot tall crustacean from the pedadoic era.

post,c39ki2,2qh72,jokes,false,1561117559,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/c39ki2/long_anger_management/,self.jokes,,"Ok, this is really long but when you finished reading, you'll have a great Lige Protip. 

When you occasionally have a really bad day, and you just need to take it out on someone, don't take it out on someone you know, take it out on someone you don't know.I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I'd forgotten to make. I found the number and dialed it.

A man answered, saying ""Hello.""I politely said, ""This is Chris. Could I please speak with Robyn Carter?""Suddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear ""Get the right f***ing number!"" and the phone was slammed down on me. I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude .

When I tracked down Robyn's correct number to call her, I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits.After hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again.When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled ""You're an asshole!"" and hung up.

I wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it, and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I'd call him up and yell, ""You're an asshole!"" It always cheered me up.

When Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic 'asshole' calling would have to stop. So, I called his number and said, ""Hi,this is John Smith from the telephone company. I'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program?""He yelled ""NO!"" and slammed down the phone. I quickly called him back and said, ""That's because you're an asshole!"" and hung up.

One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking Spot. Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. I hit the horn and yelled that I'd been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. I noticed a ""For Sale"" sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number. A couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole (I had is number on speed dial,) I thought that I'd better call the BMW asshole, too.

I said, ""Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?""He said, ""Yes, it is."" I asked, ""Can you tell me where I can see it?"" He said, ""Yes, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd, in Fairfax. It's a yellow ranch, and the car's parked right out in front.""

I asked, ""What's your name?"" He said, ""My name is Don Hansen,"" I asked, ""When's a good time to catch you, Don?"" He said, ""I'm home every evening after five.""

I said, ""Listen, Don, can I tell you something?""

He said, ""Yes?""

I said, ""Don, you're an asshole!""

Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too.

Now, when I had a problem, I had two assholes to call.

Then I came up with an idea. I called asshole #1. He said, ""Hello."" I said, ""You're an asshole!"" (But I didn't hang up.) He asked, ""Are you still there?"" I said, ""Yeah,"" He screamed, ""Stop calling me,"" I said, ""Make me,"" He asked, ""Who are you?"" I said, ""My name is Don Hansen."" He said, ""Yeah? Where do you live?"" I said, ""Asshole, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd, in Fairfax, a yellow ranch, I have a black Beamer parked in front."" He said, ""I'm coming over right now, Don. And you had better start saying your prayers."" I said, ""Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole,"" and hung up.

Then I called Asshole #2. He said, ""Hello?"" I said, ""Hello, asshole,"" He yelled, ""If I ever find out who you are..."" I said, ""You'll what?"" He exclaimed, ""I'll kick your ass,"" I answered, ""Well, asshole, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now.""

Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I lived at 34 Oaktree Blvd, in Fairfax, and that I was on my way over there to kill my gay lover.

Then I called Channel 9 News about the gang war going down in Oaktree Blvd. in Fairfax.

I quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax. I got there just in time to watch two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter and surrounded by a news crew.

The horse walked up the bar and awkwardly sat down on a stool which creaked loudly under their weight.

""I'll tell you why"" the horse said in a perfect English accent, low and gravelly as if marked by years of smoking.

""There were days when all I concerned myself with was the pursuit of carrots and the occasional sugar cube. I was a stallion, a stud used for breeding but I had one love who I shared all of my time with, galloping across the field"".

The bartender froze in place, rag solid inside the glass he was cleaning. The barflies instantly sobered up in the presence of a genuine talking equidae.

The horse looked around and shook his head with a weary smirk. ""That's right, I can talk"" he said. ""I had a human girl who loved me very much and gave me my name. She called me Horace"". He shook his head and laughed. ""Horace the horse. Jesus, I only understand how stupid that sounds now I can... well... now I can understand"".

A couple took out their phones and began to record. Another left in fear. The rest looked on aghast.

""Do you know what happens to a horse farm when they go bankrupt?"" Horace asked, bitterness in his voice. ""Because I do"".

He looked down at the empty bar in front of him. His hoof stomped down. ""Absinthe, now. And don't you dare try to fuck me on the sugar cube"". The barman hurriedly prepared the drink. ""Now, where was I?"" he asked as a glass tumbler landed in front of him.

""The farm shut down because we weren't creating enough foals. They wanted to replace me, but the owners daughter loved me so much they couldn't let me go, but they couldn't afford to buy a new stud. They thought something was wrong with me because I wouldn't mate with the other female horses but they were wrong"".

Horace looked at the glass and placed a hoof on either side. ""There was nothing wrong with me"" he said morosely. ""I was in love"".

He lifted the glass for a moment before it slipped between his hooves and smashed on the floor. He began to cry.

""Jesus fucking christ, I was in love!""

The bartender looked around. The bar was silent. He asked softly; ""Wh... what happened to her?""

""They took her to a fucking slaughter house! They took all of them to a fucking slaughter house and now she is either being gnawed on by a rabid fucking dog or being used to glue together young adult novels or some other pointless bullshit"".

""My god..."" the bartender lamented. ""But you... what about you?""

""Me?"" Horace replied, eyes staring at the broken glass. ""I was bought by a lab and experimented on"" he said. ""I don't know to what end, but when they were done I was given this curse of sentience... of awareness"".

Horace looked up, eyes red. ""Every morning I awake aware that I should not be, but also with the biological fear that I don't want to die. I am aware of my own mortality and that I am the only talking horse in the entire goddamn universe"". His voice grew hoarse. ""Do you know what I used to think about? Huh?! Do you?! I used to think about waking up and eating hay. Fucking hay"".

""I... I had no idea that companies were allowed to do that to animals"" the bartender said, looking down and shaking his head in sympathetic sorrow.

""They aren't"" Horace replied. ""That's why they got shut down and they released me into the wild to cover their arses. And now I'm here, telling my stories to strangers who could never even start to understand"".

The bar fell silent for a moment. The bartender approached Horace and reassuringly stroked his nose.

""Look mate, I can't say I've been there, but I can say that alcohol isn't the answer"". He poured a glass of water and placed a straw inside, placing it in front of Horace with a warm smile.

Horace shook his head, eyes closed and got up from the stool, moving towards the door.

""Haven't you heard?"" Horace asked back into the room, door open. ""You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink"".","A horse walks into a bar and the bartender asks; ""Why the long face?""",58

I'm writing this review about the Tony's Magic Cupcake Mix that I bought from your store recently. My experience with the product has been very miserable and I'm not at all satisfied with the product even after following all the instructions thoroughly. 

The instructions called for 1 cup of water, 1/2 cup of oil, 2 eggs and any favourite ingredient/topping to add in with the mix and blend it all together in a bowl. I did as instructed, I added the water, the oil, the eggs and my favourite topping garlic sauce which I just love so much that it's my favourite into the bowl with the mix and blended it.

I was then told to grease the cupcake tray and fill in the tray 2/3 of the way, which I did and then put them in the oven at 185°c for 30 minutes, as instructed. Before long a horrible smell started to come out of the oven, but I still let it go on for the instructed time. By the time it was done it just smelled so bad, and it tasted even worse. The packet claimed a 100% satisfaction or money back and based on my experience, I am far from satisfied. 

Attached below is my receipt as proof of purchase, please kindly refund me the price of the product in full amount and please remove this particular product from the store.",Review for store bought cupcakes mix,0

To consider these questions mathematically, let use represent the alphabet numerically by identifying sequence of letters (A,B,C,...,X,Y,Z) with the percentages (1%,2%,3%,...,24%,25%,26%).

Then
H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K = (8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11)% = 98%

K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E = (11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5)% = 96%.

Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increases as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor or may choose to go up to the next floor but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband.
On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs
She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.
'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.'

So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.

'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'

Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please and are all just want, want, fucking want.

No wonder you are on you own, you deserve being left on the shelf.  Now fuck off!

Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

PLEASE NOTE:

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.

The first floor has wives that love sex.

The second floor has wives that love sex, have some money and like a beer and a shag whenever you fancy!

Goldman makes a good impression on them, and they're a very welcoming people already, so it' s not long before they're having a nice cookout to welcome him.

While they're eating, Rabbi Goldman looks inland, and sees a tall, truncated mountain in the center of the island. There's a plateau at the top, but he can't see what's up there. So he, ever curious, approaches one of the Trid elders, and asks:

""That plateau, up there. What gives? What's up there?""

The islander shakes her head. ""We're not really sure. See, we can't get up there.""

""Why not?"", asks the Rabbi.

""Well,"" says the islander, ""there's a giant who lives up there. He has for generations. And for all those generations, whenever one of us tries to climb up there...?"" She flicks her fingers and makes a knocking sound with her tongue on the roof of her mouth. ""The giant comes over, and he kicks us off the mountain."" 

The Rabbi scratches his chin. ""You don't say.""

""Hey, if you're thinking what I think you're thinking, Goldman -- don't. He'll just kick you off, too.""

""We'll see about that,"" says he, and goes back to his feast.

&amp;nbsp;

The next morning rolls around, and right at the crack of dawn, Goldman heads out of the village and toward the mountain. He spends the day climbing up the slope, scrambling over boulders, squeezing between jagged outcroppings. But he perseveres, and by mid-afternoon, he reaches the top -- and there, he discovers a garden paradise, with fertile orchards, flowers like fireworks, and the sweet, heady scent of some come-hither vine.

...and the giant. Twelve feet tall if he's an inch, the giant lumbers up to the edge of the plateau, a gruff, bestial vision of savagery and fury.

...and he stands there, and does nothing. 

Goldman stands his ground; still, nothing happens. Finally, he shrugs, and says:

""Hello, giant. Look, I have to admit, I'm surprised you haven't kicked me off your mountain yet.""

The giant chortles, and roars back:

""Ha! Silly Rabbi! Kicks are for Trids!""","[Long] Rabbi Goldman, World Traveller, comes to a lovely island in the South Pacific.",8

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.","A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”",25
