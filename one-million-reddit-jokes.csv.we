So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

to pose a question to all assembled.

He explained that his wife had been a bit frisky the night before and he
failed to get his usual amount of sound sleep.

He posed the question of just how much of sex was ""work""
and how much of it was ""pleasure?""

A Major chimed in with 75%-25% in favor of work.

A Captain said it was 50%-50%.

A Lieutenant responded with 25%-75% in favor of pleasure, depending upon his
state of inebriation at the time.

There being no consensus, the colonel turned to the Private First Class who
was in charge of making the coffee and asked for his opinion?

Without  any hesitation, the young Private First Class responded, ""Sir, it
has to be 100% pleasure.

The colonel was surprised and as you might guess, asked why?

it for them.""

While having cocktails and waiting for their salad, Ed said, ""I guess you can tell I'm very much in love with you. I'd like a little serious talk before our relationship continues to the next stage. So, before I get a box out of my jacket and ask you a life changing question, it's only fairto warn you, I'm a total golf nut. I play golf, I read about golf, I watch golf on TV. In short, I eat, sleep, and breathe golf. If that'sgoing to be a problem for us, you'd better say so now!""
 
Carolyn took a deep breath and responded, ""Ed that certainly won't be a problem. I love you as you are and I love golf too; but, since we're being totally honest with each other, you need to know that for the last five years I've been a hooker.""
 
Ed said, ""I bet it's because you're not keeping your wrists straight when you hit the ball.”

 ""Remus Reid was a famous cowboy in the Montana Territory . His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Montana railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to government service, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Remus passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.""

He’s out in the garden one day and he hears this voice say “Sell everything and go to Las Vegas.” He looks around and no one is there. He figures it’s probably just the wind and goes back to his planting. 

The next day he’s cooking breakfast and he hears the voice again “Sell everything and go to Las Vegas.” He thinks he’s going nuts. He hasn’t been out of the house for a while so maybe he just has a case of cabin fever. 

The man goes into town to do some grocery shopping. While he’s in the meat section he hears the voice again “Sell everything and go to Las Vegas.” and it’s starting to become more and more frequent. It gets to the point where it’s repeating over and over “Sell everything and go to Las Vegas. Sell everything and go to Las Vegas. Sell everything and go to Las Vegas.” Finally he can’t take it anymore and he says “OK, fine! I’ll do it! I’ll sell everything I own and go to Las Vegas just to shut you up!” Everyone in the grocery store is looking at him as if he were insane.

It takes him about a week but he manages to sell everything he owns. The only things he has left in his possession are a suitcase full of clothes and toiletries, his car, and a duffle bag full of $250,000 in cash. He starts the car and drives to Las Vegas. 

At the edge of the city, the voice says “Drive to the Billaggio and let the valet take the car.” He does this. The voice says “Now, go to the desk and get all your money in chips.” The man hesitates but does this anyway. 

The voice says “Now, go to the roulette table and bet everything on black” The man pauses and says “No! Are you crazy! This is all the money I have in the world! I’m not betting it all on black!” The voice in a more stern tone repeats “Go to the roulette table and bet everything on black!” 

Reluctantly, the man heads over to the roulette table, puts all his chip on black. The operator drops the ball and it takes what seems like forever. The intensity is building. Every click of the ball on the wheel sounds like a gunshot. Finally the ball stops. It lands on red.

Can we make this a happier, healthier street that would discourage such behavior. 
I  need to debate this with some friends for a few days and try to come to a consensus.   
This is all so confusing!

He immediately goes to hell, where    the devil is waiting for him

I've got a couple of folks here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.""
 
Obama thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.
In it was Ted Kennedy and a large pool of water. Ted kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in hell.
 
""No,"" Obama said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer, and I don't think I could do that all day long.""
 
The devil led him to the door of the next room.
 
In it was Al Gore with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.
 
""No, this is no good; I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day,"" commented Obama.
 
The devil opened a third door. Through it, Obama saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.
 
Obama looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, ""Yeah man, I can handle this.""

A woman is having an affair during the day while her husband is at work. Her 9 year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them and hides in the bedroom closet to watch. The woman’s husband also comes home. She puts her lover in the closet, not realizing that the little boy is in there already.

Man ~ “OK, how much?”

Boy ~ “Its dark in here.”

Man ~ “Yes, it is.”

Boy ~ “I have a baseball glove.”

The lover remembering the last time, asks the boy, “How much?”

Boy ~ “$750?

Man ~ “Fine.”

A few days later, the father says to the boy, “Grab your glove, let’s go outside and have a game of catch.”

The boy says, “I can’t, I sold my baseball and my glove.”

The father asks, “How much did you sell them for?”

Boy ~ “$1,000?

The father says, “That’s terrible to overcharge your friends like that…that is way more than those two things cost. I’m going to take you to church and make you confess.”

As the bagpiper was not familiar with the backwoods, he got lost and, being a typical man, didn’t stop for directions.
He finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. He felt very badly and apologized to the men for being late. He went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. Not knowing what else to do, he started to play.
The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. He played out his heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. He played like he’d never played before for this homeless man. And as he played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, he wept, they all wept together.
When he finished, he packed up his bagpipes and started for his car. Though his head hung low, his heart was full.

BALLS - Is coming home late after a night out with the guys, smelling of perfume and beer, lipstick on your collar, slapping your wife on the butt and having the Balls to say: 'You're next, Chubby.'

His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor. ""How many customers bought something from you today?""

The kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing him out on his first day. He asked (semi-sarcastically), ""So, how much was your one sale for?""

This is indeed a very exciting program,  and I'll explain it by
using a Q &amp; A format:
  
  
Q.  What is an 'Economic Stimulus' payment ?
  
A.  It is money that the federal government will send to taxpayers.
  
  
Q..  Where will the government get this money ?
  
A.  From taxpayers.
  
  
Q.  So the government is giving me back my own money ?
  
A.  Only a smidgen of it.
  
  
Q.  What is the purpose of this payment ?
  
A.  The plan is for you to use the money to purchase a
high-definition TV set,  thus stimulating the economy.
  
  
Q.  But isn't that stimulating the economy of China ?
  
A.  Shut up.
  
  
Below is some helpful advice on how to best help the U.S. economy by spending your stimulus check wisely:       
  
  
          
*  If you spend the stimulus money at Wal-Mart,  the money will go to China or Sri Lanka .
  
  
*  If you spend it on gasoline,  your money will go to the
Arabs.
  
  
*  If you purchase a computer,  it will go to India , Taiwan or China . 
  
      
  
*  If you purchase fruit and vegetables,  it will go to Mexico ,
Honduras and Guatemala ...
  
      
  
*  If you buy an efficient  car,  it will go to Japan or Korea .


    
*  If  you purchase useless stuff,  it will go to Taiwan .
  
    
 
*  If you pay your credit cards off, or buy stock,  it will go
to management bonuses and they will hide it offshore.
  
  
Instead,  keep the money in America by:
  
  
1)  Spending it at yard sales,  or     
  
2)  Going to ball games,  or   
  
3)  Spending it on prostitutes,  or     
 
4)  Beer or     
  
5) Tattoos.
  
  
(These are the only American businesses still operating in the U.S. )


Conclusion:
  
Go to a ball game with a tattooed prostitute that you met at a yard
sale and drink beer all day !


No need to thank me,  I'm just glad I could be of help.

""Eighty dollars per visit,"" replied the doctor. ""I’ll sleep on it and if needed I will come back to you,"" I said.  Six months later the Psychiatrist met me on the street. ""Why didn’t you come to see me about those fears you were having?"" he asked. ""Well, Eighty bucks a visit three times a week for a year is an awful lot of money! A bartender cured me for $10. I was so happy to have saved all that money that I went and bought me a new SUV."" ""Is that so!"" With a bit of an attitude he said, ""and how, may I ask, did a bartender cure you?"" ""He told me to cut the legs off the bed – ain’t nobody under there now!""",bartender cured my fear of someone under my bed,2

LJ : well dad I just told her that I had my first fuck today.

post,35sg5k,2qh72,jokes,false,1431486375,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/35sg5k/the_girl_at_the_bar/,self.jokes,,"When I first met my husband, he told me about a poor girl he met and accidentally embarrassed when he was out drinking one night. 

I guess he thought she was cute and asked her to dance, but she refused while all of her friends went off dancing with other guys. He bought her a beer and after chatting a few minutes he took her hand and asked her to dance again. Again, she declined, but he wouldn't take ""no"" for an answer so he pulled her arm in an effort to get her up out of the booth she was sitting in. Well, she fell out of the booth onto her face, and that is when he realized that she had no legs. 

Her friends came rushing over, calling him an asshole as he apologized profusely, and they grabbed her wheelchair which was resting by the front door. They helped her into it, and my husband asked if he could make it up to her, buy her a drink - anything! She expressed her embarrassment and desire to just go home. He told her that he was sober, and that his truck was down the street and offered her a ride home, as it was the least he could do. 

She obliged and he took her ten minutes up the street to where she said she lived. He got out, grabbed the wheelchair from the cab and helped her into it. She thanked him and as he went to get back in his truck she invited him inside, saying that there was no sense in ruining the whole night, and that she knew that he was just trying to be cute back at the bar. He agreed to join her for a beer inside. 

They went in, and I guess it was her parents' home. She said hello to her dad, introduced him, and took him downstairs to her basement apartment. 

He was amazed to see that there were bars fitted all across the ceiling - and even more - the wheelchair was discarded and she moved her way around the basement with elegance and skill using the bars. 

She grabbed them each a beer, turned on a movie, and lowered herself into the couch next to him. They got to know one another a bit, and she began to tell him about how she lost her legs, and how it had been so long since she'd been with a man. 

All of the sudden, as he described it, she was kissing him and un-zipping his pants, giving him a blow job. He didn't want to be rude, (and it had been a while for him too) so he started in with her too. Very quickly, they were both naked, and she grabbed the bars on the ceiling and was about to lower herself onto him, when the door to the apartment swung open and her dad walked in with three more beers! 

My husband quickly put his clothes on while the girl just hung naked from the bars, yelling at her dad for not knocking. 

As he rushed past the father, still zipping his jeans, apologizing and excusing himself, the father told him that she almost never has company, and that he just wanted to have a beer with them. My husband tried to get past him, but the dad stood in his way, begging him not to leave. My husband apologized again and pushed past him, when he heard the father drop the beers behind him, and start sobbing. He turned to look at the father, confused and feeling guilty. The father looked at him, teary eyed, and said ""Please! Don't leave my daughter hanging!""",The girl at the bar.,113

The next morning, she cooks a gourmet meal with all the trimmings. The guy is amazed. Everything had been SO incredible!  ""You know,"" he said, ""you are the perfect woman. Are you this nice to every guy you meet?""

The morning of his first day on the job, his wife gives him a kiss goodbye and says, ""Now I want to hear all about it when you come home, dear.""

So he sets off and drives along Sesame Street.  He makes his first stop, and to his astonishment, on comes a super muscular, extremely-chiseled 6-year-old girl!  The girl says, ""My name's Patricia...and I'm LEAN!!"" and takes her seat.  At the next stop, here is a little girl who is even more muscular than the first one...veins popping out, bulging biceps, the whole nine yards.  She steps on to the bus and says to the driver, ""My name is Patricia...and I'm MEAN!!!""  A little baffled by the look of his first two passengers, he continues on with his route.

He reaches the next stop, and feels relieved to see a normal-looking little boy, dressed in a sweater and tie.  He gets on the bus and says to the bus driver, ""My name is Ross...and I'm special!""  The bus driver says, ""That's nice, Ross,"" and Ross takes a seat.

At the next stop there is a little kid in a suit carrying a briefcase.  He introduces himself as ""Lester,"" gets on the bus and sits next to the two muscular girls.  The bus driver continues driving, but can't help but notice through his large rear-view mirror that Lester starts playing Three-card Monte with them, and is cheating!  He thinks to himself, ""He's dead meat if they catch him cheating, but it's not my business to say anything,"" and continues driving.  He starts to notice the faint smell of onions, but doesn't know where it's coming from.  As he gets closer and closer to school, the stench of onions is so strong that the bus driver is almost teary-eyed.

Finally all the kids go off to school, and the bus driver, now on lunch break, goes back home to his wife.  ""How was your first day?"" she asked.  He replied, ""You wouldn't believe it: two all-beef patties, special Ross, Lester cheats, reeks of onions on a Sesame Street bus!""",The Bus Driver on Sesame Street,0

He tells them to climb the nearest tree and leave the boy at the bottom of the tree. They are to leave the boy there for two days and two nights. On the third day at morning a bird will fly down and unscrew the golden screw. So the parents did exactly what the witch doctor said and the bird came as he said it would. Once the bird finished unscrewing the screw, it fell out as promised. The parents were ecstatic!

Danny, the leader of the bunch, turns to his three pals.

""Holy shit guys, now's our chance!""

""Yeah!"" says Tommy, ""Let's get drunk!""

So Tommy threads himself through the pants of the tux in a U shape, forming a nice looking pair of legs.

Ed and Heath twine together with their heads poking out of the sleeves, looking like a pretty convincing torso.

Danny wraps his head around all three of his buddies, and pokes his head out of the top.

After a little bit of practice on a muddy bank by the river, the boys have it down pat.  The creature walks with a bit of a wobble, but after a few minutes they can manage a pretty convincing strut.

""Let's go!"" they all cry.

The quartet flop their way up from the river, like some sort of slimy Frankenstein's monster, to the nearest liquor store.  Tommy, like a champ, never complains once about being at the bottom.

They peruse the aisles for a few minutes before Ed and Heath both grab a six-pack in their mouths and head for the counter.

They drop the six packs in front of the bored-looking clerk and Danny, as the head, says ""How much do I owe you, boss?""

'Just put yourself in my hands for one year,' said the psychiatrist.

'Come talk to me three times a week and we should be able to get rid of those fears..'

How much do you charge?'

$600 per visit,' replied the expert.

'I'll sleep on it,' I said.

Six months later, he met me on the street.

'Why didn't you ever come to see me about those fears you were having?' he asked.

'Well, $600 a visit three times a week for a year is an awful lot of money!

A bartender cured me for $20. I was so happy to have saved all that money that I went and bought myself a new car!'



'Is that so?' With a bit of an attitude he said, 'and how, may I ask, did a bartender cure you?'

The Russian stares into space for a brief minute and then proceeds to draw three trees on the first piece of paper. He shows his drawings to the interviewer and says, ""Here. Tree, tree, and tree equals 9.""

The interviewer is slightly taken aback by this show of ingenuity, but he pushes onward. ""Very well,"" he says. ""Now, do the same thing with the number 99."" 

The Russian's face goes blank as he stares into space for a time. Finally, he takes his pencil and draws a little smudge on the trunk of each tree. He gestures to the paper and says, ""Here. Now each tree is dirty. Dirty-tree, dirty-tree, and dirty-tree equals 99.""

The interviewer is begrudgingly impressed, but he really does not want to hire this man. He decides on one final, loaded question. ""Fine. For your final question, perform the same exercise with the number 100.""

The Russian man stares at the wall of the office for several minutes. Just as the interviewer is about to smugly ask him to leave, the Russian draws a little dot at the base of each tree on the paper. He points at the dots and says, ""Here. Little doggy come by and poop by each tree. Now is dirty-tree and a turd, dirty-tree and a turd, and dirty-tree and a turd. This is 100. When do I start?""",So a Russian man shows up for a job interview.,402

All of the pedigree animals were too expensive and she began to pout, visibly. One of the store's tellers asked what was wrong and she explained her circumstances.

“Well... we have a specially trained frog for $24.99”, he said.

She examined the unimpressive creature and requested clarification, ""$25 for a frog? How could it possibly be worth that?”

“The frog is quite unique."" Said the teller. ""It has been trained to give blowjobs!”

The woman was at first alarmed and then offended, but after some coaxing from the teller she began to see the merit in a pet with this talent.  Her hope was that the creature would relieve her of one of her more immoral and unpleasant chores, and she bought the frog. 

On the couple's anniversary, the wife gave her husband the frog and explained its purpose and talent.  He was shocked and violently threw the frog into the trash.  The rest of the evening did not improve his mood and eventually they went to sleep in separate rooms.  

Long after midnight the woman was called to an alert state by loud noises coming from the kitchen. She got up and went to check against intruders. As she entered the kitchen she saw her husband vigorously pantomiming flipping an omelet with a frying pan. Oddly, the frog was on the counter watching attentively. 

Perplexed, the woman asked, “What on earth are you doing, husband?”

A group of businesses, ran by the infamous leopards, known as the Association of Private Australian Corporations(APAC) worked its way to power. These businesses were evil in the eyes of the viper. He despised everything the leopards were for. The business were constantly changing hands.  They were letting new businesses into their association while kicking others out. This drama ravaged the village, causing mayhem to the fellow snakes, and angered viper. It continued for years and years and years. The leopards grew elder. With their age came sickness, yet they continued to rule over the village. Their greed enabled them to power through illness and helped them acquire skilled doctors to cure them. Viper knew the leopards were power hungry and only wanted money. He proposed a plan and worked for seven days and seven nights creating large signs, striking against the corporations. The very next day he charged down to the headquarters and shouted and screamed while flailing his signs around.
