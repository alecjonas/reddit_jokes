 he was told that he had committed a sin, and that he could not 
 go to heaven right away.  He asked what he did and God told 
 him that he cheated on his income taxes, and that the only way 
 he could get into heaven would be to sleep with a 500 pound, 
 stupid, butt-ugly woman for the next five years and enjoy it. 
 Tony decided that this was a small price to pay for an eternity 
 in heaven.  So off he went with this enormous woman, pretending 
 to be happy.

 As he was walking along, he saw his friend Carlos up ahead. 
 Carlos was with an even bigger, uglier woman than he was with. 
 When he approached Carlos he asked him what was going on, and 
 Carlos replied, ""I cheated on my income taxes and scammed the 
 government out of a lot of money...even more then you did.""

 They both shook their heads in understanding and figured that 
 as long as they have to be with these women, they might as well 
 hang out together to help pass the time.

 Now Tony, Carlos, and their two beastly women were walking 
 along, minding their own business when Tony and Carlos could 
 have sworn that they saw their friend Jon up ahead, only this 
 man was with an absolutely drop dead gorgeous supermodel, 
 centerfold.  Stunned, Tony and Carlos approached the man and 
 in fact it was their friend Jon.  They asked him how is he 
 with this unbelievable goddess, while they were stuck with 
 these god-awful women.

 Jon replied, ""I have no idea, and I'm definitely not 
 complaining.  This has been absolutely the best time of my 
 life (and I'm dead,) and I have five years of the best sex 
 any man could hope for to look forward to.  There is only 
 one thing that I can't seem to understand.

 After everytime we have sex, she rolls over and murmur's to 
 herself, ""Damn income taxes!""",Death and Taxes,14

Grandma later turned on the TV, and the reception was terrible. She started adjusting the knobs, trying to get the picture in focus. Frustrated, she started hitting the backside of the TV hoping to fix the problem.

The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story.
Little Suzy raises her hand. ""My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.""
When the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, ""Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.""
Little Lucy went next. ""My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.""
Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.
Lucy replied, ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch.""
Next up was little Johnny. ""My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""
The teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.
""Well,"" Johnny replied, ""Don't f**k with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.""
""But Doctor,"" Bill replied, ""I feel great. I haven't felt better in years. This just can't be true. Isn't there anything I can do?"" 

After a moment the doctor said, ""Well, you might start going down the street to that new health spa and take a mud bath every day.""

And, fair to say, it's a bit boring. more than a bit boring, as they walk about the town.   

As they pass before a Catholic church, one friend tells the other: wait here a minute, I need to confess my sins. He walks into the church, steps into the confessional, and tells the priest: ""bless me, Father, for I have sinned: I have committed adultery!""

The Father reassures him that we all stray, we are all welcome back in His Holy Embrace; but to give absolution, the confession must be full. He needs names, and dates.

""Bur Father, I swore on all the Holy Names that I would never tell - and breaking my oath would be a mortal sin, wouldn't it?""  

The priest pondered the contradiction, and came up with a solution: ""If I guess who it was, then you wouldn't have broken your vow, now would you?"" to which the young man agreed, no.

""So: was it Julie, the new maths teacher in our elementary school?"" - ""No, Father, it wasn't her."" 

""Was it the widow Flaherty, who runs the tourist information bureau?"" - ""No, Father, it wasn't her."" 

""Was it Maggie, the barmaid at The Shoving Leopard?"" - ""No, Father, it wasn't her.""

""Well, my son - until you give full contrition, I can't grant you absolution.""

He walks out of the church, and joins his Protestant friend... who had been waiting patiently... 

""Hah! Early Friday night, cruising time, and you burn a half hour talking with your padres - and what good did that get you?""

And the answer came back with a smirk: ""I have three hot tickets for tonight!""

We, the mods, have been discussing this for a while, and we've begun doing it. We've configured automoderator, as well as doing it by hand. The purpose of this is to flair some of our more common types of jokes, so people can filter out in RES for them, or if they like them, search for more of that type. 

The flairs we currently have are:

""Dirty"" - For any jokes that are dirty or possibly triggering to the SRS/Tumblr crowd, such as jokes about sex, racist jokes, Nazi jokes, etc

""long"" - For any jokes that have a longer setup. 

""Puns"" - For clever wordplay

""Religion"" - Jokes about any and all religions. 

""Blonde"" -The classic, jokes about Blondes

""Knock Knock"" - Knock Knock jokes

""Politics"" - for any jokes that have to do with current US politics, including the presidential primaries. 

""Screwed on a lightbulb"" - for jokes about how many ___ it takes to screw on a lightbulb

""walked into the bar"" - For the classic ""walked into a bar"" jokes. 

The rationale behind this was so that people can filter out joke types they don't like in RES, so if you get easily *TRIGGERED*, by dirty jokes, you can choose to hide those, or if you despise puns, you can hide those. 

Conversely, you can also search by flair! So, if you have a hankering for more jokes with a longer setup, you can just click on the flair text of ""Long"" on any post marked as such, and it'll take you to s page that's nothing but long jokes. 

If your post gets a flair, but the flair is inaccurate or shouldn't be there, please modmail us!

Please give any **constructive** feedback in modmail or as a reply to this thread!",[Mod Post] We've begun flairing jokes,98

The thing is, it didn't just sit there on the ground but it started sliding down the front walk (the church was on a hill, in the middle of the town) and it went out the front gate. Now we are all chasing this coffin down the street and hill but the damn thing just kept picking up speed and momentum and we couldn't catch up to it.
At the bottom of the hill there was a drugstore and this coffin slid up the handicapped ramp and through the front door and slid right down the front aisle to the Pharmacy counter where it hit with some force. When it did that, the coffin lid popped open and the body flew forward against the counter, much to the dismay of the pharmacist and his employees.

Then the cadaver looked at the pharmacist and asked ""Excuse me sir, do you have something to stop this coffin?""","So, I was a pallbearer at a funeral",9

The bartender pounds ten pints of Guinness and lines them up in a row. Everyone is watching. The Irish man says ""start the clock!"". The clock starts, and he downs each Guinness in order, one by one, until they're all gone in under two minutes.

The American is amazed. He says ""That was the most incredible thing I've ever seen! But one question - where did you go for five minutes before coming back in and accepting my bet?""

The Irish man replied ""Well, I went to go to the pub next door to make sure I could do it first!""",An American walks into an Irish pub...,130

He looks down to the urinal next to him and sees a short man in a green suit taking a piss. This little guy has the absolutely largest dick that the man has ever seen. The man is absolutely shocked.

In this man's drunken stupor he blurts out, ""Oy, that is one fucking big cock ya got there!""

The little man in the green suit looks up and says, ""Well of course I do, all leprechauns do!""

The man is even more shocked now, ""Wait you're a fuckin' leprechaun?!""

Slowly the man tries to process this and suddenly grabs the leprechaun and says, ""Well, now you need to give me your pot of gold!""

The little man looks up sadly and responds, ""Well, you see, in this economy we leprechauns don't have pots of gold anymore. We decided it would be easier to grant a wish to the people who catch us, but there is a catch. If you want the wish you need to let me fuck you in the ass.""

The man thinks for a second and agrees. The idea of getting anything he wants is just too tempting despite the massive size of the leprechaun's cock.

So they move to a stall, the little man jumps up on the toilet, and they start fucking. The little guy really starts giving it to him.

After about 15 minutes the man is really starting to regret his decision. Then the little man asks, ""What's your name, friend?""

The man is barely able to talk while getting fucked in the ass like this, but he just manages to get out, ""My name is Dave.""

""You are right, but you know what? I am king of the jungle and I must not lower myself to his level. Let's ignore it.""

The lioness, astonished, sat in silence. Yet the monkey kept on. After sometime, the lioness looses her patience.

""I cannot allow this any longer. I'm going to teach that monkey a lesson.""

So the lioness chases after the monkey. After a long chase she finds herself out of the jungle and at a construction site. She sees the monkey going through a narrow pipe and leaps in after him. The pipe apparently was not large enough, and the lioness gets stuck.

Seeing that the lioness is stuck, the monkey walks around behind her.

""Who's a bad girl? Who's a bad girl?!!"" he yells as he screws her from behind, over and over again. The monkey has his way and then finally leaves with a big smile on his face.

After an hour long struggle, the lioness finally frees herself from the pipe. Injured, and completely embarrassed, she returns home to the jungle and to her king.

""So how did the hunt go?"" the lion curiously asked.

The lioness couldn't even look at him.

""Aaahhh, he took you to the construction site didn't he?""

As we all know, many women in positions of power are at risk of ""spinning their bean"" in a selfish manner stimulating their sensitive nerve endings for a 30-60 second sensation of neuromuscular euphoria.

My theory is to prevent the hideous result of a both a woman in power having her self-stimulation cycle is to either have her wear a chastity belt or undergo surgery to remove her sensitive clitoris. That is the acceptable way for a woman to be president for example. Think about it, we don't like the idea of something pleasurable and sensitive walking around like a boss. It needs to be tamed and put in it's place.

""God, He is a rabbi what does he know of confessions?"" He replies.

""Call him and give him a note with a list of what he will need to do it"", is God's reply.

So the Priest calls his Rabbi friend and tells him of the conversation. The Rabbi points out he knows nothing about Catholic confession but the Priest reassures him so he comes to the church the next day.

The Priest has put a note in the confessional booth which covers how many Hail Mary's and Our Father's each specific sin gets and when someone comes in and confesses he gives them the amount according. It all goes well until the fourth day.

""Forgive me Father for I have sinned"", says a woman.

""What are your sins my child?"", the rabbi replies.

""I had unprotected anal sex with my boyfriend last night and then gave him a blow job after."" She replies.

The Rabbi looks at the note and there is nothing covering anal sex or blow jobs on it. He begins to worry and peaks out of his door to see a young altar boy walk by.

Sensing opportunity, he whispers for the altar boy to come over to the booth. 

He asks the altar boy: ""Hey, what do you get for anal sex and a blow job?""

A man is driving his car on [U.S. 50 through Nevada](http://unusualplaces.org/u-s-route-50-americas-loneliest-road/), and he's rather surprised to see someone jump out in the road in front of him dressed in bright green from head to foot. The driver slams on his brakes to avoid hitting the green-clad man, then rolls down his window to yell out ""Are you okay?""

""Why, yes I am! Thank you for stopping, I'm the green jerk of the highway! To pass, you must hand over a snack!""

The driver, dazed, grabs a bag of chips that he'd bought for his trip. The green jerk of the highway steps back from the vehicle, then grandly waves the driver on.

Twenty minutes later, a fellow dressed all in red jumps out onto the road; the driver stomps on his brakes, and is confronted with ""I'm the red jerk of the highway! To pass, you must hand over three, one dollar bills!"" The driver opens his wallet up and pulls out three, one dollar bills. By this point, he's starting to get really suspicious because the green jerk knew he had snacks and the red jerk knew he had three one dollar bills. But, the red jerk steps back and grandly waves him on.

The driver steps on it, eager to get past *whatever* this nonsense is, but is soon confronted by someone stepping into the road wearing all blue. The driver slams on his brakes, roll down his window and yells out. ""Who the *#$% are you?! The blue jerk of the highway?! What the hell do you want?""

When they found a small clearing in the woods, they noticed that there was a big hole in the middle of it. Being curious, one guy said to the other ""I wonder how deep it is?"" So he picks up a small rock and drops it down the hole. They both listen for the rock to hit bottom, but they don't hear anything. So the other guy picks up a larger rock and drops it into the hole. Again they listen, but hear nothing. ""That's a pretty deep hole!"" said the second guy. After a few more rocks were thrown in with no sound, the first guy says to the other guy, ""Hey, help me throw this old tree trunk in there. That'll make some noise for sure!"" So the men throw the huge log into the hole. As they're waiting for a sound a goat suddenly busts through the treeline running as fast as it can towards the hole! When the goat reaches the hole, it jumps up in the air and goes straight down into the hole. 

As the two men were standing there in shock as to what just happened, a farmer walked into the clearing. The farmer asked the guys ""What are you two doing out here?"" The men explained the whole thing that just happened with the goat. The farmer scratches his head and said ""Hmmm, yep that is pretty unusual. Well no worries, I know that it wasn't my goat.

Look, if you want to know what oxygen is, do you want to know what oxygen is? I'll tell you. First of all, it's the O in the periodic table. By the way, I love the element O. It's probably my favorite element, no it is my favorite element despite I don't know what O is. You know what, it's probably more like the Hydrogen but with a lot of proton in it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of proton. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a neutron that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy, but he's like, 'Helium, Neon,' on and on, like that. He's inert! You know what I mean? He's like a inert gas. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these proton, and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of periodic table than me. You wouldn't believe it.

Jesse has a few movie credits to his name, and of course his uncle does too, so they're having the great conversation of two professionals, all while enjoying a pleasant stroll through the neighborhood.

They cross a street, when a police car appears from nowhere, lights flashing and sirens blaring. An old, bald officer steps out of the vehicle, and walks stone-faced toward the two men.

""What's the problem, officer?"" Christopher asks. 

""You're not allowed to cross the road wherever you want, don't you know?!"" The cop has pretty clearly had a bad day. He's about to yell some more when Jesse spots a bug, and can't help but swat at it. He accidentally strikes the cop in the face. The cop turns furious, draws his gun, and yells for Jesse to get on the ground. Christopher instinctively tries to intervene, which of course only escalates the situation. A second, younger officer emerges from the car to help subdue both the civilians.

Five minutes later, the two men are in handcuffs, leaning against the police car and doing their best to explain away the problem.

The three are confused, and think it's just a joke so they smile and nod. The gates are opened and they enter heaven, realizing heaven is just FILLED with ducks. They're everywhere, shoulder to shoulder, hardly even any room for milling about.

Within minutes, the man steps on a duck. It quacks, and all the other ducks around it quack, and soon all the ducks in heaven are quacking. God hates the cacophony. St. Peter appears and, without a word, chains the ugliest woman in the world to him for all of eternity.

About an hour later, one of the women steps on a duck. St. Peter appears and, without a word, chains the ugliest man in the world to her for all of eternity.

The second woman, however, is very careful. She shuffles her feet around, carefully avoiding stepping on any ducks at all! About a week goes by when St. Peter appears and, without a word, chains the most beautiful man in the world to her for all of eternity, then disappears.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.""",What did Abraham Lincoln say at the Gettysburg Address?,0

Sorry for the bad english onwards, but I think I really need one as of now. Lately, I noticed that my girlfriend had lots of calls on her phone, and when I ask who is it, she always hungs it up quickly and she said it's one of her friends/business contacts. I also noticed that recently, she goes home in our rented apartment late, and when I ask why was she late, she always tell me that she went overtime because of her team building meet, although when I checked her slip, she had no overtime fee and I was a bit suprised since as far as I know, they didn't had any team building meets since 3 months ago. So, I went to her boss and asked about this, but her boss said that they only did team building meets only one time with her co-office mates a long time ago (which confirms that I was right), and as an extra, she's been absent on that meet, and her boss told me that she's been absent in her work a couple of days as well. The next day, she went out and told me she'll be attending her ""urgent team building meet"", so, keeping a distance, I followed her with my motorbike, and not far away from our place, a man fetched her on his car. I stopped my motorbike from a distance to make sure they won't hear me and observed them, and when they were going to drive out, I was about to follow then but when I start the engine, it died on me. So I want to ask for advice, where would the problem be? Is it the spark plug that caused the starting to fail, or is it on the main engine? The clutch, perhaps? Please give me a good advice.

As he claims, it was all a big misunderstanding. Dan was down on hard times; He caught his wife cheating on him with another man. His two kids won’t talk to him anymore. He lost his house to his wife in the divorce. The only thing Dan had left was his flower delivery business, Dan’s Daffodils, which he ran out of the same white delivery van he lived in.

The first incident happened in June. Dan had just been denied for a business loan from the bank. As he was parked outside in his van, three masked men jumped in and told him to drive. Fearing for his life, he drove off. Turns out the men were bank robbers and Dan’s van matched the getaway vehicle. At his trial, Judge Holz said “Daniel, I am inclined to believe this is a bit of a misunderstanding. This is your first warning.”

The second incident happened in August. Dan parked in a secluded parking lot to sleep in his van for the night. In the hot California sun, he stripped naked to cool off. In the morning, he was awoken by two police officers, naked as the day he was born, in an elementary school parking lot. At his second trial, Judge Holz said “Daniel, it’s getting hard to believe this is all a misunderstanding. This is your second warning.”

The third incident happened in September. Things were starting to look up for Dan’s flower delivery business; he just booked a big contract with a funeral home. He went to a bar to celebrate that evening and had a few too many. He stumbled home to his van and passed out in the driver’s seat, which according to California law, is Intent to Drive under the Influence. As he walked into the courthouse, he saw Judge Holz sitting on the bench. Judge Holz turned to him and said “Damn Daniel, back at it again with that white van!”
