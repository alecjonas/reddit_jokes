The golf course is a thing of beauty, perfect greens, giant sculptures, huge sparkling blue lakes, the finest sand pits, and amazing views. The rich of the world all have mansions and castles on either side of the fairways. 



The husband is a bit of a worry-wart. So, naturally, on the first hole of the course he's giving his wife tips and encouraging her to drive the ball straight down the fairway. 

""Don't you dare flub your shots dear, if you do and it breaks anything at all we're in so much trouble... We could barely afford the trip let alone damage fees!""

He makes the wife nervous and at first she whiffs the ball entirely. After encouragement... She hits the ball hard and drives it, straight into a beautiful stained glass window of a near by mansion.

""Dammit!"" They both exclaim and start to argue. After bickering for a few minutes they decide they had better walk up to the mansion, apologize, and see if they can work out an arrangement for the damage.

Upon arrival to the mansion they notice the door wide open and a deep, strong voice echoes ""Well... Come in.""

They enter the spectacular mansion, and follow the voice I till they come into a room that appears to be a study, there is broken shards of glass everywhere, and halfway across the room is a broken jewel encrusted vase. Standing next to the wreckage is a burly man with thick goatee and fine clothes, holding a golf ball.

The husband and wife start apologizing profusely and begging to work out an arrangement, but the man hold up his hand for silence, smiles and speaks:

""Do not worry about the damage, you see you have done me a great service, do you see the jewel encrusted vase that has broken before you? I have lived in that cell for a millennium. It is only thanks to you that I am free. You see I am a genie... And as a reward I may grant three wishes... I only ask you allow me to make the 3rd wish""

The husband and wife are astonished and thrilled! The husband walks up to the genie and happily asks for a mansion just as beautiful as this one, in every country in the world. 

The genie nods his head and says ""it is done. There is now a mansion in every part of the world""

The wife looks at be the genie and asks for so much money that they never have to work a day in their lives again. And so they can golf here whenever they want.

The genie nods and says ""it is done, you now can afford all the pleasures in life""

The genie then asks for his only wish ""this is my only wish and you must command it for it to come true... I have been locked in that vase, far too long, far too lonely without the comfort of warmth of a beautiful woman such as your wife standing before me... I wish to take this woman to the bedroom upstairs and have my way with her.""

The husband and wife are shocked at his wish, and the husbands none to happy but after discussing it for a few minutes, the wife convinces the husband that it's worth it, that after all the wise genie did for them it's the least they can do... 

So with the husbands approval the genie takes the wife upstairs into a beautiful huge bedroom and has incredible sex with with her. Hours pass and they both lay there elated and tired. 

The wife exclaims ""that was incredible...""

And the genie, smoking a cigar, asks ""so how long have you been married?""

""A 35 long years"" the wife replies

""Wow, such a long time for you both, and how old is your husband?"" Asks the genie

""He just turned 50 last month.. Why do you ask?"" Says the wife

And the genie chucked ""amazing, 50 years old and still believes in genies""

Their oldest son wakes up a little later, and goes outside, sees his dead parents, and goes down to the river to cry a bit, out of sight of the whole scene of death. While at the river, a female leprechaun jumps out in front of him, and says ""so, seems you're having a bad day.""

Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.

He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""

Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing.""","So, Beethoven dies....",26

Peter heads out, and goes to the gates. Three men are already waiting for him, with a small line stacking up behind them.

Peter tells the first of the three men,"" Tell me how you died, and make it quick. There's a line.""

The man begins,""Well, I'd been suspecting that my wife had been cheating on me for the longest time. To check, I got to my apartment early from work that day, and parked the car a few blocks away to not make noise. I took the elevator up to the third floor, where my place was. I ran, slammed open the door into the apartment, and slammed open the bedroom door. Sure enough, my wife was naked on the bed, but the man was nowhere to be seen. I shouted to her,' Where is that bastard! I'll kill him!' So I went out to try to find him. I checked every room, and when I got back to the bedroom, I saw a pair of hands hanging off the balcony. When I got closer, it was a sweaty, naked man who was holding on. With my anger, I kicked his hands off. He, however, landed in some bushes and was fine, so I unplugged the refrigerator, and dropped it on him. But the stress from moving the refrigerator and the whole incident was just too much, and my hypertension made me burst a blood vessel, and I died.""

Saint Peter says,"" Alright, fair enough. Let's hear the next man's story.""

The second man says,"" Well, I live on the fourth floor of the apartment. I'm a nudist, and I was practicing my Tai Chi out on the balcony, when I accidentally slipped off the balcony. I fell one floor, but managed to hang onto the balcony on the third floor. Before I had a chance to even call for help, an angry looking man came out and kicked my hands off! I luckily landed in the bushes, but so did the refrigerator he sent down. Both the refrigerator and I were completely crushed.""

Saint Peter tells the second man,"" Well, that certainly does change things.""

Looking at the third man, Saint Peter asks,"" How did you die?""

When they get there, St. Peter says, ""We only have one rule here in heaven: Don't step on the ducks!""
So they enter heaven, and sure enough, there are ducks all over the place. It is almost impossible not to step on a duck, 
And although they try their best to avoid them, the first woman accidentally steps on one. 
Along comes St. Peter with the ugliest man she ever saw. St. Peter chains them together and says, 'Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly man!' 
The next day, the second woman steps accidentally on a duck and along comes St. Peter, who doesn't miss a thing. With him is another extremely ugly man. He chains them together with the same admonishment as for the first woman. 
The third woman has observed all this and, not wanting to be chained for all eternity to an ugly man, is very, VERY careful where she steps. She manages to go months Without stepping on any ducks.
But one day St. Peter comes up to her with the most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on. Very tall, long eyelashes, muscular. 
St. Peter chains them together without saying a word. 
The happy woman says, ""I wonder what I did to deserve being 
Chained to you for all of eternity?""
The guy says, ""I don't know about you, 
but I stepped on a duck.""",Ducks in Heaven,102

Then he starts to hang from the branch over the lion exhibit, swinging back and forth. Of course, this makes the lion furious, but the crowd loves it.

The talent agent asks what they do. Immediately, the dad rips the mom’s clothes off and starts fucking her on the floor. Then the sons start to take turns gang banging their sister.

Then the dad takes a bottle of liquor, smashes it over his face and starts fist fucking the two middle brothers up the ass with shards of glass. Then the youngest brother grabs a gun, shoots the moose in all four of its knees so it will go down on all fours and starts fucking the moose. The mom is still lying on the floor not doing anything because the dad fucked her so hard, which is impressive considering she’s given birth to five children. Then, one of the middle brothers runs outside to a swimming pool that was in the vicinity, ties a rope around his neck and slips into the pool because apparently he read about auto erotic asphyxiation and decided he was going try to take having an orgasm while not being able to breathe to a whole new level. Luckily, the sister arrives just in time to cut the rope and pull him above the water but then he grabs his sister, pulls her into the pool, pulls down his swim trunks and stuffs her face right into his crotch. You’d think the talent agent would’ve called the police but he’s too curious; he wants to find out what’s going to happen next.

Finally, they all meet up by the pool and a plane has landed, while damaging some property might I add, to pick them up and they all join the mile high club. However, the youngest son decides he wants to try to fly, shoves the pilot into the other seat, and pilot lands awkwardly and breaks his own neck killing him instantly. The family, realizing the dire situation they are in, find the parachutes and escape the plane. They still have the where with all to fuck each other while they are falling out of the sky, much to the chagrin of the horrified on lookers below. They land outside the building, walk on stage and take a bow. The talent agent asks, “Who are you?”

The family, without missing a beat, say in unison, “The Kennedys.”

The world's greatest charade player brags that he can guess any charade. 

A TV producer decides to use the charade player in a TV special. He issues a challenge offering the charade player a million dollars to guess a very hard charade on television. The charade player agrees. 


Comes the big night, all the world is watching. The charade player is sitting on stage in front of a curtain. Music blares and the curtain opens to reveal seven nude young women. The second and fourth ladies are holding their breasts, while the other five have their backs to him and are baring their behinds. 




The charade player barely glances over them and says, ""The Radetsky March, by Richard Strauss”. 




The flabbergasted producer says in awe, ""You've done it! That's the correct answer. You are indeed the greatest charade player!"", and hands him a check for a million bucks. 




Walking out, a reporter stops the charade player and ask him how he did it. 




""It's really simple"", says the charade player. ""One look at the positions of the seven women, and I recognized it as the Radetsky March, which goes: rump... titty... rump... titty... rump... rump... rump.""

The girl became pregnant and gave birth to their first child.  It was a difficult pregnancy and there were complications, and surgery was required. When it was finished and the young woman came out of the recovery room, the surgeon met with the couple. 'I have some good news and some bad news,' the doctor said, 'The good news is that you are the parents of a seven-pound baby. 'The bad news, I'm afraid, is that there is an abnormality.  Your baby is just a head.  It was born without a torso.

Well, the young couple was very brave, and they took their baby home, and loved it and cared for it and played with it.  And on the baby's twelfth birthday , the doctor called.  I have amazing news, he said.  A torso has been found that would be a perfect match for the head.  Come in immediately, for it is ready for transplant.

The couple was elated, not only by the news, but that this amazing stroke of fortune should fall on their son's birthday.  They ran to his room. 'Son! the father exclaimed. We have the best birthday present a boy like you could ever dream of!

Oh yeah? Said the lad, looking up from the floor.  Well, it better not be another fucking hat!

They had talked about everything. They had kept no secrets from each other except that the little old woman had a shoe box in the top of her closet that she had cautioned her husband never to open or ask her about.
For all of these years, he had never thought about the box, but one day the little old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would not recover.
In trying to sort out their affairs, the little old man took down the shoe box and took it to his wife's bedside. She agreed that it was time that he should know what was in the box. When he opened it, he found two crocheted dolls and a stack of money totalling $95,000.
He asked her about the contents.
'When we were to be married,' she said, ' my grandmother told me the secret of a happy marriage was to never argue. She told me that if I ever got angry with you, I should just keep quiet and crochet a doll.'
The little old man was so moved; he had to fight back tears. Only two Precious dolls were in the box. She had only been angry with him two Times in all those years of living and loving. He almost burst with Happiness.
'Honey,' he said, 'that explains the doll, but what about all of this money? Where did it come from?'

post,47hmb8,2qh72,jokes,false,1456381516,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/47hmb8/dan_liked_children/,self.jokes,,"Dan liked children. It had always a problem for him, but he kept it to himself, and, until his wife left, he suppressed all feelings about it. After Linda cheated on him with his best friend and abandoned their marriage, Dan was depressed. He spent a couple weeks without seeing anyone, only leaving to get food and other necessities. Dan had a generous boss and took advantage of his numerous vacation days. Eventually, some friends got a hold of him and got him out of the house. All attempts to cheer him up were futile. Strippers and the like had no effect. 
One day, a family moved in across the street from his two story suburban home. They had a thirteen year old daughter, and, in the pits of Dan's depression, his old desires awakened. He would watch her from his bedroom window, but never fathomed fulfilling his fantasies. 

A couple weeks passed before Dan's wife sent him divorce papers from Europe, where she was staying with Chad, Dan's old friend and the Best Man at their wedding. Dan's agony recommenced, and he moved on from only Emily who lived across the street to watching girls coming out of the school, a few blocks over. When steel prices skyrocketed, the automotive industry was hit hard. Dan got laid off. This threw him to rock bottom. He had been gradually coming to terms with his pedophilia and, though a favor from a former coworker, bought a snow-colored van. Dan began driving out to neighborhoods where he wouldn't be recognized and luring girls to climb to his vehicle. He had always been particularly attractive. Despite the weight he had gained since his divorce, convincing young teens to come with him was surprisingly easy. He didn't dare force them to have sex. Touching and groping sufficed for him. However, Dan wasn't very discrete and was apprehended by the police in a matter of weeks.

Dan pled guilty, and the judge assigned him a 7 year sentence for his crimes. In jail, he contemplated suicide multiple times, but never had the courage to go through with it. The only thing that moderated his depression was the art classes he chose to take. Dan was surprisingly talented, and the judge who convicted him bought one of his paintings as evidence of the positive effects of the prison system. When he got out, Dan registered as a sex offender, and moved out of state. He had trouble getting a job and was turned down 6 different times because of his history before finding a position at Subway. To keep his spirits up, Dan decided to try to get a girlfriend. He made an online dating profile, but no relationships lasted after they found him on the registry. The longest one he had lasted a month. As a result of pure coincidence, Susan ended it with him on the same day that the Subway franchise Dan that was working at closed down. 

Dan relapsed into depression, and his pedophilia reignited. He slipped back into the same routine that put him behind bars. Dan found a cheap Chevy Astro in white, and this time he took it further. Unfortunately for him, emotional distress made him sloppier. The police caught him even sooner. Dan found himself in court once again. By pure chance, he was confronted with the same judge from before. The judge's wife had found a better job, which happened to be in the same state Dan took up residence in. Her husband moved with her, knowing that he could find a similar position in any city. When Dan stepped into his courtroom, the judge was surprised. He had bought Dan's impressionist painting, and recognized the man he had convicted. He cried out: 
""DAMN, DANIEL BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH THE WHITE VANS""",Dan liked children,4

She was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. He wondered why she was sitting alone. That is, until he got closer and noticed that she had an abnormally long nose. *Oh well, it's worth a shot,* he thought as he walked up to her. Confidently, he asked, ""Excuse me, Miss. Would you like to get some coffee with me?""

Dump the male flight Attendants.  No one wanted them in the first place.

Replace all the female flight attendants with YOUNG good-looking strippers!  What the hell!!  They don't even serve food anymore, so what's the loss?

The strippers would at least triple the alcohol sales and get a ""party atmosphere"" going in the cabin.  And, of course, every businessman in this country would start flying again, hoping to see naked women.  Because of the tips, female flight attendants wouldn't need a salary, thus saving money while the flight attendants jobs would be better paying than ever before.

Muslims would be afraid to get on the planes for fear of seeing naked women.  Hijackings would come to a screeching halt, and the airline industry would see record revenues.  We would not have any need for Air Marshalls, the TSA, etc.  This would make flying easier and safer again and would save even more money.

This is  definitely a win -- win situation if we handle it right -- a golden opportunity to turn a liability into an asset.

Dianne: Something wrong with them? 

Sam: No. I just don't think I've ever seen eyes that colour before. Matter of fact, I don't think I've ever seen that colour before... Yes, I have.

Dianne: Where? 

Sam: I was on a ski weekend up at Stowe... I was coming in late one day, last person off the slope as the sun had just gone down.
The sky became this incredible colour. 

Sam: I usually don't notice things like that, and I found myself walking around in the cold, hoping that it wouldn't change, wishing that I had somebody there to share it with. 

Sam: Afterwards, I tried to convince myself that I'd imagined that colour, that I hadn't seen it, that nothing on this earth could be that beautiful. Now I see I was wrong.

The doctor comes before the other passengers of the plane and says ""As a doctor, I've used my medical skills to save hundreds of lives, and if I escape, I'll be able to save hundreds more."" The rest of the passengers satisfied with his response, they let the doctor grab a parachute and leave the plane.

The lawyer, very disheveled, comes before the preacher and the boy and says ""As a lawyer, I've used my legal knowledge to crack hundreds of cases and I'm probably the smartest man in the world, so I deserve to live!"" Before the boy and the preacher can react, the lawyer grabs a pack and jumps.

The preacher comes before the boy, getting on one knee and placing a hand on his shoulder. ""Son,"" he begins, ""as a preacher, I've lived a long and dutiful life in service to the Lord, and I have no doubt that when this plane crashes, I'll be taking my place at my Father's table. You have your entire life ahead of you, so you take the last parachute and go.""

Unfazed, the kid hands the preacher a parachute and says ""Don't worry, take this one: the smartest man in the world just jumped out with my backpack!""

On his arrival home he wakes up to find his penis covered with bright green and purple spots. Horrified, he immediately goes to see a doctor. The doctor, never having seen anything like this before, orders some tests and comes to the conclusion that there is no known cure and his penis will have to be amputated.

The man is shocked at the thought of loosing his penis and before committing to the operation looks to seek a second opinion.

After stressing the severity of the situation the Doctor informs the man that he has scheduled an operation in two days time, allowing for the man to seek a second opinion.

The next day, the man seeks out a Chinese doctor, figuring that he’ll know more about the disease.

The guy pleads with the Chinese doctor for help: “Dhat we can do? My American doctor wants to operate and amputate my penis!”

The Chinese doctor shakes his head and laughs: “Stupid Amelican doctor, always want to operate. No need to opelate!”

“Oh, Thank God!,” the man replies.

“Yes,” says the Chinese doctor, “you no worry! Thats going to fall off by itself!”",A Trip to China,2

post,473nu3,2qh72,jokes,false,1456183461,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/473nu3/the_40_joke/,self.jokes,,"Steve is going out for his buddy's bachelor party. It's been planned for months. He gets home from work and quickly starts getting ready. His lady, Tina, surprises him with a fancy dress shirt for the big night. ""Aw thanks babe, it's amazing"". She tells him it was really expensive but ""he's worth it and it's a big night"". 

He leaves and meets the lads at the bar. No time for food, apparently and they dive straight into shooters. 8 shots in, no food and Steve stands up and pukes all over his shirt. ""Awwwww damn....dammit all...."". His buddy says ""Steve, it's just a little puke, don't worry man"". Steve explains that it's a new shirt from Tina and she'll be pissed. 
Buddy says ""don't worry dude, give me a $20 bill"". Steve fumbles for his wallet and hands him a crisp 20. His buddy tucks it into Steve's pocket on the shirt and says ""when you get home, just tell Tina some dude at the bar puked on your shirt and gave you $20 to clean it!"". They both love the idea!

Steve eventually gets home at 5am. Lost his keys, his phone...he's a total drunk mess. Knocks on the door and Tina slowly opens it. One look at his messy shirt and she starts freaking. ""I bought you ONE NICE SHIRT and you puke all over it??!!"". 
Steve taps his pocket on the shirt...""no no babe, some dude at the bar puked on my shirt and gave me $20 to clean it"". She reaches in and pulls out $40. Surprised, she asks ""what's the extra $20 for?"".


Oh...he also took a shit in my pants.",The $40 joke,4
