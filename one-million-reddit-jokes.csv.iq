ecause he only has one ear!""

The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you
two?!? Of course only one eye and one ear are SHOWING
because it's a picture of his profile!! Is that the best
answer you can come up with?

Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to
the third blonde and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is
your suspect, how would you recognize him?"" He quickly adds""
. . . think hard before giving me a stupid answer.""

The blonde looks at the picture intently for a moment and
says, ""Hmmmm . . . the suspect wears contact lenses.""

The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really
doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. 
""Well, that's an interesting answer . . . wait here for a few
minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on
that.""

He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the
suspect's file in his computer, and comes back with a beaming
smile on his face. ""Wow! I can't believe it...it's TRUE! 
The suspect does in fact wear contact lenses. Good work! 
How were you able to make such an astute observation?""

""That's easy,"" the blonde replied. ""He can't wear regular
glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.",A policeman was interrogating 3 blondes who were training to become detectives.,4495

As the assassin tries to reload, Donald looks and hears the words from the agent again, “Donald, Duck!” 

As the assassin begins to fire his gun again, Donald decides to bob and weave, causing the assassin to miss a second time. At this point, the agent moved quickly towards Donald’s side. 

As Donald feels the agent’s hands around his arms, Donald hears the agent yell, “You magnificent, handsome, smart young man. Do you hear me? Donald! Duck!”

Donald finally ducks down resulting in the new agent bursting into tears. This causes the assassin to hit the new agent instead of Donald. As the agent dies, the assassin is then tackled by the other agents on the field. 

When the all clear signal was given, Donald stands, looks at the dead agent, and cannot believe the sacrifice the new agent made in order to save his life.

The fish thinks to itself, ""If that fly would only drop six inches I could jump up and have some lunch.""

Well on the bank of the river is a bear. The bear sees the fish and the fly and thinks to itself ""If that fly would only drop six inches, that fish will jump out of the water and I can stick my paw out, catch the fish, and I could have some lunch.""

Up a ways on an elevated bluff sits a hunter. This hunter sees the fly, the fish, and the bear and thinks to himself, ""If that fly would only drop six inches, that fish will jump out of the water, that bear will stick it's paw out to catch the fish giving me a clear shot, and I could have some lunch""

In the bushes next to the hunter sits a field mouse. The mouse sees the fly, the fish, the bear, and the hunter and thinks to itself, ""If that fly would only drop six inches, that fish will jump out of the water, that bear will stick it's paw out to catch the fish giving that hunter a clear shot, at which point he'll drop his sandwich, and I could have some lunch"" 

Well up just a bit higher from the hunter and a mouse sits a mountain lion. Now the mountain lion sees the fly, the fish, the bear, the hunter, and the mouse and thinks to itself, ""If that fly would only drop six inches, that fish will jump out of the water, that bear will stick it's paw out to catch the fish giving that hunter a clear shot, at which point he'll drop his sandwich and the mouse will jump out the bushes allowing me to pounce on it, and I could have some lunch"" 

Sure enough the fly drops six inches at which point the fish jumps up to catch the fly, the bear steps forward to catch the fish, the hunter drops his sandwich to shoot the bear, the mouse jumps out of the bushes to eat the sandwich, and the mountain lion jumps off its perch to eat the mouse. Except the mountain lion misses and goes tumbling down the hill into the river.

Luckily, they happened to be passing an inn, so they decided to stop for the night to wait out the storm.

Naturally (because this is a joke…) the inn had only one room remaining, but the innkeeper offered to put a cot in the room so they could share it.

“Will that be ok with you Sister?” asked the priest. “Of course!” she replied. They settled into their room, and prepared to sleep, the priest getting into the cot and the nun into the bed, and the priest turned off the light.

Five minutes later, the priest hears “Father, I’m cold!”  “Would you like me to get you a blanket from the closet Sister?”  “Yes please!”

The priest turns on the light, gets out of the cot, gets a blanket from he closet, and lays it on top of the nun.  “Thank you Father, you’re SO nice” says the nun, as she grabs his hand and strokes his arm.  “No trouble at all Sister” says the priest, as he pulls himself away, crawls back into the cot and again turns out the light.

Three minutes pass and again “Father, I’m still cold!”  “Would you like me to get you another blanket Sister?”  “Yes Father, I’d like that!”

Again, the priest turns on the light, gets out of the cot, gets another blanket, and lays it on top of the nun.  “Thank you Father, you’re SO good to me” says the nun, as she grabs him in a hug and squeezes him tightly.  “No trouble at all Sister, Happy to help you” says the priest, as he again pulls himself from her grasp and walks back to his cot, crawls in, and turns out the light.

One minute passes, and again “Father, I’m still cold!” “Another blanket Sister?”  “YES, PLEASE!”  Again, light on, out of the cot, another blanket. This time the nun grabs him tightly and plants a wet, passionate kiss on the priest. “Thank you Father, you’re SO nice to me!, if only I could repay your kindness!”  “More than happy to help you Sister” he says, as he again pries himself from her embrace and returns to the cot, turning out the light again.

The light isn’t off for 10 seconds when again the nun says “Father, I’m still VERY cold!”

Without getting up, the priest says “Sister, can we be honest with ourselves? We both know what’s going on here, don’t we?”  “Well, yes, I think so Father…”

“Good. Now Sister, I sincerely believe that the good Lord, in all his greatness, would understand that on this cold, cold, night, when we’re stuck here all alone in a place where no one knows us, that maybe you and I should give in to our urges, stop this game of being polite, and just behave as if we’re husband and wife for this one night.  Don’t you believe that the Lord would forgive us for our sins if we were to do so Sister?”

“Oh YES Father, I DO believe that! And it would make me SO happy!” she replies, in a deep, husky voice.

“Good.  Then get your lazy ass out of bed and get your own DAMN BLANKET!  I’m tired and I’m going to sleep!""",The Priest and the Nun,12

""Well, you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, then you get all the money.""

""What are the three tests?"" asks the man

""Gotta pay first.""

So the guy gives him the $10 bucks, and the bartender adds it to the jar.

""OK, here's what you have to do. First, you have to drink that whole bottle of pepper tequila- the WHOLE thing at once- and you can't make a face while doing it. Second, there's a pit bull chained up out back with a sore tooth. You have to remove the tooth with your bare hands. Third, there is a 90-year-old woman upstairs who's never had an orgasm in her life. You gotta make things right for her.""

""Well, I know I've paid my $10 bucks,"" says the man, ""but I'm not an idiot. No wonder you've collected so much money -- that's impossible!""

The new guy proceeds to drink several whiskeys, and eventually, he gets up his nerve.

Slurring, he yells ""ALLLLLRIGHT! Where'sat tequilla?""

He grabs the bottle of pepper tequila with both hands and downs it, gulp by gulp. Tears are streaming down his cheeks, but he doesn't make a face. Next, he staggers out back. Everyone in the bar hears a huge scuffle outside -- barking, yelping and growling, then silence.

Just when they think the man must be dead, he staggers back into the bar with his shirt ripped and gashes across his body.

""NOW,"" he says, ""Where'sat woman with the sore tooth?""",Three Tests,4

""God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, God bless Grandma and good-bye Grandpa.""

The father asked, 'Why did you say good-bye Grandpa?'

The little girl said, ""I don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do.""

The next day grandpa died. 
The father thought it was a strange coincidence.

A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this, ""God bless Mommy, God Bless Daddy and good-bye Grandma.""

The next day the grandmother died.

""Holy crap"" thought the father, ""this kid is in contact with the other side.""

Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say, ""God bless Mommy and good-bye Daddy.""

He practically went into shock. He couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office. 

He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay. 

He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

When he got home his wife said, ""I've never seen you work so late. What's the matter?""

He said, ""I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of my life.""

She said, ""You think you had a bad day, you'll never believe what happened to me. This morning my boss died in the middle of a meeting!""",Goodbye r/jokes,249

The Hippie is alarmed and exclaims ""What are you doing?!""

The businessman responds by saying that this piece of land was bought by his company. The land was good and the foundation was perfect for a storefront, and his crew would be here shortly. The Hippie tells him that he can't build on this plot of land because it's magical! The businessman is skeptical so the Hippie points at the rock on the far side of the land, where the businessman has yet to build anything.

""You see that rock?""

""Yeah, so what?"" says the businessman.

""That rock used to be on the left side of the land. Now it's in the back""

The businessman doesn't get the big deal.

The hippie goes, ""Well, how do you think that happened?""

The Businessman says ""Well, obviously someone moved the rock""

The hippie laughs and challenges the businessman to move it. So they go over to the rock and the businessman gets ready to pick it up. He can't. He tries rolling it, he can't. As the businessman fails to move this rock, the Hippie tells him ""I told you, this plot of land is magical. Only I can move this rock.""

The businessman is in disbelief. ""How the hell can you move this rock? It's impossible to budge!""

The Hippie says ""The only way to move the rock is with my orgasm""

The businessman is disgusted. ""I don't believe you. This is my land, I don't care about a stupid rock! I'll get someone from my construction crew to move it for me!""

The Hippie just laughs and says ""Let me show you""

The Hippie whips his dick out and starts stroking it. The businessman can't believe the Hippie is doing this, but he can't look away. Soon the Hippie gets ready to orgasm and the businessman is completely mesmerized now. As the Hippie cums, the whole ground shakes, it becomes too blurry for the businessman to even see what's happening! But he feels the piece of land rotate 90 degrees. By the time the Hippie finishes cumming, the plot of land has stopped moving and both the Hippie and businessman are on the right side of the land, along with the rock. The businessman is amazed, almost speechless.

The Hippie zips up and says ""Do you believe me now?""

The businessman regains his composure and finally says ""The foundation was good and the climax had me hooked... but I did not see that plot-twist cumming!""",(OC) A Hippie walks by a businessman...,696

Gorbachev told Reagan, ""look"". He ordered his security detachment beside him to jump off the canyon. The security detachment looked at Gorbachev, took a run, and jumped (by miracle he was safe hanging on a branch few meters lower).
Reagan looked at his secret service and told him to jump. The secret service looked at Reagan and said ""I have a wife and children at home. I am not jumping.""
Shocked, Reagan walked over to the ambulance that had arrived and asked Gorbachev’s security detachment: ""Why did you jump?!"" He replied: ""I have a wife and children at home.""

The man who just walked in says, ""Actually, yes I do have a trick!"" He pulls a very small man out of his pocket, as well as an even smaller grand piano. The man is only about a foot tall, and the piano about six inches tall. Immediately, the little man begins playing the piano brilliantly, and the entire bar falls silent and listens to the little man play. He plays for ten minutes, and by the end everyone is on their feet clapping and cheering for him.

One of the guys asks the original guy where he found the little man and the piano. He responds, ""Oh there's a genie in the men's bathroom here, and he gave them to me. If you go back there and wish for something, just make sure to speak clearly since the genie is a little hard of hearing.""

So the man goes into the bathroom, and sure enough the genie is sitting right in front of him. The genie says, ""What is your wish?"" And the man responds, ""I wish for a million bucks!"" The genie says, ""Can you repeat that?"" So the man says again, a little louder this time, ""*I wish for a million bucks!*"" Finally the genie says, ""Your wish is my command.""

The man walks home later that night and finds a million ducks sitting in his living room. The ducks fill the entire room and are spilling into adjacent rooms. The man is understandably pissed at this, since the ducks are taking up so much space and are making so much noise. 

The next day, he goes back to the bar and tells the original man, ""Last night I go home and what do I see? A million ducks sitting in my house! Are you fucking kidding me?"" The original man says, ""Of course not. Do you think I asked the genie for a twelve inch pianist?""",A man walks into a bar and starts talking to the guys there.,12

His interviewer said “I think you’d be a great addition to this salon, but first I want to see how you do on the practical exam.”

They both left her office and entered the salon. A model with beautiful hair sat in front of the mirror. “Go ahead and give her a trim” the interviewer told the man.

The man was very nervous as he shampooed the model’s hair. He brought the model back to her seat and pulled out his scissors. He was so anxious that he just stood there, unable to snip any of her hair. He ran his hands through her hair, trying to determine where best to cut, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it.

""He will kill any men, women and some say even children that he sees on Sundays.  Today is Sunday.   A town over was completely wiped out 2 weeks ago while they were leveling the church as he was riding through"" said the barkeep in a shaky voice

""Why are you not hiding then"" 

""Because he completely burned down the previous town become the bar was closed.  He does not seem to kill barkeepers"" smiled the old man

""Well, not to call you a lier sir, but I will take my chances even if im not much of a fighter.  Your story is too bizarre to be true.  A beer if you will kind sir"" said the cowboy in a tired voice.

""Of course"" said the old man.

As soon as the cowboy took a first sip of beer, the swinging saloon doors flew across the room, and when the dust settled, there was a man on a horse where the door once stood. 

The horse was black as night and the man riding it was wearing all black leather; pants, boots, coat, hat, everything.  Even his pistols were made of black steel, hanging in black holsters.  His eyes, mustache and beard, his hair, all black as sin.  Its almost as if the air itself around him was black too.

The rider got off his horse and hurriedly walked straight over to where our petrified cowboy was sitting.

With the right hand on his holstered black pistol, in the most thundering voice the cowboy has ever heard, the rider said

""On. Your. Knees""

The cowboy instinctively complied as he could muster no strength to say anything.  Then as soon as the cowboy's knees touched the ground, the rider, with a single motion of his left hand, in a split second, he whipped out his cock in front of cowboys face.

The rider didn't even say a word, he only gazed at the cowboy with his abyssal eyes.  The cowboy likewise didn't say anything, he knew exactly what he had to do, and so he did.

About 5 minutes later, the rider spoke again.

The Texan says yes and asks the bartender to line up 10 pints of Guinness. Immediately the Irishman tears into all 10 of the pint glasses drinking them all back-to-back. The other pub patrons cheer as the Texan sits in amazement.

The Texan gives the Irishman the $500 and says, ""If ya don't mind me askin', where did you go for that 30 minutes you were gone?""

He was the apple of Madam Georgina's eye, the only puppy kept to warm her heart as the rest of the litter was given to the loving homes of her close friends. He spent the first year of his life in luxury, spoiled on the best kibble, the most sumptuous treats, and only the finest dog toys. He went on long walks to gorgeous locales up and down the Maine beaches, and was doted on by Madam Georgina always. 

On his first birthday, his loving owner passed away quietly in her sleep. Madam Georgina’s fortunes were vast, and in her will she gave much of her wealth to Bartleby, to sustain him and keep him happy long after she passed away. Her extended family slithered from all over the country to leech off of the dead woman, and were more than a little peeved to see that, while their debts were taken care of, they would not be able to live lavishly off of her fortune. The most devious of the bunch hired equally devious lawyers, who argued before a judge that Madam Georgina had become senile towards the end of her life, for what kind of sane woman would give all that money to a pooch and leave her family out in the cold? The judge was paid off with the promise of a cut in her fortunes, and, really, how much money did a dog need? 

Madam Georgina’s mansion was put on the market and sold, and her family slunk back into their uninspired lives many times richer than they had been. But what of Bartleby? Out of his master, out of house and home, he was out on the streets, unequipped to deal with the cruel world off of Madam Georgina’s estate. He wandered aimlessly, never losing hope, but likewise never finding a family to take him in. He was growing quite thin and ragged when he happened upon an equally homeless fellow named Timothy in a public park in a little town named Redfield. Timothy had a big heart, and couldn’t bear to see a puppy in peril, so he shared his meager rations with Bartleby, bathed him, and groomed him as best he could. Quickly, the two became inseparable. What was the most striking to Timothy was that, despite his lowly state, Bartleby had a very regal bearing to him, the dog of an aristocrat. He was well behaved, quiet, and dignified in all things he did. 

One day Timothy saw a flyer for a dog show with a one hundred dollar prize. He thought that a little money would go a long way in treating Bartleby to something special, and, given the small size of Redfield, he thought that Bartleby just might have a chance to win. The contest was in one week, and he signed Bartleby up. That week they worked day in and day out practicing obstacle courses and strutting in just the right way, and became even closer friends. The night of the contest, it was said that Bartleby was not the best groomed of the many dogs in the Redfield show, and Timothy did not smell the best of the dog owners there, but by God Bartleby outshone them all. The judges could not deny that he was a perfect specimen in every way, a diamond in the rough if they’d ever seen one. 

“Timothy,” one judge said, “your dog is a regular champion, if I do say so myself. I think you should enter him in the statewide contest, with a one thousand dollar prize.”

Timothy declined the offer, happy with just his hundred dollars and the promise of a few warm meals with his friend. But, wouldn’t you know it, the check got lost in the mail, and Timothy and Bartleby were still out on the streets. 

Now, Timothy was by no means a greedy man. But he had set out to treat Bartleby to something special, and he was a man of his word. So, with the New York State Dog Show just a week away, the pair set to work again. Timothy managed to beg for just enough money for bus fare into New York City, and the pair was on the road. In New York, Timothy could see that the competition was stiff. These were the heavy hitters, pompadoured poodles and dignified owners who couldn’t hardly stand looking at the disheveled pair. 

But, the judges could not deny it, try as they might: Bartleby ran the obstacle course better than any other dog, and was dignified, and alert, and strong in posture and composure. They poked and prodded but couldn’t find fault with him. Begrudgingly, they awarded Timothy and Bartleby the first place prize, and with it the promise of entry into the America-wide dog show. As a measure of revenge, the corrupt dog show participants in the state-wide show, still bitter that a street urchin and his raggedy puppy came into their establishment and swept the show, colluded to have the prize money mysteriously disappear. 

This meant that not only were Bartleby and Timothy cheated again, they were stuck in New York City without the means to travel to the national show in Boston. That show, and its ten-thousand dollar prize, would be out of reach. Sighing, Timothy dug deep into his heart for the resolve to smile at his pooch, and he knew that they would get by. They always had, and they didn’t need any fancy dog shows or prize money to prove it. 

A local boatman, the uncle of one of the show participants who had kept the prize money away from Timothy, heard what had happened and resolved to make things right. He found the pair busking for spare change in the subway, and explained that his boat was making a trip up to Boston in just three days time. They would be perfectly able to sneak on, and that would make up for the wicked actions of his nephew. 

Timothy didn’t want money or national acclaim, but he owed it to Bartleby at this point, and he hadn’t been to Boston since he was a young man himself. He took the boatman up on his offer, and in a few days they were on the high seas. The ocean was calm and welcoming, and they made it to the national dog show without any trouble. 

Just as he’d done twice before, Bartleby arrived with much disdain, and exited with the first prize. He was, undeniably, the best dog the judges had ever seen, perfect in every way. He made all other dogs pale in comparison. Worried that Bartleby, only a few years old, would continue winning the show, year after year, for the rest of his life, they banned him from the show, and trumped up false accusations of cheating against Timothy, stripping them of their gold medal and the money they would have won. The dog show circuit in America is notoriously corrupt, an insiders club, and they had no qualms hurting Timothy and Bartleby in such a way. 

The pair returned to the boatman’s boat, and asked to be taken back to New York, if he could manage that. He promised that he would take them back, and promised them a hot meal and a place to stay if they needed it. Timothy tried to decline, but he insisted, over and over, that his house was their house, and that if anyone deserved a reprieve from suffering it was the two of them. 

The sail home was not so easy. The oceans were in a roil, and a nor'easter was rising up. The boat creaked and shook. Bartleby, who had been riding up in the crow’s nest to taste the salt air, was now trapped up there. Lightning struck, thunder roared, and the rains pelted down. Timothy couldn’t get his friend down, and Bartleby was too frightened to even try. The boat shook more and more, and even the crew were urging Timothy to go below deck until the storm passed. 

Bang! A strike of lightning, and a boom of thunder. The winds were knocking men off their feet. 

In the crow’s nest, a huge gust of wind carried Bartleby from its relative safety into unforgiving free fall. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty feet he fell, careening to the deck of the ship. Timothy saw him only as a little speck against the black sky that grew larger and larger until...Crash! He landed on the deck with a sickening thud, limp and unmoving. 

In tears, Timothy and the boatman ran towards his prone form. The boatman could hardly look. 

In a flash, Bartleby was up on his feet, licking Timothy’s face, and nuzzling his cheeks. 

“How could he have survived that fall?” The boatman asked. “I’ve seen grown men fall from that height, and they certainly died. No one could survive that fall!”

“Oh, Bartleby? He’s used to hard ships.”
",There was a beautiful little terrier named Bartleby,4

The menu is long and wide, varied in all manner of assortments of appetizers to dining for 3 or 4 people. As I go through the menu, I noticed the child from earlier looking on with a nervous expression. I do my best to ignore it, but the longer I go over the menu, the more he fidgets. 

Finally after enough of this, I look to him and asked if everything was okay. He gave a brief nod, only to be shooed away by the waitress as she brings me my drink. She asked if I would like to order, and having been more preoccupied with the nervous child, I hadn't time to fully consider the menu, but anxiety getting the better of me, I immediately order the kung-pow chicken. Suddenly the child, now sat at the front counter begins to immediately wail in despair. The waitress rushed over to the child, consoling him and it wasn't long before the food was brought to my table.

I take a bite, and think nothing of it. It wasn't until the child passes my table, that his eyes grow big and he, once again, begins to cry. ""What's wrong?"" I asked the boy.

After a while, the field is narrowed down to just three well qualified applicants. They're flown to Langley to interview.

The first candidate is Major Ron L Lubbold: Army Ranger, a 15 year veteran of 6 combat deployments and over 200 missions, He is the most accurate sniper to have served the army in 30 years, and left a lasting mark on the when he took over and overhauled the Sniper Training Center for Rangers, resulting in an overall 15% increase of mission effectiveness for new members of the elite squads.

He is a shoe-in for the position. After a brief interview, the CIA Director says 

""Major, we want you to be our new Superspy Assassin. We have only one concern. The CIA is not military. Your targets may not be military. We operate under a different ethical code than the Army: if the National Security requires a kill, there will be a kill. Your absolute reliability must not be in doubt. Your wife is sitting in the board room through those doors. Take this gun and shoot her.""

The Major stood and saluted without reaching for the pistol. ""Mr. Director, the price is too great. I cannot accept this position.""

""Very well major, take your wife and go home"".

The next candidate was Chief Petty Officer Tom Ramirez, Navy SEAL. Slight of build and carrying himself with a disarming charm, he was affectionately known as Mole for his ability to move through tight spaces and remove threats undetected. His unassuming disposition belied a capacity for ruthless, surgically efficient violence. There was only the matter of ensuring his willingness to carry out any mission without question.

He was given the same speech. Taking the pistol, he walked calmly into the adjacent room. After a few silent minutes, he walked out with his wife beside him and said ""Sir, I'm sorry but you'll have to find another for your missions. I cannot do this awful thing, I may not be able to do the next.""

He took his wife and went home.

The final candidate was a civilian, Jennifer Stone: Triathlete, 3 time Olympic Biathlon medalist, accomplished data analyst for a software firm, where she worked on several classified contracts for the CIA. Although the agency would have preferred a veteran, she was unquestionably qualified. It only remained to be seen if she could accept any mission.

""Mrs. Stone, your husband is sitting in that room. He doesn't know you're here. Take this gun and shoot him, and the job is yours""

The first shot rang out before the door closed behind her. A moment later, nine more reports, followed by swearing until all hell broke loose. Screaming and crashing and sickening thuds muffled through the closed door for several minutes. Eventually Jennifer Stone emerged: bloody and disheveled.

""You bastards could have told me the gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat the sunofabitch to death with the chair!""

 ""Ahhh, you have chosen wisely! It is $12 for the rat and $100 for the story,"" said the wise old Chinaman.

 The tourist quickly pulled out twelve dollars. ""I'll just take the rat, you can keep the story"".

 As he walked down the street carrying his bronze rat, the tourist noticed that a few real rats had crawled out of the alleys and sewers and had begun following him down the street. This was a bit disconcerting so he began walking faster.

 A couple blocks later he looked behind him and saw to his horror the herd of rats behind him had grown to hundreds, and they began squealing.

 Sweating now, the tourist began to trot toward San Francisco Bay.

 Again, after a couple blocks, he looked around only to discover that the rats now numbered in the MILLIONS, and were squealing and coming toward him faster and faster.

 Terrified, he ran to the edge of the Bay and threw the bronze rat as far as he could into the Bay.

 Amazingly, the millions of rats all jumped into the Bay after the bronze rat and were all drowned.

They haven t planned to go for a long walk, since it was quite hot, and they had no water with them. Summer in malta, being what it is, they soon became quite thirsty. 

They happened to be close by to a run down farmhouse, and peter had the idea to ask the owners for some water. They knocked on the bare wooden door and an old woman, with no teeth and dirty hair greeted them. Peter ask the old woman if she would be kind enough to give them something to drink, to which she replied that she can offer them some water from her well. 

She led the way to her yard, pulled up a bucket of water from the well and gave them both a chipped cup to fill with the cool water and drink as much as they wished. Peter immediately filled his cup with water and downed it in one go ... meanwhile paul who was a germophobe, kept looking at the cup, which looked as it hasn t been washed in years, afraid to even touch it let alone drink from it.

Finally what with the intense heat and the thirst, he decided to drink, but picked up the cup with his left hand, as he didn t want to drink from the same side as the old woman. He filled the cup, drank the water in one go with his eyes closed ... only to find the old woman with a huge smile on her face ...

Steve says, “I’m not lying. Name anyone, and we’ll visit them.”

So Jim and Steve head to Tom Cruises’s house, and knock on the door. Tom Cruise answers and exclaims, “Steve! It’s so good to see you. How about you and your friend come in for a drink?” So they did but Jim is not impressed. Jim says, “You’re just lucky.” 

He thinks for a second. He suggests they visit the President. 

So Jim and Steve head to The White House and knock on the door (don’t overthink it). Trump answers and exclaims, “Steve! It’s so good to see you. How about you and your friend come in for coffee?” So they did but Jim is still not impressed. “It’s just a huge coincidence,” he says. 

He thinks for a moment. He suggests they visit the Pope.

So Jim and Steve head to Vatican City and make their way to Saint Peters’ Square, where there is a crowd of people watching the Pope on the balcony. Steve says, “I’ll prove to you I know the Pope by heading up to the balcony and waving alongside him. I know all the guards, so it should be easy.”

Steve makes his way up the balcony and waves alongside the Pope for a few minutes when he notices an ambulance had arrived in the plaza.

He goes down to the ambulance and sees Jim being hauled into the ambulance in a stretcher. “He has a heart attack, but he’s still conscious,” one of the paramedics explained to Steve. 

Steve asked Jim what happened. Jim says “It happened when a guy who was standing next to me said asked, ‘hey who’s that guy on the balcony next to Steve?’”",Steve claims that he knows everyone.,5

To this, Bill merely smirked and walked towards the entrance, mumbling something under his breath probably along the lines of ""challenge accepted."" Before he went through the door however, he reached into his pocket and pulled out his handy dandy pair of genuine sunglasses. Then as he and his German Shepherd walked in, he pretended to be blind.

Jim would not be outsmarted by Bill. An age old rivalry rekindled, Jim pulled out his own pair of handy dandy genuine sunglasses and walked into the bar with his little Chihuahua Pedro leading the way.

As he walks in he pretends to be blind just like Bill but the bartender yells at him, ""HEY! Get outta here man, we don't allow dogs in this place!""

""What do you mean, this is my seeing eye dog! He legally goes with me where ever I go,"" Jim cleverly countered.

""Man, that's not a seeing eye dog, thats a Chihuahua. ROTFL."" The bartender laughs. Loudly.

He walked up to the front of the class.

“I'm going to tell the story about the Little Green Frog."" 

And he told the story.

As he finished, the class sat there in shock. Eyes wide open, mouths to the floor, some kids were even crying.

""Oh my goodness!!”, the teacher screamed. “Where did you learn such a disgusting, horrid story?! Come with me to the principals office, right now.""

The teacher marched Jimmy to the principals office and got him to repeat what he told the class. The principal was horrified. 

""A child of your age should not know such things! That is absolutely disgusting! I'm afraid we're going to have to call your parents in and have a meeting with the school counsellor"".

Later that day, the principal, the school counsellor, Jimmy's parents, and of course, Jimmy, sat around the counsellors table. His father sat there trying to console his mother, who was in tears.

""In the 35 years I've worked with unruly children"", the counsellor said quietly, ""I've never dealt with such a situation. I can't even fathom where he would hear such a story. To think, a child knowing such a disgusting story, it's unheard of.""

Jimmy's mother let out a sob.

""The only thing I can a suggest is sending him to St Lucian's Centre for Troubled Youths. The strictest, most disciplined facility in the country. That should straighten him out.""

And so away Jimmy went. They packed up his belongings and dropped him off at the Centre. 

The next morning, Jimmy sat in the dining hall by himself, eating his breakfast. A rough looking teenager walked up, sat down across from him, and spoke to him. 

“You’re rather young to be in here,” he said, “What’s your story?”

Jimmy looked up from his breakfast.

""All I did was tell the story of the Little Green Frog."" 

The boy across from him looked confused. 

“The what?”, he asked. 

Jimmy sighed, and began to tell the story. 

When he finished, the entire hall was silent. 

Only the sounds that could be heard were the sounds of cutlery being dropped in disbelief. Even the most violent and vicious kids stopped dead in their tracks and simply stared. After what seemed like an eternity of silence, everyone went back their business.

Later that night, as Jimmy lay on his bed surrounded by nothing but concrete walls and darkness, there was a knock on his door. It was the teenager who spoke to him earlier that morning. 

""Look kid, me and another kid have a plan to bust out of here tonight. But we need one more person. And you seem messed up enough to try and pull something like this. Are you in?""

Jimmy didn't like being in there, he didn't even understand why he was in there. After all, all he did was tell the story of the Little Green Frog.

""All right, I'm in"", Jimmy said quietly.

The teenager pulled out what looked like a mangled fork from the dining hall, and unlocked Jimmy's door. 

Before long they were outside the Centres walls.

""We're almost in the clear, boys,"" the teen grunted, ""Just over this road and we're home free"".

As the three began walking across the road, a speeding truck came past and hit all three of them, killing them instantly.

The moral of the story?

Always look both ways when crossing the road.",The Little Green Frog,2

post,8z5cqa,2qh72,jokes,false,1531691461,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8z5cqa/this_is_good/,self.jokes,,"Once there was a king. His best friend was a commoner, a man who was the son of one of the royal housekeepers. They were of an age, and had grown up playing together in the palace gardens. 

As they grew older, the king found himself more and more impressed with his friend’s ability to always see the good in any bad situation.  No matter what terrible thing happened to his friend, the first words out of his mouth were always, “This is good,” followed by an explanation of his positive outlook. 

For instance, when his friend’s childhood sweetheart spurned him for another chap, he insisted, “This is good! Better she leave me now than after we’ve married and had children!” And when his horse came to a sudden halt in the middle of the road and threw him, rather than whipping his horse as the king would have done, he said, “This is good! Look at that hole in the road before us! If he had stepped in that he would have surely broken his leg. I’d rather be a bit bruised up than have to put down my only steed!”

One day the king and his friend were out hunting. As usual, his friend was carrying both of their rifles. (After all, they were friends, but the king was still the king.) When the king spotted some game he motioned for his gun. His friend fumbled while handing it to him and somehow managed to discharge the weapon, accidentally shooting off the king’s right thumb. 

“Aaaaah!!! The king yelled. “You’ve shot off my thumb!!” 

“This is good!” his friend began, but before he could continue, the incensed king struck him with his non-mangled hand and shouted for him to be silent. That he didn’t want to hear another word about how him losing his thumb could possibly be a positive thing. His anger at his friend was so great, in fact, that he had him thrown in the castle dungeon. 

Many years passed, and the king’s heart remained hard against his friend. Every time he fumbled his fork or his pen, he seethed at his friend’s impertinence and he refused to even consider letting him go free. 

He did not lose his love of hunting, however, and he was excited to hear of a group of hunters that were planning an expedition to faraway lands to find exotic game to bring home as trophies. He requested to join their party, and seeing as he was their king, they couldn’t exactly say no, although privately they were concerned. You see, the king had grown rather indolent and fat over the years, as he was used to being waited on hand and foot, and they weren’t sure that he would be able to keep up over the rough terrain. 

Once they arrived in the faraway jungles, they were pleasantly surprised by the king’s stamina. He couldn’t move as quickly as the rest of them, but his enthusiasm never flagged and they matched their pace to his. 

They had been there for several days, and had managed to bag several large and wondrous creatures that none of them had ever heard of before when they were ambushed by a tribe of cannibals. Most of the team were able to quickly escape, but the fat, slow king was captured. 

The cannibals had never seen a man so fat, and were gleeful in anticipation of their feast. They built up a huge fire and began to heat water in an enormous cauldron in order to boil the king alive. The chieftain heard the celebrations and came out to size up their prize. Desperate, the terrified king clasped his hands together and pleaded for his life. 

The chieftain noticed something odd. He grabbed the king’s right hand and held it this way and that, examining the scarred stump where his thumb once was. He then frowned and made motions for the king to be released, for their tribe had longstanding traditions against eating anything or anyone who wasn’t whole. 

The king stumbled back to the expedition campsite and everyone rejoiced to see him miraculously alive. They packed up quickly and returned home. On the long journey, the king did a lot of thinking about what had happened. 

When he arrived back at the castle, the very first thing the king did was to go down to the dungeon to see his old friend. He threw open the cell door and threw himself at his friend’s feet, weeping. He recounted the whole tale, ending with, “You were right all along! It *was* good that you shot off my thumb! Oh my friend, how can you forgive me?”

And his friend replied, “There’s nothing to forgive! This is good!”

The king was astonished and asked, “How could this be good? I’ve kept you unjustly imprisoned for all these years!”

“Because if I hadn’t been in prison, I would have been with you, my king. And when the rest of the hunting party fled, I would have stayed with you, my friend. And I have both my thumbs!”

They bring the fish to the kitchen and show the monastery chef their prize catch, and Fr. Brian can't contain himself: ""We just caught this son of a bitch and we were thinking you could cook it up for all the Brothers tonight!""

The chef clamps a hand over Fr. Brain's mouth and looks over both shoulders to make sure no one heard him, and says, ""Brother, please! A man of God must not use such language! Look, we just found out the Pope is coming for dinner tonight, and this fish must be a sign from God that we are to serve it for this special occasion.""

That night as all the men are gathered around the table along with the Pope, the head monk stands and thanks the Pope for being there.

Accompanied by his sweetheart's younger sister, he went to Nordstrom and bought a pair of white gloves. The sister purchased a pair of  panties for herself.

During the wrapping, the clerk mixed up the items and the sister got the gloves and the sweetheart got the panties. Without checking the contents, the young man sealed the package and sent it to his sweetheart  with the following note:

""I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening. If it had not been for your sister, I would have chosen the long ones with the buttons,  but she wears short ones that are easier to remove.

""These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were  hardly soiled. I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart.

""I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to  see you again.

""When you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing.  ""Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming year.  I hope you will wear them for me on Friday night. All my love.

""P.S. The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur showing."" ",The Gift,16

There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community. If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'","Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy.

A retired older couple returned to a Cadillac dealership where the salesman has just sold the car they had been keen on buying to a beautiful, leggy blonde in a tight skirt, stiletto heels, and halter top.

The old man was visibly upset. He spoke to the salesman sharply: ""Young man, I thought you said you would hold that car until we raised the $55,000 asking price. Yet I just overheard you close the deal for $45,000 to that young lady. And if I remember right, you had insisted there was no way you could discount this model.""

The salesman took a deep breath and cleared his throat.

""Sir, what can I tell you? She had the cash ready, and she didn't need any financing.""

Just then the young woman approached the senior couple and gave the car keys to the old man.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

\#2 - there was plenty of heat and water and

\#3 - it was small enough to make me feel cozy and at home.

\#2 - there wasn't any heat and certainly no water, and

\#3 - it was much too large for my comfort.

 'Dear Sir:
