It is then he notices a second note on the windowsill ""Chinese torture no.2: rock tied to balls."" Seeing a thin bit of wire unspooling as the rock falls, the man decides broken legs are better than castration, and leaps out of the window.

The next day, the second woman accidentally steps on a duck and along comes St. Peter. With him is another extremely ugly man. He chains them together with the same admonishment as for the first woman.

The third woman has observed all this and is very careful where she steps.

She manages to go months without stepping on any ducks, but one day St. Peter comes up to her with the most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on. St. Peter chains them together without saying a word.

The happy woman says: “I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all of eternity?”

post,azon4m,2qh72,jokes,false,1552276594,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/azon4m/butch_the_rooster/,self.jokes,,"Sarah was in the fertilized egg business.  She had several hundred young pullets and ten roosters to fertilise the eggs.

&amp;#x200B;

She kept records and any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced.

&amp;#x200B;

This took a lot of time, so she bought some tiny bells and attached them to her roosters. Each bell had a different tone, so she could tell from a distance which rooster was performing. Now, she could sit on the porch and fill out an efficiency report by just listening to the bells.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah's favourite rooster, old Butch, was a very fine specimen but, this morning she noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all! When she went to investigate, she saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing, but the pullets hearing the roosters coming, would run for cover.

&amp;#x200B;

To Sarah's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring.  He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job, and walk on to the next one.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah was so proud of old Butch, she entered him in a Show and he became an overnight sensation among the judges.

&amp;#x200B;

The result was the judges not only awarded old Butch the ""No Bell Peace Prize"" they also awarded him the ""Pulletsurprise"" as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Clearly old Butch was a politician in the making.

&amp;#x200B;

Who else but a politician could figure out how to win two of the most coveted awards on our planet by being the best at sneaking up on the unsuspecting populace and screwing them when they weren't paying attention?

&amp;#x200B;

Vote carefully in the next election. You can't always hear the bells.",Butch the Rooster,33

I tried to turn her down, but she practically begged. What could I do? I had no choice but to accept.

I taught her everything: how to hold the bow, the correct way to pull the arrow, how to aim and everything. She was a quick learner.

A few weeks in, she could hit the stationary targets surprisingly well, so I decided to step it up a notch earlier than expected:

""We're going to move on to moving targets. Now, the key thing to remember with moving targets is that as soon as you see the target in your aim, you have to shoot immediately. Don't contemplate, don't even think about it - as soon as you see it, you shoot!""

She was a natural! After just a couple of hours she could hit them just as well as - no, *better"" than the stationary targets! She was outstanding. I found myself starting to fall in love with her.

The next week, I took her to the woods where to have her practice on wild animals as living targets. Just as expected, she picked it up almost instantly. It seemed like every single shot she took always hit her target. Honestly, at this point I think she ever surpassed my abilities! At this point, there was no doubt in my mind. I was madly in love with her!

That night I asked her out on a date. She said to me:

""If you had asked me that when I first met you, I would say yes in a heartbeat! But after all this time, after all you've taught me... I can't see you as anything more, or anything less than my teacher. I'm sorry... I guess you should have shot your target as soon as you saw it, huh?""

And that's when I realized... I've trained that miss.",I was the world's best archer,0

Before Thor hits John's hand, John removes his hand, causing Thor to hit the tree which makes his shovel vibrate and hurt.

Thorbeaux gets back to work and Dreaux asks him what boss said.

The farmer arrives at his neighbors place and after some haggling gets a great deal on a new pullet and cock.  While he is there he sees an old ass for sale and he asks the neighbor if he thinks that he could use it to haul things back on the farm.  The neighbor replied that he is a good worker but occasionally he will stop and you have to scratch his belly to get him moving again.  He again gets a good deal and marches off triumphantly with his pullet under one arm, cock under the other, and the reigns of his new ass in his hand.  

The farmer gets about halfway back to his farm when the ass stops moving.  He cant scratch its belly since he would have to set down a chicken and risk it running off.

Peter hears him from 200m away and starts making his way through the crowd and soldiers. At 150m a Roman soldier slashes his right arm off but Peter keeps going determined saying “I am coming master!”

Peter, now with one arm shouts “I am coming master!” and while at about 100m another Roman soldier chops his other arm off. But Peter keeps going.

Jesus shouts once more “Peter, Peter!”

Peter keeps going, shouts “I am coming master!” And guess what, two Roman soldiers at 50m chop both his legs off.

He replies, ""Well, you have no fuckin ears...""  The interviewer gets angry and throws him out.

He asks the 2nd candidate the same thing. ""You have no fuckin ears"" is the same reply, and out the door the applicant goes.


He asks the 3rd guy the same question. He replies, ""You wear contact lenses.""

The second officer however, has a much more interesting tale.

“His name was Jack “Richy” Briggs. He was known for having incredibly convoluted heists, that often involved very expensive equipment. Perhaps one of the most notorious bank robbers from the wild west. After years of evading the authorities, and making ridiculous amounts of money, he finally makes his most explosive and expensive heist yet.”

“Oh really? What did he do?”

“Well, he bought hundreds of pounds of dynamite, and transported it all using hundreds of grunts-for-hire to help him carry it all the way to the bank. For this heist, he was gonna hit the biggest, most reinforced vault, of all of the south. All in one night, he managed to set all of the dynamite, and he set off the dynamite, but guess what happened?”

“What happened?”

“He blew up the whole place! There was nothing left of the vault or money!”

“No way, that has to be the most expensive bank heist I’ve ever heard of!”




“Yeah, he really broke the bank with that stunt”

He hears a strange, unfamiliar bell coming from the top of the nearby mountain. He decides to investigate the next day. He wakes up extra early at 7am and begins his summit to find the bell. He arrives at the top of the mountain after a long 12 hour bike ride. There is a large monastery, where the sound has originated. He knocks on the door and a monk answers. “Hello” said the boy. “Yes?” Replies the monk.
“I heard a bell coming from here yesterday, I’d like to know what it was.” Asked the boy. 
The monk replied, “I’m sorry, I can’t tell you, you’re not a monk.”
The boy made the long ride back down the mountain and forgot about the bell. 6 years later on his 16 birthday, he bought his first car. The same day, he heard the strange bell again, and decided to investigate again, maybe he’d have better luck this time. He took his car and drove 2 hours up the mountain to the monastery. The same monk opened the door, and they had the same interaction as before, “what’s the sound” “I’m sorry, I can’t tell you, you’re not a monk”. So again the boy departed home. 15 years later, the boy is now a man, married, with 3 beautiful children and a red sports car. He hears the bell one day after work, and speeds up the mountain, this time he’s there in an hour and fifteen minutes. He arrives at the monastery and has the same interaction as the two previous times. So finally he says “I want to be a monk, to find out what that noise is”. The monk said, “First, you must sell your car, divorce your wife, abandon your kids and all your possessions, when you’re done, we can begin”. The man does what he’s told and comes back a month later. The monk is pleased to see him. “Take off your clothes, put on these robes and shave your head” the man complies. “Am I a monk now? “No, now read this encyclopedia and memorize everything, then you’ll be closer to being a monk”. The man memorized every word in the book and informs the other monk. It has taken him 4 years. “Am I a monk now?” The man pleaded, “no, Now I want you to find the needle in the hayfield out in the courtyard, then cut each blade of grass with scissors. This task takes the man 10 years. “Am I a monk ?” “Yes, you’re a monk” “what is the bell” the monk points to a door down the corridor. The new monk opens the door to see another, slightly smaller door. Then another. And another, until he’s only able to reach his arms through to open them. And finally he learns what the sound was, do you want to know what it is?

I’m sorry I can’t tell you, you’re not a monk ",There was once a 10 year old little boy,32

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily he can see a phone booth and flashing neon sign just down the road that says BAR.  After calling his friend Faabian to come pick him up, which will be about an hour, he decides to wait in the Bar.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bar, is simply a dive, the kind of place that the carpets get cleaned once every year or so and the walls have a brown tinge from all the smoke in the air.

&amp;#x200B;

As Siimon enters, the sparsely populated room all turn to stare at him in his effeminate splendour.  With a deep, almost choking deep breath he struts towards the barman and asks for a glass of Perrier on ice.  The barman, who has also seen better days, stares blankly at him for a heartbeat and tells Siimon that they don't serve his kind in here.  With nowhere else to go Siimon explains the situation and pleads with the barman to let him stay until Faabian comes to save him.  That he will just sit in the corner quiet as a mouse sipping his water.

&amp;#x200B;

The barman looks around the room, it's a quiet night, in fact it's been a quiet year, so he decides, ""fuck it"", pours Siimon a glass of warm tap water, charges him $10 and tells him to sit in the darkest corner on the bar.

&amp;#x200B;

After his heart slows down, Siimon is quite enjoying this little adventure on the wrong side of the tracks, the regulars are no long taking furtive glances in his direction, and he is feeling almost at one with the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly the Bar door burst open and a Man mountain enters, all muscles, flannel and bushy beard.

He gets to the bar where there is a Pint of Beer waiting for him, which he downs in one gulp.

&amp;#x200B;

Wiping his beard he turns to the room and declares to the room that he is so horny he could fuck a cow.

&amp;#x200B;

From the corner a voice replies - Moo Darling Moo!!!",Siimon is a very gay and very camp man.,0

So he decided once and for all to go see a specialist to see what can be done. 

After extensive scans and tests the doctor calls him in and gives him the bad news. 

""I'm very sorry sir, you have a very rare case in which your nuts press up against the base of your spine which, in turn, is causing you these headaches.""

So the man asks what can be done, and the doctor responds regretfully that the only solution he can think of is to cut off his balls. 

The man is understandably upset but decides that there is nothing to be done and he can't live with these headaches any longer and so they schedule the surgery. 

The day of the surgery arrives, and everything goes smoothly. 
In recovery, the doctor sees the man is very depressed his jewels are gone for good and goes up to him to try and cheer him up. 

""You know, just outside the hospital there is a very good tailer, why don't you give him a visit and get yourself some new clothes to feel better?""

The guy agrees that this might make him feel a little better and after getting discharged walks into this little tailor shop next to the hospital. 

As he walks in he hears, ""size 7 hat!""
Looking around he spots a diminutive old man in a tweed vest peering at him. 

""What did you say?"" asks the man. 
""I said size 7 hat, that is your hat size, no?"" answered the tailor. 

""Well I don't know, I was never really a hat man, how did you know?""
""I have been doing this for 55 years. I can look at someone for a few seconds and tell you all their measurements!""

The man, disbelieving, decides to put this claim to the test. ""Oh yeah? What's my shoe size?""
""42,"" came the prompt response. 

""Shirt size?""
""18.""

'Incredible,' thinks the man, 'this guy is good!'
""What about my pants size?""
""44,"" came the answer. 

""Aha!"" exclaimed the man, ""I have worn size 42 pants my whole life!""
""Impossible,"" scoffed the tailor, ""if you would wear size 42 pants, your nuts would press up against the base of your spine and cause you extreme headaches!""",A man had excruciating headaches,32

The next day the old man goes back to the doctors and gives him the jar, which is as clean and empty as when the doctor gave it to him. So the doctor asks what happened and why there is no sperm sample in the jar. The old man says, ""Well, doc, it's like this... first I tried with my right hand, but nothing. Then I tried with my left hand, but still nothing. Then I asked my wife for help. She tried with her right hand - nothing; then with her left, still nothing. She tried with her mouth, first with the teeth in, then with her teeth out, still nothing. We even called up Maisie, the lady next door and she tried too, first with both hands, then an armpit, and she even tried squeezing it between her knees, but still nothing

The doctor is really shocked by all this and asks incredulously, ""You asked your neighbor???""

The old man replies, ""Yep, not one of us could get the jar open.""

A few minutes later, he is in his kitchen, contemplating ending himself, when his wife comes up from the basement. 

Hi baby - she says - I'm very happy to see you back early, but since you weren't supposed to be here tonight and your parents showed up late, I hope you don't mind I let them have our bedroom for the night.

They were actually really unhealthy and Bert decided that he needed to take charge of him and his friends' health. He decided that they were going to be on a diet together to help them live for as long as possible. He broke the news to his friends, and they weren't too happy about it, but they decided to go along with it anyways, because they knew how out-of-shape they all were. It was tough for them all to stick to the plan at times, however they got through it together. They each lost between 120-140 pounds over the course of 20 years and were in amazing shape for their age.

&amp;#x200B;

One day the 3 of them were given great news.

Bert got a call, he answered it, then turned around to everyone and said: 

""Guys! My daughter just had a child! I'm going to be a grandpa!"". Everybody was celebrating for Bert when Earl got a call from his son. He answered it, and turned around to everybody and said:

""Guys! My son is going to get married today! I'm so excited!"". Everybody was now celebrating for Bert and Earl, when Chester got a call. He answered it, turned around and said to everybody: 

""Guys! My family is having a reunion today! I'm going to see so many people that I haven't seen in years!"".

&amp;#x200B;

They found out that the wedding, hospital, and park where the reunion was were all in the same town, and decided to carpool together to get there. It had snowed a little the day before and the roads were a little icy. As they were getting onto the highway, their car slipped and ran into a semi-truck. It killed all three of them.

&amp;#x200B;

The three of them wake up together in heaven. They notice an angel standing over them and one of them asks 

""Where are we?"". The angels says:

 ""Congratulations, you made it to heaven"". The angel decides to show them around the place and starts at a banquet. ""Here is a banquet for you three to enjoy, you've earned it"". Chester looks a little sad, and Earl notices and asks him, 

""What's wrong?"". Chester finally speaks up, 

""Okay, this is so nice of you to put together, but we're on a diet. I wouldn't want to overdo my calorie intake for the day"". The angle replies to them, 

""No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it"". The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place.

Next, the angel decides to show them a place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to a massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them,

""This is where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends"". The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him,

""What's wrong?"". Chester responds with,

""My wife left me because of my gambling problems, I don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid I wont be able to enjoy this area"". The angel then slightly irritated lets him know,

""Don't you see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here"". Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live.

&amp;#x200B;

The angel finally takes them to the third place, and it is a huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, 

""This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you want to live alone"". The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice a big window on a wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least 5 miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask,

 ""So, uh... What's the rent here?"". The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies

 ""Nothing? It's free"". Earl is sure to thank the angel and says,

""Wow! That's so kind of you guys!"". Bert notices that Chester is looking a little sad. Bert says,

""What's wrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?"". Chester looks up, looks Bert in the eye and says a little mad, 

""If it weren't for your goddamn diet. Bert. We could've been here 20 years ago!"".

He wasn't that skilled of a magician, so he had to make up for his lack of talent with cheesy 2 bit tricks.   

He found this cat that looked like it was clearly abandoned.  It had fleas and ticks, wasn't fixed and it didn't have a collar.  

So he adopted the cat, cleaned it up and got the cat fixed.   

He gave him the name ""Goldie"" because of his golden orange  fur.  

So he had an idea on how to make money from his new pet.   He was going to advertise his pet as ""a talking cat"" and take it to magic shows.  The cat loved to meow all the time, so he thought he could make his money off of the cat's meows.  

The man showed off his talking cat at his show.   He had his tip jar ready.   

After a few mundane magic tricks, the man pulled out the main attraction: The talking cat.   

He then asked the cat ""Hey Goldie, what's the name of one of China's former leaders?""
The cat said ""Mao""

The crowd chuckled and thought it was cute. A few people tipped him.  But they still wanted to see the cat speak.  

The man did a magic trick in front of the cat.  The disappearing kitty treat.  
The cat then went ""Wow"".   

""See that?"" the man cried.  ""That cat said wow!""

The crowd rolled their eyes.  He got a few coins in his tip jar for the trick itself.   

The magician, sensing that the crowd would turn on him, got desperate.  

""Hey Goldie, where does milk come from""

The cat then said ""Cow""

The crowd walked off and groaned.

As the crowd walked off, the cat said ""Some cultures drink goat and sheep's milk.  We just drink cow's milk in America due to cultural differences.  Also, I would say the Wu Sangui was a former Chinese leader, but few Westerners know of his existence.  And I didn't want to swear in front of the kids, so I said 'wow'  The tip jar is this way, folks.  Thanks for rescuing me, by the way, magic man!""

He walked into his carrier and then took a nap.   ",The Talking Cat.,4

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

As part of his program he was placed with a host family for housing. An elderly gentleman named Joshua Levin welcomed him into the large home with many rooms.

As Joshua gave a tour of the house they came into a large sitting room with oil paintings of different men. David asked, “Who are all of these men in portraits on the wall?”  
 

“Ah,” said Joshua, “This is my family! When Israel was founded I had cousins all over the world who returned home to help rebuild our nation.”

“Really?” said David. “Tell me about them.”

“This first man was a great General in the Haganah, Eli Katz. The Haganah became the Israeli Defense Forces you know.”

“Oh, I had learned about that in my history class,” said David. “Impressive that you are related to one of those leaders.”

“Yes, yes,” said Joshua, “He was my Uncle. And this next man was his Cousin - Joseph Cohen. He was a top bureaucrat in the Ministry of Finance and is most responsible for the policies that established the Bank of Israel.”

“Wow, that’s equally impressive!” said David.

“Thank you,” said Joshua. “I must also show you this next picture. This is my father, Ben Levin. He won the Israel Prize, our greatest cultural award for his poetry - it is like your Presidential Medal of Freedom. It is said that his words inspired a generation.”

“Your father must have been a very great man,” said David. “But I see one picture here that is larger and has a golden frame. Who is this man with the most impressive portrait?”

“My boy, he is the most important of all! Don’t you recognize the man in charge?”

David was puzzled. “What do you mean? Is he the Prime Minister?”

“No!” said Joshua. “That’s Ari Post, the King of Reddit!” ",A Student in Israel,4

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Trump,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Trump spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.

Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.

""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked!

Suddenly he saw a car approaching, moving slowly and appearing ghost-like in the rain. It slowly and silently crept toward him and stopped.

Wanting a ride very badly, the guy jumped into the car and closed the door; only then did he realize that there was nobody behind the wheel, and no sound of the engine to be heard over the rain.

Again the car crept slowly forward and guy was terrified, too scared to think of jumping out and running. The guy saw that the car was approaching a sharp curve and, still too scared to jump out, he started to pray and beg for his life. He was certain the ghost car would go off the road and into the river, and he would surely drown!

But just before the curve, a shadowy figure appeared at the driver's window and a hand reached in and turned the steering wheel, guiding the car safely around the bend. Then, just as silently, the hand disappeared through the window and the hitchhiker was alone again.

Paralyzed with fear, the guy watched the hand reappear every time they reached a curve. Finally the guy, frightened nearly to death, had all he could take and jumped out of the car and ran through the storm to the nearby town.

Wet and in shock, he went into a lighted tavern and with voice quavering, ordered two shots of whiskey, and then, shaken, he told everybody about his supernatural experience.

A silence came over those listening and everybody got goose bumps.

They realized the guy was sober and was telling the truth. And the sounds of the storm continued outside.

About a half hour later, two guys walked into the bar and one says to the other, 'Look Billy Bob, there's that idiot that rode in our car while we was pushing it in the rain.'

post,ayu0z1,2qh72,jokes,false,1552072218,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ayu0z1/lasik_eye_surgery/,self.jokes,,"A few years ago, I finally decided to get Lasik Eye Surgery.  I had been going to the same eye doctor for a few years, and she told me I was a good candidate for it.  She tells me I need to get a topography test which couldn't be done at her office.  Instead, she sent me to the Eye Center at a local hospital.  While I was there, I asked if this was same building I would go when it came time for the actual procedure.  They confirmed that it was.

The time for the surgery came, and I show up at the same wing of the hospital, which was rather large.  They apologized and said I was in the wrong building.  I actually needed to go across the street which was a main road but was still considered part of the hospital.  I asked the name of the building I was looking for, and they said it was the Urology building next to a Starbucks (go figure).  I asked, ""Are you sure?  I have to go to the Urology Center for eye surgery?""   
 Apparently, the Urology Center was the only building with rooms large enough to house the machine they used to perform the surgery.

Everything went well once I found the building, and my eyes turned out fine.  After relaying this story to my dad a few days later, he said, ""Well, it's a good thing you didn't end up cock-eyed.""",Lasik Eye Surgery,3
