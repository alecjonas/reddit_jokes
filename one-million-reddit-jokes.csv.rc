The teacher said, ""Let's begin by reviewing some American History. Teacher :- Who said 'Give me Liberty, or give me Death'?""

She saw a sea of blank faces except for Chandrasekhar, who had his hand up: Chandrasekhar :- 'Patrick Henry, 1775,' he said.

'Very good! Teacher :- Who said 'Government of the People, by the People, for the People, shall not perish from the Earth?''

Again, no response except from Chandrasekhar:- . 'Abraham Lincoln, 1863' said Chandrasekhar.

The teacher snapped at the class, 'Class, you should be ashamed. Chandrasekhar, who is new to our country, knows more about our history than you do.'

She heard a loud whisper: 'F*ck the Indians'

'Who said that?' she demanded. Chandrasekhar put his hand up. 'General Custer, 1862.'

At that point, a student in the back said, 'I'm gonna puke.'

The teacher glares around and asks 'All right! Now, who said that?' Again, Chandrasekhar says, 'George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.'

Now furious, another student yells, 'Oh yeah? Suck this!' Chandrasekhar jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, 'Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997.'

Now with almost mob hysteria someone said 'You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll kill you.' Chandrasekhar frantically yells at the top of his voice, 'Michael Jackson to the child witnesses testifying against him, 2004.'

The teacher fainted. And as the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said, 'Oh shit, we're screwed!' And Chandrasekhar said quietly, 'I think it was Lehmann Brothers, November 4th, 2008'.

Content with the answer the boy follow the father on his shopping errands.

Later that day the father realizes the boy is slowing him down so much he will never finish the shopping on time, so he gives him some money and sends him to the cinema.

Young Fritzl of course decides to instead visit that fabled place of joy. As he enters he is approached by the Madame intend to usher him out 'Hey little man what do you think you are you doing in here?' -'I am looking to buy joy for 20€!' Fritzl proudly answers. 
20 bucks being 20 bucks the Madame leads Fritzl to the kitchen and prepares him five jam buttys and sends him on his way looking quite pleased.

Later his Dad asks 'So son, what did you do while I was shopping?' 
-' I went to the Freudenhaus!'
perplexed the Father had to ask 'and what did you do there?'

He looks around and sees lots of dildos, sex dolls, vibrators and etc, but nothing that would keep his wife occupied for 3 weeks. So he asks the store owner, and though at first the owner says there is nothing there that would keep a person satisfied for that long, after some badgering, he finally pulls a black box with a gold clasp from underneath the counter--all the while assuring the newlywed that it's not for sale, being a family heirloom and of priceless sentimental value. He opens the box, and inside is an apparently normal dildo. The newlywed guy is unimpressed, but the clerk interrupts. ""Let me demonstrate,"" he says. He looks at the box and says ""Voodoo Dick--The Door!"" and the voodoo dick jumps into the air, floats over to the door, and starts going at the keyhole like crazy, pounding away until the door begins to crack down the center. Finally, the clerk says ""Voodoo Dick--The Box!"" and the voodoo dick flies back into the box. With some difficulty, the guy convinces the clerk to sell it for $50,000. When he arrives home, he gives his wife the box and says ""Just open it and say, 'voodoo dick, my pussy' if you ever get horny, all right?"" So he leaves on his business trip, and by the third day, the wife is getting pretty horny. So she opens the box and says ""Voodoo dick, my pussy,"" thinking the whole thing rather ridiculous. After about 20 minutes, she has had several orgasms and is starting to get tired, so she tries to pull the voodoo dick out. Apparently, her husband had forgotten to tell her how to get it back in the box. Panicking, she puts on a dress and starts driving to the hospital. About half way there, the voodoo dick is pumping away at her, and she starts  orgasming, and so she begins to swerve out of her lane. A police officer happens to be behind her, and pulls her over. As the cop stands at the window, she is sweating and her face is blushed, and she's squirming all over as the voodoo dick goes at her. The cop looks at her for a second and says, ""Lady, how many drinks have you had tonight?"" She says quickly ""Officer, I swear I haven't had anything to drink! There's this voodoo dick going at my pussy and I can't make it stop! I'm on the way to the hospital to have it removed!"" The officer thinks about it for a second, gives her a smirk and says ""Voodoo Dick my ass, lady."" ",Voodoo Dick,7

*I thought coming up with 50 inoffensive jokes off the top of my head would be easy. I was quite wrong, this took a long time. I didn't look any of these up, but quite a few are featured in this sub pretty often. I'm ashamed to admit I wrote a couple of the really awful ones up there too. And there are a couple in there that are borderline offensive, but I'm tapped out.*

*Edit: I'm very very sorry for everyone who was offended by the joke about redditors or the (poorly typed) joke about Seattle weather. Those holes have been removed, and a committee has been formed to fully document the impact of such hurtful jokes. I hope that the replacement jokes are less controversial. If you have any further offense to air, please direct it to this post's new Offense Management System at InoffensiveJokesComplaint@reddit.com. I'm sure all complaints will be appropriately managed.*",50 of the least offensive jokes I know.,560

&amp;nbsp;

""I really am sorry, but we can't serve wild animals alcohol in here, sir."" the bartender replies, picking up a beer stein and polishing the rim.

The bear, furious at this point, gestures to the woman three stools down from him. ""EITHER YOU GIVE ME A SHOT OF WHISKEY, OR I EAT THIS BITCH!"" he roars.

Stone-faced, the the bartender continues polishing the stein. ""I really am sorry, but company policy states that we cannot serve wild animals alcohol in this establishment.""

Enraged, the bear turns to the woman, and within a few bloody moments, has eaten her entirely. Then, turning to the bartender, he snarls ""I made good on my promise, am I getting my whiskey, or is someone else getting eaten?""

&amp;nbsp;

Still calm, the bartender replies ""I'm sorry, but now we can't serve you alcohol for two reasons. The first still stands: you are a wild animal. The second: We cannot serve alcohol to anyone obviously on drugs.""

The bear pauses, confused. ""What do you mean, on drugs?""

The waiter is naturally taken aback and replies, ""Excuse me, sir, but could you please refrain from using that sort of language in here, I will get the manager as soon as I can.""


The manager comes over and the bloke asks, ""Are you the chicken fucking manager of this bastard joint?"". ""Yes, sir, I am,"" replies the manager, ""and I would prefer it if you could refrain from speaking such profanities in this, a private restaurant"".

""Fuck off!"" replies the bloke. ""And where's the fucking piano?""

""Pardon?"" says the manager.

""Fucking deaf as well are we? You little piece of sniveling shit, show us your pissing piano.""

""Ahhhh,"" replies the manager. ""You've come about the pianist's job,"" and shows the bloke to the piano. ""Can you play any blues?""

""Of course I fucking can,"" and the bloke proceeds to play the most inspiring and beautiful sounding honky tonk blues that the manager has ever heard.

""Why, that's superb, what's it called?""

""I want to fuck your missus on the sofa but the springs keep hurting my knob,"" replies the pianist.

The manager is a bit disturbed and asks if the bloke knows any jazz. The bloke proceeds to play the most melancholy jazz solo the manager has ever heard.

""Magnificent!"" cries the manager. ""What's it called?""

""I wanted a wank over the washin' machine but my bollocks got caught in the soap drawer"".

The manager is a tad embarrassed and asks if he knows any romantic ballads, the bloke then plays the most heartbreaking melody.

""And what's this called?"" asks the manager.

""As I fuck you under the stars with the moonlight shining off your hairy ring-piece,"" replies the bloke.

The manager is highly upset by the bloke's language but offers him the job on condition that he doesn't introduce any of his songs or talk to any of the customers.

This arrangement works well for a couple of months until one night, sitting opposite him, is the most gorgeous blonde he has ever laid his eyes on. She's wearing an almost see through dress, her tits are almost falling out the top and the skimpy little 'G' string she's wearing is riding up the crack of her arse. She is sitting there with her legs slightly open, sucking suggestively on asparagus shoots and the butter is dripping down her chin! It's too much for the bloke and he runs off to the bogs to 'wrestle with his bald headed champ'. He's pulling away furiously when he hears the manager's voice...

""Where's that bloody pianist?""

He just has time to shoot his bolt and in a fluster he runs back to the piano, not having bothered to adjust himself properly, sits down and starts playing some more tunes. The blonde steps up and walks over to the piano, leans over and whispers in his ear:

""Do you know your knob and balls are hanging out your trousers and dripping spunk on your shoes?"".

Three contractors are bidding to fix a broken fence at the White House. One is from Chicago, another is from Tennessee, and the third is from Minnesota. All three go with a White House official to examine the fence. The Minnesota contractor takes out a tape measure and does some measuring, then works some figures with a pencil. “Well,” he says, “I figure the job will run about $900. $400 for materials, $400 for my crew, and $100 profit for me.” The Tennessee contractor also does some measuring and figuring, then says, “I can do this job for $700. $300 for materials, $300 for my crew, and $100 profit for me.” The Chicago contractor doesn’t measure or figure, but leans over to the White House official and whispers, “$2,700.” The official, incredulous, says, “You didn’t even measure like the other guys! How did you come up with such a high figure?” The Chicago contractor whispers back, “$1000 for me, $1000 for you, and we hire the guy from Tennessee to fix the fence.” “Done!” replies the government official. And that, my friends, is how the new stimulus plan will work.

A few days later a police officer came in. “How much do I owe you?” the cop asked after his haircut. “No charge, officer,” the barber answered. “I consider it a service to my community.” The next morning the barber found a dozen doughnuts on the stoop along with a thank you note from the police officer.

When Thanksgiving comes Barry's parents go on vacation to Florida so Cindy convinces him to meet her family.  After a long drive Barry and Cindy arrive at her parents and he sees that they are true mountain folk.

They have an outhouse, several cars (but none of them worked) and a large extended family living together.  As they are eating the conversation of hunting comes up and Cindy's father finds out that Barry has never hunted before.

As a family tradition all the men together the morning after Thanksgiving and go hunting.  Cindy's father invites Barry and he is reluctant but doesn't want to cause trouble so he agrees.

The next morning the truck pulls up and Cindy's father, Wyatt, steps out and along with him is his sons Jack, Junior, Bud, Sterling, Dale, Dale Jr. and Donald (adopted son).  As they are getting ready Barry pulls up in his Porsche and they outfit him and they start to walk through the woods.

As they are walking they hear rustling, Wyatt yells, ""Get ready boys, I think we got one!"".  Barry raises his gun and shakily takes aim only to have a black man peek his head out of a bush.  Barry lowers his gun but Wyatt shots and kills him.

""Got 'em!""  Barry freaks out, ""WHAT THE FUCK!!  You can't do that!""  Wyatt calmly puts his hand on Barry's shoulder, ""Relax son it's fine their in season."" and gives him a big smile.  ""There's another one!!"" one of the boys yell out and the shooting begins again.

Barry turns and runs back to his car, gun in hand and stops dead in his tracks when he sees two black guys stripping his car.  ""Get the hell away from my car!!""  *BOOM* *BOOM*, shots the two dead.  He walks up to them and a spotlight appears over him.

While this made his owner a very popular woman with those she entertained, it was his nasty habit of fucking her chickens she just couldn't take.


One day, on the eve of a visit from the new priest to her parish, she had had enough, catching him mid coitus with a prize winning hen.


She snatched  him up and shaved his head bald, and banished him to his cage in the corner with strict instructions to stay quiet, ""or else"".


So that evening he stood silently in his cage as he watched all if the townspeople enter her home, in order to greet the new priest.  This went on for a couple of hours until the arrival of the guests of honor, the priest accompanied by the bishop.


Seeing they were both as bald as he, Polly sprang into action and with his loudest voice greeted them thusly: ""Hey you two chicken fuckers! You better come join me here and keep your mouths shut, because who knows what that bitch will cut off next!""",Polly the Chicken Fucker,1

So what's your story?"" 

So the first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died right there on the balcony."" 

""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. 

The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. 

""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here."" 

Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. 

The third man came to the front of the line, and again Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story.

""Well, a beautiful woman in a bar invited me to her house not even an hour ago. Naturally, as a single man in his twenties, I took the opportunity and joined her that evening. We were right in the middle of the deed when she suddenly noticed her husband got home, and quickly told me to find a hiding place.""

Eventually, one admits, ""Well, once I touched one with the tip of my finger.""

""That's fine, wash your finger in the holy water and go on into heaven."" Advises Saint Peter.

The next naughty nun confesses, ""Well, once I... massaged one a bit..""

""Wash your hand in the holy water and go on into heaven.""

The question has been whispered back down the line and a little while later, there's a commotion as one of the nuns pushes her way to the front.

""Now hold on, what's the rush?!"" Exclaims Peter. ""You're all going to get in, anyway!""

To which the nun who pushed in replies,

He had finally been granted R&amp;R and was on a train bound for London. The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat.

The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog. The war weary soldier asked, ""Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?""

The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my Little Fifi is using that seat?""

The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.
Again he asked, ""Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired.""

The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!""

The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.

The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, ""You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road. And now, Sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window.""",American Soldier,472

You can spend one day in heaven and one day in hell, and afterwords you can decide where you want to spend eternity. 

The politician say, ""ok, let's try this out."" 

So he spends the day in heaven, praying with the Lord, singing with the choir, and talking with the angels. He's thinking this is alright, not too exciting, but it's gotta be better than hell.

The day ends with a late night prayer and he is greeted by St Peter, who tells the politician he now has to spend one day in Hell. 

The man awakes in hell, in what appears to be the Penthouse suite,  he is greeted by the Devil himself,  dressed in an Armani suit, holding out a glass of champagne for the politician. 

The man takes the champagne and is told by the devil that in the lobby there is a full bar, pools full of beautiful women, a restaurant with the finest chef the world has seen, and a casino next door. 

The politician is shocked and is thinking, ""Wow! This is hell? This is amazing!"" 

The man ends up bringing two amazing women to his suite and that is how the day finishes. 

The politician awakes with St Peter asking him that now he must make the decision of where he wants to spend eternity. 

The man says ""Heaven is OK,  but it's got nothing on Hell,  I'm sorry St. Peter, but I think im gonna have to choose Hell.""

St.Peter asks the politician if he's sure of his decision, and the man says yes. 

The man awakes to screams of pain and torture, in a dark and unimaginably hot place.  He is greeted by the Devil, who is weilding a Trident and is laughing maniacally. 

The politician says to the Devil,  ""What's going on? Where's all the beautiful women? Where's my penthouse suite? This isn't what I was showed!"" 

The Devil replies,  ""Well you see, yesterday we were campaigning, but today you voted.""",A politician dies and goes to heaven...,34

The man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke,' and turns to the ostrich, 'What's yours?' 

'I'll have the same,' says the ostrich. 

A short time later the waitress returns with the order 'That will be $9.40 please,' and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment. 

The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke' 

The ostrich says, 'I'll have the same.' 

Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. 

This becomes routine until the two enter again. 'The usual?' asks the waitress. 

'No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and a salad,' says the man. 

'Same,' says the ostrich. 

Shortly the waitress brings the order and says, 'That will be $32.62.' 

Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. 

The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer. 'Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time? 

'Well,' says the man, 'several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.' 

'That's brilliant!' says the waitress. Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live. It's brilliant!'

'That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact amount of money is always there,' says the man.

The waitress asks, 'What's with the ostrich?' 

The man sighs, pauses and answers, 'My second wish was for a tall chick with a big butt and long legs who agrees with everything I say.'",A man walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him,989

post,5avs1b,2qh72,jokes,false,1478165223,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5avs1b/a_farmer_has_1000_chickens/,self.jokes,,"He keeps them all in a large barn behind his house. He makes a comfortable living from selling their eggs. One day, however, the chickens' egg production drops off sharply. Days and weeks go by, and the chickens continue to lay fewer and fewer eggs. Worried for his livelihood, the farmer makes a number of different changes to the chickens' living conditions to try to improve their numbers. Nothing seems to work, though.

One day, a friend of the farmer says, ""you know, sometimes a chicken is unhappy just because it hasn't been...satisfied...in a while. You know what I mean?"" The farmer did know what his friend meant, and immediately set out to figure out a way to satisfy all 1000 of his chickens. To that end, he put an ad in the newspaper:

WANTED:
Rooster capable of satisfying 1000 chickens.

The very next morning, the man heard a knock at the door and opened it to find a rooster standing on his front porch.

""Hello"", said the man.
""Hello"", said the rooster.
""Do...do you think you can do it?""
""Sir, I believe I can.""
""Well then, I'll let you get to it.""

The farmer leads the rooster out back to the barn and then returns to his house. Almost immediately after closing the door, an incredible amount of noise starts to come from the barn. Squawking, cackling, wings flapping, wood creaking, even a few sounds the farmer himself, even with all his experience with chickens, couldn't place. He shook his head, thinking, ""I hope this rooster can do what he says he can"".

Come lunchtime, the noise from the barn hadn't let up one bit. By dinnertime, it actually seemed like it had grown louder. Even when the farmer went to bed, it had only subsided a little.

The farmer awoke the next morning to total quiet. He put on his clothes and went out to check on the barn. Sure enough, there were his 1000 chickens, looking happy and content and laying more eggs than he'd ever seen them lay in his life. The rooster, however, was nowhere to be seen.

On the walk back to the house, the farmer caught a glimpse of something out in one of his fields. As he walked out to check on it, he could make out the shape of what appeared to be the rooster lying motionless on the ground, with scattered vultures circling overhead.

The farmer, curious to see what manner of death satisfying 1000 chickens brings about, made his way out to the field to investigate. To his surprise, when he was only a few yards away from the rooster, it turned his head to him and whispered, ""Shhh!"" The farmer stopped dead in his tracks. The rooster said quietly, ""You want to fuck a vulture, you've got to play their game"".",A farmer has 1000 chickens.,26

""Tell ya what Paddy.... give me the money and I'll see what I can do.""

So Paddy hands over the cash and Seamus goes across the road into the butcher's shop, then comes out a few minutes later and shows Paddy what he's bought.

""A bratwurst?! How the fuck's that supposed to get us a pint, you muppet?!"" Paddy exclaims.
""Easy! We'll go into the pub, order a pint and drink up, and when the barman comes over to collect the tab I'll flop this out and you pretend you're sucking my cock, see? I bet he'll be so disgusted he'll t'row us right out! Free beer!!""
Paddy brightens. ""Grand! Doesn't hurt to try, does it?""

So Seamus hides the bratwurst down his pants and off they go to the nearest pub, where they put their plan into action.
As they finish up their pints, the barman starts to wander down their way so Seamus brings out the bratwurst and Paddy gets to work.
""Out! Out! Filthy fuckers!!"" Screams the barman. 

Seamus and Paddy leg it out the door and run up the road, stopping a few minutes later to crow at how well their plan has worked. 
Delighted, they move on to another pub, and another, and another.... with the scam working perfectly at each stop.

A few hours later, the two haven't paid for a drink all night and are plastered, having visited several fine establishments.
Eventually, Paddy turns to Seamus and says,

A huge Line has formed leading up to her, and its moving fairly fast, so I decided to join it behind a nice young fellow in a yellow suit. 

He looks at me and smiles, and says ""are you here for the important news of the day?"" I nodded and entered into some interesting conversation with him about his extravigent lifestyle, eagerly awaiting what she had to say . 

Time passes with every word and Im a little closer now and I can see her whisper in each persons ear, and watch their shocked expression as they hurry off to work. 

""Shes here every morning the man says, and she stays there until she's told everyone who will listen, this is the first time I've had the chance to stop by.. I can't wait!"" He says in enthusiasm.

I'm about 3 people away now, and I notice she is very young, maybe 24, quite pretty aswell. And I can clearly see the importance she places in her words as she says them. I'm getting really excited now!

The man in the yellow suit is next, he leans in and captures the whispers as they flow from her mouth. It's only brief but he quickly nods and hurries off, not even a goodbye.

It's my turn! I'm eager, I'm ready! I walk up to her and she looks at me and grabs my arm.  She leans in and whispers into my ear. 

""I just need you to know that I'm a vegan, do you know what that means? ""

Tragic, especially considering they didn’t exactly spend their days helping old ladies cross the street or volunteering at the Boys and Girls club.  Nope, these fellows went straight to Hades.

The Devil, as is his custom, goes to greet his two newest eternal residents, and despite rivers of lava and torrents of brimstone, they’re standing around in jackets.

 “Not hot enough for you?” asked the Devil.

 “What, this?  Nah, this is like a Spring day in Chicago.”

The Devil doesn’t take lightly to such a slight, so he decides to really turn things up.  The renewed eternal hellfire and inferno has made the screams of the tormented souls in hell even louder.   Rivers of lava overflowing their banks.  The Devil goes to check on his two Chicagoans, and sure enough he sees them lounging in shorts and t-shirts.

 “Not hot enough for you?” the devil queries bewilderedly.

 “What, this?  Nah, this is like a July in Chicago.  In fact, I think the humidity was worse in the summer of ’96.”

The Devil is even more incensed.  He comes up with a new idea.  Turn the thermostat way down.  The cursed souls in Hell are greeted by new but equally unbearable type of torture.  The lava stops flowing, brimstone stops glowing, and wouldn’t you know it, the ground they stand on has frozen solid.

The Devil again searches out his two Chicagoans, and to his dismay, they’re hugging and cheering.

 “What’s this all about!?” the Devil roared.

Very grudgingly he agreed. He took the bucket, walked out the door, down the steps, and out to the beach. As he was collecting the snails, he noticed a beautiful woman strolling alongside the water just a little further down the beach.
He kept thinking to himself, ""Wouldn't it be great if she would even just come down and talk to me?"" He went back to gathering the snails.
All of a sudden he looked up, and the beautiful woman was standing right over him. They started talking and she invited him back to her place. They ended up spending the night together. At seven o'clock the next morning he woke up and exclaimed, ""Oh no!!! My wife's dinner party!!!""
He gathered all his clothes, put them on real fast, grabbed his bucket, and ran out the door. He ran down the beach all the way to his apartment. He ran up the stairs of his apartment. He was in such a hurry that when he got to the top of the stairs, he dropped the bucket of snails. There were snails all down the stairs. The door opened just then, with a very angry wife standing in the door way wondering where he's been all this time.
He looked at the snails all down the steps, then he looked at her, then back at the snails and said, ""Come on guys, we're almost there!!""",A wife and her husband were having a dinner party for some important guests.,54
