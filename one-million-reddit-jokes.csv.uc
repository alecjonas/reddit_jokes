post,44736s,2qh72,jokes,false,1454616800,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/44736s/anger_management/,self.jokes,,"(Sorry for the wall of text.  This was and email that a cow worker sent me.)

When you occasionally have a really bad day, 
and you just need to take it out on someone, 
don't take it out on someone you know, 
take it out on someone you don't know, 
but you know deserves it. 
       
I was sitting at my desk when I remembered 
a phone call I'd forgotten to make. 
      
I found the number and dialed it. 
     
A man answered, saying 'Hello.' 
      
I politely said, 'This is Chris. 
Could I please speak with Robyn Carter?' 
      
Suddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear 
'Get the right f***ing number!' 
And the phone was slammed down on me. 
       
I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude. 
     
When I tracked down Robyn's correct number to call her, 
I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits. 
      
After hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again. 
      
When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled 'You're an asshole!' 
And hung up. 
      
I wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it, 
And put it in my desk drawer. 
       
Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, 
I'd call him up and yell, 
'You're an asshole!' 
     
It always cheered me up. 
      
When Caller ID was introduced, 
I thought my therapeutic 'asshole' 
calling would have to stop. 
      
So, I called his number and said, 
'Hi, this is John Smith from the telephone company. 
I'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program?' 
         
He yelled 'NO!' 
And slammed down the phone. 
      
I quickly called him back and said, 
'That's because you're an asshole!' And hung up. 
     
One day I was at the store, 
getting ready to pull into a parking spot. 
     
Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot
I had patiently waited for. 
      
I hit the horn and yelled that I'd been waiting for that spot, 
but the idiot ignored me. 
      
I noticed a 'For Sale' sign in his back window, 
so I wrote down his number. 
      
A couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole 
(I had his number on speed dial) 
I thought that I'd better call the BMW asshole, too. 
     
I said, 
'Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?' 
       
He said, 'Yes, it is.' 
      
I then asked, 
'Can you tell me where I can see it?' 
     
He said, 
'Yes, I live at  34 Oaktree Blvd. , in  Fairfax   
It's a yellow ranch style house And the car's parked right out in front.' 
      
I asked, 
'What's your name?' 
     
He said, 
'My name is Don Hansen.' 
         
I asked, 
'When's a good time to catch you, Don?' 
      
He said, 
'I'm home every evening after five.' 
     
I said, 
'Listen, Don, can I tell you something?' 
     
He said, 
'Yes?' 
      
I said, 
'Don, you're an asshole!' 
      
Then I hung up, 
and added his number to my speed dial, too. 
       
Now, when I had a problem, 
I had two assholes to call. 
     
Then I came up with an idea .... 
      
I called asshole #1. 
      
He said, 
'Hello' 
     
I said, 
'You're an asshole!' 
(But I didn't hang up.) 
     
He asked, 
'Are you still there?' 
       
I said, 
'Yeah!' 
      
He screamed, 
'Stop calling me' 
      
I said, 
'Make me.' 
       
He asked, 
'Who are you?' 
     
I said, 
'My name is Don Hansen.' 
    
He said, 
'Yeah? Where do you live?' 
       
I said, 
'Asshole, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd., in Fairfax, 
a yellow ranch style home and 
I have a black Beamer parked in front.' 
       
He said, 
'I'm coming over right now, Don. 
And you had better start saying your prayers.' 
       
I said, 
'Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole,' 
and hung up. 
     
Then I called Asshole #2. 
      
He said, 
'Hello?' 
      
I said, 
'Hello, asshole,' 
      
He yelled, 
'If I ever find out who you are ....' 
      
I said, 
'You'll what?' 
      
He exclaimed, 
'I'll kick your ass' 
      
I answered, 
'Well, asshole, here's your chance. 
I'm coming over right now.' 
     
Then I hung up and immediately called the police, 
saying that I was on my way over to 34 Oaktree Blvd, in Fairfax, to kill my gay lover. 
       
Then I called Channel 7 News 
about the gang war going down in Oaktree Blvd in Fairfax.
I quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax. 
     
I got there just in time to watch two assholes 
beating the crap out of each other 
in front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter 
and surrounded by a news crew. 
       
NOW, I feel much better!
     
I guess that anger management really does work.

Steve went to a career adviser to get some ideas on what classes to take.  Among the available courses Logic caught his attention.
""What does this class teach you"" he asked the adviser.
""Basic logic skill"" Steve still looked puzzled so the adviser explained, ""I'll give you an example, do you own a weed-wacker?""
""I do"" Steve answered.
""Then using logic I can assume you probably have a lawn as well.""
""I do!"" Steve answered in amazement
The adviser went on, ""Then I can logically assume that you also have a house and therefore the possibility of a wife and maybe a few kids.""
""That's incredible!"" Steve said, I'm taking that class.

When Steve and Jack met up later Jack asked Steve what classes he would take.
""Logic!"" Steve said enthusiastically, and eager to show off a little he said, ""watch this, do you own a weed-wacker?""
""No"" Jack replied
Steve looked at him differently and asked, ""Oh, are you gay?""

All arrivals in Heaven have to go through a bureaucratic examination to determine whether admission will be granted. One room has a clerk who inputs computerised records of what each applicant did on his or her last day of life.
The first applicant of the day explains that his last day was not a good one.
""I came home early and found my wife lying naked in bed. She claimed she had just gotten out of the shower. Well, her hair was dry and I checked the shower and it was completely dry, too. I knew she was into some hanky-panky and I began to look for her lover.
I went on to the balcony of our 9th floor apartment and found the SOB clinging to the rail by his fingertips.
I was so angry that I began bashing his fingers with a flower pot. He let go and fell, but his fall was broken by some awnings and bushes.
On seeing he was still alive, I found super human strength to drag our antique cedar chest to the balcony and throw it over. It hit the man and killed him. At this point the stress got to me and I suffered a massive heart attack and died.""
The clerk thanked him and sent him on to the next office.
The second applicant said that his last day was his worst.
""I was on the roof of an apartment building working on the AC equipment. I stumbled over my tools and toppled off the building. I managed to grab onto the balcony rail of a 9th floor apartment but some idiot came rushing out on the balcony and bashed my hands with a flower pot.
I fell, but hit some awnings and bushes and survived, but as I looked up I saw a huge chest falling toward me. I tried to crawl out of the way but failed and was hit and killed by the chest.""
The clerk couldn't help but chuckle as he directed the man to the next room.
He is still giggling when his third customer of the day enters. He apologizes and says, ""I doubt that your last day was as interesting as the fellow in here just before you.""
""I don't know"" replies the man, ""picture this, I'm buck naked, hiding in this cedar chest .......""",Good day,4

One day, their father dies and and in his will he leaves them three ducks... a duck each.

After the funeral they all gather at one of the house to discuss what the hell they're gonna do with the ducks.

&amp;nbsp

&lt;why don't we sell the ducks&gt;

One says

&lt;and split the money we make evenly amongst us&gt;&gt;

They decide that it's a great idea and they each go out to try to sell their duck.

&amp;nbsp

The first brother sells his duck for $15

The second brother sells his duck for $10

The third can't find anybody that wants the damn duck.

He tried all day and all night and finally he's tiered and goes to have a drink at a bar where he meets a pretty young woman. They drink a bit and hit it off and end up going to her house.

&amp;nbsp

After they have sex he gets up and is about to leave when she stops him saying
&lt;hey, where's my money?&gt;

&lt;what money?&gt;

&lt;I don't do it for free&gt;

He says &lt;well I don't have any money, all I have is this duck&gt;

She's as &lt;ok, give me the duck&gt;

So he starts to explain to her how his father died and he and his brothers all got ducks and how they each needed to sell them and she understood and told him 

&lt;you know what, you were so good in bed, come fuck me again and I'll give you the duck back&gt;

So he fucks her again and leaves and leaves in the morning and manages to sell his duck for $5.

&amp;nbsp

That evening the brothers all meet. The first one says &lt;I sold my duck for 15 dollars&gt;

The second one says &lt;I sold my duck for 10 dollars&gt;

The third one says

The alarm went out to all the fire departments for miles around.
     
When the volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the chemical company president rushed to the fire chief and said, ""All our secret formulas are in the vault in the center of the plant. They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact.""
       
But the roaring flames held the firefighters off.
     
Soon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000 to the fire department who could bring out the company's secret files.
      
From the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby Norwegian rural township volunteer fire company composed mainly of Norwegians over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the newer sleek engines that were parked outside the plant.
     
Without even slowing down it drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other firemen watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire fought it back on all sides. It was a performance and effort never seen before.
      
Within a short time, the Norske old timers had extinguished the fire and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.
      
The local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film, asking their chief, ""What are you going to do with all that money?""
      
""Vell,"" said Ole Larsen, the 70-year-old fire chief, ""Da first thing ve gonna do is fix da brakes on dat truck!""",Minnesota chemical fire,28

""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday."" 

I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.

My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, 
""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" 
It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me."" 

I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""

We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. 

She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. 
We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?"" 

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" 
She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""

After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, 
""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""

""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake. 

Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy birthday"".
And I just sat there...

So he goes up to the counter and asks the bartender for an espresso. After receiving it he asks the bartender:

""sorry again, mate, but can you please...uhm...you know...put some sugar in it for me?""

as he says this he looks down at his hands. The bartender immediately realizes he can't do it himself, and says ""oh, of course sir."" and puts some sugar into it.

The man asks him again ""uhm, really sorry to bother you once more bartender, but can you please help me sip it?""

The bartender feels a little uncomfortable, but out of the goodness of his heart helps the poor disabled man drink the espresso.

Shortly after, the man needs to use the restroom. He asks the person next to him:

""Sir, I'm sorry to ask, but I really need someone to help me use the restroom. You know... I can't do it myself.""

The person next to him obviously finds it weird and uncomfortable, but as a good citizen decides to help the guy.

So after helping him fish out the sausage and do his business, they exit the bathroom and the disabled man exits the bar. Everyone watches him walk out, thinking to themselves what a poor guy he must be with such a problem in his life. When he's outside he stops for a second, looks up at the morning sun, stretches his arms very widely and says loudly and with relief:

One evening, the old guy decided to go down to the pond and look it over. He hadn’t been there for a while.  He grabbed a five gallon bucket to bring back some fruit.

As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee.  As he came closer, he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny dipping in his pond. As he approached, he made the women aware of his presence.

At once, they all went to the deep end.

One of the women shouted to him, “We’re not coming out until you leave.”

He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper's cemetery in the Nova Scotia back country. 
 As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost and, being a typical man, I didn't stop for directions. 
 I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. 
 I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn't know what else to do, so I started to play. 
 The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before for this homeless man. 
 And as I played ""Amazing Grace"", the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished, I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head was hung low, my heart was full. 
 As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, ""I never seen anything like that before, and I've been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.""

He had a beautiful large pond at the back of the property next to the road, and he’d fixed it up real nice with picnic tables, horseshoe pits, and he’d planted some nice flowers and fruit trees next to the pond. One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond to look it over, as he hadn’t been down there for a while. He grabbed a five-gallon bucket to bring back some fruit. As he neared the pond, he heard splashing and female voices shouting and laughing with glee. As he came closer he saw that 5 young women had parked their car at the side of the road, climbed the fence and were skinny-dipping in his pond. He made the women aware of his presence and they all went hurriedly splashing to the deep end.

One of the women shouted to him, “We’re naked and we’re not coming out until you leave!” The old man frowned and yelled back, “I didn’t come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or make you get out of the pond.” Holding the bucket up he said, “I’m just here to feed the alligator.”

""I thought you said you would hold that car ‘till we raised the $75,000 asking price,"" said the man. ""Yet I just heard you close the deal for $65,000 to the lovely young lady there. You insisted there could be no discount on this model.""
 ""Well, what can I tell you? She had the ready cash and, just look at her, how could I resist?"" replied the grinning salesman.
 Just then the young woman approached the middle-aged couple and gave them the keys.
""There you go,"" she said. ""I told you I would get the dope to reduce it. See you later, Dad.""

""Pastor, I am in desperate need of work. Is there any kind of job you can give me, despite my obvious disability?""
The pastor, with a cheeky grin, points to the churches bell tower and says:
""You see that bell up in the tower? If you can ring that for me every day precisely at noon, I will pay you $20 a day. Can you do that for me?""
The no armed man hesitates, but the offer of $20 a day sounds too promising, so he agrees. 

Later that day, he makes his way up to the bell tower but alas, cannot pull the rope for obvious reasons. However, he does not give up. Being a quick thinker, the man takes a stance in front of the bell, and begins repeatedly bashing his face into the bell. Success! the bell rings on the strike of noon, and a slightly dizzy no armed man returns downstairs, where a very confused pastor lives up to his promise and grants him $20.

This process continues for several weeks. Every day at noon, the man would head to the bell tower and bash his face into the solid metal for it to chime, and then the pastor would pay him. Over time, however, this method began damaging the mans head, both inside and out. Bruises were always constant, and the pastor began noticing the man would slur his speech, look deranged and have trouble walking in a straight line. But there were no complaints, and the man, though a bit slower by the day, was still getting paid happily, so it continued.

On one fateful day, however, the man once again staggers up the stairs to reach the bell tower as noon approached. He took his normal stance, ready to smash his head once again into the giant chiming machine. However, on this fateful day, he succumbs to the damage, and as he charges at the bell, he staggers so much that he completely misses the target. His momentum takes him right over the shallow wall of the tower and he plummets to the ground. He is killed instantly.
 
A crowd of people begin to gather around the no armed man's body, including a police officer. A woman looks at the body, horrified, and asks ""Oh my god, does anybody know who this man is?"" The police officer looks at the dead man and replies ""I don't know him, but his face rings a bell.""",A man with no arms is homeless and looking for a job.,1330

The sergeant replied ""Well Commander Mohammed, the jihadis use that for sex"". 

Digusted, the Commander says ""Absolutely not, Sergeant Mohammed, I won't have any of my troops being controlled by carnal western urges. Get rid of the goat!""

The sergeant responds ""We've tried, oh Prophet Mohammed we've tried, but they just bring back a new goat!""

""Fine"" says the Commander, ""It can stay but I will set an example by not taking part in this.""

The weeks go by and the Commander has kept well out of sight of the goat, refusing to give in, but eventually his urges get the better of him. ""Oh fuck it, I'm doing it!""

He goes to the goat, sits on his back and starts trying to ride it to the nearest town, but within 50 metres it collapses.

His sergeant sees him lying in a heap on the floor ""What happened Commander?!""

Dusting himself off, his commander replies ""I was trying to ride this goat into the nearest town to visit a whorehouse but it can't seem to handle it! How do your boys do it?""

The sergeant looked confused and replied ""Well normally we just fuck the goat""

""Praise be to Allah"" said the commander, unzipping.
