He went to the Magnet Bar to pick up a chip called Millie Amp. He caught her out back trying self induction; fortunately, she had not damaged her solenoid. The two took off on his megacycle and rode across the Wheatstone Bridge into a magnetic field, next to a flowing current , to watch the sine waves.

Micro Farad was very much stimulated by Millie's characteristic curve. Being attractive himself, he soon had her field fully excited. He set her on the ground potential, raised his frequency, lowered her resistance, and pulled out his high voltage probe. When he inserted it in parallel, he short-circuited her shunt. Fully excited, Millie cried out, ""ohm, ohm, give me mho"". As he increased his tube to maximum output, her coil vibrated from the current flow. It did not take long for her shunt to reach maximum heat. Now with the excessive current shortening her shunt, Micro's capacity rapidly discharged – every electron was drained off. But that was not the end of it. Indeed, they fluxed all night, tried various connections and hookings until his bar magnet weakened, and he could no longer generate enough voltage to sustain his collapsing field. With his battery fully discharged, Micro was unable to excite his tickler, so they went home. A few weeks later, they were merged forever and oscillated happily ever after.",An account of the encounter between Mr.Micro Farad and Ms.Millie Amp on a fruitful night.,1

Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. He proved to be a
hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.

For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, 'You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels. The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. One o'clock came, however, and he didn't
return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of
wine, waiting for him. 

She quietly called him over to her. 'Unbutton my blouse and take it off,' she said. Trembling, he did as she directed. 'Now take off my boots.' He did as she asked, ever so slowly. 'Now take off my socks.' He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. 'Now take off my skirt.' He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. 'Now take off my bra.' Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor. Then she looked at him and said, 'If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.'",A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife...,2202

A Texan went to Chicago, where he thought he would buy a new ""city"" outfit. He went into Marshall Fields and, when asked by a sweet young woman if she could help him, he answered, ""Yes, ma'am. Ya see, I'm from Texas, and I want to buy a complete city outfit.""

Her eyes lit up as she asked, ""Where would you like to start?""  
""Well, ma'am, how about a suit?""  
""Yes, sir. What size?""  
""Size 53 tall, ma'am.""  
""Wow, that's really big.""  
""Yes, ma'am, they really grow them big in Texas.""

""What's next?"" she asked.  
He replied, ""How about some shoes?""  
""What size?""  
""Size 15 double D.""  
""Wow, that's really big!""  
""Yes, ma'am. They really grow them big in Texas.""

""What's next?""  
""Well, I reckon I'll need a shirt.""

""Nineteen and a half neck, size 38,"" he replied.  
""Wow, that's really big!""

""Yes, ma'am. They really grow them big in Texas.""

The woman virtually glowed as she asked, ""Is there anything else I can do for you?""

""No, ma'am , I reckon that will be all.""

As the sweet young thing tallied up his bill and as the Texan counted his money, she blushed and asked, ""Sir, could I ask you a question?""

""Yes, ma'am, I already know what it is. And the answer is four inches.""

Astonished, she blurted out, ""Why, my boyfriend is bigger than that!""

Without so much as a stutter, the Texan replied, ""Wide, ma'am?""",They make em big in texas,7

Shortly after the train has departed, the conductor comes around collecting tickets. He knocks on the restroom door and says,

 ""ticket, please."" 

The door opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a ticket in hand. The conductor takes it and moves on.

The accountants saw this and agreed it was quite a clever idea. So after the conference, the accountants decide to copy the engineers on the return trip and save some money (being clever with money, and all!) 

When they get to the station they buy a single ticket for the return trip.

To their astonishment, the engineers don't buy a ticket at all.

The young girl pulls down her shorts, showing the Cuban flag tattooed on a beautifully shaped buttock. She approaches the dying man and sticks her butt in his face.

Assume there are about 3.8 billion males,with an average dick height of about 80 cm off the ground. The average dick weighs about 100 grams. That's a combined mass of 380,000,000 kg of cock.
Now we must make an approximation. For simplicity's sake,let us assume the penises are all evenly lined up in a ring around the equator. The equation for moment of inertia of a ring is I = mass*radiusA2.The radius of earth is about 6.371 million meters. There­
fore the radius of the approximated dick ring is 6,371,000 + 0.80 = 6,371,000.8 meters.
I = 380,000,000*6,371,000.8A2 = 1.5424*1OA22
The Earth has a moment of inertia, I = 8.04x1OA37 kg*mA2.The Earth rotates at a moderate angular velocity of 7.2921159 x1QA-5 radians/second.
Using Conservation of Angular Momentum we can find the new rotation of the earth.
L=l*omega= 8.04x1OA37 kg*mA2 * 7.2921159 X 1QA -5:5.86286*1QA33.
5.86286*1OA33:(8.04X1OA37 +
1.5424*1OA22) *omega
-&gt; solve for omega = 7.292115899502489e-05
This is 4.97511e-15 rad/s slower than earth's original rotation. This translates to 6.752*10""-1O seconds = 0.6752 nanoseconds longer per da

It's times like these that Dain is left wondering what has become of his fate. He was born a soldier, not fit to be prime advisor and companion to the Royal.

The bells rang.

One hour until the most important political event of the young Duke's life and he's nowhere to be found. The Zenith of the Sun in his twentieth nameday. Lords and Ladies from all over the Realm to offer their heir to be the Royal Duchess. This day Dain has come to fear. He knew Duke Tyuratam more than anyone and of all the stunts he pulled, this may change the game completely. He has recently expressed his sentiments for the Realm's common people, the Commons. And if Dain's suspicion is right, for him to be seen celebrating with them in this most important day, without his Guardian for good measure, will be the start of reuniting people like no Duke has ever done. 

The Guardian is supposed to impart lessons to the young Duke but the truth is he had learned more from him. He's beaming with pride at this, beside the empty throne, which irked the Lady in front of him even more. He barely noticed  the throne room is filling up with the lots of them, but he couldn't care less. Finally the Lady demanded, 'Where is he?' and Dain, feeling very much like the olden days facing the enemy vanguard, summon up the courage and replied: 'The Royal Duke is in the Commons'.","His Royalty, Duke Tyuratam the First is nowhere to be found.",0

so he asked at the Front desk of the golf club if he could be paired up with another golfer that might be able to show him course and what do so and so on

""No problem,"" said the receptionist, ""in fact, one of our long-time members just came back from 6 months of sailing and is always eager to teach other the game""

without hesitation, the Preist accepted the opportunity to play with this veteran golfing sailor, only to discover that despite his prior experience the sailor wasn't all that good, and every time he missed the hole on the green he would stay swearing true sailor syle

Sailor: ""FucK! I missed! this piss hole of a green should suck a fat one!
Priest: Easy now my son, watch your language, God is listening

the Sailor apologized, but no more then 2 holes later, he was back at it again

Sailor: Christ on a shit stick, my fucking club is broken!
Priest: whoa now my child, don't take the lords name in vain! or he'll punish you

The sailor, ignored this priest this time, clearly aggravated that he was losing the game to this newcomer

they made it too hole 18, the final hole, the Sailor almost caught up to the priest in the score, it all would come down to this one last stroke,
The sailor Swung and he missed the hole by a mere Inch, and start going off again swearing
there were so many profanities, even some the priest have never heard before, and once more the Priest urged the Sailor to not use such bad language

when suddenly the sky grew Dark, and a Thunderbolt shoots forth from the sky, hitting the Priest dead center instantly killing him. followed by a deep dark voice saying

“Come on”, she said, “we don’t have much time”. So I climbed on her and WOW!!!! Everything was just wonderful and then I suddenly couldn’t hold it in any longer and KAPOOWWWW, I was done within a few minutes.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man who drove trains for a living,13

The man in the car sped up again, to his surprise the chicken was still running ahead of him at 60 mph!!!

Suddenly the chicken turned off the road and ran down a long driveway leading to a farmhouse. The man followed the chicken to the house and saw a man in the yard with dozens of three legged chickens. The man in the car called out to the farmer ""How did you get all these three legged chickens?""

The farmer replied, ""I breed 'em. Ya see it's me, my wife and my son living here and we all like to eat the chicken leg. Since a chicken only has two legs, I started breeding this three legged variety so we could all eat our favorite piece.""

He found a place to do a U-turn, and we soon catched up to the girl. She smiled as we stopped. I asked if she wanted a ride, and she said ""yes"". I got out, and helped her with the suitcase. The two of us managed to put it in the trunk. It was way heavier than I tought it would be. I saw that it was locked with a solid padlock. She got in the backseat. My friend asked where she wanted to go, and she said to just follow this road. I asked if she had just returned from vacation, to wich she mumbled something. My friend and I tought she was acting very strange. whatever we asked to get a converastion going, she would give a vague answer, or not answer it at all. I decided to talk about her suitcase. I said that her suitcase were heavy, to wich she didn't respond. I then said ""what's in that suitcase of yours, anyway?"". Her eyes changed, and she said with an angry tone ""That is none of your business"". Both my friend and I were really creeped out at this point.

He asked ""But seriously, whats in the suitcase?"". She told him that ""It was  none of your damn business"".

They all board the train. The MBAs take their respective seats but all three lawyers cram into a restroom and close the door behind them. Shortly after the train has departed, the conductor comes around collecting tickets. He knocks on the restroom door and says, ‘Ticket, please.’ The door opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a ticket in hand. The conductor takes it and moves on.

The MBAs see this and agree it was quite a clever idea. So after the conference, the MBAs decide to copy the lawyers on the return trip and save some money (being clever with money and all that). When they get to the station, they buy a single ticket for the return trip. To their astonishment, the lawyers don’t buy a ticket at all. ‘How are you going to travel without a ticket?’ asks one perplexed MBA. ‘This time we can’t tell you,’ says one of the lawyers, ‘it’s a professional secret.’

When they all board the train the three MBAs cram into a restroom and the three lawyers cram into another one nearby. The train departs. Shortly afterward, one of the lawyers leaves his restroom and walks over to the restroom where the MBAs are hiding.

He gets a moment to ask the CEO if he can make a movie he's been eyeing for sometime. The CEO says, ""I'm sorry, but you're still too new, and I just can't take the risk. Get a few blockbusters under your belt and we'll talk.""  


So the director gets his chance, gets a great script, casts great actors, and his film does okay; not great, but better than expected. He approaches the CEO at the next function and asks him, ""about that film..."". The CEO says, ""Look, your film was a success, but that's not gonna be enough to convince the board of directors. Get me another couple of films like this, and we'll talk"".  


So the director gets another script, it's chancy, but he manages to make some revisions, and convinces a reluctant cast to sign on. This time it's a huge success, and even gets nominated for a few Oscars. The director approaches Disney's CEO again, and says, ""what do you think of that? So about this movie I've been wanting to make..."" but is interrupted by the CEO who says, ""you know, I don't know about that, but I have this amazing script and I think you're just the director to make this film. Bring home the gold, and we'll talk later"".  


So the director looks at the script, and it's solid. So he reaches out and casts the biggest names, and convinces his producers to invest millions more, but this is going to be epic, and it is. The film is a blockbuster, sells out theatres all over the country, and it's all everyone is talking about all summer long. And come the following year, his film is nominated in nearly every category, and wins most of them. The director walks into the CEO's office, beaming a cocky smile as his hand clenches multiple Oscars and sets them down on the CEO's desk and says, ""so about that movie I've been wanting to make..."". And the CEO gets up, hugs him and then looks at him and says, ""you've given me three great films, and made billions for Disney. Now let me say, I've heard about this film you want to make, and I love it. I always have. It's a classic! And I also want you to know that from here on out any film you want to make, the board and I will fully endorse. Now go make your movie!""  


So the director goes out and casts the most obscure actors, and brings in construction teams that have never had anything to do with film, and the CEO raises an eyebrow, but is assured by the director that these are essential to his film, so the CEO gives the green light. But as progress on the movie goes on, the CEO keeps getting notifications about more and more obscure requests, and eventually decides to come down and visit the set. He comes up right in the middle of scene, and his jaw drops to the floor. He sees what appears to be a family engaging in an incestuous and bestiality orgy, with fake vomit, blood, fecal matter. To the side there are dummies of mutilated bodies, and one of the actresses, a girl no older than nine is being fitted for a noose. The CEO is filled with a mix of emotions, confused, angry, horror, but mostly confusion. He lurches up to the director, unable to wrench his eyes from this terrifying scene and says, ""what the hell is this? I thought this was a film about cats? Where are the cats?"" And the director replies, ""So when I asked you...and you said yes...  I see your confusion, you're thinking of the Aristo*cats*!""",A lesser-known director gets picked up by Disney,1

Outraged the DJ started a campaign on the air telling his listeners what was going on. That The Beach Boys wanted to charge the station an outrageous amount of money to play their old music. So until they changed their minds he would keep airing a piece on how greedy the record label was and how they abused their artists and how little the record label pays its artists for plays on the air.

This went on for months. It got so repetitive that the Manager asked the DJ to stop because it was never going to work, but the DJ was sure it would.

Then after another month the Manager came to the DJ with an update on the situation.

Manager, “Good news, The Beach Boys record label is going to let us play the song for free.” 

DJ, “Of course they are.”

Manager, “How did you know this was going to work?”

The concept of a drive-thru is weird to me. Ever think about it?

The windows are way too small. A car won't typically fit.

But there was a slight problem.

They were like ""Ay Tony...we only got the budget for eight letters.""

""But 'through' has like seven letters. How we gonna fit it?""

Master Sao says to the man, ""I have taught you all that I know. The real test will be brought to you from the outside, where you must use your knowledge and creativity to succeed.  Follow the trail up tallest mountain, and you will find the wise guider, Tao Tao.  You will recognize him as he is missing his left arm. Follow him to the five rings of tribulation.

""You will be tested with the five core principles and traits of combat: Wisdom, Agility, Strength, Skill of Foot, and Skill of Arm.  Only upon passing all five feats will you be declared a Master, and receive the blessing of leading your own Dojo.  You must head out when the clock strikes midnight of the full moon. The next is tomorrow, but I believe you are ready.""

Master Sao then bows to his pupil.  Unable to speak out of fear, excitement, and anxiety, the young man bows and heads home to plan his trip.


Upon arriving home, the young man scouts maps to figure out the most likely mountain to find Tao Tao on.

""Hmmmm.. could it be the great western mountain of Mount Ryo? No, it is towered over by it's sister mountain Mount Ling.""

The young man continues to browse until..

""There! It must be Mount Pi-Clo. It may not look the tallest to the naked eye, but it spans miles below sea level.""

The young man begins his travels.

He finds the trail that heads up the mountain and notices a man standing on the side of the path about half way up. The man is missing a limb.

""Have you come to obtain that which all seek?"" Asked Tao Tao.

The young man confirmed, and followed Tao Tao through the woods of the mountain. They arrive at a door in the mountain, where Tao Tao wished the young man luck, and headed back to his post.

The young man opened the door and was greeted by a line of fourty other willing looking men and women waiting behind a door marked ""Wisdom."" He waits a few hours, gaining impatience, until it is his turn, and heads in.

Sitting on the ground is a small squirrel. The squirrel speaks to the man.

""If you seek glory, you must first answer a simple question.  Where are we?""

The young man obviously knows they are in Mount Pi-Clo, but that is too simple.  He continues to ponder and ponder until he notices dirt and scraps on the floor begin to shift in an odd pattern.

""My observation is telling me we have entered into a coal mine. The static field created by equipment above us is causing particles to move.""

The squirrel confirms this as correct, and grants him a medallion for passing the wisdom test. He continues through the door on the opposite door, where he is greeted with thirty people waiting in line for their test.  In front of them is a door marked Agility.  After two hours, the young man enters the second waiting room.

Inside is an older man in a rocking chair, holding a pebble in his hand.  His chair is engraved ""So-Su the Swift.""  The young man chuckles to himself, as he knows the classic pebble snatching trick is in front of him. So-Su speaks up..

""In order to pass my test, you must snatch this pebble from my hand.""

The young man gets the feeling it will not be an easy task, as reaching for the stone will always be slower than the fist that closes. He comes up with a plan..

The young man steps forward and kicks the rocking chair as it rocks forward. Momentum bring the pebble towards him, and he snatches it out of mid-air.  So-Su is impressed, and awards him the Medallion of Agility.  He moves on to the third test.

He enters, and sees a line of twenty people waiting behind a door marked ""Strength."". In this room, everyone looks muscular and excited. Some stretching, some arm wrestling. Although nervous, the young man waits an hour and enters.

Inside is a tall woman. The woman speaks up.

""Hello brave traveler. I am Momon the Muscular. In order to pass my test, you must remove my feet from the ground.""

The young man approaches her and tries to lift her.  She will not budge. 

The young man realizes none of his tests have been straight forward, and have all actually been a test of wisdom. He then begins to think of a new method.

He pushes the woman as hard as he can, with his leg behind her. She trips and falls, but only after her feet both leave the ground. 

A bit disgruntled, she hands him the Medallion of Strength, and grants him passage to the fourth waiting room. Inside are maybe 10 people waiting behind the door labeled ""Skill of Foot.""  After waiting half an hour, he enters.

Inside are a tree and a centaur; the latter immediately speaks to him, ""You will no longer be able to rely on wit and creativity to pass.  You must kick this tree in a way the rustles the leaves and result in the fowls abandoning their home.""

The young man walks around the tree and thinks deeply. He remember the most powerful kick he knows, and finds the trees vulnerable spot. He kicks it with all his might and concentration... 
All of the birds fly out of the tree and leave some limbs and leaves falling out of the tree.

The centaur is extremely impressed and grants him passage to the final room, after awarding him the Medallion of Feet.

The young man enters the final waiting room to find no one waiting in line. He walks straight through to the final room labeled ""Skill of Arm.""

 Inside, he finds his master.  Master Jhu Sao exclaims, ""My pupil! I am very proud to have you standing in front of me for your final test.. the test of your hand to hand combat.  You will face one challenge on punching. But before we begin, do you have any questions?""

Now, the young man has a TON of questions, but one is bothering him above all the others. He asks..

""Is this really an impressive feat to get here? The other challenges seemed so simple.. but there was no line to enter here. What is deterring all others from reaching here?""

Master Jhu Sao responds, ""Young pupil, you must understand. Many venture to the Wisdom test. Most reach the test of Agility.  A few then wait their turn for the test of Strength, and the line for kicking is much shorter. But one principle must hold true to the end:

There is no punch line.",Master Jhu Sao is teaching his pupil about combat...,18

Obama replied, “Go ahead, my wife doesn't know what the inside of a whorehouse smells like.”",Obama and Trump are at a barbershop,2956

He left the broom on the back porch. His mother was cleaning up the kitchen when she realized that her broom was missing. She asked the little boy about the broom and he told her where it was.

She then asked him to please go get it. The little boy informed his mom that he was afraid of the dark and didn't want to go out to get the broom.
