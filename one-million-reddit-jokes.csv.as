The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other.

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head.

The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever.

The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened.

The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue!""

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won.

""I don't have a clue!!!"" the Rabbi said.

""First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here.""

""And then what?"" asked a woman.

""Who knows!!"" said the Rabbi. ""He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!""","#871: Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community...",809

An X-ray was done of his body as part of the investigation into his death and a strange abnormality was detected. Deep down his left ear canal was some kind of tiny device shaped like a speaker. When removed they found it had malfunctioned and killed him. Nobody came forward with any information on what this implant was, until one doctor said he had discovered an identical device in the ear of Pope John Paul II when he died but had kept this hidden in the Vatican archives. An amazing discovery was made when the archives were finally opened to investigators. Devices just like the two found in the deceased popes were here and belonged to every Pope from before! And not just every pope, but every deceased Cardinal, Bishop, Priest, Monk, Nun, anyone from before who was part of the church had the same thing in them! All found in the ear after death! Many other Christians also came forward and said they had secretly found these things inside those who had died but had kept it a secret until now. 

But the question still remained as to what these mysterious objects were and what were they doing in the ears of the faithful? All of them were found to have switches on them, and, anxiously, the investigators turned them on to unveil the truth...and out came a voice singing:  ♫ ""DON'T STOP......BELIEVIN'!

A boy was walking home from school when he passed by a stray cat. The cat was trying to drink water that had spilt on the tarmac near it. The boy saw that the tarmac was dirty, and was worried that the cat would get sick if it kept drinking the water. He started to slowly walk towards the cat while taking out his water bottle from his school bag. Once he got close enough to the cat, he unscrewed the cap of his bottle, poured water into it, and laid the cap down on the tarmac for the cat to sip from. 

The cat looked at the cap full of water, and after hesitating for a moment, the cat began to lick the water from the cap. The boy did this a few times for the cat before noticing a tag on its neck. He bent down to look at the tag. The tag read: “Daisy”, and had an address on it. The boy knew that the address was only a 15 minute walk from where he was now. The boy pet the cat and then picked it up, and began walking to the owner’s house. 

After about 15 minutes, the boy finally arrived at the house. He let the cat down so that he could knock on the door. He heard light footsteps approaching the door before the door suddenly opened. A girl that he recognised was standing behind the door. It was a girl from his school that he had seen walking around before. Before the boy could take say anything, the cat meowed behind him and the girl’s smile turned into shock. “Daisy!” She cried in relief as she went around the boy to pick up her cat. 

The boy turned around to the sight of the girl on the floor hugging her cat. “I found him on my way back to school” said the boy. The girl said that the cat had been missing for almost a week. She was relieved. The girl said thank you and pulled the boy in for a hug. His cheeks had turned bright red and he was embarrassed to pull away from the hug, because he knew she would be able to notice. The boy went back home, heart still fluttering from the experience. 

For the rest of the school year, the boy was too shy to approach her and he graduated high school without talking to her again. He went to college at a place where none of his friends had gone. He was alone and had to try to make friends. When he entered his first class, he was surprised to see the girl sitting in the front row by herself. He had no excuses not to sit next to her. He sat down and asked her: “How is Daisy?”. She turned around, at first looking confused, but then she smiled when she recognised him. “She’s great!” She said not knowing what else to say, only knowing she was happy to see him. The boy looked at her and her smile, and it looked just as beautiful as the day he returned her cat. This was the beginning of their relationship. 

15 years later, they had been married for 6 years, and they still had Daisy. The girl had been fighting cancer for the past year. The boy would be by her side as she underwent the treatments. The doctors told him she didn’t have much time left. The boy would lie at her side as she rested and when she was awake, he would talk to her all night, reminiscing all their years together. Unfortunately their time together was cut short. She passed away when they were both 33 on February 14th. 

The girl’s last words before entering her final sleep were: “I love you, darling. Please take care of Daisy when I’m gone”. The boy wept hearing these words and would weep more the next morning. Some time passed and the boy stopped being sad. He realised that he shouldn’t be sad that she was gone, instead he should be happy she was ever here. Even though the boy had lost his wife, he could still stroke her pussy everyday.",A Valentine’s Day Story,3

Very Long Read:

Pocket Tazer Stun Gun, a great gift for the wife.

A guy who purchased his lovely wife a pocket Tazer for their anniversary submitted this:

Last weekend I saw something at Larry's Pistol &amp; Pawn Shop that sparked my interest. The occasion was our 15th anniversary and I was looking for a little something extra for my wife Julie. What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse-sized Tazer.

The effects of the Tazer were supposed to be short-lived, with no long term adverse effect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreat to safety...??

WAY TOO COOL! Long story short, I bought the device and brought it home... I loaded two AAA batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing! I was disappointed. I learned, however, that if I pushed the button and pressed it against a metal surface at the same time, I'd get the blue arc of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs.

AWESOME!!! Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Julie what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave.

Okay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it couldn't be all that bad with only two AAA batteries, right?

There I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh &amp; blood moving target.

I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and then thought better of it. She is such a sweet cat. But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised.

Am I wrong?

So, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, and Tazer in another.

The directions said that:

a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant;

a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; and

a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water.

Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries.

All the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5"" long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference (loaded with two itsy, bitsy AAA batteries); pretty cute really, and thinking to myself, 'no possible way!'

What happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best.

I'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one side so as to say, 'Don't do it stupid,' reasoning that a one-second burst from such a tiny lil ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.. I decided to give myself a one-second burst just for the heck of it.

I touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and...

HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. WHAT THE... !!!

I'm pretty sure Hulk Hogan ran in through the side door, picked me up in the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and tingling in my legs! The cat was making meowing sounds I had never heard before, clinging to a picture frame hanging above the fireplace, obviously in an attempt to avoid getting slammed by my body flopping all over the living room.

Note:  
If you ever feel compelled to 'mug' yourself with a Tazer,  
one note of caution:

There is NO such thing as a one-second burst when you zap yourself! You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor!  
A three-second burst would be considered conservative!

A minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thing at that point), I collected my wits (what little I had left), sat up and surveyed the landscape.

My bent reading glasses were on the mantel of the fireplace.  
· The recliner was upside down and about 8 feet or so from where it originally was.  
· My triceps, right thigh, and both nipples were still twitching..  
· My face felt like it had been shot up with Novocain, and my bottom lip weighed 88 lbs.  
· I had no control over the drooling.  
· Apparently I had crapped in my shorts but was too numb to know for sure, and my sense of smell was gone.  
· I saw a faint smoke cloud above my head, which I believe came from my hair.  
I'm still looking for my testicles and I'm offering a significant reward for their safe return!

They were the best band on the gay scene so tony thought, but they just didn’t have enough notoriety to make it big. 

One day as tony was in the local gay bar, he saw a sign up for an LGBT+ battle of the bands competition, and the winner got to play with RuPaul. Tony saw this as a great opportunity for his band to finally make it in the big time!

So they practiced, rehearsed, bought new equipment, new wigs, new looks, everything to make them win this competition. 

In the end it came down to the final two acts: a rock group of asexuals, and Tony’s drag band.

Tony’s drag queens went up first, and they played their hearts out. The crowd went wild, they cheered and shouted at the loud songs, and went quiet and danced at the slow ones, and rapturous applause met them when they finished.

And then the band of asexuals got up, and the crowd went WILD, screaming and throwing things on stage. It was clear who the winner was.

After the asexual band got off stage, their manager went up to Tony and said:

“Sorry bud, but my four aces beats your four queens”",Battle of the bands,4

The clerk warns the couple that this specific room is haunted. They were exaughsted, so they reluctantly rented the room. 

They enter the last available room, and open the door. All they see, is a terrible looking bed, the wallpaper was torn, and there was one lone fridge near the wall. They walk into the bathroom, which was completely disgusting, the bath was moldy and filled with cockroaches and the toilet was without toilet paper. 
Curious to see if there was food in the fridge, they open the door and inside there was Appleslice with peanut butter on-top. They went to grab for it when an eerie voice says “DON’T EAT THE APPLE SLICE...” They immediately shut the door closed after hearing it

Since it was late in the evening, they thought they might as well go downstairs to the buffet. They notice that it was completely empty, and no one was inside. They walked up to the hotel clerk, who tells them that the place is closed at the moment from an infestation of rats.

Drained of energy, they walk upstairs to the room and jump onto the bed to sleep. 
In the middle of the night, the wife was starving, so she got up and walked to the fridge, and opened the door. She grabbed the tray, hearing the voice say “DOOON’T EAT THE APPLE SLICES”. She completely ignored the voice and bit into it

While the boy and his father were watching with amazement, a fat old lady in a wheelchair moved up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened, and the lady rolled between them into a small room. The walls closed and the boy and his father watched the small numbers above the walls light up sequentially. They continued to watch until it reached the last number and then the numbers began to light in the reverse order. Finally, the walls opened up again and a gorgeous 24-year-old woman stepped out.

They arrived at their new home in rural Minnesota, and although they were happy and still in love, the first couple of months were difficult.  They didn’t know any English and sadly there were no other Chinese immigrants around to talk to.  Plus the husband was busy at his new job, which often had him away from home for days. Now the young lil wife was supportive and grateful her husband was trying so hard to improve their new life, but soon started getting depressed and lonely, as she had no friends to talk to.  One day while she was hanging her laundry, her next door neighbor, a middle aged tall black man with a kind face who lived only with his pet Golden Retriever, offered her some lemonade.  Although she couldn’t understand him, she was grateful for the kindness he offered and they soon became friends.

A few months passed and it was the couple’s one year anniversary. It had been 2 weeks since she last saw him. Her heart was pumping with excitement all day as she prepared her husband’s favorite dishes, put on her nicest dress and waited and waited. But sadly he called and told her his office had suddenly sent him to Chicago for an emergency.

She was too crestfallen so she went over to her neighbor’s house to vent and a good cry.  The kind neighbor silently listened to her and gave her his shoulder to cry on.  After some talking and some wine, they both realized they were just two lonely souls.  They at first hesitated but they embraced and let their emotions take over.  They made passionate love multiple times that night.

Afterward, the girl returned home and was contemplating what just happened and what she had done, suddenly her husband flung the doors opened and came running in to give her a big hug.  “I realized you are the important thing in my life and I told my boss fuck Chicago, I’m going home to be with my wife!” She was elated to see him all the while feeling guilty but also didn’t want her husband to find out what happened.“Wifey, as an anniversary present, I brought home something special!” She opened the ribboned box and it was full of fancy multi scented, multi-colored condoms.  “Now which one do you want to try first? My pick is the blueberry Blue.” the husband asked, noticeably very excited.  As the girl was still very very naïve, she was worried her neighbor’s semen would be black and would have left a mark on her body. But she had a brilliant plan. “I want to try the Black One!” she shouted, thinking if they used a black condom, he wouldn’t notice. After some more convincing, they decided on black and made passionate love.

A few months had passed and to the couple’s great joy, the girl was pregnant and soon it was time to give birth. At the hospital, “It’s a healthy boy!” the doctor proclaimed as he handed the baby to the new mother.  But to the couple’s surprise, the baby was black! The husband angrily shouted, “What the hell is going on!  Why does he not look like me!?!” The girl quickly came up with another brilliant lie.  “I must have gotten pregnant when we used the black condom that night.  That condom must have been defective!” The husband who was also very very naïve reluctantly believed her story and never gave it a second thought.

&amp;#x200B;

6 years passed and the boy grew big and healthy.  The couple decided to finally go visit China and show off their healthy boy to their hometown friends and family.  The next day, after letting the boy play outside, he came running home crying.  “What’s wrong my son?” the dad asked. “Daddy, all the other kids made fun of me because I’m black!” the boy answered in between sobbing breaths.

&amp;#x200B;

The dad looked straight into the boy’s eyes and in his best comforting voice replied, “My son, be thankful you are black. If you were unlucky, you could have ended up a fucking Hedgehog!”

When he finally got home, he shut the windows, dusted off his piece of fabric, and began seeing into the future again. Right when he was about to get a glimpse of time unseen, the cloth suddenly erupted into flames, causing a small explosion and singeing the man's eyebrows.

Also, cat and mat had different meanings in those days from today, and anyway, the text should be interpreted according to the customs and practices of the period.  

This would lead to an immediate backlash from the Evangelicals. They would make it an essential condition of faith that a real physical, living cat, being a domestic pet of the species Domesticus, and having a whiskered head, a furry body, four legs and a tail, did physically place its whole body on a floor covering, designed for that purpose, and which is on the floor but not of the floor. The expression ""on the floor but not of the floor"" would be explained in a leaflet.  

Meanwhile, the Catholics would have developed the Feast of the Sedentation of the Blessed Cat. This would teach that the cat was white, and majestically reclined on a mat of gold thread before its assumption to the Great Cat Basket of Heaven. This is commemorated by singing the ""Magnificat"" and ""Felix namque"", lighting three candles, and ringing a bell five times.  

This would cause a schism with the Orthodox Church which believes tradition requires Holy Cats Days (as it is colloquially known), to be marked by lighting SIX candles and ringing the bell FOUR times. This would partly be resolved by the Cuckoo Land Declaration recognising the traditional validity of each.  

Eventually the House of Bishops would issue a statement on the Doctrine of the Feline Sedentation. It would explain, traditionally the text describes a domestic feline quadruped superjacent to an unattached covering on a fundamental surface. For determining its salvific and eschatological significations, we follow the heuristic analytical principles adopted in dealing with the Canine Fenestration Question (How much is that doggie in the window?) and the Affirmative Musaceous Paradox (Yes, we have no bananas). And so on, for another 210 pages.  

The General Synod would then commend this report as helpful resource material for clergy to explain to the man in the pew the difficult doctrine of the cat sat on the mat.

Sight unseen, he purchases a large plot of land for very cheap and has the world's most extravagant whorehouse built on the property.  Little did he know that it was built very near the San Andreas fault, an area well known for recurrent earthquakes.  While the house was soundly built, the fence around the property was routinely damaged by the earthquakes.

The only company close by that could fix the fence was a small contractor consisting of just one guy, the owner.  Because he was always busy, he decided to hire a young man to be his apprentice.  The young man asked the owner about the work to which he simply replied, ""I hate that place"".  Sure enough the following week there was a small earthquake, and the contractor was called out to the whorehouse.  The apprentice was advised to just watch the owner do his work.  He was amazed as three of the most beautiful women he had ever seen greeted them at the gate.  The first woman grabbed the owner, dragged him to the bedroom where they had a quickie, and then he grabbed his tools to start working on the fence.  The fence itself was OK, but some of the supporting poles had become loose from their foundation. The owner showed the young man how to reset the poles and fix the fence.  After they finish, the owner says, ""I hate this place.""

Two weeks pass and they get another call from the whorehouse due to another earthquake.  Again the owner asks the apprentice to just watch.  The apprentice is amazed as again there is another beautiful woman that has sex with the owner.  After they finish, they go to repair the fence.  It's the same as before, the fence is OK but some of the poles have become dislodged, which the owner rapidly fixes.  Afterwards the owner simply says, ""I hate this place.""  The next week there is yet another earthquake and another call to the company.  Again they are greeted by yet another beautiful woman who has a quickie with the owner, and the fence is repaired shortly after that.  As they finish the work and are headed back to the work truck, the apprentice has decided he has done enough watching.  He finally asks the owner, ""Why oh why do you hate this place???""

I reluctantly agreed and began by saying, ""As a shy man, this is tough for me to discuss, but here goes. I get erections every day that last more than four hours. This condition causes me a lot of problems and severe embarrassment. I was wondering what you could give me for it?""
The pharmacist said, ""Just a minute, I'll talk to my sister.""
When she returned, she said, ""We discussed it at length and this is the absolute best we can do:
* 1/3 ownership in the store,
* A company pickup truck,
* A king size bed and
* $3,000 a month in living expenses.""",I asked to speak with male pharmacist,6

After a while he sees a duck, points his gun and shoots it. The duck falls to the ground onto some farmland nearby.  The hunter walks over the the farm and sees a farmer holding the dead duck.

""Hey that's my duck!"" says the hunter.

The farmer replies, ""Well, it fell onto my land, so it's my duck.""

""Well, I shot it, so it's my duck"" says the hunter.

The farmer says ""How about we settle this country style?""

""What's country style?"" asks the hunter.

""Well, first I kick you in the nuts, then you kick me in the nuts. And we keep on kicking each other in the nuts until one of us can't take it no more.  Winner gets the duck.""

The hunter thinks about it for a bit and decides to go for it.

So the farmer hauls his leg back and kicks the hunter square in the nuts.  The hunter's eye bug out and he falls to the ground writhing in pain and clutching his swelling ballsack.  After 10 minutes or so the hunter finally recovers and stands up.

""Okay, it's my turn now"" says the hunter.

And the farmer says, ""Nah, keep the duck.""",The Duck Hunter,637

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. 

The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.

The Agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. 

They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout “Cah"", not a single one could shout “motorcycle”",Roadkill on M42,10

She was already rich but within 5 years she was going to take over the company as CEO. Jeff was blown away.

They began to date and, a few months later, Julia put down her expensive glass of wine at dinner and said, ""Jeff, I need to be straight with you: If this relationship is going to last I'm going to have to introduce you to my parents. I won't lie: they're incredibly conservative, ultra-strict, and I haven't told them about you yet."" Jeff replied that he understood her reluctance but, if she wanted to, he would meet them.

The dinner date was set at Julia's parents' huge mansion, but, on the night of, Jeff felt confident and ready. He put on his best suit and showed up right on time. He shook hands with Julia's stern father and followed him into a gorgeous study. Jeff immediately noticed a large scotch collection and struck up a conversation: he and Julia's father talked for almost 20 minutes about distilleries and vintages, agreeing on most opinions.

By then, Julia's mother came in, explaining that their dinner was ready, sous vide pork chops with cous cous and a tangerine flan for dessert. Jeff was, again, right in his wheelhouse, and complimented Julia's mother on her ingredient selections and cooking techniques. She is elated to have someone who knew how to cook so well and, again, the conversation went well.

Sometime into dessert, however, Julia's father asked about how Jeff and Julia met and their relationship. Sticking to Julia's story, Jeff explained that it had only been recently and he had wanted to meet her parents first before agreeing to any sort of relationship. This, too, went over well, but Julia's father pressed him on his background and career, asking about his daily routine. Jeff had planned a little joke at Julia's expense, and replied, ""Well, sir, I'm a morning person, for sure. I'm up and at 'em 6 AM on the dot, ready to work. That's why it's been so strange to meet Julia; her alarm is set for 8:15 and I can't understand how she gets anything done!"" Everyone laughed, even Julia, and her father fondly chided her for being a late riser.

The evening was ending, and Jeff was sure he had made a great first impression on Julia's parents, but, as he was walking Jeff out, Julia's father shook Jeff's hand one last time, leaned in close to his ear, and whispered, ""How do you know what time my only daughter's alarm is set to?""","Jeff was a ne'er-do-well who never had very much money, but one night at a friend's party he met Julia...",0

When I got home, I searched the whole condo top to bottom but did not find anybody.

 Just when I was about to give up, I noticed somebody hanging off the edge of my balcony. I went out on the balcony and tried to pry his fingers loose, but he held on. So, I went back inside, grabbed my hammer and then beat on his fingers until he let go. 

To my surprise, he survived the 12 story fall by landing in some bushes. I then proceeded to go back inside, grabbed my refrigerator, pushed it out onto the balcony and over the side, where it fell on the guy killing him. However, I have a weak heart, and the overexertion killed me.""

St. Peter says, ""What a terrible way to go! You can come on in.""

The second guy says, ""I live on the 13th floor of the Rains Building. This morning I was doing my regular morning exercise out on my condo's balcony when I slipped in some water from last night's rain and fell over the side. 

Miraculously, I managed to grab hold of the balcony of the condo below mine. I screamed for help until I was hoarse, but no one ever came. Finally, in the afternoon, I saw the owner coming out on his balcony and though 'thank, God, help at last' only to have him try to pry my fingers loose. I managed to hold on until he gave up and went back inside.

 To my horror, he came back a few minutes later with a hammer and started pounding on my fingers. I could not hold on any longer and fell the 12 stories to the ground below. Inexplicably, I landed in some bushes and was fine. Just as I was saying a prayer of thanks to God a shadow fell over me. I looked up, and there was a refrigerator coming down at me.""

St. Peter says, ""What a terrible way to go! You can come on in.""

The auditor said, ""Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, Which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I'm not sure the IRS finds that believable.""

""I'm a great gambler, and I can prove it,"" says Grandpa. ""How about a demonstration?""

The auditor thinks for a moment and said, ""Okay. Go ahead.""

Grandpa says, ""I'll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.""

The auditor thinks a moment and says, ""It's a bet.""

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor's jaw drops.

Grandpa says, ""Now, I'll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.""

Now the auditor can tell Grandpa isn't blind, so he takes the bet. Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye.

The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa's attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

""Want to go double or nothing?"" Grandpa asks. ""I'll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.""

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he ends up urinating all over the auditor's desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa's own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

""Are you okay?"" the auditor asks.

""Not really,"" says the attorney. ""This morning, when Grandpa told me he'd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you'd be happy about it!""","The IRS decides to audit Grandpa, and summons him to the IRS office.
