post,6unx67,2qh72,jokes,false,1503130263,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6unx67/its_good_economics/,self.jokes,,"Benny Shapiro worked at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He used to tell his friends that he was the curator, although his primary job was to keep the exhibits clean and polished. One day he happened to be dusting around the Arabian exhibit, and he noticed an ancient urn that needed some cleaning. He got out his dust rag and began polishing. Low and behold, an enormous Genie appeared before him.

""Master,"" the Genie began, ""I am the Genie of the urn. I can grant you three wishes, but there is one condition I will put on you: You must never shave or cut your beard for the rest of your life, or you will be forced to take my place inside the urn forever.""

Benny thought about it for a bit, and decided it was a fair condition for three wishes. So Benny wished for 49% of the total Microsoft stock which was promptly granted. Then he wished for the most beautiful woman in the world as his wife, and low and behold, she was. Finally, he wished for fame and fortune and he instantly became a worldwide celebrity.

Over the years, Benny's beard became longer and longer until it almost reached the floor. As it grew longer, it began to itch. He tried to ignore it, but the itch became more and more irritating, while the memory of the Genie's warning faded.

Finally he decided he had to get rid of the beard and he shaved it off. Instantly he was trapped in the urn, to stay there forever.

The moral of the story: A Benny shaved is a Benny urned.",It's good economics.,8

You have the chocolate ones who are still not doing to good and can just barley afford food and a house. The fruit cherrios are the middle class with okay paying jobs and can afford some treats every once in a while. And the honey nut cherrios are rich as fuck and have really good paying jobs and usually about 7 wifes. So anyway, there was a cherrio who was just a plain cherrio and his ultimate goal was to rise in the ranks of cherrios and become a honey nut cherrio. So he worked and worked and worked until he just barley got enough money and asked his boss for a promotion. His boss says good work and makes him a chocolate cherrio. Now he has a slightly better paying job but is still pretty poor and can just barley get what he needs. So after years and years of more working he finally saves up just enough, and asks his boss for another promotion. His boss at first looks shocked and thinks he stole the money because he gathered it in just a couple years. But a few backround checks and he comes out clear and is promoted to a fruit cherrio. Around this time he has met the love of his life and they are both living in a decent home and are working their asses off still for the one big promotion. And finally after only another 3 years he has worked and saved just enough to become a honey nut cherrio. So he goes to his boss once more and asks for the big promotion. He is so happy for him and not only agrees to his promotion but also says he can have one more thing of his choice. Of course, being the gentlemen he is he decided to ask for his wife to get a promotion too. The boss agrees and now they have a big success. Everyone was so happy for him and proud of his growth that they decided to throw him a party. This was a huge party with millions of cherrios in it and he was having a great time until he got thirsty. So first he stopped in the beer line and it was so long that he couldnt wait that long. So next he went to the milk line and it was full too! But then decided to go to the punch line until he realized, there is no punchline.

With a smile and a nod, the wife agrees and they venture outside and into the alley around the restaurant. Not long afterward, a bike patrol cop rolls past the alleyway and hears the most intense love-making session known to man, the couples' shouts echoing into the street.

For his 12th birthday, his mother decided to take him to a tractor convention and Sam wanted me along for the ride. We drove four hours to get there, and upon our arrival Sam was smitten by a new model on display. He approached the owner and asked politely if he could access the tractor and look around inside it.

The owner refused. Sam asked again, to no avail.

Heartbroken, Sam demanded we leave. The long four hour drive back was in silence. As we entered his bedroom back home, he began tearing down all his posters, binned his bedsheets, threw out his memorabilia. He never spoke of tractors again - except once, several years later.

We were walking together to a bar, when Sam noticed a house on fire, screams emanating from it. He quickly ran at the house, and simply sucked all the fire and smoke out, saving the inhabitants.
I was shocked, and when I replied with how he could have performed such an action, he shrugged and said:

About the time they are crossing the river, a storm comes and blows them out to sea and in the choppy waves they lose both oars but are unharmed.

For 2 days they're stranded at sea, hungry and thirsty when they see something floating on the surface of the water coming toward them.

Wouldn't ya know it, it was a magic lamp.  

So a genie pops out and says they can only have one wish between them.  

While the one Irishman is thinking about what the best wish would be, the other blurts out immediately, ""I wish the whole ocean was made of beer!""  The genie quickly made it so and disappeared into the lamp leaving the two men still stranded.

As the eager Irishman begins cupping beer into his hands and drinking it, the thoughtful Irishman smacked the other on the head and says, ""You idiot!

At night they slip out of their rooms and sneak towards the stairs. They climb up the stairs and make it to the roof. From there they can smell the fresh air, and taste freedom. All they have to do is jump to the next building.

The first man doesn't hesitate. He quickly jumps over and lands safely on the building. He smiles and grins ready to go.

The second man freezes. He looks down the crevice to ally below. The first man looks back and asks ""what's wrong?"". The second man replies ""I can't make it... I'll fall and die!""

The first man says ""look, I got this flashlight here. Why don't you let me shine a beam of light across and you can walk on it over to this building. Then we can be free!?""

Next, he has to get some flowers, so he heads over to the florist and there’s a huge flower line there. He waits forever but eventually gets the flowers.

Then he heads out to rent a limo. Unfortunately, there’s a large limo line at the rental office, but he’s patient and gets the job done.

Finally, the day of the prom comes. The two are dancing happily and his girlfriend is having a great time. When the song is over, she asks him to get her some punch, so he heads over to the punch table and there’s no punchline....... so without trouble he gets her a mug of punch which she happily empties. They enjoy some more.

Now it's well past midnight and they gotta go. So he gives her a ride home. There he learns that her parents are not at home and that she's all available - to him.

He immediately takes her upstairs to her room, rips open his fucking tux, rips open her fucking prom dress and starts to make passionate love to her. 

Suddenly, while he's about to climax, he sees that she's all quiet. Like very quiet.
So he asks her, ""Babe, you liking this?""
There's no reply.
He goes again, ""Babe, you so wanted it, you enjoying? ...am I going hard?""
Again no response.
He wants to ask her again when he realises that...... she's punch drunk.
