After decending the winding road, they encountered an alligator sunbathing, next to him was a pile of cocaine drying.

After months of enduring his foul language and sexual innuendoes in class, the girls one day get together before class and decide, if today, Eddy says anything even remotely sexual or offensive, we will all get up at the same time and walk out in protest.

Class starts and the teacher says: ""OK kids, today's subject will be buildings and construction. Who can tell me how buildings are made?""

The class remains quiet, then little Eddy raises his hand and says ""Madam, I know"".

The teacher says, ""OK Eddy, please explain.""

Eddy: ""Well, first before anything you need a permit from the city for the construction project to begin, that could take months. Once you get the permit, then come the bulldozers to basically dig into the earth to create the foundation. Then, cement is poured into the foundation and pylons are inserted. Around the pylons, the outer structure of the building is made, floors, walls, ceilings.Then comes wiring and plumbing. Next drywall can be installed along with flooring and fixtures. When all is said and done, you still have to get an occupancy permit from the city before you can actually use the building.

The class remains quiet.

The teacher says: WOW Eddy! Bravo, that was amazing, how did you learn all that?

Eddy: For the past many months, just a few doors down from our house, they have been building what I think is a huge whore house, I've watched the whole thing from start to finish.

At that moment, all the girls suddenly get up and start to walk out.

Eddy looks around and says:

post,6y7b3a,2qh72,jokes,false,1504610199,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6y7b3a/the_silver_woman_long/,self.jokes,,"One dark night a Frenchman by the name of Guillaume was hiking through the forest. Enraptured by the natural beauty of the world around him, he paused for a moment, taking in the cool breeze blowing through the trees, the sparkling ceiling of stars, and sighed contentedly. Looking up he saw a bright light fire across the sky.


""A shooting star, incroyable! I must make a wish."" As he thought of his wish, he noticed the 'star' seemed to be a lot closer than he'd initially though. It banked hard towards the ground and a plume of smoke and fire out out from where it landed with an earth-shaking thud.


Guillaume had lived a simple life, albeit a happy one, and had never ventured into danger before, always kept his nose down and minded his own business, yet somehow he was compelled towards the area of impact. He ran through the forest until he came upon what he now saw to be a crash site, not for a meteorite but a large metal object, rounded and pointed to one end, almost like an egg, though now the point was clearly heavily crushed.


Guillaume inched closer, somehow unafraid.


""Hello!? Is anyone there?""


He saw some movement near the tip of the ""egg"" and rushed forward.


A woman lay there, humanoid though clearly not human, with skin of pure silver. There was a large gash in her side and she must have been in immense pain, though her expression was blank, betraying no emotion.


""Mon dieu! are you alright? What happened?""


The alien formulated a number of sounds which sounded much like garbled static before eventually morphing into French.


""Please, I am in need of your aid. I my medical kit was destroyed in the crash. Help...""


The alien passed out.


Guillaume was beginning to panic, he didn't know what to do, but he knew he could not let this woman die. He picked her up and put her on his back, carrying her back to his home. He cleaned her wounds as best he could and patched her up, sitting with her through the early hours of the morning as she remained unconscious.


Finally, around 7.00am she groggily opened her eyes and flicked them around there room, though she did not appear concerned by her change of location.


""Thank heavens you're awake, I was not sure you would make it.""


""Thank you for tending to my injuries, you have my utmost gratitude"".


""My name is Guillaume, and yours?""


""My name does not translate into your language, but my designation is T-Na 528491.""


""I must ask, your wound was severe and you must have been in great pain, yet you made no sound of pain and your features remained impassive, do you not feel pain?""


""My species feels pain, but we must not show emotion. You see, our race is immortal, but past adolescence the chemical imbalance brought on my strong displays of emotion causes our system to break down, leading to death within a day. We can express our emotions verbally, but not manifest them.""


""Surely that must be very trying?""


""Not particularly, we are taught to control our emotions from a young age and so learn to live with it.""


Over the course of the next few weeks while T-Na 528491 - called Tina by Guillaume - recuperated, Guillaume salvaged parts from her craft to contact her people. Tina explained she was part of a first contact expeditionary force and needed to communicate with her people that Earth was safe for them to visit. 


Over the coming months more silver people came and the inhabitants of Earth learned much from them. Both cultures found the relationship mutually beneficial and it brought about the first age of intergalactic exploration for humanity.


Tina lived with Guillaume for many years, each enjoying the others companionship until, many decades later, Guillaume had become sick and old. He lay on his hospital bed with Tina by his side, watching over him, her face still emotionless, though a hint of sadness in her eyes, preparing to say good by. 


""Do you know... what I was doing when you landed on Earth?"" said Guillaume in a weak voice.


""I saw your craft.... going overhead. I thought it was a shooting star... so I made a wish...""


""What did you wish?"" she asked


""I wished to meet someone remarkable. Someone who would change my life forever. I never expected my wish to be granted so quickly... thank you.""


The old man stretched out his hand to the alien and she held it firmly. Despite her centuries of containing and controlling her emotions, the alien was no longer able to bear it. She welled up with tears and wept openly, not caring what this meant for her.


Guillaume was deeply moved and began to weep himself, knowing the consequences of her act of grief. Not knowing what to say, he said the only think he could:


""Don't cry for me argent Tina."" ",The Silver Woman [Long],2

All he can think about is how he has to marry her. He strikes a conversation with her and they hit it off. They leave the bar and as they're walking out she gives him her number, her name was Lela.

They had fallen in love, they tried to see each other almost every day; to the point where they decided to buy a house together. They moved in to a beautiful house, three bedrooms and two bathrooms, right along the coastline shore.

One night the man took Lela out to dinner one night, on a steamboat cruise through the night. It was there that he finally proposed to her, and they got married a month later at a church hill.
Nine months later they had their first child, and decided to name him Luigi. Luigi was their everything, they just knew that as long as they kept him on the right track everything would turn out for the better.

Though unfortunately only two months after, Luigi was stabbed by an american psycho. The police apprehended the murderer, and later told the couple that they've been hunting this man for 15 years, and that his nickname was the ""Baby Stabber"". Though that didn't help that their only son, Luigi, had died.

The man was sad, but knew that his wife was only feeling worse. She loved Luigi, and just wanted to see a great future with him in their lives. So the man decided to take a break from his job as a robotic engineer and make the unthinkable. He built a robotic version of their dead son, Luigi. It took him three months, but he developed a robotic baby, that would be able to grow up to the age of five, after that he'd have to develop a new body for their child. The robot had the exact brain of their deceased baby, Luigi. Though something bothered the man that possibly it wasn't finished, though he knew his wife wasn't feeling emotionally stable and needed a fix now.

So he rushed home and presented the robotic baby Lela. As a result she was horrified, she screamed saying ""that can't replace what's already gone! It's not right!"" They walked out of the room, and the husband calmed her down. He told her, ""that it's not the original, but we both still wanna see a future with our son don't we?"" She decided that they would keep the robot child and see how it would turn out.

Though the robotic baby didn't take kindly to the woman's little burst, in fact it felt angered. The robotic baby quickly went into a terminator state, it's arms became shotguns(which looked kinda weird on a tiny robot baby btw). It began to hover in the air, and it shot Lela without any signs of remorse. She collapsed and fell to the floor bleeding out to death. It stared at the man and yelled in an ominous deep voice,
""WHY DID YOU CREATE ME? I'M A MONSTER!""

It shot the man once in the leg, crippling him. The man replied, ""I created you because we loved you and couldn't miss a day without you!""

The baby was confused, ""Love?""
*The baby pointed it's shotgun at the man*
""What is love?""

""Baby don't hurt me, no more.""","A man walks into a bar, at night",20

post,6y564v,2qh72,jokes,false,1504579865,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6y564v/a_businessman/,self.jokes,,"There was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else.

So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, the old man ""Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except..."" and he stopped.""

""Except what?""

""Nothing, nothing.""

""C'mon, tell me ! I need something!""

""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'""

""So what's up with this voodoo dick?"" the businessman asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box, carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said ""Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!""

""Ahh, but you haven't seen what it'll do yet.""

He pointed to a door and said ""Voodoo dick, the door.""

The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said

""Voodoo dick, get back in your box!""

The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more.

Businessman ""I'll take it!""

The old man resisted, saying ""it wasn't for sale"", but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say...

""Voodoo dick, my pussy.""

He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.

After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before.

After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said:

""Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!""

post,6y53xx,2qh72,jokes,false,1504579230,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6y53xx/timely_hurricane_advice/,self.jokes,,"All week you're going to turn on the TV and see a weather person pointing to some radar blob out in the Atlantic and making two basic meteorological points:

(1) There is no need to panic.
(2) We could all be killed.

Yes, hurricane season is an exciting time to be in South Carolina. If you're new to the area, you're probably wondering what you need to do to prepare for the possibility that we'll get hit by ""the big one.""
Based on experience, we recommend that you follow this simple three-step hurricane preparedness plan:

STEP 1. Buy enough food, beer, and bottled water to last your family for at least three days.
STEP 2. Put these supplies into your car.
STEP 3. Drive to Nebraska and remain there until Halloween.

Unfortunately, statistics show that most people will not follow this sensible plan. Most people will foolishly stay here in South Carolina.
We'll start with one of the most important hurricane preparedness items:

HOMEOWNERS' INSURANCE: If you own a home, you must have hurricane insurance.
Fortunately, this insurance is cheap and easy to get, as long as your home meets two basic requirements:
(1) It is reasonably well-built, and
(2) It is located in Nebraska.
Unfortunately, if your home is located in South Carolina, or any other area that might actually be hit by a hurricane, most insurance companies would prefer not to sell you hurricane insurance, because then they might be required to pay YOU money, and that is certainly not why they got into the insurance business in the first place. So you'll have to scrounge around for an insurance company, which will charge you an annual premium roughly equal to the replacement value of your house. At any moment, this company can drop you like used dental floss. Since Hurricane George, I have had an estimated 27 different home-insurance companies.
This week, I'm covered by the Bob and Big Stan Insurance Company, under a policy which states that, in addition to my premium, Bob and Big Stan are entitled, on demand, to my kidneys.

SHUTTERS: Your house should have hurricane shutters on all the windows, all the doors, and -- if it's a major hurricane -- all the toilets. There are several types of shutters, with advantages and disadvantages:
Plywood shutters: The advantage is that, because you make them yourself, they're cheap. The disadvantage is that, because you make them yourself, they will fall off.
Sheet-metal shutters: The advantage is that these work well, once you get them all up. The disadvantage is that once you get them all up, your hands will be useless bleeding stumps, and it will be December.
Roll-down shutters: The advantages are that they're very easy to use, and will definitely protect your house. The disadvantage is that you will have to sell your house to pay for them.
Hurricane-proof windows: These are the newest wrinkle in hurricane protection: They look like ordinary windows, but they can withstand hurricane winds! You can be sure of this, because the salesman says so. He lives in Nebraska.
Hurricane Proofing Your Property: As the hurricane approaches, check your yard for movable objects like barbecue grills, planters, patio furniture, visiting relatives, etc.. You should, as a precaution, throw these items into your swimming pool (if you don't have a swimming pool, you should have one built immediately). Otherwise, the hurricane winds will turn these objects into deadly missiles.

EVACUATION ROUTE: If you live in a low-lying area, you should have an evacuation route planned out. (To determine whether you live in a low-lying area, look at your driver's license; if it says ""South Carolina,"" you live in a low-lying area.) The purpose of having an evacuation route is to avoid being trapped in your home when a major storm hits.
Instead, you will be trapped in a gigantic traffic jam several miles from your home, along with two hundred thousand other evacuees. So, as a bonus, you will not be lonely.

HURRICANE SUPPLIES: If you don't evacuate, you will need a mess of supplies.
Do not buy them now! South Carolina tradition requires that you wait until the last possible minute, then go to the supermarket and get into vicious fights with strangers over who gets the last can of SPAM.
In addition to food and water, you will need the following supplies:
23 flashlights and at least $167 worth of batteries that turn out, when the power goes off, to be the wrong size for the flashlights.
Bleach. (No, I don't know what the bleach is for. NOBODY knows what the bleach is for, but it's traditional, so GET some!)
A 55-gallon drum of underarm deodorant.
A big knife that you can strap to your leg. (This will be useless in a hurricane, but it looks cool.)
A large quantity of raw chicken, to placate the alligators. (Ask anybody who went through Hugo. After the hurricane, there WILL be irate alligators.)
$35,000 in cash or diamonds so that, after the hurricane passes, you can buy a generator from a man with no discernible teeth.
Of course these are just basic precautions. As the hurricane draws near, it is vitally important that you keep abreast of the situation by turning on your television and watching TV reporters in rain slickers stand right next to the ocean and tell you over and over how vitally important it is for everybody to stay away from the ocean.
Good luck, and remember: It's great living in Paradise.

(Edit: substitute the hurricane-prone state of your choice for S Carolina. Or substitute whatever natural disaster applies to your area that your insurance company tries to get out of paying for. )",Timely hurricane advice,2

The man got a running start, jumped up, wrapped his legs around the bell and smashed it with his face. 

It was the most beautiful the bell had ever sounded, so Quasi asked him for another go! Unfortunately, the second time, the man knocked himself out and fell down the tower. 

When the police came, they said ""Quasimodo do you know this man?"" 

He said ""I don't know him but his face rings a bell""! 

(Part 2)

So, Quasi still really wanted to go on this date with Esmeralda so he put another ad in the paper. Not long afterward, the doorbell rang. To Quasis surprise, the man looked exactly like the last! It turns out, the two men were twins, and he rang the bell just the same way that the first one did. 

Quasimodo needed to have a test ring so up the tower they went. This man knocked himself out on the first try, fell down the bell tower, and died. 

When the police came and asked Quasimodo if he knew the man, he replied ""don't know him, but he's a dead ringer for his brother"".

They go to heaven. At the pearly gates they are met by St. Peter. ""There's my favorite dead guys,"" he says. ""Look, there's only one rule here. Don't step on a duck."" The gates open to reveal every inch apparently covered in ducks. 

""What the hell,"" one of the men asks. ""We don't use that language here,"" responds Peter. ""Look, if you step on a duck, you're punished. God has a thing for ducks.""

""Well what happens if we do?""

""Well, you're chained to the most unattractive person we can find up here. Forever. Yeah. God really likes his ducks.""

The men stare out at the sea of undulating ducks in fear. They can see a few people wandering around cautiously. The first man, always the cocky of the trio, decides to go first. ""This won't be a problem. If those ducks know what's good for them they'll get out of the way.""

The man takes one step and immediately steps on a duck. The duck lets out a mighty un-echoing quack and without a moments notice, two angels appear on either side of him, attach heavy shackles to his arms and legs, and fly him away deeper into Heaven. 

The second man say's ""Oh he stepped? What an idiot!"" The man begins to shuffle-walk his way through the duck sea and before long trips and falls on at least a dozen ducks. The quacks don't resonate, instead calling angels to drag the man away in shackles.

The third man, always the smarter of the trio, watches for a while. He looks around and see's people being flown left and right. Clearly this is tough. But why did his friend fall? He takes a close look and realizes the ducks are walking like they're on uneven ground. ""That must be why my friend tripped,"" he reasons. ""I'll just take baby steps to avoid the same mistake.""

He shuffle-steps his way through the gates and immediately see's two angels fly a beautiful woman directly to him and chain the pair together. ""I don't know what I did to deserve this,"" exclaims the man. ""I do,"" says the woman sadly.

""I stepped on a duck.""",One I've never heard outside family reunions.,12

They had an advanced civilization, religion, and a massive capital city. The city was called Chih-when, and it was the power base of the emperor, who was thought to be a god like being. And once a year, as religion dictated, all of the citizens of Chih-when packed some belongings and made a pilgrimage to where the gods were thought to have originally descended from. This was similar to the Muslim Hajj, with a few exceptions: there was no massive stone, and there was a lot of representing symbolism. The Hi-Xen religion celebrated the union of male and female, and there was a lot of such ""unions"" made at the months before the ""Hajj"", as it was a sacred place to be born. The emperor's census takers estimated about 1.5 children would be born in a few months to each couple. However, this varied wildly, and in a city of millions, the result was disproportionate and the census inaccurate.

Eventually, the census takers learned their lesson: don't count your Chih-whens before they Hajj.","In ancient China, a group known as the Hi-Xen",1

Well, it was the funniest joke I'd ever heard, but it was  told to me during night of heavy drinking, so I couldn't remember it afterwards for the life of me. Maybe it was just the alcohol that made it so uproarious, but I couldn't be sure until I found the joke. I knew that I would recognize it when I heard it or saw it again. So I began my quest. I Googled ""jokes about film reels"" - shockingly, it hadn't been posted to /r/jokes, or anywhere else on the internet. So I scoured every joke book in every library in the country, looking for the joke about the film reel. But still I found nothing. After the 9,327th joke book, I gave up.

But then, just this morning, somebody knocked at my door, and I opened it to find a package there. I brought the package inside and opened it up - it was a joke book, and one I hadn't read before! It came with a letter: ""*This should have what you're looking for.*""

I didn't know who had sent this - must have been God or something - but I began desperately searching through the book, trying to find the joke about the film reel. I read through every section, absorbing numerous puns, knock-knock jokes, and other bits of humour at an impressive speed. But my long-sought-after masterpiece was nowhere to be found. I wept, and contemplated suicide. I turned to the table to contents, looking to see if I had missed a section. The joke was there, at the top of the page.

* **George** - the leader of a religion you like, or at least tolerate; or Neil DeGrasse Tyson.
* **Bob** - the leader of a religion you don't particularly like, or just someone that you think has wronged their followers.

=====

One day, Ted, George and Bob were out fishing together in a boat in the middle of a lake. 

Suddenly, Ted stands up, declares he has forgotten his lunch, hops out of the boat, and runs across the water to their cars on the shore. There, he grabs his lunch out of his car, runs back across the water and into the boat, acting like it was no big deal.

That reminds George that he forgot his cell phone in the car. After confirming with the others that they had cell reception, he hops out of the boat and runs across water to the cars on the shore. He grabs his phone from his car and runs back across the water to the boat.

Upon seeing this, Bob thinks to himself​, _If these two schlumps can walk on water, certainly so can I? I mean, I have a huge arena where tens of thousands of people attend every week to hear my sermons. I have millions more that tune to watch it on TV. I have a $10 million home for crying out loud! If anyone can walk on water, it'd be me._

Thinking quickly, Bob makes up an excuse to have to go back to his car on the shore: ""I forgot my lucky jewel-encrusted crucifix in my car. Can't catch fish without that!"" Joel jumps from the boat and sinks to the bottom of the lake.

Smiling, George says to Ted, ""Think we should have told him about the rocks just below the surface?""

With a puzzled look on his face, Ted says, ""What rocks?""",3 religious leaders were fishing,5

His bar began construction on a new building on the same street as one of the town churches (one of twelve) to increase their business. The local Baptist church among other god fearing folk of course were shocked and took this as a blasphemy and condemned the bar owner for his sins. They started a campaign to block the bar from opening with petitions and prayers that such disgrace and sin in the eyes of the lord must be punished. Prayers were had to stop the unholy businessman and his mockery of god. Work progressed right up till the week before opening when lightning struck the bar and it burned to the ground.

The whole town church folk were rather smug in their outlook after that and satisfied, until the bar owner decided to sue the church on the grounds that the church was ultimately responsible for the demise of his building.

In court the church people vehemently denied all responsibility or any connection to the building’s demise. They declared in front of the judge that they did not have anything to do with it and they are not liable in any way for this.

The judge looked over the paperwork and said at the hearing, ""Okay, I don’t know right now how I’m going to decide this, but it appears to me, that we have a bar owner who believes in the power of prayer, and an entire church congregation that does not.’

**EDIT:** Changed the church from Baptist to Catholic since it was requested :P


**EDIT 2:** Changed it back since apparently Catholics are alcoholics. Go Baptists again :)


**EDIT 3:** It seems that the story isn't believable since there aren't enough churches (so one is not enough) and mad church people, so I changed it...

that would increase our labidos. She said it would take about a week of daily doses before it would reach full effect. We both felt stirrings after a few days but we decided to wait the full 7 days.

And then it happened.

As she reached down to get the milk, my wife looked at me over her shoulder and slyly winked while she wiggled her ass. That's all the encouragement I needed! I threw her sundress up, dropped my pants to my ankles, and entered her in
one thrust! She moaned my name as I held her waist and thrust in and out of her while she pushed back to meet me. Lost in our lust, we engaged in butt-slapping, hot monkey love; yelling the filthiest things until we came together and collapsed on the floor. 

Smothering each other in kisses, we spooned until finally rising on shaky legs, we composed ourselves and hugged.

We were back! It was all we'd hoped for and more!

The wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car.

Unable to stand the embarrassment, she dutifully stepped forward, quickly put her hand UP his shorts, 
and tucked everything back into place. She then took a deep breath and stood up boldly to face the crowd.

Fed up with this, he headed on over to his neighbor and asked him, “My grass smells weird and the cows won't eat it. Do you know anything about this?”
Perplexed, Phil walks over to his yard and sniffs the grass and sure enough it smells like chocolate. 
They both knew where they had to go to get an answer. After driving for a few hours, they made it to Dave’s house, a biologist and a mutual friend of theirs. When he heard about the problem, he instantly knew the source. “It's the Toller Ants,” he explained, “They are all white except for their feet. The colors of their feet can have every color as a possibility, and each color has a different effect. Your ants have black feet, which can make it smell like chocolate.”

A husband had to leave his wife for 3 months while he attended business in Africa. To prevent her loneliness and to lower the temptations of her being unfaithful he went to the local sex shop and asked the lady at the counter what the best product she had to offer was. The woman pointed at the $400 sex doll in the corner and asked the man, ""Will that do?"" Not wanting his wife to think of the sex doll as another man, the husband shook his head and asked for another suggestion. The counter clerk pointed at the back wall where a rack of dragon dildos hung, to which the man replied that he had plenty of those at home and was looking for something a little more special. 

Looking partially defeated, the counter clerk put her hand to her forehead and thought for a while before removing her hand and saying, ""We have one other option but I really wanted it for myself. It's one of a kind."" The man, intrigued, says ""Let me see it."" The clerk pulls out a antiquated box inlaid with gems along its side. She opens it and pulls out a rather normal looking dildo and turns to the man, who is obviously disappointed. The clerk sees this and announces, ""This is not just any old dildo. It's a magic dildo. It will fill your wife with pleasure once she says the words, 'Magic Dildo,' followed by whatever she hole she desires to put it in. The magic dildo will then fly up straight into her, filling her with an orgasm like she's never had before. She'll be plenty busy with it."" The husband looks skeptical, so the clerk decides to display the dildo's powers for him. Holding the dildo in her hand, she confidently states ""Magic dildo, my pussy."" Upon which the dildo soars from her palm to her vagina, making her immediately open her mouth wide in pants and intensity. After about ten minutes of this, she seems satisfied and says, ""Magic dildo, the box."" Making the dildo fly back to a rest. Impressed, the man rushes home to give the dildo to his wife. 

A week after her husband left the wife decided to give the magic dildo a try. She left it in the garage and then went up into her bed and said, ""Magic dildo, my pussy."" Instantly it appeared where it was called and satisfied the wife. The wife was very excited about her magic dildo and started to use it every where. She called to it at work when no one was looking, in the wooded part of the park, at the movie theater, when she was dancing, everywhere. No matter where she was it would appear and make her squirm with pleasure.

One day on her way to work the wife hit bad traffic. She looked up ahead and saw there was an accident and realized it would be a while and decided to call the magic dildo. The wife was feeling really confident and called out ""Magic dildo, my pussy."" She became overwhelmed and hit the accelerator slamming into the car in front of her. As it turned out that car was a cop.

The cop came up to the car seeing the woman squirming and suspected she was on drugs.

""Get out of the car now and put your hands on the hood!"" The wife tried to comply but ended up just falling to the pavement. The officer was quite alright and asked the wife what she was on. The wife told him ""Officer I'm not on any drugs, my husband gave me a magic dildo and its causing me to lose control!""

The officer, not buying it, simply replied ""Magic dildo, my ass.""",Magic Dildo,608

She responded that she indeed had a .45 automatic in her glove box.

Something—body language, or the way she said it—made me want to ask if she had any other firearms. She did admit to also having a 9mm Glock in her center console. Now I had to ask one more time if that was all.

She responded once again that she did have just one more, a .38 special in her purse. I then asked her what was she so afraid of.

Running through the TSA, Nick from New York had no trouble getting through it. But when his friend stepped through the metal detector, it went off. The TSA officer told him to take his jacket off and go back through. Again, the metal detector went off. He was asked to take off his pants, and then his shirt, and then finally everything, but the metal detector still went off. Finally, the TSA officers let him through. They ran onto the plane,  just barely getting on before the doors closed. Back at the TSA, two officers were talking about the situation. One asked the other why he let Nick through, and he said, ""I saw on the monitor that there was actually a pair of keys inside of that Nick guy. He must have swallowed them somehow.

The fisherman says he does not have money to pay, so instead he offers a trade-- if he can get the bartender to laugh at his joke, then the bartender should provide a drink for free. The bartender, a smug, old pirate of a man accepts. After all, he is a moderator of /r/jokes, so he has become very accustomed to not laughing.

The fisherman begins his tale. ""Years ago, I set out on a whaling expedition, when a fellow sailor told me about the mystical golden fishing rod.""
""Let me stop you right there"" says the bartender. I can see where this is going. Golden rod. This is a sex joke. I've heard it before.""
""No. It's not a sex joke"" says the fisherman.
The bartender, fascinated, realizes that this may actually be OC.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""There once was a mystical golden fishing rod that was said to be so powerful that anyone using it could catch any fish.""
""Wait a minute"" says the bartender. ""I think you're in the wrong place. This sounds like the tale of Darth Plagueis. You want /r/prequelmemes down the street"".
""No. It's not a prequel meme"" says the fisherman.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""One day, a little boy found the rod and used it to catch a lion fish. Neptune, god of the sea appeared. He was furious because the lion fish was his best friend.
In retaliation, Neptune broke the rod into pieces, separating the rod and the reel.
The little boy said 'Now I am sad'.
""Oh, come on!"" said the bartender. ""Hey, Sad. I'm neptune! You want /r/dadjokes. Don't waste my time"".
""No. It's not a dadjoke"" says the fisherman.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""The boy took the pieces home, but they never worked again.
Eventually, the rod was sold at a flea market, and the reel became the subject of many jokes.""
The fisherman then asks ""So, what did you think?""
The bartender, confused, looks up. ""What? That's it?""
The fisherman nods.
The bartender, now, is very confused. It's OC, sure, but it doesn't make any sense.

He scratches his head and asks a question ""What do you mean about the reel becoming the subject of many jokes?""
The fisherman says ""I can't answer that here"".
The bartender asks ""Why not?""

The fisherman replies ""The reel joke is always in the comments""",A fisherman walks into /r/jokes where he finds a bartender.,35

Mex was offered a full ride scholarship to Yale, and instantly fit in. He was never late to any of his classes, and always studied for absolutely everything. He graduated with a Bachelor's in Engineering and got a home in Southern Texas.

He was driving home from a job interview when we noticed a group of construction workers at a house trying to put up a wall. He slowed down and rolled down his window. ""You fellas need any help?""

Mex spent the next few hours helping them with a section of the house. He told them how he could down and help them out from time to time. They told him that'd be awesome, and he started going back to the site a few days every week. They all became great friends.

A few weeks later, the big boss of the project, Trevor Shump, came to check up. Everyone called him *the Trump*, because he was a nasty, grumpy businessman. They were all on break, when Trevor stormed in. ""Who the hell is that?""

""This?"" One of the workers said. ""This is Mex. He went to college for engineering, and has been helping us out for a few--""

“It’s 100 rupees per kilo, Sir,” said the boy.

The customer just glanced at the second boy and realized that he was also selling the same variety of fish. Hoping to get a better bargain from him, he moved on to him and enquired his price. Without any hesitation the second boy said, “It’s just 500 rupees per kilo.”

“ What ! 500 rupees per kilo ! You are demanding 5 times the price of what the other fellow is demanding, and that too for the same kind of fish. It’s atrocious !”

“ No, it’s not the same kind of fish. It might appear so, but it is a special kind of fish.”

“What’s so special about it?”, the customer became curious.

“ It’s an intelligent fish and makes one who eats it regularly intelligent, too. That’s why it’s costlier than the other fish.”

“ I see, then it’s worth buying. Let me try it.”

He bought a kilo of the fish, paying the hefty price of 500 rupees. He bought the fish regularly for the next six days at that exorbitant price with the fond hope of improving his intelligence. Did it improves his intelligence ? Unfortunately, no. At the end of the week, he realised that he had been taken for a ride by that smart alec fish-monger. Furious at being cheated like that, he wanted to settle scores with that fellow. The next day, he went straight to that boy and demanded to know whether he still sold that “""intelligent fish” ?

“Of course, yes,” replied that unsuspecting guy.

“You bloody liar. Your “intelligent fish” is a big hoax. I have been eating it for the past 7 days, but not a speck of improvement in my intelligence. You have cheated me. Return my money, or else I’ll call the police now.”

Without batting an eyelid, the young rogue said,” Look, when I said it is an “intelligent fish”, a week ago, you didn't object to it. Now, within a week, you have become intelligent enough to find out that it can’t be an intelligent fish. Very good improvement. Isn’t it? Keep taking more of it, and you’ll become even more intelligent!”",Two boys were selling fish in the marketplace.,107

Intrigued and bemused by this item, he decides to buy it on a whim.

The cashier looks at him with raised eyebrows as he approaches, and says ""now, this is an object with a story behind it. Wanna hear it?""

""Nah, I don't wanna hear some bullshit legend, just gimme the rat.""

As the man is walking home, he noticed a rat peek out from beside a dumpster and start trailing behind him a bit. Thinking nothing of it, he continues.

A few minutes pass and he looks back to see a couple more rats also following. Finding that odd but not being concerned, he goes back to walking.

A few more minutes pass and he actually hears the rats before he turns around. When he does there are at least ten rats following him, and they seem to be moving a little faster...

A little freaked out, the man starts half-jogging and is shocked as the rats pick up speed after him! More start coming out from all around, from side alleys and trash cans and gutters, all pounding after him as he breaks into a panicked sprint. A huge, seething mass of rats is now following him, and they close in swiftly as he aims for a dock overlooking the city river. They have almost reached his ankles when he reaches the end of the dock and flings the bag containing the bronze rat as far as he can into the water. He is nearly knocked in himself as the wave of rats thunders past him and pours into the water after the bronze rat. Under the water he can see them all swimming after it as it sinks fast to the hundred-foot depth of the river. Not a single rat came back up.

After standing in a daze for a long while, the man runs back to the antique store as fast as he can. The cashier smirks as he enters and says ""Ah, they always do come back for the story...""

The man says ""Fuck your story! I want a bronze lawyer!""",A man visits an antique store...,0

After a few minutes he calls into the cabin, ""I'll be right back, I'm gonna scout the premises"" then leaving with the door still ajar.

He isn't walking for more than a few steps before he see's a prize bull, a fully grown brown bear resting a few hundred feet away from the front face of the cabin, without thinking he quickly aims and takes the shot. 

After a few minutes on the pot, the Operations manager hears a gunshot, a scream, a *thud* and then a roar as he watches a fully grown grizzly ploughs through the wide open front door of the cabin. The bear is looking confused as it looks out at the sales manager who scrambled to his feet and closed the door on the bear which had just barreled over his body laying on the ground.

The Operations Manager sat there there in shock with his pants around his ankles as he hears his sales manager shout from outside ,""Hey boss! You skin this one, I'll go fetch the next!""
