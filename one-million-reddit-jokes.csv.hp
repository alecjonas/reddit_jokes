“I have access to the blood bank at the hospital. If I fudge a few numbers I can sneak some out to help keep you fed, without hurting anyone”

The vampire thanks him and takes him up on his gracious offer. The arrangement works well for a few months, with the doctor sneaking some of the nearly-expired blood from the bank. He is clever enough not to get caught, but soon the vampire returns with a request. 

“I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, I really do. But the blood you’ve provided, it isn’t...the freshest. Do you think you could get some of the fresher samples for me? It would taste so much better...”

The doctor is hesitant, but agrees to try. He realizes that if he’s careful, he can swap the samples around without anyone noticing and get the fresh blood for his friend. This arrangement goes on quite well for some time, until one day the doctor notices that a young comatose woman in his care has some suspicious wounds on her neck-they look exactly like bite marks.

The doctor decides to let it go, but over time he notices the same bite marks on others during his rounds. He finally decides that it cannot go on any longer, and that he must confront the vampire. He calls his friend and they meet at the doctors house. After some small talk, the doctor finally decides he cannot wait any longer.

“We’ve been friends a long time,” he starts. “And you know I want what’s best for you. I was fine helping you with the old blood. I didn’t even mind getting you the fresher stuff...but now, you’re beginning to try my patients.”","A doctor has a friend, who one day admits he has recently become a vampire...",172

One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  
  
About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.""  
  
The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""  
  
The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""  
  
The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?""  
  
The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  
  
It's unbelievable.  
  
The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.""  
  
The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.""","4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it.",42051

Next on your list is frozen peas. Go to the store and pick up a bag of frozen peas. I would recommend spending the extra money on the nicer peas because an elephant never forgets and will probably know the difference.  
With your frozen peas in hand, head back to your hole and begin placing the peas one by one around its edge.  
Once you're satisfied with the elephant trap, find a nearby bush to hide in and the waiting begins.  
Eventually, the elephant won't be able to resist the urge to take a pea, and when he does, you kick him in the ash hole.",How to catch an elephant.,41

The shaman turns to the jinn and says,
""I bet my soul against your eternal servitude, that I can raise more corpses freshly dead within the past 10 years, than you can steal the souls of the living by granting their wishes.""

The jinn ponders on the wager, but before he can agree, the gargoyle says,
""Wait a minute! How are you to know how many fresh Corpses are in this graveyard? The only bear solution is for you to wish that both of you have the knowledge of how many have been buried Within the past decade.""

The shaman thinks about the request, and nods his head. He wishes that both he and the jinn have the exact number of newer human carcasses which have been planted in the last 3,670 days.
The jinn inhales and all of a sudden the number ""162"" pops into his and the shaman's minds.

The shaman repeats his question,
""I bet my soul against your eternal servitude, that I can raise more of the 162 corpses freshly dead within the past 10 years, than you can steal the souls of 162 living by granting their wishes.""

Thinking this is more than fair, the jinn is just about to shake on it when the gargoyle interrupts again:
""Hold up."" He throws his claws in the air, ""How are you going to know which graves are which without walking from one to another. That's going to take all night! All the genie has to do is find 162 people and his side is done; he can be finished in moments by simply going to Wall Street or Vegas. It'd only be fair if you knew which gravesites to go to and be able to get to each within seconds.""

The shaman and the jinn both agree that tge gargoyle was right. So the shaman makes a wish:
""Okay. I wish that I could travel instantaneously to only the graves of the 162 decade-old dead bodies in this Cemetery.""

The jinn inhales once more, and the shaman begins teleporting between different sites in the burial ground. He teleports back to the others and asks his question one last time.

Both the jinn and the shaman know this bargain is 100% Fair. But just in case, they look back at the gargoyle,. He shrugs his shoulders, confirming the unbiased.

But, the shaman thinks he's slick. He looks back at the jinn, and makes another wish:
"" I wish that the 162 freshly dead, 10 years and newer, would raise from their plots.""

The jinn inhales one final time; as the 162 human remains rose from their graves, so the soul of the shaman is sucked into the nostrils of the demonic genie: as those were the dark priest's three wishes.

The jinn turns to the gargoyle, who seems as relaxed as he ever had, and says:
""Not that I'm complaining, but why were you so concerned about the fairness of the shaman's wager?""

The statued beast cocks an eye toward the inquirer and replies,
""I have no idea. I'm totally stoned""","A Gargoyle, A Jinn, and A Dark Shaman are hanging out in a cemetery...",6

Now the night is ruined because Brandon is obsessed. He’s like, “That ex-boyfriend is going to come back for you, he knows where you live!”

So after dinner he drives her home, she lives in one of those big apartment buildings by the freeway and he walks her to her door.

But he forgets to lock the car, and leaves the windows down.

He kisses her goodnight, but things are kind of weird. Then he gets back in his car and starts to drive away. But when he glances in his rear view mirror his blood turns cold. Guess what’s in the back seat?

The study, which cost an estimated $17 Million, was started in 1983 when all the rats in a laboratory test control group contracted cancer.

Spokesperson John Smith explained: ""We were running a test on the possible link between excess popcorn intake and increased incidence of colon cancer. The test group consisted of twenty rats who were force fed three quarts (roughly one and a half times their body weight) of popcorn daily, a perfectly reasonable amount. The control group consisted of twenty rats who lived in cages carefully shielded from all known carcinogens. To our surprise, all twenty control rats developed cancer within six months.""

Mr. Smith went on to say: ""We had always had some trouble with control rats contracting cancer. But as long as more of the rats in the test group than the control group got cancer, we were able to feel pretty good about condemning whatever we were testing at the time.""

Mr Smith was then questioned about the possibility of test results being invalid if any of the control rats developed cancer. He responded: ""Yeah, we had an scientist at the lab ask that once. We had to let him go though when we found out he was a member of the Audubon Society; you know, conflict of interest. He was a real trouble maker, always asking questions like: 'Wouldn't eating that much popcorn give anyone cancer?' We just didn't need that kind of a negative influence. The last thing you want in a research lab is someone asking a lot of fool questions.""

When asked if these results would change any previous findings Mr. Smith replied: ""Why yes. This could blow our whole gig. I mean, if it's been the cages all along, this could mean that things like asbestos, smoking, even radiation are perfectly harmless!""

Mr Smith continued: ""This could change everything! We may be forced to recall all our previous findings at a cost of millions of dollars. This says nothing of the possible lawsuits from individuals who contracted cancer while spending time in prison, or zoo workers forced to spend extended periods inside the animal's cages.""

When asked why the study cost seventeen million dollars, Mr Smith responded: ""Oh, you know how it goes; a little here, a little there. Besides, do you have any idea how expensive it is to provide food and living conditions for rats that doesn't expose them to any of the things we have determined to cause cancer? In fact right now we're in the middle of a two year study that may link breathing with lung cancer. You think the cost is bad now, just wait till we are forced to prevent the control rats from breathing so as not to invalidate the results by having more of the control rats get cancer than test rats.""

He arrives, sits down at the bar, and orders some whiskey. A handful of drinks in, he tells the bartender his story, and asks him what he needs to do to become an Alaskan.

“Okay pal, to become an Alaskan, you need to do two things. First thing you need to do is shoot a polar bear. Then you gotta screw an Eskimo.”

The former cowboy downs his last bit of whiskey, and says “That’s no problem at all!” and rushes out the door.

Because of their hectic schedules, it was difficult for the couple to coordinate their travel plans. So the husband left Minnesota and flew to Florida on Thursday, while his wife planned to fly down the following day.

The husband checked into the hotel. There was a computer in his room, so he decided to send an email to his wife. However, he accidentally left out one letter of her email address, and sent the email without realizing his error.

Meanwhile, somewhere in Houston, a widow had just returned home from her husband’s funeral. He was a Baptist minister who was called home to glory following a heart attack.

The widow decided to check her email, expecting condolence messages from family and friends.

But after reading her very first email, she screamed and fainted.

The widow’s son rushed into the room, found his mother on the floor, and saw the computer screen which read:

*To: My Loving Wife*

*Subject: I’ve Arrived*

*Date: 21 February 2018* 

*I know you’re surprised to hear from me. They have computers here now and you are allowed to send emails to your loved ones. I’ve just arrived and have been checked in.*

""On behalf of all those who don't have access to clean water,"" says the redhead, tossing the coin into the well, ""I wish that everyone in the world could have something to drink.""

The brunette nods appreciatively. ""I like that! Very altruistic. I think I'll wish for something a little more concrete, though…"" She gets out a coin and tosses it in after the redhead's. ""I wish that the three of us knew what we can do to help those who need something to drink.""

The blonde perks up. ""That's incredible!"" she says. ""I've just figured out what I want to wish for!"" She reaches into her purse and pulls out a coin. ""I wish that this well was small enough that I could pick it up and hold it.""

As she tosses the coin into the well, the other two look at her with baffled expressions. But then, *poof!* In a flash of light, the well is transformed! It's become a dollhouse-sized replica of itself, with a tiny bucket and crank. The blonde picks it up.

""Whoa,"" says the brunette, looking to the redhead. ""Do you suppose our wishes came true too?""

""Of course they did!"" the blonde cries. She begins moving the well vigorously through the air, back and forth.

""How are you so sure?"" the redhead asks. ""And also, what are you doing?""

The blonde, grinning, tosses the little well aside and reaches into her purse. ""Look!"" she says, pulling out a plastic bottle of what looks like a fruit smoothie. She unscrews the top and takes a drink. ""If it weren't for you two,"" the blonde says, holding up the bottle, ""I'd never have known how to open this. See? It says 'shake well before opening'.""","A blonde, a brunette, and a redhead visit an old wishing well.",6

Hillary Clinton goes to a gifted-student primary school in New York to talk about the world. After her talk she offers question time.

One little boy puts up his hand. Hillary asks him what his name is. ""Kenneth,"" he says.

""And what is your question, Kenneth?"" she asks.

""I have three questions,"" he says.  
""First -- whatever happened in Benghazi?  
""Second -- why would you run for president if you are not capable of handling two e-mail accounts?  
""And, third -- whatever happened to the missing six billion dollars while you were Secretary of State?""

Just then the bell rings for recess. Hillary informs the kiddies that they will continue after recess.

When they resume Hillary says, ""Okay, where were we? Oh, that's right, question time.

A different boy -- little Johnny -- puts his hand up.

They drive their wagon all the way into Time Square because they want to find a hotel with a room overlooking all of the cool sights they have never seen. The husband drops his wife and kids off at the front door of a super fancy hotel and he drives off to go look for a parking spot.

His wife is enamored with everything she is experiencing. There are blinking lights, and giant advertisements and so many sounds she has never heard. She eventually heads toward the hotel lobby and is startled by the doors that open automatically as soon as she walks near.

In the lobby she notices there are so many machines that do seemingly magical things! She sees a few people approach a machine, put a cup underneath and press a button, and it fills the cup with steaming hot coffee. She thinks to herself, ‘I’ve gotta try this.’ So she walks up to the machine, inserts a cup, and presses the button. Sure enough, there’s hot delicious coffee.

She also sees a machine where you put in a few quarters and it gives you a pre-packaged snack or soda. She is in awe, so she tries it. After a few dollars and pressing a few buttons, she has a coke and a bag of cookies. She can’t believe how awesome this place is! To her, it seems like they have a machine that can do anything.

After getting a room, the person at the front desk points her and her kids toward the elevators. Having no idea what they do, but too embarrassed to say, she walks over and decides to watch and see what happens.

Yet again, to her surprise, this machine seems to do the impossible.

As she watches, a frail 80 year old man presses the button, and with his cane, he walks through the open doors into the little room. The doors shut and she is left waiting to see what happens. 30 seconds later, a 25 year old, buff and gorgeous man walks out of the little room.

The woman looks to her son and says, “I think I know what this does. Go get your father.”",An Amish family takes a day off to visit New York City,57

post,9maml7,2qh72,jokes,false,1538962225,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9maml7/computer_idiots_warning_old/,self.jokes,,"Any time you feel dumb, don't worry. Check out the following excerpts from a ""Wall Street Journal"" article by Jim Carlton. Lots of people are dumber than you.

1. Compaq is considering changing the command ""Press Any Key"" to ""Press Return Key"" because of the many calls asking where the ""Any"" key is.

2. AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse was hard to control with the dust cover on. The cover turned out to be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.

3. Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining that the system wouldn't read word processing files from his old diskettes. After trouble-shooting for magnets and heat failed to diagnose the problem, it was found that the customer labeled the diskettes by rolling them into a typewriter to type on them.

4. Another AST customer was asked to send a copy of her defective diskettes. A few days later a letter arrived from the customer along with Xeroxed copies of the floppies.

5. A Dell technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech to hold on, and was then heard putting the phone down, getting up and crossing the room to close the door to his room.

6. Another Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax anything. After 40 minutes of trouble-shooting, the technician discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it in front of the monitor screen and hitting the ""send"" key.

7. Another Dell customer needed help setting up a new program, so a Dell tech suggested he go to the local Egghead. ""Yeah, I got me a couple of friends,"" the customer replied. When told ""Egghead"" was a software store, the man said, ""Oh, I thought you meant for me to find a couple of geeks.""

8. Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no longer worked. He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap and water and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the keys and washing them individually.

9. A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged because his computer had told him he was ""bad and an invalid"". The tech explained that the computer's ""bad command"" and ""invalid"" responses shouldn't be taken personally.

10. An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get her new Dell Computer to turn on. After ensuring that the computer was plugged in, the technician asked her what happened when she pushed the power button. Her response, ""I pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens."" The ""foot pedal"" turned out to be the computer's mouse.

11. Another customer called Compaq tech support to say her brand-new computer wouldn't work. She said she unpacked the unit, plugged it in, and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to happen. When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, she asked ""What power switch?""

12. True story from a Novell NetWire SysOp: Caller: ""Hello, is this Tech Support?""

Tech: ""Yes, it is. How may I help you?"" Caller: ""The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am within my warranty period. How do I go about getting that fixed?"" Tech: ""I'm sorry, but did you say a ""cup holder""?"" Caller: ""Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer."" Tech: ""Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped; it's because I am. Did you receive this as part of a promotion, like at a trade show? How did you get this cup holder? Does it have any trademark on it?"" Caller: ""It came with my computer, I don't know anything about a promotional. It just has '4X' on it.""

At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he couldn't stand it. The caller had been using the load drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and snapped it off the drive!

Another well-known one that I can add is the true tale of the user who called up complaining that the instructions said to load the four diskettes into ""Drive A"" but he couldn't possibly get more than two in.",Computer idiots (Warning: Old),8

The doctor, though stunned, nods understandingly. 
“Well...Mr. Wilson...I’m very sorry to hear this. I’m sure you may be concerned that something like this could have affected your blood pressure, or your heart...”

“Doc, that’s not it! About a month later I came home early from work and found my wife in bed with the same man! In a rage I took my gun and went to kill my wife! But again the man stopped me and said ‘Hey, hey, hey, come on now, there’s no need for that. Let’s sit down, have some coffee and really talk this out’. So we did and he left.”

The doctor is silent for a bit. 
“Well Mr Wilson, with this kind of...problem,I’m certain a psychiatrist would be better able...”   

“No Doc!” The man exclaimed, “that’s not it either!
Just yesterday I came home early from work and I caught her! Again! With the same man! 
At my wits end I took my gun and went to kill myself! But the man stopped me and said ‘Hey, hey, hey, come on now, there’s no need for that. Let’s sit down, have some coffee and really talk this out’. So we did and he left.” 

The doctor is completely flustered at this point.  
“Mr Wilson, I’m confused! Why exactly did you come to me?”

“Well doc,” he said, nervously wringing his hands, “Is all of this coffee good for me?”

However, after the initial work of loading the ship and leaving the harbor was done, he noticed something weird.

During lunch or dinner, whenever most of the crew was gathered together, some of them would say random numbers.

""15"" one ventured. A chuckle rolled around the room. Another responded by ""23"", and several crewmembers hid their faces in their hands, trying to get their breath back under control.

After a few instances of this, the newbie asks the First Mate what's so funny about these numbers.

The man replies ""After working together for so many years, we all know each other's jokes by heart. So all we need to tell them is refer to their number"".

The crewman nods, understanding the reason even if he's still a bit confused. He decides to try it out at the next meal.

""9"", he says. No reaction. He decides to try again. ""34"" he says. Blank faces all around.   
Frustrated, he asks ""What the hell am I doing wrong? You all know these jokes by heart, right?"".

At 30 years old, he's been praying for the same thing for the past decade. All he wanted was a son. His life would finally be complete; all he needed was a son.

At the age of 35, the man began giving up. The priest in charge of the church gave up long ago on staying in the church until the man left, so he left early, letting the man keep praying past midnight.

The man was wondering, why was God so harsh? Why can't he have a child? But alas, he kept praying.

A few weeks later, it was 1am. He was all alone, in the church, all by himself. Suddenly, he noticed a white glow appearing in. Completely astonished, he realizes that it's nothing but an angel.

He gets on his knees and tilts his head downwards slightly in a motion of respect.

The angel speaks, in an echoing voice, ""I have a message from God for you, oh pious man.""

The man looks up, his smile as radiant as the angel and says, ""Am I finally going to have a son?""

They had a great time but, after all the hearty partying, they slept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Penn State until early Monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, they decided that after the final they would explain to their professor why they missed it. They said that they visited friends but on the way back they had a flat tire. As a result, they missed the final. The professor agreed they could make up the final the next day. The guys were excited and relieved. They studied that night for the exam. The next day the Professor placed them in separate rooms and gave them a test booklet. They quickly answered the first problem worth 5 points. Cool, they thought! Each one in separate rooms, thinking this was going to be easy.... then they turned the page.
