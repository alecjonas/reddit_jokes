Then he mentions that his Civic probably wouldn't be able to pull the boat so we go to the auto section and I sell him a 4x4 expedition.""

Tommy goes right up to Cindy, pulls down his pants and says, ""You see this thing, this is a BOY'S Bike, you can't have it!""  Cindy sad at what Tommy just said, runs home crying. She runs right up to her mother and relates what Tommy said to her. Cindy's mother calms her down and whispers something in her ear.

The next day Cindy is on her way home from school, no football, no bike.

Tommy walks up to her and again pulls down his pants and says, ""You see this thing, this is a BOY'S Bike, you can't have it!"". Cindy calmly replies, ""oh yeah?"" while lifting her skirt, ""You see this thing, my mommy says with this thing I can get as many of THOSE as I want!""",Little Tommy is playing in his yard,3

Upon arriving back at her witch den, she proceeds to cage up the terrified young boys, and begins brewing her evil potion according to her recipe.

Finally she comes to the end of the recipe, and with an evil laugh, she grabs a boy from the cage and tosses him into the giant boiling cauldron.

After many tormenting screams, followed by a moment of silence, the cauldron suddenly bursts and out jumps a now young man in place of the boy. It was clear the potion didn't go as intended for the witch.

The young man then chases after the bewildered witch and proceeds to kill her with his bare hands. 

As he finally makes his way back to the cage to free the confused young boys, they ask him in astonishment, ""what happened to you?"" ""How did you not die?""

""Easy"" says the young man, ""That witch doesn't kill you... only makes you stronger""

The market was very crowded and their shopping trip takes much longer than anticipated.

- **Sister Diana:** Sister Andrea?

- **Sister Diana:** It‚Äôs already dark and we‚Äôre still very far away from the convent.
- **Sister Andrea:** Yes, and did you notice that a man is following us?
- **Sister Diana:** Yes, I wonder what he wants.
- **Sister Andrea:** To rape us?
- **Sister Diana:** What do we do?
- **Sister Andrea:** We should split up. You go this way and I go that way.

After they separated, the man followed Sister Diana while Sister Andrea hurried up worriedly to the convent. One hour later, Sister Diana arrives breathing heavily and with a flushed face.

- **Sister Andrea:** What happened Sister Diana?
- **Sister Diana:** I kept changing direction and so did he.
- **Sister Andrea:** What did you do then?

- **Sister Andrea:** And then?
- **Sister Diana:** He caught me after a few blocks.
- **Sister Andrea:** Oh my God!!! Did you scream for help?
- **Sister Diana:** No, I didn‚Äôt resist and did the only logical thing. I pulled up my dress high above my knees.
- **Sister Andrea:** Oh my Heavens!!! What did the man do?
- **Sister Diana:** Well, I guess it should be very obvious. He pulled his pants down.
- **Sister Andrea:** Oh my Lord!!! And then, what happened?
- **Sister Diana:** Isn‚Äôt it obvious???
- **Sister Andrea:** Oh no!!!
- **Sister Diana:** A nun with her dress up runs faster than a man with his pants down!!!

\- St Peter, I was freezing all of my life and was dreaming about how warm it would be in Hell if I could get there. Can you please send me to Hell so I would get some warm?

\- You‚Äôve spent quite sinless life so you belong here. But if you really want me to do this then I will fulfill your dream.

So Corey was sent to Hell. A few days later St. Peter started to feel ashamed that he sent a righteous man to Hell for no reason and decided to check out how Corey was doing there. He walked up to the Hell‚Äôs door, opened it up a little and took a peek inside. Corey was sitting inside a boiling hellish cauldron with a big fire burning beneath and seemed to look quite happy enjoying such a bath. Suddenly Corey turned around and shouted out:

\- Shut the fucking door! There is a draft here!",Corey was feeling very cold during his entire life.,8

He walked over to the window and reflected on his quiet surroundings. He had always hated hilly *Yorkshire* with its grotesque, green gates. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel unstable. 

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather some*one.* It was the figure of Fred Parker. Fred was a patient *volcano* with spiky finger and pointy toes.

Raymond gulped. He glanced at his own reflection in the *squiggly mirror.* He looked as a cowardly, yet courageous, *grape juice drinker* with sticky fingers and fluffy toes. But his friends saw him as an oily, outrageous *ogre.* Once, some six or seven years ago, Raymond might have rescued a fat blind person from a burning building; yet this incident was undisclosed to the general public. Years of being a recluse and a social outcast certainly did not help his public image.

Not even the sliver of courage could prepare him for what his *friend* Fred had in store today. 

The foggy air teased like smiling dogs, making Raymond surprised. As Raymond stepped outside and Fred came closer, he could see the tall glint in his eye. Fred glared with all the wrath of *twenty five thousand eight hundred and ninety* considerate greasy goldfish. 

He said, in hushed tones, *I hate you and I want your Wi-Fi password.*

Raymond looked back, even more surprised and still fingering the magic hat.

*Fred, I hate you with all the fibre of my being,* he replied.

They looked at each other with stressed feelings, like two perfect, powerless pigeons sitting at a very special dinner party, which had piano music playing in the background and two deranged uncles swimming to the beat.

Raymond studied Fred‚Äôs spiky finger and pointy toes. Eventually, he took a deep breath. *I‚Äôm sorry,* began Raymond in apologetic tones, *but I don‚Äôt feel the same way and I never will, I just don‚Äôt like you Fred.*

Fred looked afraid, his emotions raw like a tense, tender teapot. 

Raymond could actually hear Fred‚Äôs emotions shatter into *forty three thousand five hundred and thirty* pieces. Then the *patient volcano* hurried away into the distance.

Not even a *drink of grape juice* would calm Raymond‚Äôs nerves tonight. ",Two Deranged Uncles Swimming to the Beat,0

The study took two years and cost over 1.2 million pounds. The study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to provide the man with more pleasure during sex. 


After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study were incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of 2 million Euros, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. 


When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didn't really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around 75 dollars (three cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete.

He sees a group of rough rider lookin' scoundrels playing poker and he musters up enough courage to sit down with 'em (thinkin' he might get a story out if he was lucky). ""Mind if I play?""

The others look up with a scowl that would curdle milk, but one looks at the clock and shakes his head. He points out the time to the others and they gather up their chips and go. ""Play alone, we're a-leavin'. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""

The writer is confused, but smells a story brewing; a strong one at that. He hoofs it up to the bar, passing most other patrons on their way out, and slaps a whole dollar bill on the table, ""Barkeep, give me a beer and a story, and you can keep the change.""

After taking a quick glance at the clock, the bartender shakes his head, pours the beer, and pushes the bill back to the reporter. ""The drink is on the house, but I suggest you drink it quick and leave. Wild Bill is coming to town."" Without another word the 'tender puts his last glass away and walks right out the swinging doors, leaving the reporter in an empty bar.

Now fear in his gut tears at him as he hears the emptiness in that bar. This emptiness seems to seep in as he realizes that he's about to be the last man in this town, alone with only the sound of that ticking clock to keep him company. Still, a story of this caliber must be worth something; so he waits...

Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, Bong&lt;CRACK!&gt;- Just as the clock strikes the first chime of twelve, a sound like thunder splitting a mountain is heard outside. The reporter runs to the doors to see what it is. In the distance and closing fast is a tornado coming right for the bar. The reporter hits the ground and watches as the tornado comes up to the bar and stops.

The wind settles and there is a giant of a man riding a grizzly bear. He steps off the bear, and instead of hitching it, he punches the great beast right in the face &lt;WHAM!&gt;, knocking it cold on the ground.

The reporter is so scared he runs back into the bar and dives behind the counter, sure that this is the last of his days. &lt;KaPLOW!&gt; the giant kicks in the saloon doors, and they turn to splinters that imbed themselves into the walls and break bottles and glasses that they touch.

The man walks up to the bar, breaking every floor board with each thundering step. He looks down at the reporter and slams his fist on the bar, cracking it down the middle, ""GIMME A DRINK!""

The reporter comes up, shakily holding out two bottles of whisky; which the giant snatches up, chews the glass tops off of, and drinks down as fast as the amber liquid can spill from the bottles. He throws both bottles in the air, whips out his six-shooter and fires off a round. The single bullet rips through both bottles showering the reporter with shards that rain down.

Regretting his curiosity and repenting of his life, the reporter stands on weakened legs and whimpers out, ""W-w-w-would y-you like a-another drink?""

The man turns to him, fire in his eyes, then glances at the clock... ""Nah, I gotta go. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""

The young seaman rushes over, goes to attention, and throws a sharp salute. ""Seaman, I want you to go over to that water tower and swan dive off."" Without a second thought the young man runs over, climbs to the top, and performs a graceful swan dive off off the tower landing head first, dying on impact. ""Now that is bravery. ""

The Marine general, not to be outdone by the Navy, just sneers out, ""you boys ain't seen a thing yet."" He spots a young corporal and shout out, ""hey maggot, over here on the double!"" The young Marine barrels over, pops to attention, and throws a perfect salute. ""Alright you worthless pile of crap time to finally make something of yourself. I want you to climb up that water tower, do exactly three flips mid-air and land head first into the ground. You better die on impact as well or so help me I will reach into whatever afterlife you believe in, rip you out, and throw you off that tower myself!"" Without batting an eye the Marine sprints over to the water tower, climbs up, does exactly three flips, and lands head first dying on impact. ""Now that is bravery.""

The Air Force general just shakes his head and says, ""I got this in the bag."" He sees a young airman and calls him over. The young man gives a quizzical look and motions to himself to make sure, eventually walking over to the general. He makes a lazy attempt at attention and briefly throws a salute. ""Airman, I want you to go over to that water tower and jump off."" The airman raises his brow, looks up at the tower, and then down at the pile of dead service members. ""Pfft, screw you ... sir,"" he replies and walks off. The Air Force general turns to the other officers and remarks, ""Now THAT is bravery!""",The bravest (long joke),470

The frog said to her, ""If you release me from this trap, I will grant you three wishes.""

The woman freed the frog, and the frog said, ""Thank you, but I failed to mention that there was a condition to your wishes.

Whatever you wish for, your husband will get times ten!""

The woman said, ""That's okay.""

For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world.

The frog warned her, ""You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis whom women will flock to"".

The woman replied, ""That's okay, because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me.""

So, KAZAM-she's the most beautiful woman in the world!

For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world.

The frog said, ""That will make your husband the richest man in the world. And he will be ten times richer than you.""

The woman said, ""That's okay, because what's mine is his and what's his is mine.""

So, KAZAM-she's the richest woman in the world!

The frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered, ""I'd like a mild heart attack.""

Moral of the story: Women are clever. Don't mess with them.

Attention female readers : This is the end of the joke for you. Stop here and continue feeling good.

Male readers: Please scroll down.

The man had a heart attack ten times milder than his wife.

Moral of the story: Women think they're really smart.

Let them continue to think that way and just enjoy the show.

Ralph and Edna were both patients in a mental hospital. One day while they were walking past the hospital swimming pool, Ralph suddenly jumped into the deep end. He sank to the bottom of the pool and stayed there.
Edna promptly jumped in to save him. She swam to the bottom and pulled him out. When the Head Nurse Director became aware of Edna's heroic act she immediately ordered her to be discharged from the hospital, as she now considered her to be mentally stable. 
 
When she went to tell Edna the news she said, 'Edna, I have good news and bad news. 
The good news is you're being discharged, since you were able to rationally respond to a crisis by jumping in and saving the life of the person you love... I have concluded that your act displays sound mindedness. 
 
 The bad news is, Ralph hung himself in the bathroom with his bathrobe belt right after you saved him. I am so sorry, but he's dead.
 
Edna replied, 'He didn't hang himself, I put him there to dry. 

How soon can I go home?'

Jimmy thought about it for a second and said: ""a pink diving suit"".

His parents didn't want to give him a pink diving suit for his birthday, so they bought him a nice green bicycle. Jimmy, being a little disappointed for not getting his pink suit rode his green bicycle all year long around the house until his 6th birthday was approaching... 

Again, his mother asked him what he wanted for his birthday and Jimmy again asked for a pink diving suit. Again, his parents didn't want to give him a pink diving suit and instead gave him a quad bike. And again, Jimmy drove his quad bike all year round the house...

Now this pattern went on for a few years, with all kinds of different presents for Jimmy, but never his beloved pink diving suit.

That is, until his 16th birthday. After all these years, his parents finally gave in and gave him his own pink diving suit.

The next day Jimmy immediately tried out his new diving suit in the nearby lake. He went in the water, dived under and surfaced again somewhere in the middle of the lake, right next to a small boat with two man in it.

Listening to the conversation in the boat, Jimmy heard one man say to the other: ""Now it's my turn to sit in the middle"".

&amp;#x200B;

Joe: You see that horse about 100 feet out? (Joe points to the horse in question)

Dave: I sure do! That's the biggest horse on our land. 

Joe: Well I tell you what... Let's play a game. If I can make that horse laugh hysterically without touching him, you owe me $100. Deal?

Dave: Joe... I've never seen a horse laugh. You've got yourself a deal.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, Joe walks out into the pasture all the way up to the horse. Dave sees Joe talk the the horse for a minute or two, after which the horse is rolling on the floor laughing. The horse is laughing so hard, you could probably hear it for a couple miles. 

&amp;#x200B;

Joe walks back over to Dave, only to see the massive disappointment on Dave's face.

&amp;#x200B;

Dave: I've got to hand it to you, you came through on your bet. I'm a man of my word, and although I can hardly afford to put food on the table for my family, here's your hundred dollars (hands Joe a $100 bill).

Joe: Listen pal, don't feel so discouraged. I'll give you a second chance. Let's make another bet, double or nothing. But this time when I go up to the same horse, I will make him cry like a baby without touching him. Deal?

&amp;#x200B;

Dave looks over to the horse, still laughing his ass off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dave: I don't have much more to lose. I've never seen a horse cry before, and he is in such a good mood that I doubt anything will make him upset at all. You've got yourself a deal. Double or nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like before, Joe walks up to the horse. In the distance, Dave sees Joe talking to the horse for a minute or two. By the time Joe starts walking back towards Dave, the horse is severely depressed. He is crawled into a ball, rocking back and forth, sobbing uncontrollably. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dave is once again completely defeated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dave: Alright old sport, no more bets. Here's your $200. You've ruined me and I don't know if we're gonna make it. But I have to know how you did it!

Joe: It's simple, really. The first time I went up to the horse, I told him I had a bigger dick than he does. So of course he started laughing like crazy! The second time I went up to see him... I showed him. ",Two Farmers and a Horse,2

post,a7b7av,2qh72,jokes,false,1545140903,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/a7b7av/yippie_yippie_worms/,self.jokes,,"(This one is a bit long)

There once was a man who had everything he could desire, money, fame, a beautiful home and a loving wife.
Still the man wasn‚Äôt happy, he felt like there was something missing.
One day he reads an article in the paper, the article talks about the three yippie yippie worms who are scattered around the globe and if you manage to own all 3 you will obtain happiness.
So the man spends a crap ton of money on researchers to find the first Yippie Yippie Worm.
After two weeks the researchers find the location of the worm, he is somewhere in the African Savannah.
So the man hires another team of researchers and guides to find the worm.
The search is tough (one dude got eaten by a lion) but the man manages to find the worm.
Overjoyed the man puts the worm in a jar with holes in the lid and keeps it close to him on his journey home.

When he gets home he puts the jar in a big ass vault and tasks his wife with feeding the worm.

His team of researchers in the mean time have found the location of the second yippie yippie worm, this time its on top of Mount Everest.

He goes to the base of the mountain and hires another crew to go up the mountain.
After thats done they go up the mountain, this time the trip is even more dangerous, avalanches, people fell down and some froze to death.
But even though so many people were dead, the man manages to arrive on the top and finds the second Yippie Yippie worm.
He puts the worm in another jar with small holes in the lid and again holds it close to him on the journey back home.

The man starts ordering books on how to take care of the worms and goes to sleep.

In the meantime the researchers have found the last Yippie Yippie worm, this time he‚Äôs rather easy to find.
The worm is in the Netherlands in a weed shop who have him in a tank for tourist purposes.

So the man buys a plane ticket to Amsterdam to find the last worm.
He finds the shop and asks the owner for how much he‚Äôll sell it for.
The owner says it‚Äôll cost him 10 million.
The man reluctantly pays as the price as he is desperate for his happiness.

The man arrives back home and puts the worm in the vault with the other worms, the man then watches some TV and falls asleep.
When he wakes up in the morning he realizes he had to feed the worms, so he gets their food and goes to the vault only to realize the worms are gone.

The man is utterly devastated that his last chance at happiness is gone.
He goes to the door to get his paper and sees something on the other side of the street.
Its the worms!
The man is so happy that he runs to the worms to get them when suddenly he gets hit by a truck.

So the moral of the story is: always look left and right before crossing the road.

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",My favorite joke: Everyone Knows Dave,22192

A frog walks into a bank, and approaches the teller. He sees the tellers name tag read Paddy Black and says

&amp;#x200B;

""I'd like to take out a loan, Mrs. Black""

&amp;#x200B;

""Certainly,"" says the teller, ""how much would that be for?""

&amp;#x200B;

""One million dollars."" replies the frog. ""Don't worry, it's ok, I know the manager.""

&amp;#x200B;

The teller is understandably taken aback by this, and asks if the frog has any collateral to cover this.

&amp;#x200B;

""As a matter of fact, I do!"" says the frog, and he reaches into his pocket and hands over a tiny ceramic elephant.

&amp;#x200B;

""What?!"" says the teller, ""This is garbage! I can't take this!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, take it up with my father then!"" The frog retorts.

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh yeah, and who might that be?"" The teller is quickly getting more and more annoyed at the frog.

&amp;#x200B;

""Why, it's Keith Richards!"" The frog is waiting impatiently, tapping his toe on the ground. ""Now, can I have that loan or not?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Wait right here"" the teller says, as she storms into the back room, looking for her manager.

&amp;#x200B;

""There's a frog out there who claims to know you, and wants a million dollar loan. He claims his  father his Keith Richards! He even gave me this as collateral,"" she  says, holding up the elephant. ""I mean, what even is this?""

&amp;#x200B;

The  manager takes a look at the elephant and replies ""It's a knick knack,  Paddy Black, give the frog a loan. His old man's a rolling stone!""",Frog wants a million dollar loan,44

This has been my favorite joke for at least a couple years now.

A  man drives train in Bulgaria. One day, he falls asleep driving, and  runs over someone walking on the tracks. Well, his case goes to court,  and he gets the death sentence for murder. So, he's on death row and the  executioner approaches him.

""What would you like for your last meal?""

""I would like a banana please.""

The  executioner thinks it's weird, but shrugs and gives him a banana. The  guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into the electric  chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In Bulgaria, an act of  divine intervention means you get released.

A  few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new  company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2  people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he  ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from last  time approaches him.

""You again? Shit. What do you want this time?""

""Two bananas please.""

The  executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but  whatever. There's no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip  the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second time.

Some  time passes, and the executioner is very busy. After another few  months, the same dude shows up, apparently having run over 3 people with  a train. Exacerbated, the executioner approaches him for the third  time.

""Let me guess. Three bananas?""

""Actually yes! How did you know?""

""Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.""

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

""I don't get it,"" says the executioner. ""I didn't let you eat any bananas!""

""Its not the bananas. *I'm a bad conductor.*""",The Ultimate Joke:,726

Not gonna lie. But I would never pursue a student sexually or romantically. Apparently, that feeling was not mutual. At first, things were like they usually were with stupid young girl crushing: double entendres, very subtle comments, etc. But there's a line, and she crossed it. 

She wrote her number on an essay with a smiley face. This was not okay by any means. I immediately contacted an administrator so I wouldn't get in any trouble. These sorts of things are taken very seriously at pretty much any grade level these days, and I'm not interested in losing my job over some girl's hormones getting the best of her. 

So a couple of days later, this administrator called a meeting with the parents. We were all in the office and the administrator was doing his spiel to the girl and her parents about appropriate behavior at school and appropriate age differences and the like (apparently this is a common enough issue that he had some training on how to have this kind of talk). She looked fairly ashamed, staring at the floor the whole time. He finished his rehearsed rant and then asked the parents if they had anything they wanted to say to the daughter. 

The father was silent, but the mother spoke up. She said something about how the girl should know better and how they taught her better than this, etc. The usual parent reprimand stuff. But teenage girls can often find ways to surprise you. The mom asked her daughter, ""And what did you even expect would come of something like this?"" My student was quiet for a moment, looking down at the floor still, but then she turned to me, and I will never forget the way she looked at me when she said it: ""About tree fiddy."" It was about this time I noticed that my student was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. I said, ""Damn it, monsta, get out of this office! I ain't givin' you no damn tree fiddy!""

When NASA was preparing for the Apollo project, some of the training of the astronauts took place on a Navajo reservation.

One day, a Navajo elder and his son were herding sheep and came across the space crew. The old man, who spoke only Navajo, asked a question that his son translated. ""What are these guys in the big suits doing?""

A member of the crew said they were practicing for their trip to the moon. The old man got all excited and asked if he could send a message to the moon with the astronauts. Recognizing a promotional opportunity, the NASA folks found a tape recorder.

After the old man recorded his message, they asked his son to translate it. He refused. The NASA PR people brought the tape to the reservation, where the rest of the tribe listened and laughed, but refused to translate the elder's message.

Finally, the NASA crew called in an official government translator. His translation of the old man's message was: ""Watch out for these guys; they have come to steal your land.""",NASA was preparing for the Apollo project,364

The poor man asks the rich man, ""What are you getting your wife this Christmas?"" The rich man replies, ""Diamond earrings and a Mercedes."" The poor man asks, ""Why are you getting her two gifts?"" The rich man says, ""Well, if she doesn't like the earrings then she can drive to the store and exchange them.""
 

The poor man nods. Then the rich man asks him, ""So what are you getting your wife this year?"" The poor man thinks about it for a second and replies, ""A pair of slippers and a dildo.""

The rich man asks, ""Why those two things?"" The poor man astutely reponds, ""This way, if she doesn't like the slippers she can go f*ck herself.""",A poor man meets a rich man around Christmas,15

""I'm sick of all these conferences. I always say the same things over and over!""


The driver agrees: ""You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place.""
 

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""
 

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.
 

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.
 

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :


 ""Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.""
