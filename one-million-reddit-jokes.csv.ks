A man, returning home a day early from a business trip, got into a taxi at the airport. It was after midnight. While en route to his home, he asked the cabby if he would be a witness. The man suspected his wife was having an affair, and he intended to catch her in the act.

For $100, the cabby agreed.

Quietly arriving at the house, the husband and the cabby tiptoed into the bedroom. The husband switched on the lights, yanked the blanket back and there was his wife in bed with another man.

The husband put a gun to the naked man's head. The wife shouted, 'Don't do it! This man has been very generous! I lied when I told you I inherited money. He paid for the Corvette I gave you. He paid for our new cabin cruiser. He paid for your season Pittsburgh Steeler tickets. He paid for our house at the lake. He paid for our country club membership, and he even pays for the monthly dues!'

Conditions are primitive, but the man and Chihuahua coexist peacefully for several years. 

The man eventually comes to the realization that he will never be rescued. Sadly he begins composing a mental list all the things he will never be able to enjoy again.... wine...women...song...  By far the most painful thing to accept is that he will never have sex with a woman again.

One day, sitting at the fire beside the little dog, the man's eyes widen abruptly and he looks up the side of the mountain at the herd of sheep.  ""Why, yes, why not? Who would ever know?""
He goes up the mountain, picks out a particularly docile looking ewe, walks up behind her and lowers his trousers.  Just as he does so the Chihuahua begins yapping frantically, dancing around him, and nipping at his ankles.  Nothing he does or says will make the dog stop.  After several minutes of trying to quiet the Chihuahua he gives up on the ewe.  The mood is spoiled.

He tries again, multiple times over the next few weeks and months, but it's always the same.  The Chihuahua is always underfoot, driving him to distraction. Eventually he abandons the idea entirely.

One day, out on the horizon, he sees a ship going down--same reef that doomed his ship. He watches it sink, there's nothing he can do. The next day while walking the beach searching through the debris that is washing up he discovers a woman, half in/half out of the water, barely alive.  

She is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen!  
He quickly clears the sand and seaweed from her mouth and restores her breathing.  He carries her back to his camp and nurses her carefully.

She is unconscious for several days.  When at last she is awake and able to speak she looks him over and says,""  I am so grateful for all you have done for me...you saved my life...I don't know if I can ever repay you, but I want you to know that I will do anything to try...and I do mean anything...""

The man thinks for a moment, then his eyes widen abruptly, and he asks,"" Would you mind babysitting this Chihuahua for about 5 minutes?""",A ship goes down at sea and two survivors wash up on the shore of an island--a man and a Chihuahua.,5

Then he saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow that was addressed to 'Dad.'

Fearing the worst, he opened the envelope with trembling hands and read the letter. It said:

Dear Dad,

It is with great regret and sadness that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.

I have been finding real passion with Susie and she is so nice. But I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion. Dad she's pregnant. 

Don't worry though, Susie said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.

Susie has also opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy.

In the meantime, we will pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Susie can get better. She deserves it.

Don't worry Dad. I'm 15 and I know how to take care of myself.

Someday I'm sure that we will be back to visit so that you can get to know your grandchildren.

Love, Your son Tim.

P.S. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jimmy's house.

I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than a lousy report card ...

That's in my desk drawer.

I love you.",A father was walking past his son's bedroom one day and happened to look in.,44

The words were barely out of his mouth when there was a loud splash.

Everyone turned around and saw Brian in the pool fighting madly with the crocodile, jabbing it in the eyes with his thumbs, throwing punches, head butting it, getting it in choke holds, biting it's tail and flipping it through the air like some kind of martial arts expert.

The water was churning and splashing everywhere. Both Brian and the crocodile were screaming and raising hell.

Finally, after what seemed like an age, Brian strangled the crocodile and let it float to the top of the pool like a dead goldfish.

An exhausted Brian wearily climbed out of the pool with everybody staring at him in disbelief.

The millionaire said, ""Well, Brian, I reckon I owe you a million dollars then... What do you plan to do with the money?""

Elon musk walks into a bank in London and asks for the loan officer. He says says he is going to space on a business trip for two weeks and needs to borrow £5,000.

The loans officer says the bank will need some kind of security for such a loan, so Elon Musk hands over the keys and documents of two Tesla Roadsters, parked on the street in front of the bank. Everything checks out and the bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. An employee drives the Teslas into the bank’s underground garage and parks it there.    


Two weeks later,  Elon returns and repays the £5,000, plus interest, which is £15.41. The loans officer says: “We are very happy to have had your business and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and found that you are an extremely wealthy man. Your flamethrowers netted you £10 Million in 2018. I mean , you even sent a car to mars that had a mannequin holding a mars bar sitting inside of it last week...  Elon , you are a billionaire! Sir, i admit, we are curious as to why you would even bother to borrow £5,000?”.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but one person had died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat;I dont know what the bananas do to help you stay alive but we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,282

However, behind closed doors, Paul is a hardcore submissive masochist, and his wife is a prude who detests any kind of sexual activity. The only way that Paul can get his wife to comply with his desires is to cook bacon. For some odd reason, the smell of bacon cooking really drives her wild. Now on this particular day, Paul had been without his sick kicks for about a month, and was getting pretty antsy. He runs to the supermarket to pick up a pound of bacon, but finds that a shortage has left all of the shelves bare. With his head hanging low, he shuffles toward the door to go home, but he meets his priest walking in instead. “How’s it going, Paul?” The priest asks. “Oh, not too good. I was hoping to fry some nice juicy bacon today, but they’re all out,” he replies. “I’ll tell you what,” says the priest, “I know you’re a farmer and that you have a donkey. Every day this week the church is putting on our spring play. We need a donkey for Jesus to ride on. If you bring that donkey of yours to every production, I’ll let you have all the bacon we had stored up for our Easter breakfast.” At this point, too desperate to argue, Paul agrees. However, the only way he can transport his donkey is in a beat up old school bus he bought second hand to use as a farm truck. So every day he loads the stubborn animal in the back of his bus, drives 15 miles to town to the church, and waits for the play to be over before cramming it back in the bus and heading home. At the end of an exhausting week, the priest thanks him and hands him an entire box full of bacon. Paul speeds home and proceeds to fry up every single piece of bacon in a huge skillet. He closes all of the doors and windows, and let’s the smell fill the house. His wife, hypnotized by the smell, leaps out of bed, runs into the kitchen, bends her husband over her knee, and gives him 10 spanks right to the rear. Paul immediately jumps out of her arms. “What the hell was that??” He demands. Those were the weakest spanks he had ever experienced, and he had just fried up an entire box of bacon, the only in town. He’s livid. Mad with rage, he turns to his wife:

“I bussed my ass all week to bring home the bacon, and this is the spanks I get?”",A man and his wife have a very peculiar relationship.,34

It was done to show that they could and because it amused them. Years later, after they made their planet uninhabitable, they left and abandoned the craft because it served no purpose other than an old joke. Eventually, it was thrown off-course and exited that solar system, only to re-enter, many years later in an adjacent one with life-forms who were evolved enough to look at their sky and wonder. 


The craft, caught by the pull of their planet, settled into orbit. The religion of La grew up around the new satellite and eventually the life-forms retrieved it. For many years they worshipped La until they were visited by the creatures from the planet that had launched it. 


The two found a way to communicate and the joke of the craft and the likeness was explained to the believers. Some were angry, some violent, but most saw it as a test to see if they could grow beyond themselves and find humor in the universe. The life-forms rose to the occasion, launched their own craft and likeness, and in the moment of inspiration, called it La. 


And thus began the billion year process requiring all life-forms to prove that they could take a joke before being helped by others. Of course, it is now known as the Test-La.",The Test,70

They took each man of the house out to the field. (Ahmed , Pudra and Sun) 

“Hey! You guys! We’re feeling quite generous today. So if you are able to finish the tasks we give you, then we’ll set you and your families free. If not, we’ll kill you on the spot but your family will be spared regardless.” said the soldiers with a grin.

“Don’t worry guys, there are only two tasks”the soldiers continued.

Thinking it would be the only chance to survive, all three guys agreed. How could they not, “its only two tasks right?” the three thought.

“For your first task! Go find ten round items and come back to us. If you don’t comeback within three hours I’ll have your family beheaded.” The three guys went into the forest in search of the items.

After an hr Ahmed came back as fast as he could brining back ten rambutans in a sack. 

The soldiers were pleased, “Good job sir” they shouted. “And for your next task!” Ahmed eagerly waited. “Use all these ten rambutans, and shove it up your anus! And if you make any noise while doing it, you’re dead meat”

Angered and confused, but having no other choice to save his family he started pulling down his pants. One by one he slowly stuff it in his bumhole, careful not to make any noise eventho the pain was excruciating. After the sixth one he can’t take it anymore and screamed in pain and immediately got shot.

Another hour past and Pudra came back with ten small little pebbles in his palms. He saw what happened to Ahmed and figured out roughly what’s gonna happen next. The soldiers ordered the same thing from him. Slightly relieved he picked up only little pebbles he was confident that he would succeed and leave with his family. One by one he slid those little pebbles in in bum hole. After the ninth one, he picked up his last pebble. Suddenly he bursted out laughing non stop and the soldiers shot him down.

In heaven, Ahmed asked Pudra “What happened what did you picked up for the first task?”

Pudra in anger told him “ It was all good the pebbles were small and smooth! I almost got it, there was only one left!”

Ahmed asked again “Then what? Shouldn’t you be alive then? How did you fail?”

Pudra replied “Just when I went to pick up the last pebble, I saw in the corner of my eye.....  FUCKING SUN BROUGHT BACK TEN FUCKING DURIANS!”

The Priest was stunned and he shouted at the young men. 'I cannot believe that any of you boys would ever do such a thing, much less speak of it in front of me.' 'Why, when I was your age we didn't know what sex was, much less joke around about it.'

The lead boy handed the Priest the $5.00 bill. 'You win.' ",Lies about sex.,130

His only travel compagnion and also means of transportation was his camel. The journey was long and hard, and after a while the traveller was feeling lonely. 

He started to get some weird thoughts about his camel and since he was all alone in the desert, he thought, why not. He went around his camel, stood behind it and tried to fuck his camel, but since the camel was much bigger than him. He couldn't reach where he needed to be, not even when he was standing on his toes.  


So he had no better idea than to make a pile of sand, and stand on top of it. But when he tried to commence with his unholy act, the camel ran away. He ran after his camel,  forgot about his whole idea and travelled on.

Still, after a while he was feeling lonely again and tried it again. Alas, the camel, again, ran away. Realizing this was never going to work, he travelled on, forgetting about his stupid idea.


But not too much further on his journey he ran into someone that was stranded, it was a woman, a stunning one too, and she had engine trouble with her car. The woman was so happy to see him, she thought she was going to die, being stranded alone in the middle of the desert. She asked him if he couldn't help fix her car, or if she could travel with him.

The traveller knew a thing or two about cars but could never afford one. Luckily for the woman he was able to fix the car.

The woman was so thankfull, she said 'thank you so much, you saved my life, I will do anything for you, name it and I will do it, I'm all yours'

""Fuck!"" he screams, ""I missed!"" The priest turns to the imam and says ""My friend, you must watch you language. If you continue to swear God will rain his wrath upon you"".

On the fairway, the imam lines up for another shot. Sure enough, he mangles his shot and ends up in the rough. ""Fuck!"" he yells, ""I missed!"". The priest starts getting a little hot under the collar. ""My esteemed friend,"" he begins sternly, ""You must watch your language, or God will show his wrath!"" The others take their shots and move on.

Eventually the imam gets his ball on to the green while managing to refrain from any further swearing. He lines up for the 2 foot putt and stares with concentration on the hole. He putts the ball and misses by 5 feet.  ""Fuck!"" he shouts, ""I missed!""

There is a clap of thunder and a lightning bolt hits the imam dead on, leaving a charred pile of bones. The priest and rabbi look at each other askance. Eventually however, they decide to play on and move to the next hole.

The rabbi lines up his drive and hits a beautiful 250 yard shot - straight into the water. ""Fuck!"" exclaims the rabbi, ""I missed!"" The priest motions frantically to the rabbi. ""Rabbi! You must control your tongue or God will strike you down!"" They move to the fairway.

The rabbi pulls out his iron and promptly hits a divet while managing to graze the ball and losing a stroke. The rabbi is livid. ""Fuck!"" he rages, ""I missed!"" The priest gets worked up as well. ""Rabbi! Stop swearing or God will strike you down!"" The rabbi gets himself back under control and both the rabbi and the priests manage to get on to the green.

The rabbi lines up his putt, a nice straight line with no break. Softly he taps the ball, and the ball rolls ever so slowly towards the whole, but stops on right on the cusp. The rabbi can't take it. ""Fuck,"" he exclaims, ""I missed!""

post,7vqgh8,2qh72,jokes,false,1517950013,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7vqgh8/a_new_girl_moves_into_my_neighborhood/,self.jokes,,"So I recently moved into a new neighborhood and it's a pretty nice area. After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself.

Being the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?""

And keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel.

So I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, ""Uh... No thanks, I'm good.""

""Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.""

So a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, ""Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.""

So I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, ""OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.""

So I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.

A couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?"" Luckily, she says, ""Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't miss it.""

So I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled ""Video Games."" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, ""Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?"" and she responds with, ""No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it."" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.

So I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.

So a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me.""

I tell her, ""Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great."" 

She says, ""Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow.""

So next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again.""

""Wait, what? Why not? What happened?""

""Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.""

""I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person""

""She told me, and I quote, that she is going to fucking murder me.""

""I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.""

I go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.

So day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.

Then I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, ""She's dead, you're next."" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.

Now I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE.

And it raises the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?

He had been part of this project from its inception, and during its long development, he had risen in influence becoming one of the lead engineers on the project. During all this time, he had met his beautiful wife and had become the father of a wonderful child named Timmy. He loved his family very much, but his identity was in this project. He would see it through, unlike those before him. After a decade and a half of sweating every detail, building working models, and constructing the base of the island, the time had come to set sail on the floating city, the largest man-made vehicle in history.

He was one of the first people to move onto the island, in the developed area near the center. He would visit home from time to time, but overall he trusted his wife with the task of raising his son.  He thought about backing out, but in his mind it was too late. He only hoped he could keep his family together.

He could not. He came home to divorce papers. He could hardly blame her for leaving but was nevertheless angry over how she clearly desired to hurt him. She took much of his wealth and was never seen again. This left the engineer with a dilemma: he was more invested than ever in the project, but he had a son to raise. His colleagues encouraged him to take a smaller role on the team and move off the island, but he could not do it. He would be on the island when it was finished. Timmy, his son, would join him on the island. Anyway, he'd be done with his part in the relatively near future, so there was no reason in his mind to give up his position.

This did Timmy no favors. He had gotten to that age where he'd started to make distinct friends, his first network, and he was torn away from that. The people on the island were sympathetic to his predicament, but there was little they could do to help. They were adult engineers. Timmy had little interest in their activities. They also did their best to keep him safe.

In the center of the island, there was a valve used to regulate water flow through the center of the island. There was a pool in the center, which was the recreational hub of the entire island. It also served another purpose. To reduce turbulence during storms among other things, water could be allowed to fill a central pool. Because they were not using it recreationally, and they were not in turbulent waters (they remained somewhat close to land for the construction), the pool remained empty, making it a simple matter to walk up to this valve. When the island was to be finished, the valve would be operated by a computerized system, but at this point it was operated by a large, red lever to be operated only by professionals.

The adults told Timmy the same thing over and over: ""Don't touch that lever. Don't touch the lever, or you could sink the island. Don't even THINK about touching that red lever."" They would tell him in the middle of recreation or fun. He felt like the grown-ups cared a lot more about the island than about him. He grew disinterested in their company and resentful of his father. Instead of humoring them, he became an imaginative boy and lived in his own thoughts most of the time.

His father sensed his son's resentment toward him, and it broke his heart. He thought quite a lot about leaving the island, but it seemed too late now. He was here to stay. That being said, outside of leaving, he would do anything to please his kid.

Everything changed when Timmy came home one day. He ran into their suburban home and shouted, ""Daddy! I met a friend today! I met a friend, and his name is Nate."" His father asked if he could meet this Nate. ""He's in the garage,"" his son said nonchalantly.

To the engineer's great surprise, in his garage was a wild-looking dog. It was a mutt so thoroughly interbred, one could not decipher the breeds at play. It moved its head erratically. It was lean about the belly. It had no tags or labels. Timmy must have named it. It looked like a street dog. The engineer was taken aback by this because there were no animals allowed on the island. ""How the heck did you get here?"" he said to Nate. Nate foamed at the mouth a little. The dog appeared sickly. A contagious illness could do very bad things on an isolated ship. He knew he ought to shoot the dog before it was too late.

But that was impossible. His son had taken such an instant liking to it. It already had a name. He couldn't remember ever seeing Timmy this happy. He could hardly remember ever seeing Timmy happy at all. A supply ship would be there in five days. They could take Nate back to land. He told Timmy he had five days with Nate before he had to go away. He also told Timmy that the dog must stay in the garage and not be touched and that Timmy was to wash his hands if he were to break the second rule.

Nate's puzzling appearance lit up Timmy's well-trained imagination. He figured that the only way Nate could have come to this water-borne limbo was by flying through the air like Superman. Nate must have known that he needed a friend and flown through the sky to lift his spirits. Nate coughed up foam. Timmy was very grateful. Nate the Wonder Dog. He was the smartest dog in the whole world. He could fly from place to place. His barks could tear through walls. He helped kids and stopped criminals. He was immune to both bullets and loneliness. Nate rolled over.

Timmy relayed this fantasy to his father over and over again. It was killing his father inside. The dog appeared more and more sickly. He wouldn't kill it now. It was too late. Throughout his life, the engineer had always felt he was too late. He regretted never having done what he had to. The night before the beast was to go away, the engineer awoke to noise coming from the garage. He leaped out of bed. Timmy was in the garage. His son explained that an enclosed area like a garage was no place for a flying dog. They were to go exploring together before they were forced apart.

But the moment he had a path, Nate bolted from the garage, running mad. He bolted at an ungodly speed toward the dried-up pool. Toward the red water-control lever. The engineer knew what he had to do. He ran upstairs and grabbed the shotgun. Timmy followed. ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THAT'S MY FRIEND!"" he screamed.

""He's going for the valve. He could sink the island."" The engineer set his sights on the dog, approaching the red switch with no sign of diverting or slowing down.

""He's not gonna hit the lever, Dad!"" Timmy was in a total panic.

""I have to be sure. I thought you said he was bulletproof.""

""I DON'T KNOW!""

He'd said the wrong thing. He'd have to live with that. At this moment there was one thing left to do. One thing he had to do before it was too late. The dog was only about ten feet away now. The engineer took in a fluttery breath and squeezed the trigger. He whispered to himself,

""Better Nate than lever.""",Nate the Wonder Dog [Very Long],13

And the first one says, ""I can order a drink."" So he goes up to the bartender and says, ""Bartender, I'd like a drink.""

The bartender takes one look at him and says, ""got any ID?"" Oh, because the first guy wasn't old enough. None of the three guys are old enough to order a drink, but the first one said he would be able to order it anyway. But when he tries, the bartender looks at him. Got it?

So the guy says, ""no, it's in my other pants."" But the bartender throws him out of the bar. And the other two guys laugh at him.

But the Catholic guy goes, ""I bet I could do it."" He's thinking that the Muslim guy -- that's the first guy -- just didn't do it right. So the first guy was the Muslim, but he got thrown out because he wasn't old enough, okay? But the second guy is Catholic, and he says ""I bet I could do it."" Just pretend that Catholic guys could place bets, because the religion aspect really doesn't have anything to do
with the joke.

So the Protestant guy goes into the bar -- I mean, the Catholic guy, I'm not talking about the third guy yet, still the second guy. So he goes into the bar, and he puts a $50 bill on the counter and says, ""Can I have a drink?"" He's trying to bribe the bartender, see? So the bartender picks up the $50 and puts it in his tip jar. Then he looks at the first guy and says, ""let's see"" -- I mean, the second guy, the
Protestant -- and says, ""let's see some ID, Clyde."" His name wasn't really Clyde, but that doesn't have anything to do with the joke either. Cindy, maybe, or Susan or Lucy. It doesn't really matter. The point was, she wasn't Clyde. But the bartender already had the $50, and the guy -- girl -- she's a girl, okay? But she knew she wasn't going to get a drink because she didn't have ID. I mean she DID have some ID, but it showed she wasn't old enough to drink. So she leaves. I mean, the bartender throws him out too. So now there's two guys that were thrown out. And the other two start laughing at him. Her.

But then the Jewish guy, he gets this great idea. Saul, let's call her. I mean, him. No, let's make her name Charlotte, but my point is that the second guy -- girl -- was Jewish. Not that this has anythingto do with the joke, really; that's just how we're going to keep the characters straight. So Saul gets this great idea.

Wait -- did the second guy go in yet? This is the third guy, alright? But he's this jewish girl that has a really great idea. First she wraps his ends around each other and tucks herself in -- because she's a string, did I mention that? So she wraps herself around and tucks herself in. Then she takes out a comb and combs his head, only he breaks a few strands as he combs it. Then he walks into the bar -- you
have to believe that strings can walk, see. Oh yeah, and the bar has a sign up, it says ""No strings allowed."" That's why the other two strings got thrown out, they were strings, but the bar doesn't allow underage strings. Any strings. And the bartender can tell a string just by looking at them. But this second string -- sorry, third string, he's tied in a knot, and then he goes in to the bar and orders
a drink.

And the bartender takes one look at him and says, ""where's your ID?"" so the third guy takes out his ID and the bartender looks at it. But it says ""String"", see? So the bartender asks, ""are you a string?""

And the string looks him right in the eye and says, ""no, I'm afraid not!""

Do you get it? ""I'm afraid not!"" It sounds like, ""no, I'm a frayed knot!"" 'Cause he tucked himself end over end, and used his comb to fray some of his strands, now he's a frayed knot!

By the 15th century, the Templar Knights had disappeared, but deep in the bowels of the British Museum in a case well sealed and protected lies a strange memorial to their impact on the city of London. 

London of the early 12th century was on its way to becoming an impressive city, but its life and its blood was the Thames River. Without the river commerce would grind to a halt as the people of London discovered to their horror in 1216........ 

The first ships seemed simply to have disappeared, but the monster wasted little time in this caution. Soon, many Londoners had seen the gaping maw licked by flames dragging a hapless crew to its death. It was a fire salamander, and in the Autumn of 1216 it was estimated to be 40 feet long with jaws that gaped 10 feet wide. 

By the spring of 1217, the monster was no longer a nuisance, it was a deadly plague. No boat could navigate the Thames... no raft was small enough, no ship was large enough to resist the demon of the Thames. Worse, the beast was growing! The latest reports called it 70 feet long with jaws opening 15 feet. Our instinct is to discount this absurd growth, and yet few could impeach its source. 

He, our source, enters the story in August of 1217. London had begged, prayed, blasphemed, and killed in desperate attempts to exorcise or appease their curse; to no avail. On June 14, four men painted themselves with the Devil's Cross and proclaimed themselves the Dark Priests of the Beast. They built a ship and doused it in oil; then, they sailed it down the river. Dark Priests they may have been, but they died screaming like any man. On July 28, London sent three virgins (the youngest not yet 13) down the Thames to the monster. It was thought that this would appease the evil god: the monster's hunger exceeded even this atrocity. 

On August 23, our source received his summons. His given name is lost in his chosen name: Honorus. He was a Templar Knight and possibly a saint. That morning, he was commanded to destroy the beast. 

London in fear and desperation had turned to their most jealous weapon, the Templars... warrior monks who fought with the fierce, perhaps fanatic, frenzy of the devout. The city had exhausted all other options; the monks were its last hope, and Honorus was the greatest of the Knights. 

The battle was truly a footnote to his preparation... Honorus ventured into the woods upstream from London. He forsook shelter, clothing, food, and sleep for four days, meditating on the coming struggle. When the four days ended, he stalked and killed a stag without weapon or aid. With the skin of the stag he made clothing; from its flesh he regained his strength; and with its guts, he lashed five logs into a raft fit for his purpose. 

Honorus set the raft in motion. He had outfitted himself with the only item he would use in this fight which had not come out of the forest with him. A sword of Spanish steel, blue with the sky, lay in his lap. Soon, he felt the swell of the water disturb his raft: the monster was coming, yet he sat unmoving. 

The beast broke the surface. 

No human is perfect; a splinter of the collapsing raft clipped Honorus' left foot as he leapt into the water. He had timed his jump slightly too late, but no matter, the injury will not be important until after the battle. 

The monster was above the water only momentarily; time enough for Honorus to drive his sword between two of its scales. The monster thrashed in pain, turning its exposed flesh from the steaming water. Honorus was lifted from the water as the beast rolled. He gauged his stroke and leapt, striking the monster's eye. 

Angered and half blinded, the beast threw Honorus into the river and grasped him in its immense jaws. Honorus swam quickly past the teeth into the monster's mouth. Inside, the questing tongue scalded his feet as he searched for purchase again, and we shall ignore this injury for now. 

Once he had braced himself inside the beast's mouth, pushing with all his strength against the slowly rising tongue, he took aim. Honorus had time to make only one thrust. 

When his journal recalls these events, it attributes Honorus' ""luck"" in this battle to aid from the Divine. We do not wish to detract from the glory of God, but surely He will not envy His servant. Is it coincidence that Honorus' blade struck true to the brain? Honorus had already studied carefully the anatomy of the salamander a week before he was summoned to fight the beast. Did Honorus not know that the water's rush against the beast's exposed flank would cause it such pain? In his journal, ""August 24: And once I am atop the beast and it has rolled from the water, where then to strike?"" 

Two weeks after Honorus was told to lift the curse of London, the beast was dead. The next day London celebrated Honorus; the town would live because of him. Three days later, gratitude had disappeared. 

The body of the beast had lodged itself firmly in the mire less than half a mile downstream of London. Although it was yet intact (perhaps due to its incredible armor), it would surely soon rot. While not so great a terror, the rotting beast would be almost as dangerous as the live beast, attracting disease and scavengers. No ship could move the carcass. The people of London called upon Honorus. 

Honorus' solution was difficult but practical, and he began as soon as he had retrieved his sword. He fasted for two days; then, he ate the cooked meat of the huge salamander and fasted for a third day. When he suffered no ill effects, Honorus began dissecting the beast. With the help of London, Honorus soon had all the usable meat and intestines of the dead beast transformed into sausage. 

A bizarre solution it was, but a good one. The sausage was soon discovered to be excellent and to keep easily for very long periods of time. Even more important, the sausage fast became incredibly popular throughout England and much of Europe. It began to reestablish the fame of London's trade after the Hiatus of the Beast. 

Still, Honorus has one final contribution to this history... It became vital that everyone knew from whence the incredible sausage of London came, and thus we return to Honorus' injuries. 

After the battle with the live beast and the crisis of the dead beast, Honorus took time to recover. Six weeks after he was first summoned, he was dressing the injuries on his feet. The problems of London were known to him. As he dipped a strip of paper like gauze into a healing salve, he had a thought. 

One week later, each sausage shipped from London carried a fascinating new development: a label. Just as the gauze dried and closed on Honorus' foot, the parchment around these sausages was attached; and all would know the fame of London from each link she sold. 

In the end, despite all his other feats, it was this idea, the product label, that survived Honorus. In tribute to this advance, the British Museum houses the only known surviving label from Honorus' sausages. 

And although even the tough gut of the Beast has long since faded to dust, the label may still be read. If our reader could go to the Museum and enter the Medieval wing's most treasured collection, she could still read, in faint letters, the Label of Honor: ... It Was The Beast Of Thames, It Was The Wurst Of Thames....",The Legend of the Monster of Thames,0

In the classroom the next day, Joe gave his example first, “My dad is a farmer and we have chickens. One day we were taking lots of eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of the truck when we hit a big bump in the road; the basket fell off the seat and all the eggs broke. The moral of the story is not to put all your eggs in one basket..”

“Very good,” said the teacher.

Next, Mary said, “We are farmers too. We had twenty eggs waiting to hatch, but when they did we only got ten chicks. The moral of this story is not to count your chickens before they’re hatched..”

“Very good!” said the teacher again, very pleased with the response so far.

Next it was little Johnny's turn to tell his story: “My dad told me this story about my Uncle Bob who was a flight engineer in the war and him plane got hit. He had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a bottle of whisky, a machine gun and a machete.”

“Go on,” said the teacher, intrigued.

“Uncle Bob drank the whisky on the way down to prepare himself; then he landed right in the middle of a 100 enemy soldiers.

He killed 70 of them with the machine gun until he ran out of bullets. Then he killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke. And then bit the last ten to death.”

“Good heavens,” said the horrified teacher, “What did your father say was the moral of that frightening story?”

She walked up and tied her old mule to the hitch rail. as she stood there, brushing some of the dust from her face and clothes, a young gunslinger (cowboy) stepped out of the saloon with a gun in one hand and a bottle of whiskey in the other.

The young gunslinger looked at the old woman and laughed, saying “hey” old woman have you ever danced”

The old woman looked up at the gunslinger and said, “no, I never did dance… never really wanted to.”

A crowd had gathered as the gunslinger grinned and said, “well, you old bag, you’re gonna dance now,” and started shooting at the old woman’s feet.

The old woman prospector – not wanting to get her toe blown off -started hopping around. everybody was laughing.

When his last bullet had been fired, the young gunslinger, still laughing, holstered his gun and turned around to go back into the saloon.

The old woman turned to her pack mule, pulled out a double-barreled shotgun, and cocked both hammers.

The loud clicks carried clearly through the desert air. the crowd stopped laughing immediately.

The young gunslinger heard the sounds too, and he turned around very slowly. the silence was almost deafening.

The crowd watched as the young gunman stared at the old woman and the large gaping holes of those twin barrels.

The barrels of the shotgun never wavered in the old woman’s hands, as she quietly said, “son, have you ever kissed a mule’s ass?

The gunslinger swallowed hard and said, “no maam… but… i’ve always wanted to.”

A couple of weeks go by with nothing amiss. And, then it happens. Trump completely screws up to the point that there is simply no graceful recovery.

It has a single sheet of paper with a single sentence written on it. ""It is not too late to blame your predecessor.""

So, he explains to Congress, ""Something awful has happened. It seems that Obama may have left some cracks in the process and, I've stumbled right into one.""

""Well, these things happen,"" they told him. ""Learn from it and document it and make sure it doesn't happen again.""

More months go by and Trump thinks he is making great things happen and then disaster strikes again.  He wastes no time in opening the safe and grabbing envelope ""2"".

Inside is a single sheet of paper and printed on it is one sentence. ""It's still not too late to blame your predecessor.""

He contacts his press secretary,  and plays the same card as before. ""I've hit a roadblock. It's almost like Obama had set it as a trap for me. And, boy, did it work. Almost too well.""

He got told by everybody the same thing he did last time. ""Mistakes happen. Learn from it and let's make sure it doesn't happen again.""

post,7vnqg9,2qh72,jokes,false,1517928074,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7vnqg9/the_party/,self.jokes,,"I moved to a rural neighborhood and was a little upset that none of my new neighbors came to welcome me. 

While working in the yard that first weekend, a big, trucker looking type of guy with a big smile came up to me and introduced himself as Jim, my neighbor from about a half mile down the road. 

We got to talking and hit it off immediately. Jim was a jolly guy that always seemed to have a smile on his face. 

After a few minutes I told him that I was a little disheartened that he was the only person that I had met so far. 

He explained that people around there were actually very friendly, just slow to welcome outsiders. 

“Which is why I always throw a party for newcomers.” He said with pride. 

I told him that a party would be exactly what I needed. 

“I’ve got to tell you right off the bat though, friend, you can count on there being some drinking. I hope you don’t have any objections to that.”

“No. Not at all.”  I said “What’s a party without some drinking?”

He gave a big hearty laugh that made me laugh too. 

“Thatta boy! But listen, these parties can get a little rowdy too.” he said. “Don’t be caught off guard if there’s a fist fight here and there.”

“After the week that I’ve had, I could stand a little excitement!” I said. 

He gave that big jovial laugh again that got me to laughing.  

“Just one more thing, neighbor.” This time he leaned in and took a cautious tone. “Sometimes there’s, well... sometimes there’s some sex.”

“Well damn.” I said. “This is shaping up to be my kind of party!”

Jim jumped back in surprise, gave me another slap on the back, and we both had a good laugh. 

“Well alright then!” He said. “You’re gonna fit right in, I can tell already. I’m gonna head on home now and get everything ready. Come on over on around 8!”

Jim turned to head home. 

“Oh, hey!” I shouted. “What should I wear?”

He stopped and turned around, looking a little confused. 

“Hell, it don’t matter, bud. It’s just you and me!”

post,7vn0q4,2qh72,jokes,false,1517920375,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7vn0q4/english_teacher_in_north_japan/,self.jokes,,"A guy who the Japanese government had sent to Hokkaido, in the far north of Japan, to teach English in one of the local schools, was stuck at home one day in late December - it was, in fact, Christmas, his first since arriving in Hokkaido. He went over his checklist to make sure he had everything needed for the few Christmas recipes that work for one solitary foreigner in the middle of nowhere. With a shock, he realised he had run out of milk.

It was a harsh winter, and the snow had piled up outside to the extent that he couldn't easily go into town to get some more milk. So he rummaged around in his cupboards, desperately trying to find something even vaguely dairy-related, yet couldn't find anything, because hey, Japan. Then he found some old edamame soybeans that had been at the back of the cupboard for months. He dimly remembered one was supposed to freeze them, but evidently he must have forgotten whenever he bought them. However, he thought the edamame could help, as they could probably be turned into soy milk.

He soon remembered, however, that he had no blender, and desperately, he thought he might heat them up to the extent that they might soften to the extent that they could easily be turned into liquid. So he put the edamame in a saucepan with some water, and turned the heat on full. However, although he waited for two hours, and although the water boiled properly, the edamame remained stubbornly resistant to anything he could throw at them. Eventually, he gave up and managed to make the recipe without that one ingredient. Although it tasted alright, he was still irritated by the incident, and it remained at the forefront of his memory at the time he went back to work after the school winter holiday ended.

The other teachers weren't, apparently, sympathetic. ""*Really* now?"", they said. ""You thought you could boil months-old edamame and turn them into soy milk?""

""Yeah"", said the English teacher, ""why not?""

""Well"", one of his colleagues said, speaking slowly as if to a child, ""*a JET, for Yule, can't melt stale beans...*""",English teacher in North Japan,2

“Yes, you see them and they make you cry.”

""Tell you what,"" said the taxidermist, ""I've got an apprentice just starting, if you don't mind us using the carcass for training then I'll do you a special on what we in the trade call a shoulder mount that you can hang up on your nan's wall above the fireplace, for £100.

I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA about my gift, and in no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping. I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running.

""But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security wandering near suspicious characters and listening in.

The Angel was surprised, bit still went to the Japanese. The Japanese was a genius physicist, and he created a magnetic field that made both orbs float above ground, revolving around each other. The Angel was even more surprised, having never seen anything like this. He was sure the Russian couldn't beat that! The man was just a drunkard! But he had to give each a proper chance. So he goes into the last room.

He doesn't come out for 20 minutes. German and Japanese we're worried. They left their rooms, anxiously looking at the third door. But soon, they saw Angel come out, red-faced, dying of laughter, while also looking completely befuddled. He comes out with the Russian and escorts him into heaven. German and Japanese are shocked!

post,7vjprn,2qh72,jokes,false,1517879631,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7vjprn/never_seen_this_one_here_longnsfw/,self.jokes,,"This all starts with a man named Dan. Dan's your ordinary type fellow, ordinary face, ordinary build. If you looked up ""generic"" in the dictionary you'd probably find a picture of Dan.

Dan worked in IT. Dan was very good at his job, but he just felt unfulfilled. Something was missing from Dan's life and he was willing to do whatever he took to find it. So Dan took all of his savings, sold his house, packed what little he didn't hock and bought a convertible and took off.

Dan's life took a turn for the extraordinary. He'd seen things that he never thought he'd see. The Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore, Yellowstone! If it was there to see, he saw it. 

One day, Dan decided ""Fuck it. I've got five dollars left. I'll play the lottery."" It was the biggest jackpot ever on record at a whopping 500 billion dollars, what did Dan have to lose?

Dan's luck was anything but ordinary. With his newly acquired 2.5 billion dollar prize (fuck you Uncle Sam) he decided his next adventure lie in the desert. Leaving his car behind Dan bought himself a seat on a luxury cruise liner bound for Asia. Now, in Asia, Dan saw many things that excited him. Things were so different there and it utterly astounded him. Dan thought, ""My life can't possibly get any better."" Just as he thought that an elderly man by the name of Zwong caught him by the arm ""Sir."" Zwong croaked ""I have a map to a treasure in the middle of the Gobi Desert...you must go on foot and follow the map exactly and untold riches will be yours. The map is yours for one thing only. The life of your best friend."" Dan didn't have any friends so...he took the map.

The trip started simple. He'd purchased enough supplies for a small village, at least and set out on his journey. But life is whimsical and through happenstance or pure misfortune Dan was robbed of his supplies and left beaten in the sand.

But Dan didn't give up, friends. Not by a long shot.

Dan crawled through the scorching sand, the brutal sun. He was stung by scorpions, the wind tore at his raw flesh. But Dan crawled. He would survive. He had to.

Thirty days and thirty nights Dan crawled. He survived off of cacti. Purely by their juices and flesh. To this day Dan can't help but marvel at his luck. But soon, the cacti were gone and nothing but unrelenting heat remained. Dan thought that was it for him. He crawled to the top of the highest dune ""I'll die close to the sky, so the angels don't have far to go to claim me"" he thought. But the sand at the top broke and sent him into a rolling heap. Dan lost consciousness as he rolled.

When Dan awoke, he found his wounds had been treated. And fresh fruit and water had been laid out for his consumption. He'd awoken in the lushest and most beautiful Oasis that you could possibly imagine, my friends. There are no words to describe what Dan saw. He explored this small rainforest of an oasis. His mind reeled at the discovery! But, as life is want to do, Dan found himself more frightened than he ever had in his life. A monolith, great and terrible to behold stood before him...but the monolith wasn't what frightened him. It was what was coiled around it that petrified Dan.

A snake. A great, venomous serpent with eyes like rubies and fangs larger than Dan himself! The body made of pure muscle slowly uncoiled and the snake, undulating in the most horrific manner ever seen, made his way towards Dan. Dan closed his eyes and prepared for the worst. ""Well, hello there! Welcome to my home, friend!"" A warm voice rumbled. Dan opened an eye and the serpent's head swayed almost...happily? ""Yes! You, friend!"" the mouth moved slowly and carefully, avoiding hissing the syllables. ""Welcome! I hope your wounds are better?""

""Completely healed!"" Dan replied ""How did you do that?""

""You shall find I know many things, young Dan. But for now...stay awhile. Speak with me. It has been at least an age since I have spoken with a human. My name is Na'tha'niel.""

Dan's mouth worked around the name before he simple settled on calling him ""Nathaniel."" It was much easier on the tongue, for sure.

Years passed with Nathaniel and Dan. Dan never seemed to age in the presence of the serpent. And the serpent seemed to relish in his new friend. Finally, one day Nathaniel coiled around his monolith and spoke to Dan with utmost urgency in his voice ""Dan. I will grow old and die here. Soon, I think. But first...I have an egg for you. It will hatch and my son shall spill forth. I wish for you to name him and take him on a journey. I wish for him to see everything, as you have...and when you are done. Bring him here. He shall take up my sacred duty of guarding this monolith. You see...this monolith is a lever. If pushed or pulled...it will destroy the whole of existence. I was placed by the gods to protect it under all circumstances."" Dan nodded and swore to his friend he would do whatever he asked, to repay him for saving his life. ""Excellent. Before you go, Dan...I grant you one final thing. You may choose one of the three...you could be the strongest man in the world, or the smartest...or the most lucky. Please. Choose.""

Dan thought on that for a long time. Finally he spoke up ""Nathaniel, I choose the intelligence. There is so much good I could do with it.""

""Very well. Goodbye, Daniel.""

Dan found himself in front of his old house...it'd never been sold! His bank account had accrued almost fifteen years worth of interest! And in his hands lay an egg, no larger than a football.

In the coming years Dan married. He had children. And founded the most successful and ethical pharmaceuticals company in the history of industry. His company single-handedly cured world hunger, disease and (if you passed the physical) aging. 

The egg had long since hatched, the snake had dubbed himself Jack. Jack was accepted with nothing but love by Dan's wife and children. But soon...Jack matured. It'd been thirty years since Dan had seen his friend, Nathaniel...but it looked like he'd be seeing him, soon.

Dan kissed his wife and children goodbye and he and Jack departed. You don't often see thirty foot long snakes exploring the world, so soon he and Dan were national news! Interviews, talk shows...Jack told his story of his birth. His journey (The monolith was left out). They made t-shirts, they made novelty cups. Soon everyone would chant ""Jack the snake! Jack the snake!"" when Dan and Jack came into town. Years passed and...the US, Canada and Mexico had nothing left to see. It was time to leave. By then the snake was now international news! A sensation! Everyone wanted Jack the Snake to come to their town! And he did. Every town, every city. Every remote monastery and every tomb.

But as Jack and Dan sat atop the world, the North Pole between them Jack spoke ""Dan...I think we're done. We've counted every blade of grass, every grain of sand. We've drunk tea with the most reclusive of monks and we've broken bread with royalty. I think it's time I returned to my father.""

Dan sighed. Stood up and smiled at his surrogate, snakey son. ""You know, Jack."" he said, tears in his eyes ""I think you're right. Let's go. Nathaniel has waited long enough.""

But Jack couldn't go home doing something as mundane as walking. No he had to go in style, my friends. Dan purchased the biggest, most luxurious recreational vehicle known to man. If you can think of it, this thing probably had it. Also it was shiny and that was cool.

The desert was nothing this time. Dan drove his RV though the dunes like they were nothing more than air. He knew they wouldn't need to go by foot. His magical friend would be more than ready for his eternal rest. He'd allow them to arrive safely and without harm. 

""There it is!"" Dan shouted, excitement making his heart pound ""The final dune! Jack!"" The snake looked out of the window, excitement glittering in his ruby eyes. The RV tore up the dune...then promptly lost control as it went over the top.

The RV hurdled at a breakneck pace. Both Jack and Dan were screaming, Dan furiously and desperately tried to regain control. He just couldn't. They'd hit the jungle now, the RV smashing over trees and tearing up underbrush. Dan and Jack screamed for someone, anyone to stop the RV...but then. The monolith! Nathaniel! They were in view, dear readers! Nathaniel uncoiled himself from the world ending device and launched himself from the monolith, landing in a heap next to it. Dan jerked the wheel and a sickening crunch all but tore his heart from his chest. He could hear the man, Zwong, from so long ago laughing. 

He and Jack jumped from the RV and collapsed next to the broken and destroyed skull of Nathaniel. Jack wept bitterly...but Dan only let out a sound of relief. Jack turned, hissing his rage at Dan's unsympathetic response. ""WHY!?"" Jack roared ""WHY DID YOU KILL MY FATHER, DAN!""

Dan only shrugged.

""Better Nate than lever.""",Never seen this one here [long][nsfw],0

The physicist goes second, and he rolls in a huge whiteboard.

After hours and hours of calculations, he finds his answer! He decides to celebrate by going out for a drink before heading home. The next day, he realizes he forgot to actually shoot the gun.

After a whole lot of struggling he finally asks a rabbit if he could help retrieve the thing.

So with a little wiggling and waggling the rabbit drags out from the tree a tarnished and weathered oil lamp almost as big as he. Rabbit and Bear stand about it, perplexed, wondering what it is and what to do with it. It is clearly metal, and you could almost make out a reflection, and as such, rabbit leans in to polish it with his fur to see whether he can see his reflection in it.

**POOF**

Suddenly appears a genie before the two animals, and thus he spoke, ""Since you both have relieved me of my prison I shall grant each of you three wishes. Rabbit, since you did the honors, you may choose first."" Both animals are dumbstruck, not quite sure what to think, but thrilled at the idea of being granted wishes. 

So the rabbit begins, ""I would like to be the fastest of all animals. Faster than all of the other rabbits, faster than the hawks and eagles and owls who would seek to eat me, and faster than the fox and the wolf and even the exotic cheetah so far away. I wish to be the fastest and most agile of animals.""

**POOF** 

The genie grants his wish. The rabbit appears almost more lithe, muscular but sinewy. He springs about with incredible speed and grins, satisfied with his choice.

The bear, however, erupts into laughter, ""Ohhh-hahahaha! Stupid rabbit! You want to be fast?! Bahahaha - don't be silly. You might elude your predators for a time, but when you tire, they will crush you. Me? Genie! I wish to be bigger and stronger! Stronger than any other animal in the forest. I want to be looked upon as a king amongst animals!""

**POOF** 

The bear seems to grow before the rabbits eyes, where the rabbit became strong and sinewy, the bear becomes bulging and titanic. His claws grow longer and stouter, his teeth greater, his muscles rippling under the fur, a terrible sight to behold indeed.

The rabbit, none-too-pleased at the bears condescension and one-upsmanship simply gives the bear a sidelong glance before turning to the genie once more, ""Genie. I wish to have the perfect pair of goggles to fit me. While running, it is a nuisance to feel the wind sting in my eyes.""

**POOF**

A pair of aviator goggles appears in the rabbits hands which the rabbit quickly looks over and responds with a shit-eating grin on his face. He dons the goggles for a quick test and pulls them back up to rest on his forehead, ready to be pulled down at a moments notice.

The bear sniggers softly, shaking his head as the genie turns to him, ""Genie,"" the bear speaks, ""I wish to be glorious, to have the most rugged, beautiful fur and the best scent, so that all the female bears will find me attractive."" 

**POOF** 

The bears fur ruffles and seems to take on a beautiful shimmer in the sun, puffing out and ruffling in all the right ways. The rabbit turns away at the sudden eruption of the bear's potent musk while the bear stands erect, strutting and preening, pleased with himself, showing off to the world.

The rabbit is taken aback by the bears vanity, his mouth partially ajar, regarding the bear with squinted eyes, stunned that *that* is all the bear cares about. When the genie turns to the rabbit asking what his next wish will be the rabbit can only respond with one thing, ""I need another moment.""

So the genie turns back to the bear, ""Since the rabbit needs some time, shall you make your last wish?""

""Of course!"" replies the bear, ""The third wish is the easiest one! I wish that all of the bears in the forest were only ever interested in mating with me!""

**POOF**

And that's when a smirk creeps across the rabbits face. The rabbit had caught something in the language the bear used that perhaps the bear had not. As the genie regards the rabbit he is already beginning, ""I wish,"" the rabbit begins before pausing briefly to lower his goggles over his eyes, ""... that the bear was gay."" 

And with lightning speed the rabbit sprints away faster than the bear can comprehend, even before the genie can fulfill the wish.

**POOF**

The rabbit hears, over the sound of wind rushing by, a ferocious roar from across the forest as he speeds away, laughing.",A bear and a rabbit uncover a magic lamp.,8

 Thinking she might be up for some sexy time I agree "" you go up and I'll let the dog out for a wee and I'll be right up"" I say. So off she goes and I let the dog out in the front garden. 

When I open the door Fido didn't want to go as it was absolutely lashing it down with rain and blowing a gale, anyway with a quick shove with the foot he was out the door. With in a minute he'd done a quick piddle up one of the kids toys that had been left out, I'd dried him off and he was settling down in his bed. 

So off I dashed upstairs hoping to find the Mrs in her best underwear waiting for me with come to bed eyes, instead I found her fast asleep drooling in her big flannel PJs, she really did want an early night. So I go and brush my teeth and jump into bed. After a few minutes of trying to tug some of the cover from the strongest sleeping lady ever I settle down and drift off. 

I must of been asleep for about an hour or so and I was woken up by a loud banging on the front door. The Mrs wakes up "" who the bloody hell is this at this time of night?""  Like I'm some kind of phsyic. I get out of bed, go to put my robe on, can't find it so just throw the wife's little short one on (the one I was hoping she'd be wearing) I run downstairs all the while the banging is still going on. I yank the door open and there's a bloke stood there absolutely wet through, the winds howling and rain's coming down even harder than before 

""What do you want? It's half twelve at bloody night!"" I say rather angrily. ""Could you give me a push?"" He asks 

""Push?! Push? At this time of night, I this weather you must be joking""  and I slam the door in his face. I get back in to bed and the Mrs asks who it was "" it was some crazy man asked me to give him a push""
 

"" What and you didn't?"" She replied ""did I heck"" I say, with this she sits up in a huff, arms crossed  "" have you forgotten already the promised you made to that farmer on our holidays last year? Our car broke down on a similar night to this and we knocked on his door not only did he let us use his phone, he towed the car to his yard and his wife made us coffee while we waited for the recovery tuck and when we offered him some money what did he say?"" 

"" He said he was just being a good Samaritan and all he asked is that I do the same if the need ever arises"" I begrudgingly replied knowing what she was getting at. 

So I Scrabble about looking for some jeans to put on and throw a jumper on go back down the bloody stairs stick my big coat on and open the front door again. The moment I open it the wind blows the rain horizontally into my face the weather is absolutely biblical and it's pitch black I can't see any cars all I can see is the street light down the road rocking backwards and forwards with the wind. 

I shout out ""HELLO!!"" 

Hiya! I hear yelled back 

""DO YOU STILL NEED THAT PUSH?"" 

""YEAH IF YOU DONT MIND?"" He yells again 

""WHERE ARE YOU?"" I shout

The drunk walks into the water and subsequently bumps into the preacher. The Preacher turns around and is almost overcome by the smell of booze. Whereupon he asks the drunk,

‘Are you ready to find Jesus?’

‘Yes I am’ replies the drunk,

So the preacher grabs him and dunks him in the river. He pulls him up and asks the drunk,

‘Brother, have you found Jesus?’

The drunk replies, ‘No, I haven’t.’

The preacher, shocked at the answer, dunks him into the water again, but for a bit longer this time.
He pulls him out of the water and asks again,

‘Have you found Jesus, my brother?’

The drunk again answers, ‘No, I have not found Jesus.’

By this time the preacher is at his wits’ end so he
Dunks the drunk in the water again, but this
Time he holds him down for about 30 seconds.

When the drunk begins kicking his arms and legs, the preacher pulls him up.

The preacher asks the drunk again,

‘For the love of God, have you found Jesus?’

The drunk wipes his eyes and catches his breath and says to the preacher,
‘Are you sure this is where he fell in?",Have you found Jesus?,936

The horse starts playing and boy oh boy can he play, so he decides to take it to the bar, and people love him. He meets a chicken at the bar, and the chicken says ""man with your guitar skills and my singing skills we could get a real band going this could be really cool!"" The chicken continues, ""I have this drum set that I can play but I bet we could find someone"" the horse amazed it was all coming together says ""well I'm sure I could find someone"".


The next day the horse is back at the farm when he hears this pig tapping away on the side of the barn. He knew instantly this pig was the real deal, ""hey pig, play in our band we have a drum set for you"" the pig amused by this says ""sure thing boss, but only if my buddy the donkey can come he plays bass"". ""Alright, we have this gig at the bar tonight meet us there at seven"" eagerly says the horse. So they get there and the bar is packed, of course no one has ever heard of a barn yard band made up of barn yard animals. So they rock the night away and everyone loved it, at the end of the show their approached by this guy in a suit and he tells them ""you guys are going to be huge, now whoever the leader of the band is we have a ticket for you to fly to Hollywood"" the band looks to each other and they all nod in agreement.

So the next day the horse gets on a plane for Hollywood, he gets there signs the contract, and call his buddies to fly down. They all died in that plane it crashed into a mountain, the horse was devastated. He flew back to his home and decided to drink himself silly, the bar tender looked at him and said ""hey buddy, why the long face?"".",The horse joke,3

One day he was walking down the high street, when he noticed a young lady of his congregation sitting in a pub drinking beer. The Reverend wasn’t happy. He walked through the open door of the pub and sat down next to the woman.

“Miss Fitzgerald”, he said sternly. “This is no place for a member of my congregation. Why don’t you let me take you home?”

“Sure”, she said with a slur, obviously very drunk. When Miss Fitzgerald stood up from the bar she began to weave back and forth.

The Reverend realized that she’d had far too much to drink and grabbed her arms to steady her. When he did, they both lost their balance and tumbled to the floor. After rolling around for a few moments, the Reverend wound up on top of Miss Fitzgerald, her skirt hiked up to her waist.

The pub landlord looked over and said,”Oi mate, we won’t have any of that carrying on in this pub.”

The Reverend looked up at the landlord and said, “But you don’t understand, I’m Pastor Fluff.”

The landlord nodded and said, “Oh well, if you’re that far in, you might as well finish.

Trump was quick to stop him saying ""No way buddy, my wife will smell that and think I've been in a damn whorehouse.""
The second barber turned to Obama and said ""How about you?""
Obama replied, ""Go ahead, my wife doesn't know what the inside of a whorehouse smells like.",Donald Trump and Barak Obama end up in the same barbershop,18441

I'm waiting in the self-checkout line and I dropped a $20 bill (yep that's me trying to hold everything because I didn't want a cart). The lady in front of me picked it up. I thanked her and held my hand out, and she said, ""The things found on earth are kept by the collector,"" and walks away. 


I was like oh hell NO!! I looked at the person behind me standing in line, they couldn't believe it either.... this can't be real life right now, right?!


So I took a deep breath and I turned back towards the lady/thief/or whatever you wanna call her and as I approached her I said, ""Do I look like I'm in the mood?! Let's not play games. Go ahead and give me back my money.""


She had the nerve to ignore me completely and TRIED to walk away from me... SOOOOO, of course, I left everything and followed her into the parking lot as I was calling the police (because of course somebody's about to go to jail... not sure who at this point though, her or me). She was almost running at this point to get away from me, which was the first sign of real intelligence  this lady had shown. When she got to her car she put her bags on the ground trying to quickly get her trunk open.


I was boiling at this point! I decided that her “finders keepers"" rule just presented the perfect opportunity for a great teachable moment... SO... I went into track star mode and grabbed her grocery bags, and headed to my car yelling, ""The things found on earth are kept by the collector!"" 


I hopped in my car ignoring her every attempt to get my attention. I was outta line I'll admit, but she was too. I was HOT, but I had a sense of satisfaction at the same time. Lemme say this, anyone who knows me knows that as an adult this is not completely out of character for me. But anyway I get home and open the bags and what did I find?


3 packs of ribeye steaks
3 pounds of wild caught salmon
2 pounds of Vegetables 
Everything to make a bomb salad 
And...
A decent bottle of Whisky 


I can't help but think to myself... WOW! Not bad for $20 dollars!
