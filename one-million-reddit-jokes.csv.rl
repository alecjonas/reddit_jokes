The waiter takes his drinks order, a shaken martini, and heads for the bar to get cracking. As he leaves the man hears a voice call out:

&gt;""Hey Jim, those are great shoes you're wearing""

He thought to himself, ""that's odd, there's nobody else here. Maybe I imagined it"" 

The waiter returns and takes the man's order for his starter and main course, a delicious onion soup followed by a tender fillet steak, cooked rare. As the waiter leaves and heads for the kitchen the man hears the voice call out once again:

&gt;""Hey! Hey Jim - I love that jacket""

The man is understandably disturbed at this point, the restaurant is still empty and he can't see where these kind words are coming from. 

The waiter returns with the man's first two courses and the man says to him 

&gt;""you didn't say something to me as you walked away did you?""

&gt;""no,"" replies the waiter, ""I'm afraid not sir - would you like to order dessert now ready for when you finish your main?""

The man orders a rich chocolate mousse for his dessert, with whipped cream and fresh strawberries, and tops off with another martini, once again shaken not stirred.

As the waiter heads back to the kitchen the man is very confused to once again hear a voice calling him:

&gt;""psst, Jim! I like your hair today. Very stylish""

At this point the man has had enough. He only wants to enjoy his meal in peace. When the waiter returns, mousse in hand, the man says to him 

&gt;""I know you've been talking to me, I heard you""

&gt;""I'm sorry sir,"" says the waiter, ""but I really don't know what you're talking about - there's nobody else here and I've not said anything""

The man reluctantly agrees that he must be imagining things and tucks in to his mousse. As he is finishing up the waiter returns with the bill, and offers the man some mints from the bowl on the side. He takes the payment, through Amex, and makes to leave. Just then, a voice once more calls out to the man:

&gt;""oh, sorry you're leaving, Jim. You're glasses really are the business. You have such style""

The man cries out 

&gt;""there, did you hear that?""

&gt;""oh that,"" says the waiter, ""pay no attention - it's just the complimentary mints!""",A man at a restaurant,38

She kept records and any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced.    

This took a lot of time, so she bought some tiny bells and attached them to her roosters. Each bell had a different tone, so she could tell from a distance which rooster was performing. Now, she could sit on the porch and fill out an efficiency report by just listening to the bells.    

Sarah's favorite rooster, old Butch, was a very fine specimen but, this morning she noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all! When she went to investigate, she saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing, but the pullets hearing the roosters coming, would run for cover.    

To Sarah's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring. He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job, and walk on to the next one.  Sarah was so proud of old Butch, she entered him in a Show and he became an overnight sensation among the judges.    

The result was the judges not only awarded old Butch the ""No Bell Peace Prize"" they also awarded him the ""Pulletsurprise"" as well.    

Clearly old Butch was a politician in the making. Who else but a politician could figure out how to win two of the most coveted awards on our planet by being the best at sneaking up on the unsuspecting populace and screwing them when they weren't paying attention?    

Vote carefully in the next election. You can't always hear the bells. ",Butch the Rooster,271

“Well, let me show you the best part about this place.”

The patron quickly finishes his drink, walks to the edge of the roof, and jumps off. Just as the visitor gasps in horror, the patron floats back onto the roof.

To prove his point, he runs off of the roof again, and once more, floats back onto it. 

“Wow! That’s fantastic!” exclaims the visitor. “Let me try!”

The patron steps aside. The visitor runs to the edge and flings himself into the air. Much to his dismay, he drops like a rock, quickly picking up speed until he meets his untimely demise on the pavement below.

The patron hiccups and turns to the bartender, who is cleaning dishes. “Did you see that, Bruce? Pretty funny, right?”

They’re hacking down trees, killing leopards, and generally doing manly things.

All of a sudden, they are confronted by a group of natives, who grab the trio and drag them to their little village and tie them to stakes, all the while shouting in their own language.

Eventually, a wizened, bent, ancient old white man comes out of one of the little mud huts. He approaches the trio and explains that a very long time ago, he was taken hostage by the tribe, but allowed to live as the sole survivor from a group of explorers. He learned their language and served as a translator for any white men foolish enough to cross them.

He explained that unfortunately, the men had accidentally walked over what the natives considered sacred ground; this was punishable by death. The method of death, was to be skinned alive and turned into a canoe.

However, the old man says, the tribe are a kind and generous people, who will give the condemned one final wish, that they are honour bound to fulfil.

The Englishman, ever brave, elects to die first. He asks that his final wish, as a red-blooded man, is to have one final night of wild passion with the most beautiful woman in the village.

The old man translates and the chief of the tribe goes away, and comes back with a very big, very ugly, very hairy woman. Clearly they had different standards of beauty. But, nonetheless, the Englishman is happy to go off with her and have one final night of passion. In the morning, he is skinned alive and turned into a canoe.

The Scotsman decides to go next. His wish is to get so blindly drunk he won’t even know that he’s being skinned. So the chief gives him a small cup of firewater. The strongest on the planet. The Scotsman drinks it and is immediately horrendously drunk. He stumbles about the village, singing, dancing, and generally causing mischief until morning comes, when he is skinned alive and turned into a canoe.

And finally, it’s the Irishman’s turn. When asked what his final wish is, he asks for a fork. The old man is confused, and asks again. The Irishman insists he just wants a plain old metal fork. So the old man translates and the chief brings him a fork. The Irishman is untied, and he stands in front of them for a moment, before wildly stabbing himself all over his body, screaming;

“YOU’RE NOT GOING TO TURN ME INTO A FUCKING CANOE!”

2. Don't abbrev.
3. Personally, in my opinion, a writer or essayist should not make use of too many words or phrases which he does not necessarily need in many cases.
4. About sentence fragments.
5. Dont, use, commas, when they are, unnecessary.
6. Keep tense consistent. You didn't want to shift from present to past.
7. Use semi-colons; only between; independent clauses; don't scatter them around; indiscriminately.
8. A noun and a verb always agrees with each other.
9. Poor spelling in you're writing makes a bad impresion on a lot of reeders.
10. Slang totally freaks out some blokes, so waste it.
11. Don't repeat; don't be redundant. Don't say the same thing twice, don't be repetitious.
12. Writing dangling modifiers, readers will be confused.
13. A noun must agree with their antecedents.
14. Their is a difference between the use of there and you're use of they're, to. Your two use them correctly in more than too cases.
15. You should avoid the use of nonspecific pronouns in your writing.
16. Well, let me tell you about the mistake that makes a teacher weep enough tears to fill a well. Well, here it is. The use of well at the beginning of a sentence is not only wrong, but... well, stop doing it!
17. But whatever you do, don't compound this crime by substituting ""but"" for ""well"" at the beginning of your sentence. And just to clarify the point, don't start with ""and"" either.
18. After all these mistakes, another one that is worse then the well issue above is than/then because students always seem to confuse the two, than think they are interchangable.
19. English teachers, who are wonderful and skillful in their teaching methods, particularly hate it when their students feel they can take up space and word count by complimenting the very amazing, beautiful, and downright swell righters that they are writing about.
20. Last but not least, avoid clichés like the plague.",Simple instructions from an English teacher for a great essay.,7

""Mommy I'm hungry""

""Well honey go out to the coop and get some eggs and I'll cook breakfast.""

So the boy went out across the yard to the chicken coop. He was delighted to see a fresh laying of eggs, more than he could have asked for. As he reached for the eggs, the chickens pecked at his hands. Despite his efforts, the chickens would not relent, so he grabbed the largest hen and threw her out of the coop. The mother, upon hearing and seeing the commotion, hollered ""Boy you need to learn to be nice to the chickens. No eggs for you today. Now go get some milk from the cow.""

So the boy, grumbling, goes to the barn and retrieves the pail and pedestal. The cow was not in the mood for milking and would not stand still. The boy grew increasingly frustrated and finally struck the cow with the pail. The mother saw again and screamed at him ""Boy didn't you learn from the chickens?! No milk for you today. You treat those animals right! Until you can learn, you're staying home. No playing with your friends.""

The boy hung around the house all day, bored out of his mind. When his father returned from the mill at the end of the day, the boy ran to greet him. As the boy hugged his father, the family cat entwined itself between their legs, causing the pair to stumble. The father exclaimed ""I hate this stupid cat!"" As he raised his leg back to kick the cat out of the way, the boy said ""daddy I wouldn't do that...""",A Boy on the farm,5

Peter looks up and notices that Jesus seems to be calling him, ""Peter, come hither!"" Immediately Peter rushes over to the cross, only to be hit severely over the head by the roman guard. He gets on his feet again and wants to return to the other disciples when he hears Jesus calling again, ""Peter, come hither!"" So, again Peter tries to climb the cross to get to his lord, when the roman soldier draws his sword and chops Peter's arm off. Peter is getting a little pissed and wants to go back to his buddies, but again Jesus summons. The roman guard can't believe that Peter is trying yet AGAIN to climb to the cross, and chops off another arm. Peter is now covered in blood and demented from the blow to the head and wants to call it a day. Jesus hoarsly croaks, ""Peter, please, come to me!"" By now, the roman gurad is tired of chopping limbs, so he lets Peter be. The faithful disciple struggles to climb the cross (without arms mind you) and after a long while he finally arrives at his Lord's side. Hurting, suffering, bleeding, Peter looks into his Master's eyes and asks, ""yes, my Lord. What is it?"" Jesus smiles lovingly and looks off into the distance as a weak smile plays across his face, ""Look Peter, I can see your house from here!""

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" 

Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""The man sets about his task. 


After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery.,0

The town is the normal, cliché Western town, complete with a bank for robbing, a saloon for drinking, a sheriff for sheriffing, and a tumbleweed store for dramatic high-noon dueling. Being the tired and weary traveler that he is, the cowboy heads straight for the saloon and orders a drink.

As he sits at the bar, he gets to talking with the stranger he's sitting next to. It turns out that the man is a foreign horse merchant, and is in town for the next week to sell some of his horses. The cowboy decides to stay in town for the night so he can buy a horse the next day.

The next morning, the cowboy goes to the horse merchant and asks him about the horses. The merchant starts talking about how fast one horse is, how strong another one is, and how smart a different horse is. However, none of those horses draw the cowboy's eye. He walks up to a big, beautiful stallion and asks the merchant, ""What do you call this here horse?""

""Oh, that horse Tim.""

""Alrighty then, how much for Tim?""

""Tim not for sale.""

""Wha- N- Not for sale? Why?""

""Tim don't look too good.""

""'He doesn't look too good'? What are you talking about? This is a beautiful horse!""

""I tell you, he don't look too good. He not for sale.""

This goes for a bit, with the cowboy wanting to buy Tim and the merchant insisting that Tim isn't for sale, until finally, the cowboy pulls out his wallet. ""Hey, I'm offering to pay you for a horse that you think doesn't look good. I think Tim looks perfectly fine.""

""Ok. Give me $400. You buy Tim. Now go.""

The cowboy takes Tim and goes on his way. A few hours later, he comes back, and he's furious.

""Hey, what's your problem, man!? You sold me a blind horse!""

The merchant looks at him and calmly responds, ""I tell you, he don't look so good.""

We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you.

""What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!"", he said to himself.

As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. He turned to look. He saw a 7-foot grizzly charge towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing.

He ran even faster, so scared that tears were coming to his eyes. He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. His heart was pumping frantically and he tried to run even faster. He tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up but saw the bear right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him.

At that instant the Atheist cried out ""Oh my God!....""
Time stopped.
The bear froze.
The forest was silent.
Even the river stopped moving.

As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky, ""You deny my existence for all of these years; teach others I don't exist; and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer?""

The atheist looked directly into the light ""It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask You to treat me as Christian now, but perhaps could you make the bear a Christian?""

""Very well,"" said the voice.
The light went out.
The river ran again.
And the sounds of the forest resumed.
And then the bear dropped his right paw ..... brought both paws together...bowed his head and spoke:

""Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful...AMEN!""",The Atheist and the Bear,8
