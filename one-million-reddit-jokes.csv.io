MAN: ""OK, but for that price I want it with all the

WOMAN: ""Great! Oh, and one more thing. I was just

talking to Janie and found out that the house I wanted

MAN: ""Well, then go ahead and make an offer of

He plops down at the end of the bar next to Old Willy–the guy who's seen more, and knows more, than anyone around.

""Hey Willy,"" the reporter says amicably, ""I'm trying to come up with a good story to write, but nothing's really going on recently.  No crime, no county fair, not even any award-winning high school students!  I'm thinking it'll have to be something retrospective. 
 Would you do me a favor, and tell me about the best day in your memory of this town?""

Old Willy ponders the request for a brief moment, then begins: ""Well, there was that one time farmer Boone's daughter got lost.  Man, we got the whole town together lookin' fer her; every man and boy older'n 13 was out lookin' all day.  We looked over every hill, behind every rock, through every forest.  We finally found her, and man, when we did, we all fucked the *shit* outta that girl!  That was great.""

Being a modern young man, the reporter is rightly horrified.  ""Well, Willy, I certainly can't write about a gang rape!  How about you tell me about the *second* best day you can remember in this town?

Old Willy ponders the request for a brief moment, then begins: ""Well, there was that one time farmer Boone's sheep got lost.

We finally found her, and man, when we did, we all fucked the *shit* outta that sheep!  That was great.""

Head in hands, frustrated and disgusted, the reporter clears his head and gathers himself.  ""Alright Willy, this isn't working,"" he says.  ""Let's try a new tack: what's the *worst* day you can remember?""

Old Willy ponders the request for a brief moment, sighs deeply, then begins: ""Well, there was that one time I got lost...""",It's a slow news day in a small West Virginia town,26

post,918dxy,2qh72,jokes,false,1532362327,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/918dxy/grandpas_tale/,self.jokes,,"Last week, I took my grandchildren to a restaurant. My eight- 
year-old grandson asked if he could say grace.  As we bowed 
our heads he said,


   
""God is good, God is great. Thank you for the food, and I would 
thank you even more if Grandpa gets us ice cream for dessert. 
And liberty and justice for all!   Amen!""


   
Along with the laughter from the other customers nearby, I heard 
a woman remark,   ""That's what's wrong with this country. Kids 
today don't even know how to pray. Asking God for ice cream!


  
Why I never!""
   
Hearing this, my grandson burst into tears and asked me, ""Did I 
do it wrong? Is God mad at me?""


   
After I assured him that he had done a terrific job and that God 
was certainly not mad at him, an elderly gentleman approached 
the table.


   
He winked at my grandson and said, ""I happen to know that God 
thought that was a great prayer."" ""Really?"" my grandson asked. 
""Cross my heart,"" the man replied.


   
Then, in a theatrical whisper, he added (indicating the woman 
whose remark had started this whole thing), ""Too bad she never 
asks God for ice cream. A little ice cream is sometimes good for 
the soul.""


   
Naturally, I bought my grandchildren ice cream at the end of the 
meal.  My grandson stared at his ice cream for a moment, and then 
he did something I will remember the rest of my life. 


  
He picked up his sundae and, without a word, walked over and 
placed it in front of the woman.


   
With a big smile he told her:


   
""Here, this is for you, you grouchy old bitch. Shove it up your ass!""


  
Kind of brings tears to your eyes

Low and behold, after a few seconds into relieving himself a very short man walks in and begins peeing in the urinal next to him. Curious about the little fellow, the man looks over the wall separator and tries to get a glimpse of the smaller man's penis. To his surprise, the short man the longest and girthiest penis the man has ever seen. ""Truly this short man is blessed."" he thinks to himself.

The smaller man notices the man looking at his privates and starts up a casual conversation, ""I see you've noticed my penis there, sir. Do you know why mine is so large?""

The man replies, ""No I don't, tell me.""

The shorter man exclaims, ""It's because I'm a Leprechaun, and now that you know my secret I am obliged to give you three wishes. Ask for whatever you want, it will be so.""

The man, pauses and in disbelief and sarcasm, ""Yeah, sure pal, how about a million dollars? Let's see you make that happen.""

The leprechaun snaps his finger and says, ""When you arrive home, there will be a suitcase of money on your dinner table, totally $1,000,000 USD.""

The man, now no longer apprehensive makes his next wish, ""I wish for a mansion, a great big house.""

The leprechaun snaps his fingers and says, ""Your crappy and meager house will no longer be there when you return, you will have a mansion fit for a king.""

The man, now with a glint in his eye and happiness on his face says, ""Thank you Mr. Leprechaun, thank you.""

The leprechaun replies, ""You have on more wish, ask for anything you want.""

The man immediately says, ""I want a hot babe of a wife, a drop dead gorgeous woman with huge cans.""

The leprechaun snaps his fingers and says, ""When you get home to your mansion, your new supermodel wife will be a in french-maid outfit with her cleavage bursting from her chest and prepare a feast for you on the same table your million dollars is on.""

The man is ecstatic, he cannot wait to leave the restroom and go home. As he begins to leave, the leprechaun stops him and says, ""Sir, you cannot leave yet.""

The man say's, ""Why not? I've asked for my wishes and you've given them to me. I am off to enjoy my new life.""

The leprechaun say's, ""Well, there is a cost for these three wishes. If you do not pay it then I will snap my fingers and take my wishes back.""

The man say's, ""What is the price?""

The leprechaun smiles and replies, ""You must let me fuck you in the ass until I am satisfied. Do you agree?""

The man, dumbfounded, terrified, thinking of the size of the leprechaun violating him thinks to himself, *""Do I give up this new life I have just found or swallow my pride and let this leprechaun violate me?""*

#30 minutes later

In the stalls of the restroom, the man is crying and holding his pain and tears back, as much as he can. The Leprechaun, thrusting and thrusting, exacting the price of the wishes from the man. To take the man's mind off the pain, the leprechaun ask the man a question, ""What is your name, sir?""

The man squeaks, ""Bob...""

The leprechaun replies with another question, ""Bob, how old you are?""

The man chokes out, ""45.""

The leprechaun says, ""Bob, you're 45 and you still believe in leprechauns?""",Leprechauns do exist,12

Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married O.Schitt, the owner of Kneedeep N.Schitt Inc. 

In turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt, and the deeply religious couple produced 6 children: Holie Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Giva Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins: Deap Schitt and Dip Schitt. Against her parents' advice, Deap Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school drop out. After being married for 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced. Noe Schitt later married Mr Sherlock, and wanted to keep her previous name.

She was then known as Noe Schitt-Sherlock. Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt and they produced a nervous son, Chicken Schitt. Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony. The wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens wedding. The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Hoarse. Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world. He recently returned from Italy with his new bride, Pisa Schitt. So now when someone says, ""you don't know Jack Schitt"", you can correct them.",Who is Jack Schitt?,21

""Welcome to heaven,"" said St. Peter. ""Before you get settled in though, it seems we have a problem. You see, strangely enough, we've never once had an executive make it this far and we're not really sure what to do with you.""

""No problem, just let me in."" said the woman.

""Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in.""

“Actually, I think I've made up my mind. I prefer to stay in heaven"", said the woman.

""Sorry, we have rules."" And with that St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and it went down-down-down to hell. The doors opened and she found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club and standing in front of her were all her friends - fellow executives that she had worked with and they were all dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and they talked about old times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the country club where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy (kinda cute) and she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. She was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everybody shook her hand and waved good-bye as she got on the elevator.

The elevator went up-up-up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates and found St. Peter waiting for her. ""Now it's time to spend a day in heaven,"" he said.

So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her.

""So, you've spent a day in hell and you've spent a day in heaven. Now you must choose your eternity,"" he said.

The woman paused for a second and then replied, ""Well, I never thought I'd say this, I mean, heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in hell.""

So St.Peter escorted her to the elevator and again she went down-down-down back to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in rubbish and filth. She saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the rubbish and putting it in sacks. The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her.

""I don't understand,"" stammered the woman, ""yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of rubbish and all my friends look miserable.""

The Devil looked at her and smiled.

""Yesterday we were recruiting you; today you're staff.""","One day while walking down the street, a highly successful executive was tragically hit by a bus and died.",109

A few days after washing up onshore, the American is gazing over at the neighbouring island and spots a Japanese soldier staring back at him.

The American tries shouting out to the man but decides it is much to far of a distance to be heard, so he decides to use hand signals.

By holding his arms straight out to his sides and waving them slowly, he asks ""Are you in the Air Force?""

He then makes a swimming motion with his arms to ask ""Are you in the Navy?""

Then goes on to hold up his fist to ask ""Are you in the Army?""

And finally he holds his hands up to his eyes in the shape of binoculars to ask ""or...are you a Spy?"" 

The Japanese soldier does not respond, so he tries again with his hand signals...""Are you in the Air Force?...Are you in the Navy?...Are you in the Army?...Are you a Spy?""

The Japanese man suddenly responds by ducking behind the closest tree to hide.

The American tries one last time with his signals.. ""Are you in the Air Force?...Are you in the Navy?...Are you in the Army?...Are you a Spy?""

Eventually he gives up and doesn't see the Japanese soldier again. A few days later a large American warship comes through and rescues both men off their respective islands. They immediately detain and begin interrogating the Japanese man, but he is far too shaken to cooperate.

The Captain of the ship asks the American Soldier, ""What on earth did you do to that Japanese Soldier, he is terrified of us because of you!""

The American Soldier responds, ""Captain, all I did was ask him (while doing the hand motions), are you in the Air Force?...Are you in the Navy?...Are you in the Army?...Are you a Spy?""

Right, well what he understood was:
At quarter to three, I'm going to swim over there and fuck you in the ass 'till your eyeballs pop out.

Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",A Man Wakes Up Dazed and Confused in a Strange City,53

One day, a Navajo elder and his son were herding sheep and came across the space crew. The old man, who spoke only Navajo, asked a question that his son translated. ""What are these guys in the big suits doing?""

A member of the crew said they were practicing for their trip to the moon. The old man got all excited and asked if he could send a message to the moon with the astronauts. Recognizing a promotional opportunity, the NASA folks found a tape recorder.

After the old man recorded his message, they asked his son to translate it. He refused. The NASA PR people brought the tape to the reservation, where the rest of the tribe listened and laughed, but refused to translate the elder's message.

Finally, the NASA crew called in an official government translator. His translation of the old man's message was: ""Watch out for these guys; they have come to steal your land."" ",NASA was preparing for the Apollo project.,29

Regretfully, st . Peter says that heaven is full and as a result he can only choose one of them.
“Tell me about how you died and I will decide who shall go forth” he said.

The first man steps forward and says 
“I was a hardworking husband devoted to my family and my job. I had just finished a long hard days work and returned to my apartment on my 23rd floor building complex when I heard my wife giggle from the bedroom. Suspicious, I burst into the room to find my wife, naked and shocked, in bed. I said three words: where is he? My wife refused to tell me so I searched the place until I found a man in his underwear dangling from my balcony, clinging on to dear life. I hesitated - but then the bastard smiled at me. In a blind fit of rage I bashed at his hands as a look of utter terror rushed over his face. Eventually the man’s grasp escaped him as I watched him plummet 23 floors. Yet to my bewilderment, he landed in a bush and I watched him stand up unscathed. The bastard then began looking up at me and laughing! By this point I was seething so I ran into the kitchen, picked up my large fridge and threw it over the balcony and watched it fall 23 floors and crush him. Straight after - I don’t know whether it was the anger, panic or strain of picking up a really heavy fridge - I had a heart attack and died”

“Right” said St. Peter “what about you?” 

The second man stepped forward and said

“Well I had been dancing in my underwear on my 24ft floor apartment balcony when I had suddenly slipped and fell over the rail. Luckily I managed to grip onto the balcony below and was left dangling above 23 floors. I was terrified but I thought I was saved when I saw the owner of the apartment come onto the balcony and noticed me. I let out a sigh and smile of relief. However with a crazed look on his face he began smacking my hands over and over until I fell to the ground. Yet to my amazement I had landed in a bush and was totally fine. I couldn’t believe my luck - I had just fell 24 stories! So I looked up at the height I had fell and laughed in disbelief. That’s when I noticed a fridge falling at me with incredible speed, and it was too late. It crushed me to death.”

“Okay” said St. Peter. “And what about you?”

The third man came forward.

“Well, I was in this fridge...”  ",Three men are at the pearly white gates of heaven and are greeted by St. Peter,15

  A ""friend of a friend"" put him in touch with a nefarious
underworld figure who went by the name of ""Artie.""
Artie explained to the husband that his going price for
snuffing out a spouse was $5,000. The husband said he was willing to pay that amount but that he wouldn't have any cash on hand until he could collect his wife's insurance money. Artie insisted on being paid something up front.

The man opened up his wallet, displaying the single
dollar bill that rested inside. Artie sighed, rolled his eyes, and reluctantly agreed to accept the dollar as down payment for the dirty deed.

A few days later, Artie followed the man's wife to the local Safeway grocery store. There, he surprised her in
the produce department and proceeded to strangle
her with his gloved hands.

As the poor unsuspecting woman drew her last breath
and slumped to the floor, the manager of the produce
department stumbled unexpectedly onto the
scene. Unwilling to leave any witnesses behind, Artie
had no choice but to strangle the produce manager as well.

Unknown to Artie, the entire proceedings were capturedby hidden cameras and observed by the store's securityguard, who immediately called the police.

Artie was caught and arrested before hecould leave the store. Under intense questioning at the police station, Artie revealed the sordid plan, including his financial arrangements with the hapless husband.

And that is why, the next day in the newspaper,
the headline declared: ""Artie Chokes Two For A Dollar At Safeway.""

Later that evening, the woman's husband comes in from work and once more the parrot ejaculates, this time saying ""Fuck me Keith, long time no see!""",Three parrots are in a pet shop for sale,32

He loads his weapon, undoes the safety, and lines up his sight. To his surprise, all of a sudden a bear appears in his scope point blank. The bear pulls its claw back ready to slice the atheist open when he cries out, ""oh God if you're there please help!""

The bears stops moving, the river stops running, and the birds stop chirping. The atheist looks up to see the clouds part and the sky open wide. God emerges and says, ""well, well, well, Mr. Atheist. After all these years of telling people I don't exist, you seek me out to help you in a time of need and desperation.""

The atheist cannot deny. He apologizes for all the bad he has said against God and begs for his forgiveness. God is not moved by his attempt. The atheist then comes up with an idea, ""if you can't make me Catholic, can you at least make the bear Catholic?""

God ponders the question a bit and finds it to be a very good idea. The atheist thanks God for the humbling interaction and noted that he too will be a better Catholic moving forward. God sighs and life resumes. The birds begin chirping, the river flowing, and the bear unleashing his fury when all of a sudden it stops. It repositions the man, gets on its knees, and says, ""bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts we are about to receive from thy bounty. Through Christ, our Lord, amen.""



Backstory: my nearly 90 year old neighbor is a total jokester and he tells this one to everyone he meets at least twice. Whenever anyone asks ""is the Pope is Catholic"" or ""does a bear shit in the woods,"" he'll respond with ""is the Bear Catholic?"" to prelude his joke. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did

The highly disciplined German police enter the forest and through a coordinated effort using various traps and tactics, they manage to catch a wild rabbit in 5 minutes.

Up next, the French police immediately huddle up and have an intelligence gathering meeting where they investigate and manage to find the den of a wild rabbit, smoking it out and catching it under 3 minutes.

Finally, the Turkish police dive into the forest and disappear from sight. Hours pass and there is still no sign of them. Just when the competition is about to disperse, the Turkish authorities show up with a grizzly bear. The grizzly bear is in handcuffs and is beaten up to a pulp. The competition's jury asks, ""Where the hell is the wild rabbit?"" One of the Turkish policemen hit the bear in the gut and shouts, ""TALK MOTHER FUCKER!"".

His father grew and sold raw sugar cane. As Juan grew, he realized that while he may not have a lot of resources, he had his mind. He knew that he could process the sugar cane into sugar and sell it for more. He does this and soon has a crude machine that chops the cane, boils it, and leaves the crystalized sugar behind. This soon starts bringing in more money for the family, so Juan takes it upon himself to generate new income. 

He's discovered that by mixing the sugar with water, it'd create a sweet drink, and by adding boiled fruit extracts, it tasted even better. By chance, he found a natural spring that had carbon dioxide infused in the water, giving it a bubbly texture. He mixed this with his sugar and fruit and created the world's first soft drink. This was a big success for him and he opened a factory to create more of it, right there in his home village. He would go far away to find new flavours from citrus trees, cocoa plants, sarsaparilla, berries, you name it. In addition to his soda company, he developed new recipes for ice cream and had a successful company making all sorts of frozen desserts. 

One day, a terrible storm was forecasted to come. 
For days, people were told to evacuate but Juan wanted to stay. He felt that he had come from nothing and he had built everything up with his own hands and mind. If his factories were to be threatened, he wanted to stay with them and make it through the storm. People watched fearfully at the factory, situated in the valley while they sought shelter on the mountaintops. A flood came, and the water levels rose, threatening the factories. They watched as the water tore the buildings apart, knowing the fate of Juan inside. 

The next day, Juan came up, with nothing but his clothes, still sopping wet. The villagers asked him how he had managed to survive the floodwaters, as the buildings were quickly torn to shreds. Juan only said ""As I stood in my office, watching the waters rise, I felt at peace. I took a tall glass, two scoops of my ice cream, and a sarsaparilla drink and mixed them together. You see- the reason I never drowned or sank in those waters was because of that root beer float.""",The Story of Juan,0

Sarah stood up and exclaimed:

This lady's completely out of place; dressed to the nines, talk-to-the-manager haircut, the works. She hands our man Joe a tiny paint chip and says, ""I need this exact color. It has to be perfect.""

Joe says, ""Well, it's a bit smaller than we like to work with, but let me see what I can do."" He puts it through the spectrophotometer, gets a formula, and mixes it on up. Upon inspection, the lady says, ""That will never do, it's not quite right."" So he tries again, and again the results just don't measure up. A third try, and not only are both Joe and the customer getting frustrated, he can see that his coworkers and other customers are starting to get annoyed by how much time it's taking. The lady says, ""Look, you're obviously just not gonna get this right. Let me have my chip back and I'll go somewhere where they know their jobs.""

Well, Joe's already on edge, and this fresh insult is the last straw. But he's been at this for years, he knows how to keep a customer service face. ""Ma'am, let me try just one more thing, and if I can't get it right then you have my blessing to try another store.""

""Well, all right. But you've already wasted enough of my time. You have five minutes."" Joe nods, and takes the chip and disappears into the back room. (Meanwhile, his coworker just rolls his eyes at being left alone.)

Shortly, noises can be heard from the stockroom. There's thuds, some grinding, the occasional swear... it sounds like a paving crew have set up shop. Just as the five minutes runs out, Joe reappears with a gallon canister, which he opens and puts together a sample for the lady to compare to her chip. Immediately her demeanor changes.

""That's perfect, young man! You've absolutely got it."" and just on and on. Joe grins and wishes her a good day, and watches as she pays and leaves, then calls the next customer over.

""I don't know how you dealt with that woman. You didn't even get mad! But, you've gotta tell me. How did you manage to get her color?""

post,90vc15,2qh72,jokes,false,1532233790,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/90vc15/a_story_about_a_traveler/,self.jokes,,"There was a once a traveler, who had traveled nearly everywhere. He’d been to France, Rome, Africa and even the icewall. 
One day he had entered this city he had never been in before. He was walking down the street for a place to stay when he saw this women talking on her phone and just wasn’t stopping. As she crossed the road a incoming truck wouldn’t stop and nearly hit her, until the traveler had pulled her out of the way. The women, still talking  on her phone, looked at the man and said thank you and handed him $200.00. The traveler was in awe at the amount of money he was given for his small deed. Now, the traveler had never had this much money at once, but he had worked jobs to get bits of cash for traveling. So he decided that he would go on a cruise ship, because it was a easy way to travel to many places.
So he had headed down to the library and got on a computer and looked up, “cruise ships for $200.00”
He had began scrolling through, finding one for $299, $250, $469, he didn’t know why that one is there, but he kept scrolling, until finally he had found one. All they way at the bottom of the third page one his preferred search engine, was one for exactly $200 with tax included. It told him to meet by the dock at 6PM on Tuesday, which happened to be tomorrow.
So, the next day he went down to the dock at 6PM and told the captain waiting at the dock, 
“I’m here for the 6AM cruise for $200” 
“Oh, that will be tomorrow at 6AM” said the captain
So, the traveler went back to his hotel and slept until the next day, and woke up at 7:50 AM to go the dock. 
The traveler spoke to the captain and said, yet again,
“Hi, I’m here for the 6AM cruise for $200”
The captain responded this time saying,
“Ah yes, let me show you around”
The traveler had been taken to the front deck and the captain spoke to him saying 
“Now let me show you to you’re room, although it’ll be away, it’s a ways from here.”
The traveler, being fine with anything, followed the captain down past the main quarters, VIP quarters, the kitchen, the dining area and even past engine room all the way down right where the hull began to curve, and right straight to the bottom where it flattened out. 
“Alright, this is where you’ll be sleeping. This door will be locked all day until 12 AM to 6 AM. That is when you’ll be allowed to leave. We will serve you food right through this hole.”
The captain pointed to a hole that looked like a letter hole in a door, but only bigger. The traveler was ok with this and rolled out his sleeping bag and stuff and slept until it was 12. Exactly at that time, he heard someone walk down and unlock the door. He exited the room and began walking around. Searching for things to do, he found a pool. He was told he could do anything, so he began diving. He hadn’t dived much in his time, so he began teaching himself how to. He did this every night until the captain came out because he couldn’t sleep. He saw this traveler diving and was in awe. He saw him doing amazing dives the traveler taught himself over time. He told the traveler he could perform at the next nights show and live on the cruise ship for a while.
So the next night, he had done many different great dives and had the crowd screaming. So the captain decided to raise the height to 20 feet. And he kept doing this after each show to 25, 30, 40 until they hit 50 feet. The captain came to the traveler and told him,
 “Hey, you’re pretty good at diving, i the record is 63 feet. I think you can beat that and do 100 feet. I’ll have to make the pool a lot deeper, but I think you can do it. Also, a lot of people want to see this. So we’ll do it tomorrow at the harbor. 
So the next day came, and the traveler got ready. Almost the whole city showed up just to see this one traveler dive. So he climbed the ladder, up past the trees, past the clouds until he had hit the top. He could see the pool, but was sure he could do it. So he jumped and did the most graceful swan dive and did three front flips, three backflips until going back into a dive. As he hit the water, he had made no splash whatsoever.
A couple of minutes had passed and the traveler still had not come up. A few began worrying about him until one boy noticed that the water was draining. The captain was alerted and looked at the pool. It was completely empty, until they noticed that the traveler has crashed through every single, even past his room at the bottom and was sitting at the bottom of the boat in the ocean. 
The captain looked down and asked,
“Hey, you ok?”
The traveler responded,
“Yeah. I’m fine. I’ve been through many a hardship.”",A Story About a Traveler,0

This girl is in excellent shape and I do my best, but no such luck. So for the next four days, the same routine happens and I'm gradually getting in better and better shape.  Much to my delight on the fifth day when I weigh myself, I
discover that I have lost 20 lbs. As promised.
 
So I decide to go for broke and called the company to order the 7-day/50 pound program.
 
""Are you sure?"" asks the representative on. ""This is our most rigorous program.""
 
""Absolutely,"" I reply, ""I haven't felt this good in years.""
 
The next day there's a knock at the door; and when I open it find a huge muscular guy standing there wearing nothing but pink running shoes and a sign around his neck that reads, ""If I catch you,... You're mine.""
 
I lost 63 pounds that week.

Later that week, the boy is watching Animal Planet on tv with his Father and sees two lions going at it. The Father, noticing the puzzled look on his face, quickly changes the channel and tells the boy that the lions were hungry, so they were making some Fish Sticks.

That weekend, the boy awakens from a nightmare during his nap, and heads off to his parents room. Opening the door, he sees his Mother bolt upright, grabbing a sheet to cover their naked bodies with. The boy, getting angry, asks ""you were making Fish Sticks and you already ate them didn't you?""

Pleased with the feeling that she's off the hook, the Mother replies ""yes, I'm sorry we didn't save you any."" Then, curiosity getting the better of her, and wanting to know that she was doing a good job as a parent, she asks him how he knew what they were doing.

Paddy says in agreement: ""Murphy that is as good an idea as you'll ever have, but I'm pretty sure that you have to pay taxes and duty on things like that. The shopkeeper will never let us have them if he thinks we're going to export them and make our fortune, so he won't.""

Murphy thinks and says: ""Paddy, I've got an idea! You can do the best English accent out of the pair of us. You go in there and do the talking and I'll just stand behind you and say nothing. He'll never guess we're Irish. No he won't.""

""OK"", agrees Paddy, ""I'll do the talking, you just stand there and look English.""
