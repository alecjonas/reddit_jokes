As I went to get the bread she asked me if I could change my gloves cause she was vegan and I had been handling meat. I did that, no problem, perfectly reasonable request. I get her bread, toast it and put all the veggies she wants on it, I start to wrap up her sandwich when she says, ""can I get some mayo?""

...

I look at her, she's looking at me, I pick up the mayo, I'm waiting for her to be like haha jk.

Nothing.

Me: ""You know mayonnaise has eggs in it right?""

THIS. GIRL. JUST. STOOD. THERE. SILENT.

She stood there for a second.

V: ""N-no it doesn't, I get mayo every time, are you sure?""

Me: ""Yes ma'am, mayo has egg whites in it.""

I felt so horrible, she stood there with such a distraught and defeated face, I had shattered this poor girl's world.

I had a couple people waiting so I had to get this lady out of here.

Me: ""Would you like the mayo on it ma'am?""

V: ""Sure, go ahead.""

She sounded so done, so defeated,

So I gave her her mayo, wrapped her sandwich up and charged her for her sandwich, she was silent the whole time. She took her sandwich and started walking out.

Me: ""Thank you for coming, have a nice day!""

She just looked at me, sighed, ""yea, I'll try"" and walked out.

""Well,"" says the *consigliere*, ""first you need the best food.  The best parties have the best food.""  The Don nods and writes it down.  ""Then you need the best entertainment: clowns, jugglers, that band your son likes, and of course you need a mime.""  The Don writes this all down and says ""Money is no object, go out and find the best of the best for my son.""

The day of the party comes and everything is wonderful. The hall is decked in the most luxurious assortment of amenities one could ask for, streamers adorn every surface, there's music and laughter coming from every direction.  The caterers arrive and the food is amazing, succulent, decadent, delightful.  The clowns arrive and perform their act and there are howls of laughter and tears of sadness.  The band arrives and performs his son's favorite song, and everyone is wowed. 
The mime shows up an hour late.  He's obviously drunk, he's unshaven, and his makeup is sloppily put on, but he starts his act.  Soon there are boos and hisses and mocking laughter from the crowd as the mime tries and fails to do even the simplest act.  The Don, enraged, tells his son to look away, and draws his gun and puts it to the mime's temple.  ""You disgrace yourself, and ruin the day of my son's birthday, how dare you.""  He draws back the hammer and is about to fire when the *consigliere* puts his hand on the gun and gently pushes it away.

He was embarrassed but regained his composure to deliver his paper. As he concluded, he raced out the stage door, never to be seen in his hometown again.



Decades later when his elderly mother was ill, he returned to visit her. He reserved a hotel room under a false name, Solomon Levy, and arrived under cover of darkness. The desk clerk asked him, ""Is this your first visit to our city, Mr. Levy?""



Dr. Epstein replied, ""Well, young man, no, it isn't. I grew up here but then I moved away.""



""Why haven't you visited?"" asked the desk clerk.



""I did visit once, many years ago, but an embarrassing thing happened and since then I've been too ashamed to return.""



The clerk consoled him. ""Sir, while I don't have your life experience, one thing I have learned is that often what seems embarrassing to me isn't even remembered by others. I bet that's true of your incident too.""



Dr. Epstein replied, ""Son , I doubt that's the case with my incident.""

The official announces the final word to be ""Timbuktu"", Preston thinks for a moment then indicates that he's ready to start.

We lined them up two-by-two,
And drove them into Timbuktu.

He's known as Billyjoe Jim-Bob from the Bayou and this is the first time he's been away from home. Whether he's literate is up for debate but he does have a way with words. He approaches the podium and the official tells him ""Timbuktu."" Billyjoe mutters to himself and thinks long and hard, almost until the clock runs out, until he finally says he's ready.

“Susy what did you do during recess?”

“I played in the sandbox next to Bobby”

“Wow box sounds like a fun word to spell! If you can come up to the board and spell box I will give you a fresh baked cookie”
Susy gets the cookie.

Teacher asks what he did during recess.
Gerome responds:
“I wanted to play in the sand box next to Bobby and susy but they wouldn’t let me because I’m black”

“Wow that sounds like blatant racial discrimination! If you can come up to the board and spell blatant racial discrimination I’ll give you a fresh baked cookie!”",Three kids walk in from recess...,2

And whose given name was 'Onestone'.

He hated that name and asked everyone not to call him Onestone.

After years and years of torment,

Onestone finally cracked and said,'

If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!'

The word got around and nobody called him that any more.

Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird forgot and said,

'Good morning, Onestone.'
He jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night.

He made love to her all the next day,

Until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.

The word got around that Onestone meant what he promised he would do.

Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until

A woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away.

Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin,

Was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.

She hugged him and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.'

Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest,

Then he made love to her all day,

Made love to her all night,

Made love to her all the next day,

Made love to her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!

post,8ujewu,2qh72,jokes,false,1530192567,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8ujewu/so_a_man_walks_into_a_bar/,self.jokes,,"So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can’t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there’s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.

So the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”

And the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”

So the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.

So the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”

And the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

So the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”

And the guy’s, like, “World peace.”

So the bartender is understandably ashamed.

And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.

And the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”

And the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”

But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”

And the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”

And the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”

And the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”

So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.

And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”

And the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”

And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”

And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”

And then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”

And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!

And the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”

And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”

And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”

And the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.

And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.

And the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”

And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”

And the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”

And he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.

And suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.

And the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”

And the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”

And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”

And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.

So the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.

So the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”

And the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.

And the guy’s, like, “Well done.”

And then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.”

And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.

And the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”

And the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.” ♦

Seven years wasted. One time, Rob told Jack that he had been planning to kill himself, but that he can't. There just isn't a way out. The guards won't let him. Rob and Jack have both been sentenced for life in this shithole of a place. It is'nt even a normal jail. It's \*fucking\* Securia. This is an infamous and deserted place, far away from civilization. It has been installed by the American government to isolate enemies of the state. The security in here is from disproportional levels. Unparalleled knowledge of robbing individual freedom, Securia has at least 50 patrols guarding the whole place, every hour of the day. It's sole purpose, is to keep the prisoners alive. Alive is probably not the correct word, since the prioners are on the verge of death. In total, there are 16 prisoners. That means there are almost 3 guards for every prisoner. Including Rob and Jack. Especially Rob and Jack. After seven years, Rob knows the sentence of every other prisoner.

Every day is the same, the prisoners are all working their asses off by doing simple, brainless tasks. As a prisoner you wake up at 6:00, get assigned to a new task every day, and you have to perform that task until 17:00. When they do not achieve the goal, they are sent back to their cells. When you do achieve the near impossible goal, you receive a carton of cigarettes and you get to spend 15 minutes in the courtyard of Securia, with the other prisoners that have completed the goal of the day. Today, Rob did it again. The first time was on his second day in Securia, where he solved 750 rubiks cubes. The second time he had beaten the Warden his highscore on Pacman. The Warden sure had a weird sense of humor, since his high score was fairly easy to best. 16 out of 16 prisoners were allowed to go outside that day. An important event for the prisoners in Securia, since 16 out of 16 prisoners made up The Plan at that point. Today, it was Rob his 3rd success. This time, he chopped enough wood to achieve the goal. He is escorted to the courtyard, where he will spend 15 minutes of pure joy. He inhales deeply. Fresh air. That sure was a long time ago. but wait- what was that? Someone is approaching. The person had a wide grin on his face. His face starting to become more and more clear.

**It was Jack.**

*""Jack!!.""* says Rob, almost shouting with excitement.

*""Whatsup fambroghini?""* answers Jack. They both stare at each other. They hadn't seen each other in a long time. Rob remembers him well. He was an absolute unit. He had the nickname ""Beast"", so it's not a surprise that he also chopped enough wood today, and reached the goal. The thing about Jack is, that he just isn't that.. smart.

He is actually pretty dumb.

*""I'm fine, but lets talk business. We have been waiting for this for so long. One minute has passed already.""* Rob is dead serious. Jack still looks at Rob in a kind of funny way. Rob remembers the pacman challenge and all the stories Jack told Rob about his romantical adventures, the ladies probably like his appearance with that dumb, boyish attitude.

*""Yeah you are right.. So we really doing this, Rob?""*

Jack thinks and they look at each other. Still Jack has a wide grin. Rob takes a deep breath of air. Man, do they reek. A mixture of sweat, defecation, blood and piss. To another human, they would appear to be closer to being dead than being alive. Rob looks like he hasn't eaten a proper meal in a few weeks. Which was partially true. He had been eating rice and beans for a new record of eleven days. The guards really hate him, and want to see when Rob will break. He promised himself he would never give in. Fuck those guys.

*""I'm done being in this place. I made sure the head of patrol tonight won't raise hell when we make the trade with him.""*

*""Well done. From now onwards untill our cells, no more talking and stick to the plan no matter what.""* answers Jack.

He was clearly agitated. The trade involved both of their packs of cigarettes. The guards weren't allowed to smoke in Securia; an arrangement the guards really hated, because somehow; every guard in Securia used to smoke. The rule was installed by the Warden, so that the guards would hate the prisoners even more than they already did. Either way, Rob and Jack knew it: tonight would be their chance. There are so much reasons the plan could fail. So many factors determinate the rate of success. Obviously achieving the goal of the day was hard enough. It also requires two prisoners to follow The Plan. Furthermore, there was only one corrupted guard, which had to be assigned head of the nightshift in order to receive an unguarded night for the two prisoners. Since this corrupted guard would quit his job in one year due to retiring, tonight is their chance.

Rob and Jack both  slid their pack of cigarettes in the pocket of the corrupted guard when they re-entered their cells. (Jack nearly cried because of this because ""he chopped a shitload of wood yo!"")

Back in their cells, Rob noticed that once the moment was there to rotate for the guards, no one came back. The deal must have worked! That means that the deal apparently worked, and they had a full night for themselves. It was worth the trade. He was able to do whatever he wanted for a whole night. It almost felt like freedom for a second, he realised that the thick iron bars illustrated quite the opposite of that image.

The Plan was simple and contained three parts

**dig through the cell**

**walk through the front door by pressing the emergency button**

**escape**

The first part is to dig through the floor of their cell. Since the guards are always busy guarding cells, this part is fairly simple, but due to the patrols it used to be impossible. The second part was based on speculation: All the supplies are handled by the Warden during the day, where they arrive through the main hall. Shipments like rice and beans, but also shipments full of wood to be chopped for the challenge. That means there should be a window of opportunity during the night, where it would be unsurveilled. The plan was to basically walk through the front door and run, escaping whatever might be out there..

*""This is it. Let's start now Jack, here goes nothing.""* Rob whispers.

*""Sure thing, I'm on it as well. Good luck Rob!""* Jack answers.

""*Shh!! quiet, idiot!""* Rob hisses, afraid that the volume of Jack his manly voice will alarm a guard.

The digging was the nastiest part in their plan. But it was the first part, and they were prepared. The only thing they have in their cell was a mattress. It got changed every other year. The floor was just sand. The short amount of sleep they have is uncomfortable as dog shit. There are tons of bugs crawling through the sand. Rob even remembers that one day a snake crawled towards him. Instead of acting, the guards simply laughed about it.

But yeah. Right. The nasty part of their plan. The cell does not have a proper facility to handle defecation. So, all of the prisoners just dug a really big hole to shit in. To the sheer amusement of the guards.

But that hole was a great start, to dig a way through their cells.

Rob his thought are interrupted by a really weird sound. It almost sounded kinda spongy? oh- Jack probably jumped in his hole and started digging.

Here goes nothing. Rob jumps in and it makes the same spongy sound as he heard earlier. A substance made of shit, piss and sand. He has to vomit immediately after jumping. ""Probably can't get any nastier."" he thinks to himself.

They are both digging horizontally through their holes and have to climb out every now and then to check how far their progress is. A couple of times they quietly try to discuss the estimated time they need to complete the dig. After what feels like hours of digging through shit, they finally are able to dig to the surface. Jack is faster and waits for Rob. After 15 minutes they can physically shake hands and start walking towards the main hall. Their hearts are racing in their chests. They are afraid of being caught, no one has ever tried to escape Securia. But the consequences/punishment couldn't be worse than the circumstances they currently live in anyway.

They reach the main hall. A gorgeous setting with exotic plants on the sides, an enormous stairway and the ceiling is really far above their heads. At this point, they are both slowly walking towards the huge wooden door. They need to stick to The Plan. They can reach the emergency button if one of them stands on the shoulder of the other. They get closer and closer, and Jack loses his patience. He decides to take a sprint towards the button. Hesitating at first, Rob decides to chase Jack. They reach the door and they both glance at the emergency button they have only heard rumors of.

*""You stand on my shoulders, I can easily hold you.""* says Jack whilst kneeling.

Rob climbs on, and is now standing on Jack his shoulders. Finally the masculinity of Jack pays off big time. Rob his face is now directly in front of the big, red emergency button. He reads the text underneath: **""!Do not press!""** in a gigantic, black font.

*""Ready my friend?""* Rob almost shouts in excitement. He has not experienced this adrenaline rush in a very long time.

*""I'm ready! Hit it!""* Jack responds almost afraid.

Rob slams the button, the both of them immediately collapse to the ground due to an agonizing pain in their heads. It's as if the button was directly connected to their brains. The main hall fades away, Rob sees guards racing towards him as he faints...

He wakes up after what feels like centuries.

*""W-Wh.. Where.. am I?""* Rob is stuck and can't move his body. He opens his eyes and sees the Warden. He immediately feels a rush of adrenaline. He looks around him and sees Jack in front of him. They are both tied to chairs, rendering them unable to move. In front of him, a long table.

*""You two did it. Canada and USA.""*

Wait.. We did it? Canada? USA? What the fuck is going on? It's like he is another person right now. As if that button triggered something in his brain. but he gets interrupted, as if the Warden was able to read his mind.

*""Yes, USA! Pressing that button removed the memory chip in your brain. It started a series of cognitive connections of neural sensors. You should have access to all the memories you have lost in about 3 minutes. After you regain memory, you come out of stasis. And you will have to settle this final duel.""*

Rob never heard the Warden speak. His voice was soft, filled with excitement but yet very strict. The end of the statement was kind of grim. Rob looks closer to the table, and sees a shotgun in the middle.

*""What do you mean final, eh?""* Jack nervously asks the Warden. Rob clearly hears an accent in Jack his voice he doesn't remember.

*""I'm not giving away anything. You will have to think harder, Canada.""*

Rob suddenly recalls. How he volunteered to be the star of America, how he was praised and loathed by his people, how he received one year of training to be up for any challenge that would come his way, all the memory losing excercises, how he met all his contestants, how he fell in love with one of them; Anna..

Rob also understands now, why he was being surveilled all this time by the guards. The easy pacman challenge, the corrupt guard.. It's all starting to make sense!!

Deeper memories also come back. How he strangled the star of China Xiao Huy in the first duel, how he stabbed the gorgeous swedish Signe in her back during the second, beheading John, the popular Irish contestant in the third.. Then he looks at Jack, and he completely, vividly remembers. They both had an enormous crush on Anna. All 3 of them, Jack Anna and Rob were inseperable during the beginning phase of this experiment. Rob realises he can move again.

Rob doesn't hesitate and jumps on the table, his mind filled with love, anger and hate. He then grabs the shotgunand aims for Jacks head.

*""Rob.. Please don't.. She always loved you..""* Jack is begging for his life.

Rob won't listen to Jack his last words and simply pulls the trigger. Jack his head cracks open like a nut, and Rob falls down on his knees.

*""Well done, America!""* says Eugene the Warden. He was the referee in the process.

*""I don't want to hear it Eugene. I need to know what happened to Anna! Tell me at what position she ended!""* Rob gets another adrenaline rush, he is super afraid of the answer the referee Eugene will provide. Up untill the duels, the competition didn't contain casualties. Anna could be alive!

*""**She* *is fine**,* *America.* *Germany didn't make it through the group stage.""*","Rob and Jack are in jail, planning to break out..",0

When, another 5 minutes later, he feels the need for relief he tests his luck and stays in the bed.  He realizes his mistake when, with a push and a grunt, he promptly soils himself and the bedding.  

Ashamed, he strips the filthy bedding off, rolls it in a ball, and throws it out of the window where it lands on an unfortunate drunk walking home from the bar.  

The drunk becomes entangled in the fouled sheets and, due to his drunken lack of coordination, fights for nearly 2 minutes to extricate himself.  

Once he is free, a nearby vagrant, amazed by this display, asks: ""whoah, man, what the hell was that!?""

He was born in Texas by illegal immigrants who left him in a ditch when the immigration officers came looking for them. Luckily, a woman found the baby Simpson as he was on the verge of death and was promptly sent to the hospital for recovery. He was diagnosed with pneumonia and was left with severe asthma ever since the incident.

Child services later arrived to send him to the local orphanage, where he would be cared for by nuns; when he was five, old enough to walk and talk, he was allowed to be with the rest of the orphans. Finally, he wasn't alone, but in spite of his best efforts to make friends, all the children made fun of him and his big, uneven teeth, calling him *dientes grandes* whenever they saw him, and the nuns would laugh too.

When he was fifteen, a couple adopted Simpson. Surprised, but very happy, Simpson smiled all the way to the couple's home, thinking that he was in a dream. They led him into the basement and handcuffed him to the rusty pipes. Every day, the couple would come down and beat him, feeding him the leftovers from their meals, saying things like ""no one will ever love you like us"" or ""be glad for all that we give you."" 

Two years later, an anonymous tip was received and the police busted the couple, sending them to jail for child abuse. Simpson was again sent to another orphanage. All the other kids ignored him since he was so old and looked dangerous. On his eighteenth birthday, he ran away and went up north to Cincinnati. He was taken in by a gang called the Red Cobras. In his time with the gang, he stole, raped, and killed. One of the Cobras who went by Crown befriended Simpson and they hung out every day as the best of friends.

Eventually, the Cobras had a war with the an opposing gang called the Dominoes. In a gunfight in an alley, Crown was shot and died from blood loss while the rest of their group was cornered. The Dominoes leader of that night's raid said they would take one of them prisoner and let the rest go. They left Simpson behind and ran away.

Back at the Dominoes' base, they tortured and interrogated Simpson, using whips, waterboarding, and knives to try and get out any secrets. They carved a huge domino-shaped tattoo on his cheek and threw him on the streets. Beaten, broke, and emotionally scarred, nothing left to live for, Simpson sought revenge. After years of drug dealing, stealing, murdering, he bought guns, stockpiled bombs, and stored warehouses of ammunition across the country.

On his twenty-fifth birthday, Simpson set out to deal his wrath on those that have wronged him. He took a plane back to Texas and found the addresses of all the orphans from that original house and killed them all. He burned down the orphanage and bombed the remains with the nuns inside. Then, he invited the abusive couple to an alley where he would supposedly give them another kid to beat. He shot them dead. Simpson then returned to Cincinnati, where he killed members of the Cobras and Dominoes, framing the other gang and starting another war. Sabotaging each side and killing from the shadows, Simpson left the gangs in tatters who were never able to recover. 

Fueled by the evils of his past, Simpson went on to become the greatest criminal of the century, organizing drug cartels, shutting down and bringing up crime syndicates, planting undercover agents in every organization known in the United States, spreading internationally to every big city From Dubai to London. Across the globe, local PDs, the FBI, the CIA, governments, and the UN were on the lookout, BOLOs in every town and city, bounty hunters in every nook and cranny, and trust long gone from any institution.

Everywhere, the name Simpson Santiago was respected, feared, hated. There wasn't a single person that didn't know his name.

Through all the turmoil, the panic, a man sat by a grave in the shape of a crown on the Texas border, the sun setting on the desert landscape. As the dust coiled around his feet, he murmured a short prayer. As to the man, there was a strange shape on his cheek,  a rectangle with 7 dots, his body looked like it had broken long ago, and a perpetual smell of gunpowder lingered on his tattered clothes. He took out his inhaler and sighed. Under his breath, he whispered, ""sorry about this, amigo. I think I went a bit too far,"" and as he stood up, a police car's sirens rang, pulling over to the grave site. The police officer got out of the car, gun raised, shaking in his boots.

""Problem, officer?"" the man said softly.

""Uh, yeah. Can I see some ID? What brings you out here today?""

""Oh, you know who I am. As to what I'm doing, I'm just meeting an old friend before I leave for good.""

Sweating profusely, the officer began, ""Simpson Santiago, you are under arrest for every single crime known to man. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used aga--""

""Save your breath. I ain't under arrest for nothing.""

""Mr. Santiago, every town, city, and state has a bone to pick with you and wants you dead. You're the most wanted man in the country.""

Simpson chuckled to himself and then began to laugh uncontrollably. The officer stood there dumb-founded, unable to understand what was so funny.

""W-why are you laughing? This is a serious matter!""

As his laughter subsided, Simpson took another breath from his inhaler and looked the officer straight in the eye. ""'Most wanted man in the country'? Mister, if that was the case, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place."" Before he knew it, the police man heard a shot and blood erupted from his chest. He fell to the ground, spasming, gasping for breath, dying to the eerie chuckle of a man close by, a wide childish grin on his face saying, """"wanted', huh? 'Wanted'. Now that's a first.""",There once was a man named Simpson Santiago,3

She’d never had a night like it before and decided to invite him back to her room. 

They had a passionate affair all that summer.
One night, she confided in him that she was pregnant.
Not wanting to ruin his reputation or his marriage, he gave her a large sum of money and told her to go back to Italy to secretly have the child.
 
He said that if she stayed in Italy to raise the child, he would also provide child support until the child turned 18.

She agreed, but asked how he would know when the baby was born. To keep it discrete, he told her to simply mail him a post card, and write 'Spaghetti' on the back. He would then arrange for the child support payments to begin.
                        
One day, about 9 months later, he came home  to his confused wife. 'Honey!,' she said, 'you received a very strange  post card today.'  'Oh, just give it to me and I'll explain it later,'  he said.
 
The wife obeyed and watched as her husband read the card, turned white, and fainted.
 
On the card was written:
                    
Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti.
                      
One with meatballs, two without.

The first guy peers into it and says, ""Wow! That looks deep.""

The second guy says, ""It sure does. Let's throw a few pebbles in there and see how deep it is. We'll be able to tell the depth by how long it is before we hear the noise of the pebbles landing.""

So they pick up a few pebbles and throw them in and wait. Nothing. There's no noise.

The first guy says, ""Jeeez. That is really deep. I know, let's throw one of these great big rocks down there. Those should make a noise.""

So they pick up a couple football-sized rocks and toss them into the hole and wait... and wait... Again, nothing.

They look at each other in amazement. Then the first guy  gets a determined look on his face and says, ""Hey, over here in the weeds, there's a railroad tie. Help me carry it over. When we toss that sucker in, it's gotta make some noise.""

So the two of them drag the heavy tie over to the hole and heave it in. Once again, not a sound comes from the hole.

Suddenly, out of the nearby woods, a goat appears, running like the wind. It rushes toward the two men, then right past them, running as fast as it's legs will carry it. Suddenly it leaps in the air and into the hole.

The two men are astonished with what they've just seen and look at each other in amazement.

Then, out of the woods comes a farmer who spots the men and ambles over. He asks them, ""Hey, you two guys seen my goat out here?""

The first guy says, ""You bet we did! Craziest thing I ever saw. It came running like crazy and just jumped into this hole and disappeared!""

""Nah"", says the farmer, ""That couldn't have been my goat. My goat was chained to a railroad tie.""

""So how did you die?""

""Well, I was suspecting my wife was cheating on me, so I got home from work early to catch her in the act. I go into the apartment and find her naked in bed alone. I ask her 'Where is he?' She plays dump so I start looking all over the apartment. I couldn't find him anywhere. I finally give up and go out to the balcony for a smoke. I see him naked hanging from the railing and he had the audacity to smile at me. I start punching him, and he lets go falling to the ground. He was lucky and his fall got cushioned by some bushes. So I go in blinded by rage, draw the fridge outside and drop it on him. I felt a pain in my chest, I dropped down and died a couple minutes later. I think it was a heart attack.""

St. Peter scribbles it all down, hmmms, stamps his report and pulls a lever dropping the man to hell. He signals to the next guy:

""So how did you die?""

""Well, I got home after a long day and took a long shower. Like I always do when it's hot, I went out immediately after, still wet and naked to enjoy the cool breeze and have a smoke. It seems the railing had rusted and it collapsed the moment I leaned on it. As I was wet it was very easy to slip and fall, but luckily I grabbed on the railing of my downstair's neighbour. I was holding on for dear life, and then he gets out. I smile at him and before I could ask him for help, he starts punching me all over. I slipped and fell on some bushes. Before I could recover I see a big white box dropping on me and then I woke up here.""

St. Peter scribbles it all down, hmmms, stamps his report and opens the gates, signaling the man to go in. He then waves to the third man to approach, who at this point has burst out laughing. Before St. Peter could ask him, he tries to start explaining amidst all the laughter.

As he arrives at the airport, goes outside, there, Mark is waiting in his private limousine.

John is a little amazed, but not anything special. As they arrive, John is impressed to see a giant mansion!

Inside,  thousands of artifacts and old books...

John asks: Mark, my brother, how did you get the money for this!?

Mark replies: Well, you see that bridge?

Yes, replies John

Mark continues: Its support was to be 25 feet taller, is was to be another 30 feet over the water in case of flooding,

it was to have 6 more traffic lanes, and not to mention the details! And guess where all that money went?

John says: Clever game, brother!

And John stayed at Marks place for another week, and when saying goodbyes at the airport John intimidates Mark to come over next week.

When Mark came, he was amazed!

John OWNED the airport, his mansion was more than double in size, doors of gold, gold plated walls, golden cutlery and other details you cant even imagine!

Mark asks: WHERE DID YOU GET THE MONEY FOR THIS?!

John replies:You see that bridge over there?

No, says Mark,

We had a crazy night of drinking, and passion, and maybe even love, but she was gone in the morning, and I had to go back home. I couldn't even remember her name, only the translation she'd given me into English. ""A length of time."" It was a dumb thing to remember. It also wasn't much to go off of, especially with my drunken memories distorting everything else. 

Well, I went back recently to the same city and thought ""I should look for her."" It was a small city, a town, really, and so I thought that, surely, someone would know this woman, or even me, but I still didn't have her name, so I did what I could.

Everywhere I went, I kept asking about a beautiful woman whose name meant ""a length of time"" in English. I tried to remind them of myself, and of the night I'd been there. But, no matter what I said, no one seemed to know what I meant. I didn't blame them. Half of them didn't speak English, and to the half that did I sounded crazy, but I had to keep looking. I just knew that she was still there. So I asked and asked and asked until I'd almost given up. That's when a young man approached me.

""You look for Era, sir?"" His accent was thick, his English broken, but I'd heard him loud and clear.

""Yes!"" The name had struck a chord in me. Era. Of course. How could I have forgotten such a simple name? ""How did you know? Can you take me to her?""

""Yes, sir. Know you from last time. Was child then, but see you with Era, sir. I take you now.""

So, the youth and I took off through the streets. My heart raced. My thoughts pounded. Before long, we came to a square and I saw her. She was older, but so was I. I knew it was her. That face. That body. It had to be. ""Era!"" I called out. ""Era! It's me!"" 

But the youth grabbed my hand to stop me. ""Not her, sir. That Era twin."" 

""What? She never told me."" Perhaps she had told me, perhaps I'd even met this twin, but I couldn't remember in the haze of my ancient memories. ""What's her name? How do you tell them apart?""

The youth smiled at me. ""That's Ya, sir. Era fat.""",I was in a small city in Israel...,4

GUTS - Is arriving home late, after a night out with the lads, being met by your wife with a broom, and having the “Guts” to ask: “Are you still cleaning, or are you flying somewhere?”

BALLS - Is coming home late after a night out with the lads, smelling of perfume and beer, lipstick on your collar, slapping your wife on the bum and having the “Balls” to say: 'You're next, Chubby.'

Well, by the time he got to the 14th tee, his penis was showing below his shorts. He continued his game and on the 15th hole, it was dragging along behind him. By the 18th he could hardly drag it to the green.

He went straight to the pro shop and asked the pro how to fix it. The pro told him that according to legend, you must go back and make another ace and see the leprechaun again. So after purchasing five buckets of balls, he made his way back to the 13th and frantically began hitting shot after shot until finally he made the hole in one.

The second event is the singing competition. Participants are instructed to show off their manly singing voice in front of a panel of judges. However, DJ Khaled doesn't do that; he only shouts his name over others' performances. He refuses to participate and scores a zero.

The two were in the same homeroom in elementary school, the same classes in middle school, and remained friends in high school. However, in high school, Peanut Butter began a relationship with Jelly. Jelly was popular at the time. He was hot stuff to Peanut Butter's peers, and Jelly had a record of several girlfriends. Chocolate became jelous of Jelly quickly however, as he had slowly begun to sexually think of Peanut Butter. The though of spreading her around on his bed became a deep sexual fantasy of his. When prom rolled around later that year, it seemed obvious Jelly and Peanut Butter were going together, until Chocolate went out and asked Peanut Butter to prom unexpectedly. She said yes, but was not keen on going with him. Chocolate and Jelly were very tense around each other from that point on, and Jelly often was sour to Chocolate for stealing his girl. Chocolate knew Peanut Butter was not happy about going with him, so he had to spice things up. He had to convince her otherwise. He quickly spoke with the DJ of the prom night, and had a rap thought up to highlight Peanut Butter and Chocolate to make Peanut Butter feel more special and cared for from Chocolate. Prom night came, and the dancing began. Chocolate awkwardly danced with Peanut Butter, until the time came. He qued the DJ.

Bin Laden was not pleased, but he settled. “FINE! I wish to wake up with three American women in my bed with me. NOW BE GONE.”

“Fine, so be it,” the annoyed genie responded. And with that, she snapped her fingers and disappeared.

The barber handed him a small wooden ball and said, “Place this in your mouth and roll it around to whichever side I’m shaving. It will stretch out the skin and I’ll give you the best shave you’ve had in years.”

The man did what the barber said and sure enough. his face was smooth as silk after the shave. He spit out the wooden ball and said, “I just have one question- What would happen if I accidentally swallowed that wooden ball?”



“You’d bring it back in a few days,  like everyone else does.”

A tall, somewhat nerdy looking gentleman sitting nearby notices the depressed man, ""Hey buddy, what's bothering you?"".

The depressed man looks deep into his glass shaking slightly, ""My wife left me for my best friend... she took everything, the house, my kids, my money, even my dog. I have nothing left"".

The gentleman smirks, ""Well hey, it's never too late to turn things around"".

The depressed man turns with empty bloodshot eyes, in a harsh tone, ""What do you know of it, pretty boy?! It's easy to say that shit when you're so well off!""

The gentleman slaps his knee, ""Hah! Just three months ago I was right where you're sitting! There is a secret in this bar though... one that can change everything!""

Skeptical, the depressed man scoffed, ""Yeah, right. Sure...""

The gentleman stands up sharply and gestures to a window behind him, ""This here is a magical window. If you leap from it and make a wish on the way down, you will instantly pop back into this room and your wish will be granted!""

The depressed man drinks from his cheap whiskey and pretends to ignore the clearly insane ramblings.

Grinning, the gentleman walks to the window and opens it, ""Don't believe me? Fine, I'll prove it to you."" The gentleman begins to step out of the window…

In a state of shock, the depressed man stumbles to try and pull the lunatic from the open window, but he is too late! In a thundering clap, the entire bar shakes as a gust of wind rips through, clashing glasses and knocking over stools. To the depressed man's disbelief, the gentleman was back in the room standing near the pool tables!

In awe, the depressed man stutters, ""H...how... wh... what did you wish for?!.

With proud look the gentleman announced, ""I wished for superhuman strength!"" As he spoke, he grasped the side of the nearby pool table and lifted it high into the air with a single hand!

The depressed man still in shock looked back at the magic window, ""S... so all I need to do is c... climb out that window and make a wish??""

The gentleman nodded. Moving towards the window the depressed man was scared, but for the first time in months he was gripped by another emotion - hope. He looks out the window down 112 stories to the busy streets below. The people down below looked like ants trapped in a maze. The man hesitated and looked back. With one last nod from the gentleman, he let go of the window sill.

After several moments the hard packing sound mixed with shattered glass and the screams of women rang out through the air.

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.

The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.

The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.

And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",Once upon a time...,289

When I walked into the person I made them drop the books they were carrying.

My cock immediatly flicked up as soon as I realized it was a hot girl, trying really hard to hide my boner I get on my knees to help her pick up her books.

I gather up some confidence while helping her pick up her books, ""can we go on a date?"" I wisper.

""Hmm? I didn't hear you"" She replied.

I gather up some confidence again and say it loudly ""can I take you out on a date?""

""You know what, i'm busy until next week but I would like to get to know you, maybe it was faith that you walked into me? I'll leave my number with you."" She says.

Super excited I take her number, but being as shy as I am when it comes to talking to girls, I never got the confidence to call her.

A week later I used all of the confidence I have to call her and ask her if she would like to get some drinks together, she says ""sure"", I tell her to come at my house, i'll pay for her uber when she arrives and i'll drive my car to take us, she agrees.

Knowing that I will get a boner when she comes I try to think of a way to hide it, I get the briliant idea to duct tape my dick to my leg.

I duct tape my dick to my leg and then 2 hours go by, she arrives and she is knocking on my door, I run to go and open it.

When I opened the door I kicked her in the face.

He was large, muscular, and able to chop down a fully grown Siberian pine tree with one swing of his axe. This came in handy as Ivan had to chop down many trees to be used as firewood so his wife and children could stay warm. Everyday, starting at 4am and ending 10pm, Ivan would leave his home and begin chopping down every tree he came across. He would then haul the trees back home where he would chop them into firewood. 

It was hard work, and didn’t leave him much time with his family. However Ivan didn’t mind it too much because he was rough, tough, hard to bluff, and extremely used to hardships. 

Ivan’s work routine went along uninterrupted for  a few years, until one day Russian government officials showed up at Ivan’s home. They were mad at Ivan for chopping down a large portion of the Siberian Forest, a natural beauty that is loved by the entire country. They demanded that Ivan stopped chopping down the forest so that Russia could continue to boast the region’s vast beauty.

Ivan was not intimidated by the Russian government, after all he was rough, tough, hard to bluff, and extremely used to hardships. So Ivan continued his routine of chopping down more and more of the forest.

The same government officials came back a month later, this time with a squad of Russian soldiers. They were furious that Ivan didn’t follow their command, and wanted to punish him for his actions against the state. So at gun point, Ivan was drafted into the Russian navy, where he would be far away from his wife, children, and the Siberian forest. 

This punishment was severe, and very painful for Ivan. He would no longer be able to care for his family, and being at sea made him feel uneasy. But he didn’t try to get out of his punishment for he was rough, tough, hard to bluff and extremely used to hardships. He just wanted to serve his time in the navy and then go back to his family.

Ivan was assigned to a large battleship, and was posted to an observations chair on the ship’s tallest mast. The waters he patrolled were rough, and Ivan would get very seasick from the ship constantly swaying side to side.

One day, Ivan’s battleship was caught in a terrible storm that caused everyone on board to panic. The ship rocked violently in all directions, but Ivan refused to leave his post on the mast. He held on as tightly as he could until a giant wave smashed against the side of the ship, and Ivan was thrown from his post to the deck below.

Ivan’s body had made a large crater in the battleship’s hull, causing massive damage. All of Ivan’s comrades on board saw the crater with Ivan at the center, and immediately assumed the worst. Then suddenly, Ivan stood up and climbed out of the crater, leaving all the sailors around him in disbelief.

“Ivan! How could you have survived a fall from that height?”

“It was nothing comrades, I am rough, tough, hard to bluff, and extremely used to hard ships.”",There once was a man named Ivan who lived with his family in a Siberian forest...,5

The husband said 'The what' ?  
The man repeated 'The Voodoo Penis' and pulled out what seemed to be an ordinary dildo.  
The husband laughed, and said, 'It looks like a dildo !'  
The man then pointed to the door and said, 'Voodoo Penis, door !'  


The penis rose out of its box, darted over to the door and started pounding the keyhole. The whole door shook wildly with vibrations, so much that a crack began to form down the middle. Then the man said 'Voodoo Penis, return to box !' and the penis stopped and returned to the box.  


The husband bought it. He took it home to his wife, And after the husband had been gone a few days, the wife remembered the Voodoo Penis.  


She undressed, opened the box and said 'Voodoo Penis, my crotch.' The penis shot to her crotch. It was absolutely incredible. After three mind shattering orgasms, she became very exhausted and decided she'd had enough. She tried to pull it out, but it was stuck. Her husband had neglected to tell her how to turn it off.  
So she put her clothes on, got in her car and started for the hospital.  


On the way, another incredibly intense orgasm made her swerve all over the road. A police officer saw this and immediately pulled her over.  


He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink.  
Gasping and twitching, the woman said 'I haven't had anything to drink officer. You see, I've got this Voodoo Penis thing stuck in my crotch and it won't stop screwing me .'  


The officer looked at her for a second, shook his head and replied, **'Yeah right ... Voodoo Penis, my ass!'**
