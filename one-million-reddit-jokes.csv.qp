So after the photo on Everest, i dipped into my savings and took the next flight to Nepal. I was on his tail, the locals knew him well as the crazed man on a mission...I followed his tracks back to the airport, where the airline was able to give his destination, hed just jumped on a plane back to our home town a few days prior, so i called home...""Jims here!"" mum said in tears through the phone. I took the next flight home fuming with anger. 

2 days later I arrived home and walked through the door, and see Jim, the light from the window gleaming through his hair like an angel. 

""Jim you absolute bastard where have you been! Note even a call?""

""I've been on a mission of enlightenment! when I found myself stranded in the desert, some monks came to my aid and I became obsessed with the mysterious beautiful sounds of their monetary, but I needed to become one of them to uncover their origin""

""so?"" I said, ""what did you find out?""

""Oh I'm sorry"" he said ""you are not a monk, I cannot share that with you"" he said",So I spent the last 10 years trying to find my brother Jim....,1

There are so many rooms and I can’t keep a track of them. I mean we need rooms but not so many. Either we reduce the rooms or add more member to our family. Like adopt a few kids from around the world like Brad and Angelina just to make the White House look more occupied.”


The President had earlier hinted that he along with First Lady Melania Trump would not be spending much time in the White House.


Apparently, Mr. Trump got the idea of putting up White House for rent from Indian PM Narendra Modi. “We came to know that Mr. Modi has been globe trotting since the time he was elected and his official residence is being used as wedding venue. So we thought of doing something similar,” said an official associated with the White House.


Sources also say that it is highly likely that Barack Obama might find his way back to the White House after it gets listed on Airbnb. The Obama’s have however refuted the news.


While speaking to Jimmy Kimmel on his show, Michelle Obama said that she had already packed all her bags and had no intention to stay back. “Do you know how much effort it took me pack those damn bags. Now you say we are going to stay back. Barrack better be sleeping on the couch if he does that,” she said.


Though many are questioning the rationale behind Trumps sudden love for ‘cost cutting’. “There’s more to come and this is just tip of the ice-cream,” he said, with his close aide whispering in Mr. Trumps ears that it’s called iceberg.


Meanwhile, Boeing has hit out at Donald Trump for saying that Air Force One costs were too high and said that the costs in building the air craft were far lesser than what Mr. Trump spends on maintaining his hair.","After cancelling Air Force One contract due to high costs, Trump plans to rent out White House on Airbnb",0

They decided to try and convert him to be Catholic. They went over and talked with him and were so happy that he decided to join all of his neighbors and become a Catholic.

The first Friday of Lent came and just at supper time when the neighborhood was setting down to their fish dinners came the wafting smell of steak cooking on a grill.

The group arrived just in time to see John standing over his grill with a small pitcher of water. He was pouring small droplets over his steak on the grill and saying, ""you were born a cow, you were raised a cow, and now you are a fish.""",John Smith was the only Protestant to move into the large Catholic neighborhood,53

Nice house, nice friends, a solid job. All around he's got an easy life. But there was just one problem. He didn't have anyone to share it with.

So, he goes up to my other mate Chris and he says,

""Chris, what's wrong with me, why can't I get a girlfriend?""

""I'll be honest Dave. It's because you're obsessed with tractors.""

And it was true! Dave was absolutely obsessed with tractors. He had tractor wallpaper, bedding, pajamas, a cascade of farmhouse vehicle memorabilia. He would even refuse to eat his toast if it wasn't cut into the shape of a tractor.

So, desperate for love, he goes to his Mum and says he wants all of his tractor-related things removed.

""Dave, are you sure? That's literally everything you own.""

""I'm sure. Get rid of it all.""

So she sells everything from the shampoo to the curtains, and makes a tidy profit in the process. She buys Dave normal clothes, normal sheets, normal toast. She made him a new man.

And it worked! Dave did get a girlfriend, and as they walked arm in arm down the street, they saw something in the distance. A house that had caught on fire! Not a moment wasted, Dave sprinted to the letterbox and, with one big gulp, sucked all of the oxygen out of the house, extinguishing the inferno.

Renowned as a town hero, Dave found himself on national television, smiling nervously at an audience of admirers as the reporter asked him the fatal question.

""Dave! Dave, how did you do it? How did you accomplish this incredible feat?""

Dave turned to the camera, cleared his throat and said,

""My name's Dave. And I'm an ex-tractor fan.""

""No?""

After the show Billy finds out Bobo will return in 4 years. He decides that he will get Bobo back for humiliating him when he returns.


During those 4 years, Billy stayed up every night watching stand up comics and comedies while noting down the best comebacks. He enrolled in comedy classes and ended up getting a degree in insults and combacks. He dedicated his whole life to this. 


The night has finally come of Bob's return. Billy sits in the exact seat he was in last time. Bobo comes out on stage again and walks right up to Billy.

A blonde is sat on a plane waiting for everyone to sit down and to get airborne. A guy in an expensive looking suit sits along side her and introduces himself. 
Disinterested, she says hi and turns towards the window. 
He asks if she'd like to play a game. She says no. 
Just after take off he tries again. Explaining this time that the game is question and answer. He asks a question and if she knows the answer he pays her $5. If not... she pays him. 

She snaps back at him that she's not interested. So he tells her he is a lawyer and will make it interesting. If she doesn't know the answer she pays $5. If she asks one he doesn't know though, he will pay $500 to her. 

Still not really wanting to she reluctantly accepted and he goes first. ""What is the distance in miles from Earth to the moon?""

She doesn't say a word. She just reaches for her purse hand hands him five bucks. Then goes to grab her travel pillow to get some shut eye and escape the lawyer. 

He says wait. It's your turn! 

She thinks for a moment and says ""what goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four?""

He looks confused for a moment and she starts to get comfortable. He says he's going to have to think about it and she goes to sleep. 
As soon as she nods off he gets his laptop out and searches all of it for an answer. He connects to the internet and tries everything from I'm feeling lucky on google to Wikipedia and fires emails to his most likely to quiz contacts. 
After an hour of finding nothing he wakes her up with a $500 check. 
""Thank you"" and she tries to get immediately back into her comfortable spot when he asks,
""Wait! What does go up a hill with three legs but comes down with four?""
Without a word she reaches for her purse and hands him $5.

---

I was at the grocery store yesterday picking up some ingredients to make breakfast for the week. I already had a few essentials picked out like Milk, Eggs, &amp; Bacon. Yes, Bacon is an essential. I moved to the cereal aisle but got stuck deciding between Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Fruity Pebbles, which has always been a tough decision for me. From the corner of my eye I see an older woman peering at me. She was probably in her 60's or 70's, wrinkles, very ... grandma-looking. 

Anyways, I didn't think much of it and grabbed the Fruity Pebbles. I started making my way to the next aisle, which required me to go past her. When I got close, she turned to me and asked me to get a box of cereal (some specialty diabetic kind) from the top shelf. I grabbed the box and handed it to her. She used that moment of kindness to start up a conversation with me. I'm all about ""respecting your elders"" but I have no idea who this woman is and I didn't really care. Still, I figured she probably doesn't have anybody to talk to and I wasn't in much of a rush so I avoided being rude.

The conversation started out pretty normal. She was talking about the weather and her daughter (maybe she was trying to set me up?) but then it got pretty personal. She started telling me about her son who died fighting in Iraq, how I look just like him, and that I remind her of him. She started telling me a story about him as a young boy and I had to feign sadness. The whole thing was a bit much for a Monday night so I figured once we get out of the aisle, I can break away. 

We finally got to the front by the registers. She got into one of the lines, I went to get some fresh ~~muffins~~ bread. When I got back to the register, the line she was in happened to be the shortest so I decided to take my chances. Wrong move. Literally the moment I got within proximity, she turned around and picked up the conversation exactly where it left off, telling me how much she misses her son. She then asked if I could do her a huge favor that would really make her holiday season. ""When I walk out, can you wave and say 'Goodbye Mom' to me?"" Apparently she never got closure and hearing those words would mean the world to her. I said sure but it's not like I jumped at the request, I was actually very sketched out by the whole thing. However, I claim to be a good person and just to be clear on the situation, Monday night grocery shopping, 70 y/o granny asks you to make her holiday season by saying 2 words. What kind of an asshole would I be to say no? 

As we got to the cash register, I had a change of heart in my cereal decision. I decided to go with the Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Retrospectively, I think my subconscious wanted to get away and was hoping she would be gone by the time I got back. The aisle was pretty close and when I got back she just got done bagging the groceries. I'm looking down, fidgeting with my wallet, hoping she forgets the whole situation and just walks out the door. Sure enough, as I look up there she is, just waving at me by the exit. Very awkwardly, I wave and shout ""Goodbye mom"". She walked out and I sighed, so happy that she was gone and that whole ordeal was over with. The cashier rings up my items and I proceeded to bag them. I take out my credit card as the cashier looks at me and says ""That'll be $124.37"". I looked at my bag that held something like six items and then back at the cashier. ""There must be some mix-up, there's no way my groceries came out to a hundred dollars"". She looked back at me puzzled ""Oh, your mom said you were paying for her"".

**THAT FCKING BTCH.** 

I normally don't curse in public but I screamed. I was BOILING with rage. I dropped my bag, ran outside, and saw this old little conniving shit scurrying to close the trunk. I bolted in her direction. She opened the front door of her car and got in, but before she could close it, I grabbed it and flung it open. I yelled ""ARE YOU FCKING KIDDING ME?"". She, probably scared for her life, started screaming and kicking me. This got me SOOO mad because to any bystander, it probably looked like I was trying to rob this poor old grandma. I tried to grab a hold of the foot she was using to kick me and finally I did. So there I was, pulling her leg, just like I'm pulling yours.",My Grocery Store Experience,864

So when their birthday finally arrived, the three girls lined up in the front and waited for their mother.

""Alright sweethearts"" said the mother ""todays the day you lose your virginity! Just remember everything ive told you and youll do fine.""

The mother then arranged for three young men to take the girls into three separate rooms.

About thirty minutes later, curious as to how her daughters are doing, the madam puts her ear to the first door.
Hearing soft moaning she smiles, then proceeds to the second door.
Screams of pain echo from the room and the mother frowns, knowing all too well how that first time goes.
Then she makes it to the third door, but hears sbsolutely nothing. Worried, she calls out to her daughter.
No response. She called again, but still nothing. She almost opens the door then stops. Being a professional she backs away, telling herself if shes not out in an hour shes going inside.
Sure enough about ten minutes later all three girls come out of their rooms.
""I did everything you told me momma!"" Said the first girl as she yawned and stalked off to her room.
As the second girl staggered by the mother hugged her,  saying it gets easier.
But as the third girl shuffles past the mother grabs her. ""Why didnt you answer me young lady! I was worried sick!
""But ma, i was just doin what you told me to!"" the girl whined
""Since when did i tell you its okay to ignore your mother!"" The madam shrieked
The daughter shrank and said

The American has to choose first. In his head, he thinks:
''I don't know what is the woulawoula, but the choice is easy. I don't want to die. I have a family.''
So, he yells:
''I choose the woulawoula''.

At that moment, one of the tribe's warrior put him on all fours and sodomized him like there is no tomorrow. Once the warrior is done, the American is released.

Now it's the turn of the French to make his decision. He thinks:
''Wow, that was something. Anyway, I prefer to be fuck in the ass rather than to die. Furthermore, it can't be that worst than that one time in college''.
So he yells:
''I choose the woulawoula''.

Like the American, the French is released after being brutally sodomized by one of the tribe's warrior.

Now comes the Russian's turn. He thinks:
''There's no way I'll be fucked like those two Westerners faggots. Shame on them. I will keep my honor''.
So he yells:
''I choose death''.

In regard of this decision, all the tribe's warriors clump together to form the firing squad. The tribe's chief declares:
''I admire your courage. I sentence you to death, by the woulawoula''.

I drove over to her house and had this pit in my stomach, I was nervous for some reason, something felt off.

I knocked on her door and was greeted by her dad.

""Oh! You must be IstolethePudding!"" (privacy)

""Oh fuck, he knows my plans."" I thought to myself.

HE pointed me down the hall to her the living room. I saw her on the couch wrapped up in some blankets. We sat and chatted for a bit, the usual ""you look different in person"" bs and what not. We sat there for almost an hour, having a really amazing conversation, all fears or nervous feelings dissipated quickly.

She asked me if we could go to the park and I nodded, as I stood up and was offering my hand she pointed to a wheelchair in the corner and asked me to get it for her. I was lost at this point, did she hurt her leg? Was there something in the chair she needed?

""Okay.. Why do you need it?"" I asked curiously as i pushed it over to her.

She casually moved the blankets away and revealed that she didn't have any legs, from the mid thigh down there was nothing. Internally panicking I had no idea what to do, my first instinct was to just bolt, but I stayed. Shorty after I helped her in the chair, out the door, and into my car. I folded up her wheelchair and put it in the trunk of my car and drove us to the park.

Once we reached the park I helped her out and was pushing her around the park for quite some time. About 20 minutes later she spotted some willow trees that completely shielded the outside world from what was underneath. She asked to be pushed under them to get out of the heat, and I obliged. 

We continued to talk for a few minutes while we were under there before she reached up and grabbed a low branch and hoisted herself out of the chair, with her elbows out she held her weight up from the branch and smiled at me.

""Whoaaa there, where do you think you're going?"" Said the Cowboy. 

""Well,"" said the Lawyer ""You see I shot this buck on my friends land and he ran across this fence line and died on your land. So I'm just coming across to claim what is rightfully mine.""

""Well partner, I'm sorry 'bout your luck but this ol' buckaroo is mine now."" The Cowboy said. 

The Lawyer starting to get angry, ""If you don't let me come over and get that buck, I'll sue your country ass for everything you got, and win.""

The Cowboy said, ""I've got a better idea, how about we settle this like real men and I'll kick you, and then you will kick me and we'll keep taking turns. Whoever is the last one standing gets the buck.""

""Deal"" said the Lawyer. 

The Cowboy gets down from his horse and walks up to the Lawyer, pulls back his leg and kicks the Lawyer right in the nuts, as hard as you can kick someone with steel toe boots. The Lawyer falls to the ground puking, crying out in pain holding his junk. After about five minutes the Lawyer finally somewhat composes himself and gets to his feet on shaky legs. 

""OK, my turn"" said the Lawyer.

One day, while watching the game at home, his friend said, 

""Hey Juan, you should run for school board. Because you never beat your kids, never beat your wife, never do drugs, and you are an overall nice guy."" 

So, he did. He ran for school board, and won the position. 

A couple of years roll by, and Juan is no longer in the School board. 

While watching the game at home with his friends, they said, 

""Hey Juan, you should run for county representative, since you never beat your kids, never beat your wife, never do drugs, you are an overall nice guy."" 

So, he ran for county representative, and won the position. 

A few years pass by, an Juan is sitting home watching TV. 

His wife then said 
""Hey Juan, you should run for governor, since you are a really nice guy, you never beat me, the kids, you never do drugs. You are an overall nice man."" 

 So, he ran for governor and won the position. 

A few years pass by, and he is sitting at home. 

While watching TV with one of his kids, the child said, 

""Dad, you should run for President. Since you are a super nice man, and you don't do drugs, never hurt anybody, you are an overall nice guy."" 

So, he did. He ran for presidency and won. 
 
He is currently sitting in his office, a man comes through the doors and says, 

""Quit being nice, or I will come and shoot you with a golf gun in the chest."" 

Succumbing to the mysterious man's desires. He started being mean. 

He did almost every drug on Earth, beat his wife and kids, drank to the point where he was super drunk. 

However, moral goodness kicks in, and starts being nice again. 

A couple days later, the mysterious man walks in again. 

The man is angry with him for not fulfilling his promise. 

The man shoots him in the chest.

post,5gq76y,2qh72,jokes,false,1480990217,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5gq76y/business_trip_in_bangkok/,self.jokes,,"A businessman had a short work trip in Bangkok. As he was leaving the house, his wife gave him a peck on the cheek and said, “You’ll be amazing, honey! I’m sure you’ll close the deal!”

“Aw, thanks dear! Any final words of wisdom?”

“Well, have you heard of the Green Quasar Diner?”

The businessman was taken aback. “Can’t say I have. What about it?”

The wife’s face grew dark and serious. “Whatever you do, dear, no matter what happens, don’t go to the Green Quasar Diner.”

That’s an odd request, the businessman thought, but he smiled and promised her: “Of course not, if that’s what you want.” He didn’t think it would be a problem. After all he had never even heard of the place! And neither have you, if we’re honest.

So he got into his car and drove to work, where he needed to pick up some documents for the meeting. On his way out his boss waved and wished him all the best. “I’m sure you’ll do great!” she said.

“Thanks boss!” the businessman said. “Anything you need me to remember?”

“Well, have you heard of the Green Quasar Diner?”

Now the businessman was curious. “No, I’ve not. Why?”

Again the boss’s face grew dark and serious. “Whatever you do, no matter what happens, don’t go to the Green Quasar Diner.”

Okay, that’s a really weird coincidence, the businessman thought. He simply nodded, went down to the lobby, and hailed a cab to the airport.

Now the cab driver was a friendly chap, and soon they were striking up a conversation about where the businessman was going and why. The businessman asked the cab driver if he had any recommendations about what to see or do in Bangkok. The cab driver obliged: “Well, there’s pad thai, and Thai massage, and - oh! I must warn you though -”

“About the Green Quasar Diner?” The businessman said.

“Why, yes! Have you heard of the place?” The cab driver asked.

“No, I’ve not. Why?”

And immediately the cab driver’s voice grew serious: “Whatever you do -”

“No matter what happens, don’t go to the Green Quasar Diner. I know, I know.” the businessman said and shrugged.

“No, I’m serious!” the cab driver pleaded. “Bad things happen if you go there. Trust me.”

But just then they reached the airport, where the businessman paid his fare and said farewell to the cab driver.

The businessman caught his flight to Bangkok and attended his meeting - which went well but ended late. Late enough that as he wandered the streets looking for a place to eat, almost every place he saw was closed. I say almost every place, of course, because you can guess the name of the establishment he came across after an hour of walking around hungry:

The Green Quasar Diner.

It was a small, sleazy looking bar with a flickering neon sign. He could see why he’d been warned about the place - it looked dingy and dodgy; “bad things happen if you go there,” he could hear the cab driver’s words ringing in his ear. But as he made one round, then another, around the city, he grew ever hungrier, and the Green Quasar Diner looked ever more tempting. So eventually, he gave in.

He went in to the Green Quasar Diner and ordered a steak. He had it for dinner. Then he went back to his hotel, slept, and caught his flight back the next morning.

Would you have guessed it, the cab driver bringing him back from the airport was the exact same one who had drove him there the previous day! So they continued their friendly conversation about how the business trip had went, and all that. As they neared the businessman’s office, the businessman casually said: “Oh, I went to the Green Quasar Diner after all.”

“What? What did you say?”

“Oh, I went to the Green Quasar Diner. The steak wasn’t bad. The place is a little old, of course, but -”

“OUT!” The cab driver slammed his brakes to a halt in the middle of the street.

“What?”

“I said, get out of my cab right now! I told you not to go there, and you did! I’m not driving you an inch further!” the cab driver screamed.

“But - but - it’s just an ordinary diner -”

“OUT!”

And the businessman had no choice but to open the door and get out. “What about my lug -” he had left his luggage in the boot, but the moment he got out of the cab the driver floored the gas and left him stranded.

“Well, that was weird,” the businessman murmured. He’d been dropped off two blocks away from his office, and the walk back left him sweaty and hot. He went to see his boss, who was a little surprised. “What happened, didn’t you get a cab back from the airport?” she asked.

“Well, I closed the deal,” the businessman began. “Then on the way back, I was just talking with my driver, and when I mentioned the Green Quasar Diner -”

“Oh no,” the boss interrupted, “oh nooooo. Tell me you didn’t.”

“Well, look, I don’t know what his problem was with the place, and I don’t know what your problem is either. I simply went in, ordered a steak, and -”

“You’re fired.”

“WHAT?” The businessman couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

“I told you not to go to the Green Quasar Diner, and you did. Pack up all your things. I want your desk cleared within the hour.”

“But -”

“Pack up NOW!”

Confused and dejected, the businessman went to his desk and started packing. Any doubts he had dissolved when two security guards came over to make sure he cleared out, and escort him to his car. He drove home, and when he saw his wife waiting for him, it was all he could do to not burst into tears.

“What’s wrong, dear?” his wife asked, alarmed.

“Well, I don’t know what on Earth is going on!” he said. “First the cab driver left me stranded without my suitcase in the city. And then my boss fired me! I don’t get it! Why is this happening?”

“Oh darling, we’ll get through this!” she tried to encourage him.

“I’m just so confused,” he replied. “All this over a little diner?”

“Wait,” the wife’s voice narrowed. “A diner. Did you go to the Green Quasar Diner?”

“Look, dear,” the businessman began. “I don’t know why everyone bothers so much with it but -”

“Did you go to the Green Quasar Diner?” the wife asked, insistently.

“Yes, but -”

And the wife’s face hardened. “You’re dead to me,” she said. “Get out of my house! We’re no longer married!”

The businessman was taken aback. “But dear -”

“Out! OUT! I’ll call the police!”

In a complete daze, the businessman found himself outside the house, the front door slammed shut in his face. He turned around to face the street. Losing his job, and his marriage? Over some silly little diner? What on Earth was going on? Without paying any attention to where he was going, he started walking - onto the street, where a car hit him and he immediately died on the spot.

Now, dear patient listener, you may be wondering what the lesson of the Green Quasar Diner is. Why did I tell you all this? It’s a stern warning not to do what the businessman did:

Look both ways before you walk onto the street or you’ll get hit by a car and killed.",Business trip in Bangkok,0

Goku, disgruntled by the inconvenience, takes a seat and completes the paperwork. He returns to the desk and asks the lady if he can be treated now.

 ""Not yet,"" she tells him, handing him a ten page packet of personal information he must complete.

Goku is in a lot of pain and very annoyed by this, but he decides the quicker he completes the paperwork the sooner he can be treated, so he sits down and does it. Upon completion, he returns to the desk, ready to be treated.

""Not so fast,"" says the nurse, handing him a twenty page packet.

At this point Goku is infuriated.

""Who said that?"" she demanded. Chandrasekhar put his hand up. ""General Custer, 1862.""

At that point, a student in the back said, ""I'm gonna puke.""

The teacher glares around and asks ""All right! Now, who said that?"" Again, Chandrasekhar answers, ""George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.""

Now furious, another student yells, ""Oh yeah? Suck this!""

Chandrasekhar jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, ""Bill Clinton to Monica Lewinsky, 1997.""

Now with almost mob hysteria someone said ""You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll kill you."" Chandrasekhar frantically yells at the top of his voice, ""Michael Jackson to the child witnesses testifying against him, 2004.""

The teacher fainted. And as the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said, ""Oh shit, we're screwed!"" And Chandrasekhar said quietly, ""I think it was Lehman Brothers, September 15, 2008.""",Chandrasekhar Subramanian,5

The man decides ""Why the hell not?"" and purchases a ticket before entering the large tent. Inside, he sees a group of a dozen or so people all crowded around a small wooden stage and a red curtain. 

Music starts to play and the curtain parts, revealing a large man with a shaved head and a handlebar mustache. He's wearing a bright red speedo and his body is sculpted like a figure from Greek myth. The crowd looks on in wonder as the man proceeds to display his seemingly God-like strength. 

He first takes a frying pan and proceeds to roll it up like a tortilla wrap. The crowd roars with excitement and applause at the amazing feat of strength.

Next, he takes knife and presses it against the center of his chest. Monty's face turns bright red and he winces but his face melts into a smile as the blade bends from his resistance. What began as shrieks of terror end with cheers and applause at the amazing feat of resistance.

Finally, he steps in front of a small stool sitting next to him on stage. On top of this stool is a single walnut, still in its shell. Monty takes the walnut and places it between the palms of his hands before squeezing it together a mighty roar. His arms and chest bulge outward from the immense force. 

A moment later, a few drops of walnut oil drip from the stool below. 

The crowd cheers at the incredible feat and before they can die down, Monty raises his hand to silence them. 

""I have a challenge for one of you. I have done this feat for many years and I always like to see how easy people believe it must be. 

He gestures toward the pile of dry, mashed walnut on the stool. 

""If one of you believes they have the ability to squeeze just a single drop more of oil from this walnut, I will give you $1,000 in cash right now.""

The crowd looks on in stunned silence. A few women nudging their red-faced husbands to give it a go. Finally, the man who had previously purchased his ticket raises his hand. ""I'd like to give it a try"" the man says.

Monty grins with delight and gestures for the man to come forward and onto the stage. The man works his way through the crowd and makes it on stage, it's almost comical how small he is in comparison to Monty.

Monty gestures toward the stool and the man takes a deep breath before grabbing the pile of dry walnut. 

In what seems like a few twists of his hand, the man manages to get five more drops of walnut oil out of the nut. The crowd is cheering and laughing while Monty is red-faced with both anger and embarrassment. 

The crowd disperses and Monty slaps a pile of $100 bills into the hand of the mysterious man. Monty finally breaks his silence. ""I have been doing this act for almost a decade. Not once during that time have I met anybody who was able to do that. There was absolutely nothing left for you to get from that Walnut. Please, so I'm able to sleep at night, what is your secret?""

The man smiles as he slides the stack of bills into his back pocket. ""I'm an auditor for the IRS"" before leaving the tent and the stunned Monty behind him.

Peope who are ""special"" are great in bed. Why that is, a greater mind than mine will have to explain, as my research never reaches further than the symptoms.      
          
            
You always understand that you have had ""crazy-sex"", never that you might have it. When you are still lying there and enjoying the little moment before you have to clean your dick off. When the rush of ""love-drugs"" makes you say the silliest things, that is when you realise...   
        
            
""Wow, that was pretty...  O.O * *screams inside* *""          
""Pretty what?""        
""Good...good. Well! I guess I'll go and clean my dick off""           
               
             
We need a dating site for crazy people! For the crazy people and the people who like crazy-sex. The problem is that crazy people do not always know they are crazy.        
         
                         
So I have invented a simple test to separate the population into three kinds of people;        
1: Does not know they are crazy.            
2: The people who like crazy sex.                  
3: The virgins.             
                         
The test is a single question.       
              
""Are you crazy?""          
          
""No"" - ""Does not know""         
""Yes"" - ""Likes crazy sex""         
""Excuse me?"" - ""Ahhhhh...""",Voight-Kampff-dating. (OC and Long),1

Hugh is also a very strong man...As we know. Because of his muscles, he decideds he could get of the grid by doing some labour work in for a Monastry in China, his strong arms could lift four times as many Rice sacks as the old monks.

So he flys out and hikes a long while, finally arriving. The head monk greets him and hugh explains his situation. The head monk agrees with him, but on one condition! He takes young Ling with him everywhere. Hugh accepts.

So the first week Hugh is ordered to plough the rice fields. It's tough work and by the end of it Hugh is exhausted. And what's worse is Ling didn't lift a finger! He just stood there and watched! But hugh ignores it. 

The second week Hugh is ordered to fix the East Wall of the Monastry. brick by brick Hugh builds the wall up, and bit by bit Hugh's anger for the lazing Ling does the same. He has done nothing but look at hugh for 2 weeks! 

So Hugh can't stand it, he marches over to Ling who is now petrafied.  Picks him and and pins him against the wall. 

""I came here to get away from watching eyes, what do you want!? What are you doing here!?""

Ling looks back at him, and says in a strong Chinese accent ""wherever hugh go, I go""
