 today I was really horny, and I saw what I thought
to be a blank dvd. I thought, DVDs have a tight hole,
they might feel pretty good. So I put my soft pp into
the hole of the DVD, and for a few seconds as I started
getting harder, it felt pretty good, but then, once I was
fully erect, it started being painful. My pp was stuck in
the dvd, and I had to break it in half to get if out. It was
then when I flipped the broken dvd over and realized
that it was not a blank dvd, but a copy of the movie UP.

Well guys, guess I fucked up.",I fucked a DVD.,0

""I'm sorry. I'm sure you loved him very much.""

""No, it's just that we recently had him neutered! It cost $250!""

""Oh,"" the man replies, taken aback. He's suddenly rather aware of the officer behind him, and isn't sure what to do. ""Would it settle the matter if I paid for him?""

""Yes, I think that would settle it.""

Nodding, the man pulls his wallet from his back pocket and takes $250 out. As he hands the money to her, the police officer suddenly pushes past him and throws the woman against the door, handcuffing her.

Completely perplexed, the man can only look at the officer and ask, ""Why?""

“Not quite”, says Mr. Trump, “that would be an accident.”

A little girl raises her hand: “if a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.”

“I’m afraid not,” explained the president. “That’s what we would call a great loss.”

The room goes silent. Trump searches the room. “Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? “

Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says, “If Air Force One, carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens; that would be a tragedy.”

“Fantastic!” exclaimed Mr. Trump. “That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?”

But nothing happened. So the guy again said, ""Dick, at EASE!""

But still nothing happened. So the guy now says,"" For the last time, you son-of-a-bitch, I said AT EASE!!""

Still nothing. Well, the guy was embarrassed and ran off to the bathroom. His wife made excuses for him and then joined her husband in the bathroom, where she found him masturbating.

The Irishman looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns and he laughs. ""Oh, no, everybody's just fine!""

He explains, ""It's just that my wife had us join that Baptist Church and I had to quit drinking.

 - What do we do with this?

 - We should notify the American archaeological team. These people are professional and I'm sure they'll know what to do with this.

 They warn the American archeological team that comes with their jeeps, trailers, caravans and helicopters full of scientific devices.

 They get into the pyramid and after two years they leave.

 - Wow, it's been a while.  What have you found out?

 - Well - the spokesman of the American team responds - after laborious investigations, we have found out that this pyramid was built between 1500 and 2500 BC.

 - Only that! After two years they have only found out that!

 The two angry guys decide to call the Germans. The Germans come with their jeeps, helicopters and planes with scientific devices, get into the pyramid, spend two years and leave.

 - What have you found?

 - We have found out - the German responds -
 that this pyramid was probably built around 2000 BC.

 - Anything else?

 - Well, we couldn't find out more, the hieroglyphs are very complicated.

 The two men get very angry.

 - We can still call the russians, I'm completely sure they'll discover something else.

 But when the russians arrive, the men are surprised: there are no jeeps or helicopters, just one guy. The russian man enters and two hours later he leaves.

 - Soon!  What have you found out?

 - I have found out that the pyramid was built between February 12, 1858 and July 22, 1857 BC, according to the orders of Pharaoh Ankhetop IV, and its architect Thutmose the Younger.

 The opening day was cloudy and a branch of priests opposed it, because there was a partial eclipse of the moon in Sagittarius ... bla bla bla.

The most delicious plants, the spearmint leaves, sat at the edge of the fence where the chickens perched.  Whenever the cow would come by she'd eat the leaves, and then smooth talk the chickens with her minty fresh breath.  The chickens would eventually get so flustered they'd lay their eggs right then and there and the cow would have a cheeky laugh about it.

General Rooster, the leader of the hens, brought them together one night to hear his clever plan.  Each one would take a white stone the size of an egg and hide it under their feathers.  The cow would come and smooth talk them to have a laugh, but the chickens would drop the stone instead of an egg.

The next day they put the plan into action with great success.  That evening when General Rooster examined the nests he was relieved to see they finally had eggs.  When he got to absentminded Abigail though, he was shocked to see that she had the stone in her nest instead!

""Abigail!"" he began.  ""If your stone is here that means...
The real yolk is in the cow mints!""",A very smooth talking cow,11

Small John’s family, the Eeyeas had five children: three daughters and twin sons born from the same mother, Nicole. Nicole was a very patient mother. She loved Small John very much, but promptly left after her twin boys, the youngest of the children, were of learning age. Small John was notorious for his mischief, and though he never cheated on his wife, his humor was too much for her to handle. What Small John named his children was the deciding factor as to why Nicole left him.

Tildaswet was the first daughter born. Nicole found her first daughter’s name to be rather common in convention with other girls in the village. Jaswet, Feruswet, Tudaswet… the list went on to the commonality and the sense of belonging this implied. It was safe to say that Nicole was pleased with Small John’s name of choice, though she feared it at first as his mischief was in the realm of wordplay.

Dawn-Mabals was the second daughter born at, you guessed it, dawn. Nicole found her second daughter’s name to be on the stranger side, but she understood where Small John got this name. Their family owned cows renowned for their leather which the Mabal company purchases directly from the Eeyeas. It is common to name people after their occupations afterall. Using that logic, Nicole was once again pleased with Small John’s name of choice.

Dreepz was the third born daughter. On the day she was born, there was a big storm which raged for six days and seven nights. The onslaught of rainfall caused water to drip down the ceiling, hence the name “Dreepz”. Nicole thought that it was strange how Small John came up with the name, but it was an easy way to remember the day of Dreepz birth, so she went with it. “Dreepz” is a cute name anyway.

Tudawal and Tudawindo were identical twins, save for their height which became more apparent as they aged. Both of their names began with “Tuda” which made sense as twins should have more than just their birthdays be similar.

Nicole grew worried that she had missed something with Small John’s naming of their children. As if Small John could predict the future, his mischief did not miss the chance at a long-con pun. This grew apparent on the day that the Eeyeas got a new Russian teacher to home school their children.

Yaltski, the Russian home school teacher, instructed the Eeyea Children to stand in line from shortest to tallest. Yaltski found this to be the easiest method his brain could manage as the height differences were very clear, especially for the twins. 

Before the introductions, Small John gave instructions to his sons and daughters,

“My children. You all are my pride and joy that I myself have named, so show Yaltski the same pride you have in your name as is equivalent to the effort I took to raise you all. When I point to you, announce your names like the warriors I see you all as. You as well, Yaltski.”

Small John beats his chest, and yells, “EE-YEA-AH!!!” to which the children respond with their own chest pounding and proclamation of their family name, “EE-YEA-AH!!!”

Yaltski was shocked. Nicole finally saw where this was going and promptly left, saying she was going to buy a packet of cigarettes.

Small john proceeded to gesture his children to announce their names one by one from shortest to tallest, and finally to the Russian teacher in which the following proceeded:

Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.  


When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony being played backwards.""  
He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eight Symphony, and it's backwards too! Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening, ""There's the Seventh... The Sixth... The Fifth...""  


Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery:   


""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing.""

My wife did not really approve of it but I thought it will be a good place for my dog. Things did not go as planned. Separation between me and my wife grew after we moved. I was not able to find any work near the farm either.  I got diagnosed with depression and the doc told I should not drink alcohol. I sat in my shed and started crying everyday. One day my dog came and kept his paw on my leg as if trying to reassure me and I broke down. In the coming days things got worse. My farm started getting attacked by animals. Deers and horses started breaking into my farm. I was spending hours repairing the damage. But somehow that changed things around me. My relationship got better. My skills improved and I started getting work. But animals still attacked my farm. I thought about putting something more permanent to stop the damage to the farm. As I was bringing the iron fence from the truck, my dog came and sat next to me and said ""what's all this buddy"". After recovering from the shock of hearing my dog speak I told him how my life has suddenly gotten better and the only thing bothering me now is the animal attacks. He said ""buddy, they are my friends, and they are destroying your fence so that you can repost and get some sweet good karma!""",I recently bought a farm.,0

His brother was worried he might lose what little sight he had now. His friends were worried that what he was doing wasn't entirely legal. 

He dismissed them all one by one and finally bought his ticket and set off with grim determination.  

Upon arrival at the clinic he was shown into a simple room with white walls and ceiling. He put on the hospital gown and waited for the surgeon. 

After some time he began to hear screaming.  Blood curdling screaming, but he stayed put. Finally the door opened and in walked a little doctor followed by a nurse. 

The surgeon motioned for Saul to sit and began to pick individual eyes from the bloodied container the nurse carried. One by one he carefully held them up in front of Saul's eyes and muttered. 

""Too big"", the nurse translated, ""too small, too round, too damaged"". This continued as he tried every eye. 

With a frustrated gesture he then marched out of the room with the nurse in tow. 

Some time passed and after more blood curdling screams he returned with a fresh container.  The routine continued with more frustration and more repetitions of ""too long, too small.."". 

This second visit turned into three and four then five. Finally the surgeon slapped his knee and stared at the nurse. ""Wan!"", he announced "" Wan!"". 

5 minutes pass with more screams and he returns this time with just two eyes. ""Ah!"" he announces as he holds them to Saul's face with a grin. 

Two injections and an unknown time later Saul awakens and the first thing he sees, clearly, was the smiling nurse.

""It was a success?"" he asks nervously. 

""Of course"", she replies, ""Wan's eyes fits Saul"". 

(Original)",After years of saving Saul finally had enough money to get his eye transplant in China,7

He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery in the Kentucky back country. As the bagpiper was not familiar with the backwoods, he got lost.
He finally arrived an hour late and saw the service was finished and the father had left. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. He felt very badly and apologized to the men for being late. He went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. Not knowing what else to do, he started to play.
The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. He played out his heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. He played like he’d never played before for this homeless man. And as he played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, he wept, they all wept together.
When he finished, he packed up his bagpipes and started for his car. Though his head hung low, his heart was full. As he opened the door to his car, he heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”

She turned, smiled, and said, ""Business. I'm going to the Annual Nymphomaniacs of America Convention in Boston.""

He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs.
Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, ""What's your business role at this convention?""

""Lecturer,"" she responded. ""I use information that I have learned from my personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.""

""Really?"" he said. ""And what kind of myths are there?""

""Well,"" she explained, ""one popular myth is that African-American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American
Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Jewish
descent who are the best. I have also discovered that the lover with absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck."" Suddenly the

post,dgnkwt,2qh72,jokes,false,1570839029,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dgnkwt/my_first_oc_joke_long/,self.jokes,,"A man walks into an antique shop. He approaches the female cashier and
asks, “Is this your store?”

She nods her head, “My parents owned it for a few decades, I had since inherited it.”

The man then asks her, “Would you like to see a magic trick?”

The woman, barley amused, decides to play along, “Sure.”

“Excellent”, the man replies, “I want you to think of an item in this shop that holds the most significant personal value to you, and close your eyes.”

The woman decides to play along, taking a moment to gather her thoughts, then smiles, “Okay, I got it.”

He tells the woman to hold out her hands in front of her as if to hold the object she is imagining, she follows his instruction and holds her hands out in front of her. The man snaps his fingers and at that moment her arms are burdened with this almost cold weight. She opens her eyes to see this antique plate, ceramic, decorated in gold trimmings and a cute little chickadee in the centre. 

“Wow, that was incredible! This plate has been in my family for generations, but I had recently fallen on hard times and had to put it up for sale in the shop despite my greater wishes. How did you know?”

“But it is magic, my dear, I cannot reveal my secrets. I would, however, like to ask you to do one more thing for me. I would like you to close your eyes once again, this time holding out the plate, and think about what you wish you had in this exact moment, it could be anything you want.”

The woman again shuts her eyes, a smile reaching across her face again. She takes in a deep breath and nods, “I’m ready.”

Snap.

She feels the weight of the plate disappear and her hands are filled with a warm, almost gritty texture. Repulsed, she widens her eyes to see that the plate has disappeared and been replaced with several warm fried chicken balls. 

“What is this?!” She is exclaimed, realizing she is now holding food where her family heirloom once was. “Where did my dish go?”

“I don’t know! I think given the parameters of the previous trick you should have been more emotionally prepared for what was about to happen!”

“Get out of my store!” She yelled, hurling the chicken balls at the man as he scurried out the door.

“I’m calling the cops!” she exclaimed as she picked up the phone and began dialling.

A couple hours later two officers show up at the shop,

“Wilson, I cant believe we’re doing this”

“Tell me about it, Smith. I’m missing my daughter’s birthday for this, over a goddamn plate. Mmm—“

“Wilson, what are you doing?!”

“Wut—“ Wilson choked out, mouth full of food.

“Are you seriously eating right now?”

Wilson, arm deep in a bucket of the Colonel’s Crispy, “Oh, I’m sorryyyy, I didn’t plan lunch around the theft of dinnerware.”

“Well, put that garbage away, you’ll contaminate the crime scene.”

“No, Smith, Smith, I think I got it!”

“Got what?”

“I figured out the case.”

“What was there to figure out? A man stole a plate, there’s nothing to be solved, we’re only here to fill out some paperwork.”

“No, Smith. This is only the second known case of Chickadee China to Chinese Chicken.”

Thank you.

Many years later, John was drinking alone in a crowded pub when suddenly the pub caught fire. People rushed to the door but couldn’t make it out before the place filled with smoke. All of a sudden, John stood on his chair, breathed ALL the smoke into his lungs, rushed over to a window, and blew all the smoke outside. Everyone was amazed. 
“How did you do that?!”,  the bar owner asked.
“It was easy”, John replied, “I’m an ex-tractor fan!”","There once was a man called John O’Malley. When John was young he loved tractors. He had posters of tractors on his wall, loads of toy tractors, he even named his dog “Tractor”!",6

However, the gates are closed and Forrest approaches the Gatekeeper.
St. Peter says, ""Well, Forrest, it's certainly good to see you. We have heard a lot about you. I must tell you, though, that the place is filling up fast, and we've been administering an entrance examination for everyone.
The test is short, but you have to pass it before you can get into Heaven.""

Forrest responds, ""It shor is good to be here , St. Peter, sir.
But nobody ever tolt me about any entrance exam.
Shor hope the test ain't too hard; life was a big enough test as it was.""

St. Peter goes on, ""Yes, I know, Forrest, but the test is only three questions:

First: What two days of the week begin with the letter T?

Second: How many seconds are there in a year?

Third: What is God's first name?""

Forrest leaves to think the questions over.
He returns the next day and sees St. Peter who waves him up and says, ""Now that you have had a chance to think the questions over, tell me your answers.""

Forrest says, ""Well, the first one -- which two days in the week begin with the letter ""T""? Shucks, that one's easy. That'd be Today and Tomorrow.""

The Saint's eyes open wide and he exclaims, ""Forrest, that's not what I was thinking, but you do have a point, and I guess I didn't specify, so I'll give you credit for that answer.
How about the next one?"" asks St. Peter.

""How many seconds in a year?""

""Now that one's harder,"" says Forrest, ""but I thunk and thunk about that and I guess the only answer can be twelve.""

Confounded, St. Peter says, ""Twelve? Twelve!?
Forrest, how in Heaven's name could you come up with twelve seconds in a year?""

Forrest says ""Shucks, there's gotta be twelve: January 2nd, February 2nd,March 2nd. . .""

""Hold it, "" interrupts St. Peter. ""I see where you're going with this, and I see your point, though that wasn't quite what I had in mind.....but I'll have to give you credit for that one, too.
Let's go on with the third and final question. Can you tell me God's first name""?

""Sure"" Forrest replied, ""its Andy.""

Andy?!"" exclaimed an exasperated and frustrated St. Peter. ""Ok, I can understand how you came up with your answers to my first two questions, but just how in the world did you come up with the name Andy as the first name of God?""

""Shucks, that was the easiest one of all,"" Forrest replied.
""I learnt it from the song. . . . ""ANDY WALKS WITH ME, ANDY TALKS WITH ME, ANDY TELLS ME I AM HIS OWN. . . .""

Always there was fighting over who would control the island, as it was a veritable paradise and each King wanted it for himself as a place to relax away from royal life.

One day, the Kings decided they’d seen enough of war over the island and called a meeting to decide on a peaceful solution. After much arguing, they concluded that a friendly fight should be held with the winner taking the island. At first the Kings wanted to send their best knights in, however as it happened all 3 were injured from previous battles and couldn’t fight. In their place, it was decided that the squire of each knight would fight on their behalf. 

The day before the fight, each squire was preparing for it by training. The first squire drilled his swordplay over and over until he could take 3 men at once. The second squire focussed on improving his strength and speed, believing that he could outmatch anyone if he became strong enough. The third squire took a rope, tied it in a noose and tightened it around small cooking pot. He then hung it from the highest tower in the city before going off to feast and relax for the day. 

When the day of the fight arrived, the three squires each squared up in the ring. It was to be a free for all, last man standing wins. Each had a wooden sword and a shield, as they didn’t want to kill each other in this friendly match. The crowd looked on, tense and ready for the action. 

The announcer raised his hand for quiet. 

“Gentlemen, are you ready?” He asked.

Each squire signalled they were ready.

“Then begin!” He shouted.

It was over almost too fast, the squire from the third kingdom moving at inhuman speed and crushing both of his opponents. Nobody could believe what they’d seen.

“How on earth did you do that?” One of the Kings asked, unable to believe what he’d seen.

“It’s simple.” Replied the squire, “The squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the squires of the other two sides.”",Once there were three kingdoms,90

It was all fun and good natured tricks, until Simba looked over the Elephant Graveyard where Scar had retreated to since Mufasa exiled him. Simba wanted to pull a Halloween prank on Scar, but wouldn't dare ignore Mufasa's orders this time and cross into the dark. But his enthusiasm knew no bounds. He asked around if  a volunteer would pull the trick on his behalf. Nobody dared. Simba grew frustrated. Finally, a young kangaroo stepped forward.

""I am new to these lands; and I'm curious to know what's beyond there. I bet no animal could be scarier than what we have back home in Australia"".

So saying, he put on the costume that Simba gave, and hopped over to Scar's cave in Elephant Graveyard. 

Scar wondered if he was hallucinating when he heard *‘Trick or Treat!!’*. He barely had a good meal since he was exiled; and his failed dream of becoming king still hurt his pride. No wonder, when he stepped out and saw the kangaroo dressed in a rich robe with a crown on his head, his emotions burst out as a huge roar...

The priest nods his head with approval at the imam’s explanation. The rabbi who looks clearly offended by both their explanations says: « I can’t even begin to believe what I’m hearing!

He decided to sell his items collected over the years of roaming in the forests. He had been lowering his sale prices over the course of the day as fewer and fewer people were coming by. 

Finally, one passer by came to buy his stuff, but mister Kong quickly realized there was a language barrier between the two as he couldn’t talk, but only use his hand motions. He could hear and understand fine, but talking was a no no. Me made the motion to call his wife, misses Kong, who could communicate well! “How much should I sell this RC car for?”, he asked Hs wife. “Well, we might as give it for free if he is interested, we don’t need it anymore and it barely works!”  They both agreed. “But how can we tell him it’s free?”. “Well”, said Ms Kong, “maybe you can honk the car to say it’s free!” 

The buyer first looked at some Blizzard and Apple products but decided not to buy as they looked like shit. Finally, seeing the RC car, he dives to buy it. 

Buyer: How much is this?
Mr Kong: *waves hands*
Buyer: I’m not sure what that means...
Mrs Kong:remember to honk at the right price! 
Buyer:is it 20?
Mr Kong:*waves no*
Buyer: what about 5?
Mr Kong: *waves no and much lower* 
The buyer, confused, asks:

Buyer: **Free**? 
Mrs Kong: **Honk, Kong!**",The King of all the gorillas was having a yard sale,5

He says to the first nun, ""Sister, have you ever had contact with a man's penis?""

The first nun says ""I touched one once with just the tip of my finger.""

St Peter, pleased with her honesty says ""dip that fingertip into the font and proceed, cleansed, through the gates.""

St Peter then asks the second nun in line the same question.

She replies, ""yes your Holiness, I once gave a man handjob, and I am very ashamed"".

St Peter, seemingly unsurprised by her admission, calmly says ""very well sister, rinse your offending hands vigorously in the font and continue through the gates to life everlasting.""
