Squeezing Every Last Drop 

Out of Ya


A father walks into a bookstore with his young son. The boy is holding a quarter. Suddenly, the boy starts choking, going blue in the face. The father realizes the boy has swallowed the quarter and starts panicking, shouting for help.

A well dressed, attractive and serious looking woman, in a blue business suit is sitting at a coffee bar reading a newspaper and sipping a cup of coffee. At the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down, neatly folds the newspaper and places it on the counter, gets up from her seat and makes her way, unhurried, across the book store.
Reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants; takes hold of the boy's testicles and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly.
After a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the quarter, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand.
Releasing the boy's testicles, the woman hands the coin to the father and walks back to her seat in the coffee bar without saying a word.
As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no ill effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts thanking her saying, ""I've never seen anybody do anything like that before, it was fantastic. Are you a doctor?""
""No,"" the woman replied. ""Divorce attorney""",Divorce Attorney,12

queue when a woman behind me asked if I had a dog.

What did she think I had, an elephant? On impulse I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, I was starting the Winalot Diet again. 

I added that I probably shouldn'’t, because I ended up in hospital last time, but I'd lost 2 stone before I woke up in intensive care with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.

I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pockets with Winalot nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so it works well
and I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in queue was now enthralled with my story.)

Horrified, she asked me if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no, I stepped off the kerb to sniff an Irish Setter's arse and a car hit me.

I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard.

He's basically my dude, my bro, the cock to my balls you might say. However, I have always made it clear to him that our relationship is far from romantic. Recently though, he began learning to put more complex phrases together and has been using sloppy one liners in an attempt to seduce me. He has always had an extremely potent sex drive, his name is ""Busta"" (if you catch my drift).

Have you ever been seduced by a parrot before? No?

Well, it is hella weird and kinda perverted given the squawky voice that parrots have. The attempts are very rudimentary and sloppy as a bj from a spider monkey, but there is definitely an attempt to sound natural and sexy. His favorite phrases vary from nonsense such as ""Boy you tomato? Cuz Busta wanna hump"" to a relatively sophisticated ""Guess where I hide food pellets"" or even ""You. Me. Bang Bang!""

Now, it eventually came to the point that I could no longer simply ignore his advances. (Plus I was getting tired of being woken up to a bird dry humping my foot) Yesterday, I had a sit down with him, it played out something like this.

Me: ""Yo, so umm... we gotta talk""

Busta: ""You fuck me?""

Me: ""NO! See, this is what we gotta talk about man. Listen, You are a damn sexy parrot bro, and any other bird would be lucky to have you. You are charming, confident, and very intelligent. But like bro, I'm not gay. I don't feel for you the same way. Plus I'm a person. My dick would literally destroy you!""

Busta: ""Thats the fuckin idea"" \*sexy parrot wink\*(you shoulda seen it. freaky as hell)

Me: ""NO IT'S NOT!! DON'T YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYING!?""

Busta \*looks at his birdie boner in shame\*

There she greeted the shopkeeper and asked for a reasonably priced parrot. The shopkeeper proceeded to show her every parrot that he got. The first parrot was blue and green and could speak every language. The woman was amazed by its skills but she didn't like its price so much. ""5 thousand dollars are too much for what he does"" she said. Eventually the woman did not find something that she liked, so she was ready to leave. The shopkeeper aware of her displeasure, told her to wait and went to the back, only to come back with a huge black bird, full of grey spots, sharp claws, a sliced eye and a crooked beak. The woman disgusted from the monstrosity that laid upon her, asked what kind of bird that was. The shopkeeper told her everything about the bird. How it was trained by Bruce Lee himself, the art o karate, Kung fu and a bunch of others. She was amazed, but again it was not enough for her to buy it. The shopkeeper told her to be patient. He organised a little representation of what the parrot could do. He took her to the back where many random furniture were scattered all over the place. The shopkeeper started by pointing a wooden chair and saying ""chair karate"" The menacing bird raised its wings, and within a split second, the chair was cut into million pieces. He then proceeded by pointing a big iron wardrobe and saying ""wardrobe karate"" The bird again raises its wings and destroys the wardrobe. The woman shocked, pulled out her purse and took out a good amount of cash, and she gave it to the shopkeeper. She took the parrot and started heading home. When she arrived she found her husband lying on the couch watching TV. He saw the bird with surprise and curiosity and asked her wife what was that abomination that sat on her shoulder, and why did she return home without a parrot that she said she got it. She answered that this is the parrot that she choose, and she also tried to convince him that it would be great as a bodyguard. Curious the man asks why. She told him how the bird knows karate, can destroy anything and defeat any burglar. The man laughed at her claims and said:

The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge.

Visitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away.

It is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat. Black bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of fur. Grizzly bear droppings tend to contain small bells and smell of pepper.",The National Park Rangers are advising hikers in Glacier National Park and other Rocky Mountain parks to be alert for bears and take extra precautions to avoid an encounter.,7

This Cheerio dreamed of going to Perfect Cheerio Land, where only the best Cheerios lived. In Perfect Cheerio Land, there was everything a little Cheerio’s heart desired.

One day, when Cheerio woke up, an angel cheerio was at the foot of his bed. The angel said, “I am here to take you to Perfect Cheerio Land, but only for one day.” Cheerio was ecstatic. Finally he would see Perfect Cheerio Land!

Cheerio wanted to have a day packed with fun. First, Cheerio and the angel went to a restaurant. When they arrived, there was a very very very very very long line. So they waited and waited and waited and waited and finally got to the front. 

After they ate their food, Cheerio wanted to go to an amusement park. When Cheerio and the angel arrived, Cheerio said that he wanted to go on the Ferris Wheel. Unfortunately, there was another very very very very very long line. So they waited and waited and waited and waited and finally got to the front. 

After they rode on the Ferris Wheel, Cheerio wanted to go to an arcade. When they arrived, Cheerio said he wanted to play Pac-Man. But Pac-Man was the most popular game on the arcade, so there was a very very very very very long line. So they waited and waited and waited and waited and finally got to the front. 

After Cheerio played Pac-Man, he was very thirsty. He looked around for something to drink, but couldn’t find any drink anywhere. After hours of searching, he stumbled upon a manager and asked him, “Sir, where is the punch line?”

The manager looked up and said, “There is no punch line.”",Once upon a time there was a Cheerio.,13

An American, an Italian, and a Canadian.

A loud horn is heard signifying lunch, and all three men sat together, on the edge, their feet dangling a hundreds of feet in the air.

The American opens his lunch pail and exclaims loudly, ""Hell! Hamburger and french fries again for lunch?? Everyday my wife makes me this. I swear if this happens again tomorrow, I will jump off of here and kill myself!""

The Italian opens his lunch pail ""Momma mia! Spaghetti and-a meat-a-balls! Again?! My friend if my wife packs this again I will jump to my death with you!""

The Canadian opens his lunch pail and smirks in disgust. ""Aye bai's, if I have to eat a bolgna sandwich again I will jump too. No doobt aboot it!""

The next day, a loud horn is heard on The Empire State Building construction site. The three men sit down on the same spot, legs dangling over the edge.

The American opens his lunch pail, exclaims loudly ""FUCK!"", and without another word jumps and plummets to his death.

The Italian, looking nervous, peeks inside his lunchpail and lets out a long sigh. Then slides off the edge and plummets 40 floors.

The Canadian opens his lunch pail. Pulls out a bologna sandwich and enjoys his lunch. Stands up, stretches, looks over the city, then jumps to his death.

A week later a funeral is held for the three men. The American wife is bawling her eyes out swearing she will cry whenever she sees a hamburger. The Italian wife is in hysterics swearing to never eat pasta again. The Canadians wife is smoking a cigarette drinking a beer. The other wives ask why she is not mourning her husband.

We understand that some of you were looking forward to seeing what cruel and peculiar clusterf**k of a disaster 2020 would throw up next, but on balance we believe it is probably best not to find out.

We will instead provide ticket holders with a full refund or exchange, and start afresh with 2021 on Monday.

post,fls1pw,2qh72,jokes,false,1584695905,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fls1pw/government/,self.jokes,,"A cowboy named Bud was overseeing his herd in a remote mountainous pasture in California when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced toward him out of a cloud of dust.

The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, Will you give me a calf?"" 

Bud looks at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, Why not?"" 

The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.. 

The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg , Germany .. 

Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response.. 

Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer, turns to the cowboy and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves."" 

""That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,"" says Bud. He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car. 

Then Bud says to the young man, ""If I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?"" 

The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ""Okay, why not?"" 

""You're a Congressman for the U.S. Government"", says Bud. 

""Wow! That's correct,"" says the yuppie, ""but how did you guess that?"" 

""No guessing required."" answered the cowboy. ""You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter.

At this point, the bartender asks the man, ""Hey, have you heard of our famous bar challenge?""

The man replies, ""What?""

The bartender explains, ""Yeah. So what you do is you do a thirty second keg stand and you then have to complete three tasks. If you complete all three tasks, then you win $5,000. It's all safe and totally legal.""

The man sees no visible reason to object, so he says, ""Sure, why not? How hard can this be?""

""You'll see. The first thing you'll do after your keg stand is eat our famous deluxe double cheeseburger meal with every possible ingredient on the burger and an extra large fries and a shake."" 

The man nods, and a smug look crosses his face. *This'll be easy,* he thought to himself. 

""Next up, there's an alligator we've been trying to get rid of that's been lurking behind the bar in the back alley sewer. You'll go through that door to get there. You are allowed to use a baseball bat that's sitting by the door. Kill the alligator and deposit it in the garbage disposal.""

The man nods again, this time enthusiastically, and gestures for the bartender to continue.

""For your last challenge, you will go up the back stairs and enter the first door on the left. In that room, a prostitute is waiting for you. Have sex with her and last for ten minutes, and come back down. After all has been completed, you will walk out of here with $5,000 of cold, hard cash. Do you agree to these terms?""

""I agree to your terms,"" the man replies.

The bartender grins and exclaims, ""Great! You have exactly one hour to complete this challenge. Are you ready?""

""Hell yes. Let's DO THIS!!"" The man rips his shirt off to reveal his muscular figure in the spirit of drunkenness.

""Okay."" The bartender turns and shouts to everyone in the bar, ""Great news! We have a participant!!"" Cheering ensues from the rest of the bar. The bartender turns back to the man and says, ""Time starts... NOW!""

He performs the keg stand, while the entire room full of people cheer him on and count - ""TWENTY-SEVEN, TWENTY-EIGHT, TWENTY-NIIIIIINE, THIRTY!!"" 

The man ROARS in triumph and starts to demolish the deluxe burger combo, which he polishes off in 7 minutes and 32 seconds. The bartender shouts, ""Fifty-one minutes and thirty seconds left to go!"" The man, feeling empowered by the people at the bar, storms out the back door. 

Five minutes pass. Then, ten. Fifteen. Twenty. Twenty five. 

FINALLY, at twenty six minutes and three seconds gone by, the man re-enters the building, pants and shoes badly tattered and soaked with sewer water. He's scratched profusely in the chest, and blood is trickling down his entire body. In his drunken state, however, he doesn't seem to notice. He bellows, ""ALL RIGHT.

Before the show, they had the costumes, props, and theater disinfected to protect the health of the actors. However, the sanitizing process left the stage dangerously slippery.

Because of the shortage of household supplies, the maintenance team had no paper towels to wipe away the disinfectant, and they almost had to cancel the show. Luckily a stagehand had an idea. He found an old dictionary in the props closet, ripped out its pages, and laid them all down individually to cover the entire stage. This gave the actors just enough traction to safely perform.

The play was steamed tó over 50,000 viewers and went off without a hitch, The next day the producer tracked the stage hand.

The taxi arrived and we opened the front door to leave the house. The cat we put out in the back yard, scoots back into the front door. 

We didn't want the cat shut in the house because she always tries to eat the bird. My wife goes out to the taxi, while I went inside to get the cat. The cat runs upstairs, with me in hot pursuit. 

Waiting in the cab, my wife doesn't want the driver to know that the house will be empty for the night. So, she explains to the taxi driver that I will be out soon, 'He's just going upstairs to say Goodbye to my mother.' 

A few minutes later, I get into the cab. 'Sorry I took so long,' I said, as we drove away. 'That stupid bitch was hiding under the bed. I had to poke her with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off, so I grabbed her by the neck. Then, I had to wrap her in a blanket to keep her from scratching me. But it worked!

The manager says to the Italian, ""Sanitize everything in the kitchen!""

The manager then says to the Scottsman, ""Make new to-go flyers! All our new dishes need to be on there!""

The manager then says to the Japanese man, ""You're in charge of supplies!""

He leaves in a panic to check on his family and comes back to the restaurant. When he goes into the kitchen, he sees that everything is absolutely filthy and *nothing* has been cleaned. He asks the Italian, ""What happened? Why didn't you clean the kitchen?!""

He replies ""I no ave mop! I no ave rags! I no ave soap! You saida to the Japanese guy dat e wasa ina charge of sooplies, but he hasa disappeared and I no coulda finda 'im nowhere.""

Frustrated, the manager leaves to check on the new to-go menus, and he sees the Scotsman just sitting there, reading the old menus. ""...and you! I thought I told you to create to-go menus!""

He replied, ""Aye, ye did lad, but ah couldnae git masel' ony paper o' pens! Ye left tha' wee Jap mannie in charge o' supplies, but ah couldnae fin' him onywhar.""

The manager blows his top and storms off into the back of the restaurant to find the Japanese man. He looks in the alleyway, in the bathroom, and as he is walking towards the closet, the door suddenly bursts open! Out jumps the Japanese man and he yells...

A reporter heard about a restaurant that claimed to be the most efficient restaurant around, so he decided to take a look for himself. When he got there he noticed right away that they only had male staff. Once he was seated, he asked his waiter, “Why are there only male staff?”. The waiter replied, “Well the owner did a study and apparently male staff have more energy and need to take less breaks, and well time is money.” The reporter wasn’t sure on this but maybe it was true. He went ahead and ordered some soup. While he was eating his soup he happened to drop his spoon. His waiter was nearby and immediately gave him a replacement from his breast pocket. “That was quick!” He said to the waiter. “Do you always have a spare spoon in your breast pocket?” The waiter responded “If you take a look around, all the waiters have spoons in their breast pocket. Apparently the owner did a study and spoons are the most dropped utensil. Knowing this he told us to carry one in our breast pocket so that when a customer drops one, we don’t have to take the time to go back to the kitchen to get another one and well time is money.” The reporter was starting to think wow this owner really knows his stuff because after all I did drop my spoon. He kept eating until he noticed that all the waiters also had a string tied from the breast pocket down to their pants zipper. He called over his waiter and said “So I noticed the string that goes down to your zipper. What’s up with that?”. The waiter was a little embarrassed and said “Well this one is a bit odd and embarrassing to say, but since you’re a reporter I’ll go ahead and tell you. The owner did a study and it takes men about 3 mins to go to the bathroom, wash their hands, and get back to work. He wanted to cut that time in half, so he made us tie the end of the string to the tips of our privates so when we go to the bathroom we just unzip, pull on the string and it comes out. We don’t have to touch it so we don’t have to wash our hands, which saves time and well time is money.” This caught the reporter off guard. “That is the strangest thing I’ve heard, but I suppose it makes sense.” The waiter was about to leave when the reporter said “Wait! I see how you get it out, but ummm how do you get it back in your pants?” The waiter leaned in and said “I don’t know about the rest of the guys, but I use the spoon!”",Time is money,2

The English are feeling the pinch in relation to recent virus threat and have therefore raised their threat level from ""Miffed"" to ""Peeved."" Soon, though, level may be raised yet again to ""Irritated"" or even ""A Bit Cross.""

The English have not been ""A Bit Cross"" since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out.

The virus has been re-categorized from ""Tiresome"" to ""A Bloody Nuisance."" The last time the British issued a ""Bloody Nuisance"" warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.

The Scots have raised their threat level from ""Pissed Off"" to ""Let's Get the Bastard."" They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.

The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its alert level from ""Run"" to ""Hide."" The only two higher levels in France are ""Collaborate"" and ""Surrender."" The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability.

Italy has increased the alert level from ""Shout Loudly and Excitedly"" to ""Elaborate Military Posturing."" Two more levels remain: ""Ineffective Combat Operations"" and ""Change Sides.""

The Germans have increased their alert state from ""Disdainful Arrogance"" to ""Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs."" They also have two higher levels: ""Invade a Neighbour"" and ""Lose.""

Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels.

The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.

Australia, meanwhile, has raised its alert level from ""No worries"" to ""She'll be alright, Mate."" Two more escalation levels remain: ""Crikey! I think we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!"" and ""The barbie is cancelled."" So far, no situation has ever warranted use of the final escalation level.",Coronavirus alerts across the world,34

The First thing the man does is find water and a source of food. However, after some time has passed the man begins to explore the island, with his dog always by his side.

 He finds nothing but a goat at the other end of the island. 

At first, he thinks nothing of the goat, but a few years pass by and he begins to think more and more of the goat. It reaches the point where he actually begins to find the goat attractive in his mind, since he's had no intimacy with anyone and feels so starved of his sexual life. He was in need. 

One day he says ""fuck it"" and decides to approach the goat. He comes near it and begins to smell it, caress it and whisper sweet nothings into its ear. But his dog was not having it and immediately began barking at him loudly. The man was unaffected. He was deeply hipnotized by the goat and was already beginning to remove his clothes. In that moment the dog reacted with deep jealousy and bit his ankle. The man put his clothes back on and grabbed the dog and dragged him all the way back to the other side of the island so he could be alone with the goat. Once they were, he just went for it and put his peepee inside the goat and began to make crazy love to the goat. But the dog had made its way back and once again attacked the man disrupting his intercourse with the goat. This time the man was angry as shit and not only did he give the dog a beating but he tied him to a coconut tree with some improvised materials he found. He was still erect as a geeser and proceeded to fornicate frantically with the goat.
Once again, just as the man was about to colossally ejaculate, the dog, who had freed itself, was once again barking and bitting with all its might, interrupting the sex act at the most crucial moment.

In that precise moment suddenly a smoking hot nude woman washes up on the shore unconscious. The man forgets all about the fight and rescues the lady with some cpr. The woman quickly comes back to life and says ""who are you? You saved my life! I owe you. I will do anything you say, please let me repay you?!
"" You'll do anything?"" says the man
"" yes!!! Anything at all!!! She replies

""OK, can you just please hold my dog?""",A Man and his dog are stranded on an island,2
