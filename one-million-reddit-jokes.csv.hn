post,9ogsfs,2qh72,jokes,false,1539637302,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9ogsfs/a_king_hired_a_professional_thief/,self.jokes,,"The king wants to steal the national treasure of the neighboring kingdom, something that, if he owns, he'll have the right to rule BOTH countries. He sent out a call across the land for the best, sneakiest, and most ruthless assassins, thieves, brigands, and highwaymen and stated their crimes would be forgiven and they'd be knighted, paid handsomely, etc.

Out of all of the applicants, he finally picked the hardest, most shadowy, charismatic thief he'd ever met, and he told him the deal.

""The national treasure of Rogandia has never been seen, except by the Rogandian people - I don't even know what it looks like, but it's up in the tower in the middle of the city. There are no stairs - it's a straight rope climb up and supposedly there are traps of great cunning and lethal ingenuity. 

After all of that, you'll come to a room where you'll be able to SEE the treasure, but in order to access it, you need to converse with 3 ancient sphinxes that will test your very mental stability. Only after that will you be able to bring it back here and gain your fame and notoriety!"".

The thief smiled, bowed, and left. He got to the tower in the middle of the night in absolute darkness and nearly tripped over multiple bodies in varying states of decay, and began his climb. About halfway up, he felt a rush of air to his left and right and ducked just as huge spears flew by. Proud of himself he finished his climb and got to the top floor.

Up in front of him were two blue sphinx as the king had said, and behind them was a huge glass wall. On the other side was a curious display; a small, wooden stand with a path down the middle, and some mechanical creature going back and forth over and over.

The first sphinx spoke, but instead of a riddle, it simply said ""Thief, your mother is so fat, she jumped up and got stuck"". Taken off guard, the thief raised an eyebrow in confusion. The second sphinx laughed and said ""your dad is so stupid he sold the house to pay the mortgage"". More mechanical laughter from the sphinxes. 

Puzzled but growing irritated after 5 minutes of these jokes, the thief tried to walk forward but was buffeted back by winds from the two statues, who stopped and glared and then continued.

5 hours later the thief is in tears from the constant tirade of jokes about him, his parents, his little sister, his dead dog; everything in his head the sphinxes had a horrible insult or barb to hurl at him. After 6 straight hours, the sphinxes both ""dinged"" and allowed him to pass. He staggered wearily towards the glass, his body wracked with sobs and his nose dripping snot, mingling with his tears. 

Through the glass he saw the totality of what he'd glimpsed prior; it was a mechanical model of a small road, and a chicken was crossing it back and forth, back and forth. He laughed, softly but growing more feverish as he stared. The door to his right opened but he just kept laughing, his madness overwhelming his reason, and he ran and leapt into the void, straight down into the blackness before him.

In the morning, the guards found his ruined corpse and poked it with a spear to make sure.

""What do you suppose this one's deal was"", said the first guard.

""Like the others, I guess; just can't take a joke"".",A king hired a professional thief,5

The next day the dog comes back and scratches at the door. The guy opens the door, the dog comes in, goes down the hall, jumps on the couch, gets comfortable and falls asleep again.

Sam would come in off the lake with a boat full. Stringer after stringer was always packed with freshly caught trout. The warden, curious, asked Sam his secret. The successful fisherman invited the game warden to accompany him and observe.

So the next morning the two met at the dock and took off in Sam’s boat. When they got to the middle of the lake, Sam stopped the boat, and the warden sat back to see how it was done.

Sam’s approach was simple. He took out a stick of dynamite, lit it, and threw it in the air. The explosion rocked the lake with such a force that dead fish immediately began to surface. Sam took out a net and started scooping them up.

Well, you can imagine the reaction of the game warden. When he recovered from the shock of it all, he began yelling at Sam. “You can’t do this! I’ll put you in jail, buddy! You will be paying every fine there is in the book!”

Sam, meanwhile, set his net down and took out another stick of dynamite. He lit it and tossed it in the lap of the game warden with these words, “Are you going to sit there all day complaining, or are you going to fish?”",Sam's fishing secret.,8

&amp;#x200B;

A lady noticed that he was walking funny, taking small steps, and with a look of pain and anxiety on his face. ""Sir"", she said, ""the ladies restroom is unoccupied. You may use it if you promise not to touch any of the buttons on the wall.""

&amp;#x200B;

He was certainly about to pop, and would have promised anything, so he agreed to her terms. The relief was pure joy, and as he sat there, savoring the feeling, he noticed the buttons he had promised not to touch. Three white buttons, were identified by the letters WW, WA, and PP, and there was one red button labeled ATR. Who would really know if he touched them?

&amp;#x200B;

He couldn't just sit there and resist a challenge like this, so he pushed the WW button. Warm Water was sprayed gently upon his bottom. Such a nice feeling came over him. The men's restroom didn't have nice things like this.

&amp;#x200B;

Anticipating even greater pleasure, he pressed the WA button. Warm Air replaced the warm water, wafted and swirled about, gently drying his underside. He knew what he was going to do when the warm air stopped and without hesitation, he pressed the PP button.

&amp;#x200B;

A large Powder Puff caressed his bottom, adding a fragrant scent of spring flowers to his unbelievable pleasure. The ladies room was far more than a restroom; it was a place of tender loving pleasure! He could hardly wait for the powder puff to quit.

&amp;#x200B;

When it did, he pushed the button he knew was going to be the ultimate joy!

&amp;#x200B;

He knew he was in the hospital as soon as he opened his eyes. A nurse was staring down at him with a smirk on her face.

&amp;#x200B;

""What happened? How did I get here? The last thing I remember, I was in the ladies restroom!""

“No, I’m not kidding. I want you to kick me in the butt ,” insisted the Israeli.

The soldier went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9 mm pistol from under his flak jacket, and shot the leader dead.

Tim and Matt went to see a wrestling match at a local arena. There was a famous wrestler in town called the Human Pretzel (due to his special move folding someone in the shape of a pretzel). Anyways, the Human Pretzel won all of his matches that night and called out anyone in the crowd that thought they could take him and offered a million dollars to anyone who could make it out the first round. Tim told Matt since he was a great wrestler he should give it a try. Matt agreed and entered the ring. After 10 rounds Matt gets back in his corner and is very tired as Tim is trying to pump him up. 
Tim: ""Man, you could beat this guy. Hes getting tired and you could be the champion!"" 
Matt: ""I know but im exhausted, im probably not gonna make another round""
11th round starts and sure enough the Human Pretzel finally pins Matt. The referee comes flying in and starts to count ""One! Two! Thr"" and just before hes about to lose, Matt screams at the top of his lungs and amazingly ends up on top the Human Pretzel, pinning him, and winning the match!. After the match a reporter rushes to Matt and says:
Reporter: ""Matt, no one had ever beaten the Human Pretzel before! How on earth did you do it?!""
Matt smirking: ""Well, i thought i was gonna lose for sure. when he got me in that pretzel lock, I just happened to open my eyes and see a big pair of nuts in my face.

One morning before class started, I was reading out loud one such warning in the morning paper to my friend; where that group said they would detonate a bomb in the town market that Saturday. Once she heard that, my friend, whose nose had been buried in some kind of catalogue until that point, looked up in sheer alarm and yelled out: ""At what time??? :O ""

I guess she was hoping that the terrorists had been polite enough to provide a specific time with the warning so that she could then simply do her shopping at another time and avoid the inconvenience and potential early demise.",[Anecdote] Sometimes friends bring light to even the darkest situations,10

The next day, as the contractor was on his way to another job site, he noticed the fence at the old mans house was completely taken apart and laying in pieces on his front yard, posts ripped out of the ground and all. As he remembered the old man thanking him and leaving him with a generous tip, it didn’t seem to make much sense. 

At the end of the day, the contractor decided to make a stop at the old mans house to check up to see if everything was okay with his work. As he got there, he noticed the fence was put back together, good as the original. Still questioning everything, he knocked at the door to be welcomed by the old man and his wife looking very happy. 

The old man excused himself from his wife to talk with the contractor in private, and broke into explanation right away. 

“I had to take it apart right as soon as you left, because I needed the wife to see me building it for when she got home this morning. It made me look great.

At the next town he pulls into the service shop and asks for help. 

The mechanic says, “It’s gonna take about 20 minuets to check this out. You look pretty hot, you should go get an Ice Cream at the shop across the street to cool off while I take a look.”

So the penguin goes and orders a large vanilla ice cream cone. Now a penguin can’t use a spoon so he just goes for it and gets his face right in there. It’s kinda melty because of the heat and it gets everywhere. All over is face and chest. 

As he’s finishing his ice cream he realized it’s been half an hour and he’s a little late getting back to the shop. So he just runs over without washing up. 

He gets back to the mechanic and asks if he knows what’s wrong. 

The mechanic says, “It looks like you just blew a seal.”

The penguin says, “Oh, no. That’s just ice cream.”

With plenty of time before she has to pick up the kids from school she decides to head over to office depot.
 She arrives and is greeted by the doorman, Tom. Very polite local who she went to school with, tom is a bit slow but knows his job very well. Tom points her in the right direction and she is on her way. She grabs the last value pack or post-its and heads to the check out line.
 ""That will be $16.74 ma'am."" The woman reaches in her wallet only to find she doesnt have her card on her. She apologizes and rushes back to the house. She searches the house top to bottom and no sign of her debit card. Flustered and aggravated she heads to pick up the kids.
 They get home and she tells them to help look for her card, still no such luck. Her oldest offers to spot her the money from his savings and they head back to office depot.
 Tom stops her on her way in and says ""I tried to catch you earlier but you were in too much of a hurry. You dropped your ATM card on the way in earlier.""
 The woman loses her shit on poor Tom and demands to speak to the manager. The manager comes ovetr and offers her the sticky notes free of charge and apologizes for the inconvenience.
 The woman calms down and stops to talk to Tom on the way out to apologize. ""Y-y-yes ma'am? Can i help you?"" Tom says warily.
 ""Tom i just wanted to come over and apologize, it has been a been a day from hell and i didnt mean to take it out on you.""
 Tom smiles the most polite smile he can muster up ""Its not a problem ma'am, im glad you got what you came for."" 
The manager walks over to the two. ""Is everything okay here?""
""Yes, I was just taking the time to apologize to tom here."" 
He smiles, nods and walks away.
 ""That Dave is the best manager we have ever had. He has even been teaching me how to manage my finances.""
""Thats awesome! Hopefully youre saving up some money then.""
"" yes ma'am. He has showed me how to save money on everything, those sticky nots for instance. If you fold them over you can use the back to write on as well.""

Long ago, in a land with giants and dragons there lived a very successful man.  He made his wealth trading furs, dire wolf cloaks, unicorn hide gloves, tanned kraken belts, dragon scale boots, he traded in them all.  This man, however had stopped sitting for any reason, so he would often dominate a room with his tall stature and commanding presence. Why? You may ask, and that is simple, he would always fall out of any seat in which he sat.  His mantra began as much as an explanation as it was a focus during long hours of debate, trade, or travel: ”I am bad at sitting.”  Those around him believed him cursed, to find a seat was thought impossible. The man was simply very bad at sitting correctly, and due to his stubbornness he decided it was the chairs fault and not his own.  This lead to many, often funny circumstances, and harrowing adventures.  

Using his vast wealth and political connections he sought help from the greatest mages of the east.  The mages, certain they could create a chair of such comfort, and natural balance that there is no way the man could fail to sit in it properly.  Alas, the man could not get comfortable or remain seated for more than a few moments, and thus he shunned the mages for their incompetence.  

After the unfortunate failings of the mages he traveled to the west, where the greatest warriors in all the realms of man made their homes.  He went from town to town, seeking the greatest of all the warriors, he found and gathered the greatest swordsman, the greatest axe wielder, the greatest archer, the greatest tracker, and even the master of the arenas: who was the finest duelist in the world.  From a traveling circus he gathered the best acrobats, those who could walk a quarter inch tightrope for miles without difficulty, with the ability to train others to do the same.  

The master swordsman was an ancient woman, who taught the merchant patience greater than any other man.  The axe wielder trained him in strength, that he was among the strongest men on earth.  The Archer taught him the bow, and to hold a steady position for hours, despite his body’s protests. The tracker taught him how to move lightly, he gained such control of his body he could traverse a lightly frozen pond without breaking the ice, or leaving a trace. The arena master taught him to duel, and how to maintain his focus in any circumstance. The acrobats taught him such balance that he could sit upon a sphere of stone, which sat upon a single spike of iron, and maintain this position for days.  

After years of training, and becoming one of the finest warriors, strongest men, best archers, most capable hunters, an equal to the master of the arena in a duel, and the third finest acrobat in the world, he still could not sit correctly in a chair.  He could stand on a chair, he could sleep while balanced on the back of the chair, but he could not sit as he should.  He tried for months, patient as the stone he would perch upon.  After 17 more Moons, he decided that though he had not given up, perhaps he should seek knowledge and skill that man could not provide. 

He traveled far to the north, through frozen passes, over the highest mountains, and descended the deepest valleys.  He had to hunt to survive, and all those he traveled with died on the untamed mountains.  He moved boulders five times his size, he traversed hills that mountain goats would gawk at.  In due time, he came to a great cave: the place he had lost so many friends - and so much time - to find.  He ventured into the cave, searching for the great white dragon, said to be as ancient as time itself.  Upon spotting the man, the dragon roared, loud enough to shake the mountains, and deafen any mortal, but the man stood firm, able to keep his calm in any situation.  The dragon, seeing this, used magic to heal the old merchant’s ears, and said ‘What do you want, a human of such strength and skill to reach me, and such nerve as to not cower before me?’ Though the merchant did not understand the language of dragons, he thought he understood the intent of the question.  The man said “I am among the wealthiest merchants of the world, the strongest men on this plane, the finest hunter, and tracker known to man, an equal to the legendary duelists of the world, yet I can not sit in a chair.  The greatest teachers of men, and the best enchanters in the land could not train me, nor use magic to cheat me, into comfort, or even long term discomfort in a chair.  I am simply bad at it.

Unfortunately, the dragon did not know the human language very well, and due to gross miscommunication ate the man whole.  However, the man did not die, as he lay in the stomach of the dragon, he simply waited, knowing his life had come to an end.  Three days passed, the dragon feeling more and more ill as time went on.  On the fourth day the dragon’s mate returned, and asked him what was wrong.  

The Ancient dragon of the north replied “It must have been something I ate, it’s just not sitting right”",This is the only joke I have ever thought of that was (maybe) worth reposting,337

While their he decides to have a few drinks and tell stories of how he can save others from death. During the next few hours more people surround him to listen to his stories and check out his costume, he also becomes increasingly drunk. Sometime later this super ripped bodybuilder walks in and orders a pint of beer. Fairly soon after people leave the medic and speak to the bodybuilder curious how he got so muscular. Annoyed at his loss of company he walks over to the bodybuilder and tells him in an threatening voice that if he doesn't leave the bar his apprentice will kill him in his sleep.


“I don't have an apprentice” replys the bodybuilder amused that some medic is threatening his life.


“Then I'll kill you while you sleep”


“Don't try it” 


And with that the guy dumps the bodybuilders beer on him.


He was rushed to hospital later that night, he died the next morning.


Ironic said the his doctor “he could save others from death but not himself”

The kneading process warms and stretches these gluten strands, eventually creating a springy and elastic dough. If bread dough is not kneaded enough, it will not be able to hold the tiny pockets of gas created by the leavening agent, and will collapse, leaving a heavy and dense loaf.""",A man enters a bakery,0

post,9nzyby,2qh72,jokes,false,1539489273,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9nzyby/probably_a_repost/,self.jokes,,"I saw on the internet a guaranteed system for any man to lose 5 pounds a week.  I signed up and the next day a descent looking woman knocked on my door.  When I opened it, she said “If you catch me, you can do whatever you want with me.” Same thing happened every day.  That week I lost 5 pounds.  

Back online, I saw they had an option for a new 10 pounds a week plan.  I immediately registered!  The next morning a beautifully fit, younger woman knocked on my door.  Same deal as before, I lost 10 pounds that week.  I felt better than I had in years!  

When I got online to pay for another week I saw that there was now a premium plan that guaranteed at least 15 pounds off per week.  I immediately signed up and went to bed that night dreaming about what kind of beauty I would meet tomorrow.  

The next morning there was a knock on my door.  I hurriedly ran to answer it.  There was a large man, well over 6 feet tall and very muscular.  He was wearing spandex shorts and a rainbow tank top.  Not sure what he wanted, I asked how I could help him?  He said “If I catch you, I get to do whatever I want with you!”  I lost 35 pounds that week.

A short time later the waitress returns with the order 'That will be $9.40 please,' and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment. 

The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke'

Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. 

This becomes routine until the two enter again. 

'The usual?' asks the waitress. 

'No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and a salad,' says the man. 
'Same,' says the ostrich.

She is a little hesitant because of the price and the fact that she's about to order genitalia to eat, but she went on the vacation for adventure, so she agrees. A few minutes later the waiter returns with a large platter holding two huge testicles covered in a creamy sauce. She pinches her nose and takes a bite. Immediately she is overwhelmed with the delicious taste and digs in, finishing it in just minutes. She thanks the waiter for recommending the meal and leaves after paying for her meal. The next day, having already seen the spectacle of a bull fight, she just goes on a walk around town, stopping at little boutiques here and there and admiring the beautiful and ancient architecture. As the day draws to an end she decides the best way to top it off is to go back to the restaurant and order the same delicious meal as the previous night. The waiter takers her order and returns a few minutes later with a rather small plate with two very tiny testicles on it. She is confused and upset, and says to the waiter,

""What is this? Are you trying to trick me? Yesterday I ordered this exact dish and had much more food on my plate! Is that your angle? You give someone a huge helping the first time and then charge the same price for much smaller portions after that? This is outrageous!""

Two days later, the three get to St. Andrews, only to find Jack sitting at the bar with four drinks set up!

Wow, Jack, how long have you been here, and how did you talk your old lady into letting you go?

Well, I've been here since last night.

Yesterday evening, I was sitting in my living room chair, and my wife comes up behind me and put her hands over my eyes and asks, 'Guess who?'  I pulled her hands off, and there she was, wearing a see-through nightie. She took my hand and pulled me into our bedroom. The room had candles and rose petals all over.
Well, she had been reading ˜50 Shades of Grey, and on the bed she had handcuffs, a blindfold, and ropes!

She told me to put the blindfold on her, tie her up, and cuff her to the bed.
So I did.

And then she said, ""Do whatever you want.""

\- Push him? He's drunk - excuse his husband.

\- One more reason to help him - the woman insists.

\- He will not be able to walk alone. And you, who are always so helpful ...

""Well..., you pay £10 and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Lexus."" 
The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, ""What are the three tests?"" 
""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules."" 
So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender £10 which he stuffs into the jar.
""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do: 
First - You have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less and you can't make a face while doing it.""
""Second - There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth. You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.""
""Third - There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. You have to take care of that problem."" 
The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my £10 -- but I'm not an idiot!  I won't do it! You'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila and then do all those other things!"" 
""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is."" 
As time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says, ""Where's the damn tequila?!"" 
He grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can. Tears stream down both cheeks -- but he doesn't make a face -- and he drinks it in 58 seconds!
Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole. Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming and sounds of a terrible fight –then, nothing but silence!
Just when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar. His clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over hisbody.

I want you to slip this in my casket before I am buried.”  They each agree to honor his request.

The envelope only had $20,000.”

The doctor said, “I, too, must confess. I donated $15,000 to find a cure for his disease so that others like him could live.  My envelope only had $15,000 in it.”
