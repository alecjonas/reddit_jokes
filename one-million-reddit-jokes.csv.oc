The farmer looks at this man for a minute and asked what it is he would like to get out of his field?
 
Man: Well I see you have some butter cups growing in one of your fields and I would like to go get some.

Confused by this request the farmer laughs at the man and tells him to go get all you want.
So the man opens his trunk and gets a bucket then head out into the field. After about ten minutes the man returns with a bucket full of butter.
The farmer is dumbfounded by this as the man stops and asks, 

Man: While I was out there I saw you had some milk weed and I was hoping you would let me get some of that too.

The farmer, still in shock, nods his head.
So the man gets another bucket and guess out into the field. Another ten minutes go by and he comes back with a bucket of milk. By this point the farmer is shocked by what this man was doing. The man stops in front of the farmer and says,

Unable to separate them, and perplexed as to what to do next, and although it was very late at night, she called her vet ,who answered in a very grumpy voice.
 
After she explained the problem to him, the vet said, “Hang up the phone and place it down alongside the dogs. I will then call you back and the noise of the ringing will make the male lose his erection and he will be able to withdraw.”

The cop says: “What are you doing?”

The young man says: “Well Officer, I’m reading a magazine.”

The young man shrugs: “Sir, I believe she’s knitting a pullover sweater.”

They get offered a choice, either educate high school kids about the harmful effects of smoking weed or go to jail. In order to fulfill this promise they have to get at least 10 signed statements from kids at the schools they are assigned to that they will never smoke pot. 

To help them they are handed some visual aids. One of them is a set of cards, one of the cards has a little o on it, the other has a big O on it. Tommy picks up the cards, says ""Thanks, i got this"" and heads out to his assigned school. The councilor tries to tell him that there is more but he jets out the door before he could stop him. 

The councilor shrugs and writes Timmy off as a lost cause and tells Jim and Phillip the foolproof ways to get kids to stop smoking pot by using the two cards with the method he has designed himself. He then sends them out to their schools. 

The next day Tommy, Jim and Phillip are all waiting with signed documents for the councilor. The councilor sits them down and asks each one of them how many signatures they got and the method they used. 

Jim Pipes up First:

Jim ""I was able to get 12 signatures in two hours at the school, the method I used was by telling kids that this card ""O"" represents your brain. And this card ""o"" represents your brain after smoking pot. ""

Councilor: ""That's great Jim! And how many did you get Fillip?

Phillip: ""I was able to get 16! I told kids that this card ""O"" represents how much money you have before you start smoking weed and this card ""o"" represents how much after.

The Councilor then looks at Tommy with a smug expression ""And how many did You get Tommy?""

As a matter of fact, the scientists, now frantically looking around themselves, realized that almost every one of the surrounding, cotton-tailed creatures were actually cold, hard, metal contraptions that looked and behaved like their living, breathing counterparts.

""Well we can't have this,"" on of the scientists said, ""we came out here to count mammals, not machines.""

How did the ecologists manage to count the population of living rabbits?

They used mark and recaptcha

The walls opened, and the lady rolled between them into a small room.  The walls closed, and the boy and his father watched the small numbers above the walls light up sequentially. They continued to watch until it reached the last number, and then the numbers began to light in the reverse order. Finally the walls opened up again and a gorgeous 24-year-old blond stepped out. The father, not taking his eyes off the young woman, said quietly to his son... ""Go get your Mother.""

“You must be a conservative,” the balloon man says. The man on the ground asks how he knows that. The reply: “Everything you’ve told me is technically correct, I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is, I’m still lost. Frankly, you haven’t been very much help so far.”

The conservative replies that the balloon guy must be a liberal. How does he know? The punch line:

“You don’t know where you’re going or where you’ve been, you’ve risen to where you are on hot air, and you made a promise that you have no idea how to keep. Now you expect me to solve your problems. The fact is, you’re in the same place you were before we met and now it’s MY fault!”

Ms. Brooks had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office.

While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed.

Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test.

Principal: ""What is 3 x 3?""

Harry: ""9.""

Principal: ""What is 6 x 6?""

Harry: ""36.""

And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know.

The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, ""I think Harry can go to the 3rdgrade.""

Ms. Brooks says to the principal, ""Let me ask him some questions.""

Ms. Brooks asks, ""What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?""

Harry, after a moment: ""Legs.""

Ms Brooks: ""What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?""

The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!

Harry replied: ""Pockets.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a dog do that a man steps into?""

Harry: ""Pants.""

The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open.

Ms. Brooks: ""What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?""

The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Harry replied, ""Bubble gum.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?""

Harry: ""Shake hands.""

The principal was trembling.

Ms. Brooks: ""What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?""

Harry: ""Firetruck.""

The cashier continued, ""We're aware in this economy that many older persons on tight budgets are eating pet food to save money and we cannot condone that.

Pissed off but needing cat food, the old woman went home, put her cat in the box and brought it to the grocery store. Once again, the young cashier put his hand in the box, felt the live cat, and then rang up her cat food.

Two weeks passed and the old woman was in line once more, this time with a box prepared. The cashier was happy she would acknowledge the need for this and reached his hand in to pet the animal. Instead he found something warm and soft. He pulled his hand out horrfiied that it was stained brown.

The IRS auditor is not surprised when Ralph shows up with his attorney. The auditor says, “Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.”

I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,” says Ralph. “How about a demonstration?”

The auditor thinks for a moment and said, “Okay. Go ahead.”

Ralph says, “I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.”

The auditor thinks a moment and says, “No way! It’s a bet.”

Ralph removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.

Ralph says, “Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.”

The auditor can tell Ralph isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.

Ralph removes his dentures and bites his good eye.

The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Ralph’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

“Want to go double or nothing?” Ralph asks. “I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk and pee into that wastebasket on the other side and not get a drop anywhere in between.”

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this guy can manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Ralph stands beside the desk and unzips his pants. Although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on other side, so he gets urine all over the desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Ralph’s attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

“Are you okay?” the auditor asks.

“Not really,” says the attorney. “This morning, when Ralph told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over an IRS official’s desk and that you’d be happy about it.”",Gambling With the IRS,474

He is in a go nowhere job, with no friends or family, and is feeling down. He quits his job and decides to travel to a remote area, far from civilization. He does not like the touristy vibe that some places give off, as he does not like to socialize with the general population, so he ventures deep into the African wilderness and stumbles onto a very friendly African tribe.

The Tribe welcomes him, but are a little cautious as they have never seen a human with as light of skin as he has.

The man falls in love with the tribe, and ends up teaching them about different cultures, the English language, etc.

The man also becomes quite good friends with the tribe chief, as he and the chief have much more in common than they both would have ever imagined.

A year passes, and the chief is getting suspicious of the white mans plans for being out in the wilderness for so long, and starts to question his antics.

The chiefs wife gets pregnant.

The chief thinks nothing of it, as he loves his wife and sleeps with her regularly,  until nine months later when the baby is born, and has the same pale skin as this strange white man.

The chief becomes furious, as he thinks the white man had slept with his wife, and asks to speak with him in private far from the rest of the tribe. He takes him to the edge of their village near a sheep pasture, where it is peaceful, yet quiet.

The chief brings up his concern for his child being white, and explains to him that it isn't possible for the child to be white and be his son, as the man is the first human they have ever seen to be white. The chief has many children, all as dark as he is.

Furious, the chief threatens to banish the man, as he is convinced the man had a child with his wife, but offers the man a chance for an explanation as to why the child isn't his.

The white man thinks for a minute, and looks out onto the sheep pasture. He notices that all the sheep are white, except one of them, who is black.

The man uses this example of the sheep, claiming that in nature, there is always a ""black sheep"", and sometimes, no matter how all the others look, one comes out looking different than the rest. There wasn't a black sheep to impregnate a white sheep, to make it black, it just happens sometimes.

The chief listens to this explanation, and makes his decision.

The chief says, ""I won't tell the others about the baby, if you keep your mouth shut about the sheep""",A white man visits a rural tribe in Africa,48

We're just sitting on the rocks smoking some joints, meanwhile down on the sand there's girls in bikinis laying on their towels getting some sun.  We see this guy walking along the beach talking to the girls.  

He's wearing a big colorful Jamaican rasta hat and has this huge ridiculous red feather in his left hand.  As he approaches each of the girls on the beach he says something to them.  The girls kind of shrug awkwardly and he moves along to the next girl or they stand right up, go into the bushes with him, and then come back in a few minutes and resume sunbathing.

Eventually he gets close enough that we can hear the conversation. He strolls up to a group of three girls. He says to the first girl ""Hey... me tickle your clit with me feather?"" and the girl, a little taken aback, says  ""I'm sorry what did you say?"" the guy says  ""Typical Island weather!""  and the girl just kind of smiles at him awkwardly. 

He walks up to the second girl and says ""Hey! Me tickle your clit with me feather?"" now this girl is just aghast and disgustedly says ""What the fuck did you just say to me?"" and the guy smiles and says ""Typical Island weather!"" The girl thinks about that for a second and says ""Oh yeah I suppose so..."" 

Then he walks up to the third girl and says ""Hey, me tickle your clit with me feather?"" the girl squints her eyes at him for a moment then laughs, smiles, says ""Yeah sure!""

They go off into the bushes for a few minutes when they come out the girl goes and sits back down on her towel satisfied and the guy keeps walking down the beach. Then this other guy walks up to him. Big fucking Australian guy.

He says ""Oi mate! I seen what just happened there... tell me your secret!"" 

So the guy with the feather says ""First, simply say your line on the ladies. Then, if she doesn't like it just make a comment about the weather!""

The Australian guy says ""Alright alright.."" and walks over to a girl laying in the sand.

He says ""Oi! I want to fuck you SO HARD!"" 

The girl is shocked and says ""Excuse me?! What the fuck?!"" and the Australian guy grins and says ""LOOKS LIKE RAIN!""",right by the beach ... [long] [slightly nsfw],15

Being a competitive man, I promptly yanked out what was apparently my front left incisor, and we proceeded to play. 

I shot one of the best rounds of my life and on the ninth hole, after hitting a beautiful drive that landed within one meter of the green, my dentist turned to me and said:

""Don't chip teeth!""

Being as he's a dentist I would've taken his advice under any other circumstances, but in this instance I figured he was just trying to make me choke, so I took out my wedge and tried lining myself up for an easy putt instead.

But the sun got in my eye and I ended up hitting my front left incisor over the damn green. It flies into the parking lot and lands in a transmission intake valve on a driveway specialist's truck. 

The tooth fell deep into the engine, and a mechanic who was there told us that it would take a lot of money to fix.

I ask my dentist if he would loan me the money, but he says:

""Hell no - what did I tell ya?""

I tell the driveway specialist I'm short on cash, and he tells me I can work for him to pay off the repairs.

Amazed, the bartender reaches into a locked cabinet underneath the bar, pulls out a bottle of 20-year-old Scotch, and pours the man a shot. The man drinks  it  down  and says, ‘That was 20year-old  Scotch. I asked for 40-year-old Scotch.’ 

So the bartender goes into the back room, brings out a bottle of 30-year-old Scotch, and pours the man a drink. By now a small crowd has gathered around  the man and is  watching  anxiously as he downs the latest drink. Once again the man states the true age of the Scotch and repeats his original  request for 40-year-old Scotch. The bartender can hold  off no  longer and disappears into the cellar to get a bottle of prime 40-year-old Scotch. 
Soon, the bartender returns with  the bottle and pours a shot. The man downs the Scotch and says, ‘Now this is 40-year-old Scotch!’ The crowd applauds his discriminating  palate. 

An old drunk, who had been watching the proceedings with  interest, raises  a full  shot  glass of his own and says,  ‘Here, take a swig of this.’ The man takes the glass and downs the drink in one swallow.

post,6bn8ii,2qh72,jokes,false,1495005939,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6bn8ii/a_doctor_tries_to_con_an_engineer/,self.jokes,,"There was an Engineer who was unemployed for a very long time. Being unable to find any kind of work, he decided to open up a medical clinic. He put up a sign outside the clinic that said ""We guarantee we can find a cure for your ailment, for the price of $500. If we fail to do so, we will compensate you with $1,000""

A Doctor walked by the clinic one day, had his attention caught by the sign and thought this was a prime opportunity to make $1,000. With a small grin on his face, he entered the clinic and was assigned an appointment almost immediately.

Walking into the Engineer's office with a small grin on his face, the Doctor took a seat. The Engineer turned to the Doctor and asked ""So, what seems to be the problem?"" The Doctor, thinking that the Engineer possibly couldn't figure this one out, said ""I seem to have lost my sense of taste""

The Engineer stroked his chin in thought for a while. He picked up the phone, dialed in a few digits and said ""Nurse - Can you please bring in the medicine from box 43 and administer 3 drops into the patients mouth?""

A few minutes later, the nurse walks in with a small bottle and a medicine dropper. She sucks up a small bit of the liquid from the bottle and, as the Engineer commanded, let 3 drips drop into the Doctor's mouth.

Almost immediately after the 3rd drop, the Doctor let out a coughing fit while clutching his throat. After his coughs died down, he looked up angrily at the Engineer and yelled ""Are you trying to kill me?! This is Gasoline! You just dribbled Gasoline into my mouth!"" The Engineer gave a little grin and said ""Congratulations! You've got your taste back! That will be $500 please""

The Doctor murmured furiously while rummaging around for the $500 before paying up and storming out of the clinic.

A few days later, the Doctor decided to try and recover his money but with a different plan. He visited the clinic and again, was assigned an appointment almost immediately.

The Doctor entered the Engineer's officer with a new plan in mind. ""Welcome back"" The Engineer said, ""What can I do for you this time?""

The Doctor said ""I seem to have lost my memory, I can't seem to remember anything""

The Engineer nodded while stroking his chin, in thought. After a while, he picked up the phone, dialed in a few digits and said ""Nurse - Can you please bring in the medicine from box 43 and administer 3 drops into the patients mouth?""

The Doctor immediately frowned and exclaimed ""Wait - Last time you ordered that box and put it in my mouth, it was Gasoline!"" The Engineer put down the phone with a grin, ""Congratulations! You've got your memory back! That'll be $500, please""

The Doctor, realising he had been conned again, angrily paid up the $500 and stormed off in a huff.

After a few more days, the Doctor decided to return to the clinic, this time even more determined and more aware of the tricks the Engineer would probably pull.

He visited the clinic and was, of course, assigned an appointment almost immediately. As the Doctor entered the Engineer's office, the Engineer gave a grin, knowing more easy money was about to enter his pocket.

""What a delight to see you again!"" The Engineer said, maintaining a smug grin, ""How can I help you today?""

The Doctor took a seat and expressed his problem: ""Oh, my eyesight has become weak; I'm finding it very hard to see""

The Engineer stroked his chin in thought for a while. He leaned back on his chair as he thought of a way to solve this problem. However, this time, his grin slowly faded as the truth daunted upon him - He didn't have any medicine for this man's eyes.

After about 5 minutes of intense thought, the Engineer gave a shrug: ""Well - I give up. I don't have any medicine for this condition. Please accept my sincerest apologies and this $1000 as compensation"" The Engineer opened his drawer, took out an envelope full of money and handed it to the Doctor.

The Doctor was gleeful and delighted, at this point. He immediately opened the envelope and began counting through the money. After counting through the money three times, he looked up at the Engineer with a concerned look: ""Hold on, this is only $500...""

The Engineer gave a smile: ""Congratulations! You've got your eyesight back! That will be $500 please""",A Doctor tries to con an Engineer,33

Since his remaining hearing was sufficient, he remained in the Army. Many years later he eventually rose to the rank of Major General. 

He was, however, very sensitive about his appearance. One day the General was interviewing three servicemen who were candidates for his headquarters staff.     

The first was a Squadron Leader pilot from Air Force , and it was a great interview. At the end of the interview the General asked him, 'Do you notice anything different about me?'    The young officer answered, 'Why, yes, Sir, I couldn't help but notice that you have no ears.'  The general was displeased with his lack of tact and threw him out.    

The second interview was with a Naval Lieutenant Commander, and he was even better. The General then asked him the same question, 'Do you notice anything different about me?' He replied sheepishly, 'Well, sir, you have no ears.' The General threw him out also.    

The third interview was with an Infantryman and a commando qualified Major.

The General liked this guy, and went ahead with the same question, 'Do you notice anything different about me?' To his surprise the Major said, 'Yes, sir, you wear contact lenses.'    

The General was very impressed and thought, 'What an incredibly observant officer, and he didn't mention my ears.'

He asked, 'Major, how do you know I wear contacts?' 'Well, sir,' the officer replied, 'It's pretty hard to wear glasses with no f******g ears.'",A young Army officer was severely wounded in the head by a grenade,2263

The chief of medicine himself escorted the widow explaining the various parts of the facility as they went. 

As they passed, the widow glanced into a room and gasped in shock. Through the open door she saw a patient furiously masturbating. Seeing her shock the doctor explained, ""This patient has a rare disorder. He produces sperm at an alarming rate. If he doesn't relieve himself once every hour his testicles may rupture.""

While the widow thought this was strange she accepted the doctors explanation. The tour continued until they passed another room this time with a nurse on her knees performing oral sex on the patient. ""Oh come on, now how can you explain that!?"" she exclaimed. 

The doctor without blinking said, ""Better Insurance.""

Dave said, ""I'll be real fast. I'll throw the money on the floor, you bend

The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story.


Little Suzy raises her hand. ""My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.""


When the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, ""Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.""


Little Lucy went next. ""My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.""


Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.


Lucy replied, ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch.""


Next up was little Johnny. 

""My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""


The teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.


""Well,"" Johnny replied, ""Don't f**k with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.""",A lesson in morals . .,53

One day, an 18 year old girl tried to get on his train near its departure time but being the man he was, he started moving the train and she fell under and died. 

The man was immediately hauled off to court where he was sentenced to death by electric chair. So they strapped him in and pressed the switch but nothing happened. Baffled, they let it go. 

The operator thought long and hard about his actions and decided to change his life. A few weeks later an old woman tried to get in his train near the departure time and seeing her, he waited for her to get in. Unfortunately she tripped and fell and died. 

He was hauled off to court again and due to his past reputation he was sentenced to death by electric chair again. This time when they pressed the switch he was shocked and died... 

Are you wondering why he died the this time?

Edna immediately jumped in to save him. She swam to the bottom and pulled him out. When the Head Nurse Director became aware of Edna's heroic act she immediately ordered her to be discharged from the hospital, as Edna's good deeds indicated that she was mentally stable. 

When she went to tell Edna the news she said, 'Edna, I have good news and bad news. The good news is you're being discharged, since you were able to rationally respond to a crisis by jumping in and saving the life of a person in crisis... I have concluded that your act displays that you have a sound mind. The bad news is, Ralph hung himself in the bathroom with his bathrobe belt right after you saved him. I am so sorry, but he's dead.' 

Edna replied, 'He didn't hang himself, I put him there to dry. How soon can I go home?'
