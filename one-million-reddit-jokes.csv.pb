The three men stand there looking very confused. Saint Peter tells them that heaven is getting very crowded. ""You must ask a question or give a problem that the devil cannot answer correctly to go to heaven, otherwise-you will go to hell"" he says. The three men agree and the devil approaches each of them separately.
So the mathematician thinks for a while and give the devil a problem. The devil solves it and hands it right back to him. With a snap of Satan's fingers... he was gone
The devil then approaches the philosopher and says for him to give him any sophisticated philosophical idea, and he'll explain it. So the philosopher does this and gives it to the devil. The devil, again, explains it and the philosopher goes to hell.
Finally, the devil goes up to the idiot
The idiot declares, ""Get me a chair."" The devil complies and gets the idiot a chair. ""Alright, now drill seven holes in it."" Again the devil complies and drills seven holes. Then, the idiot sits down in the chair and he farts. ""Alright,"" the idiot declared. ""Which hole did my fart come out of?""
The devil was taken aback, and stood confused at the idiot. ""Uhh, that one!"" The devil said as he pointed to a random hole.
 ""No...My asshole!""

On his first day they go through the basic puppetry skills where you have your hand inside of a puppet.

On the second day they move onto much bigger puppets, the type that are used in Sesame Street.

On the third day they get a bit more advanced and get to using marionette style puppets.

On the fourth day thongs get a bit more advanced, and they start with ventriloquism.

On their final day they are told to pass the course, they must perform a classic routine. The instructor tells them""If you would like to be the policeman, que over at point A. If you would like to be the crocodile que at point B. If you prefer to be the baby que at point C, and if it's Judy you're after que at point D.""

The man takes this all in, has a long hard think to himself and then it comes to him. ""Where's the punch line?""

Note: I think I came up with this myself (even though it's a twist on recently posted jokes). But the chances are it's not original. That's the world we live in.

""How can look I help you?"" the accountant asked.  He couldn't help but stare at her bosom through her low cut top.

The blonde handed him a piece of paper.  ""My W-2 has code 'D' on it.  What does that mean?"" she asked.

The accountant couldn't help but be distracted by her D-sized breasts but he answered her question with grace.

""Oh, okay!  Thank you!"" the blonde said and walked out happy.

The accountant started to pack up when an even more scarcely dressed brunette girl walked in.  She also had a nice bosom, which was a little bigger than the previous girl's.

""How can I help you?"" the accountant asked, feeling glad he didn't leave earlier.

""Can you tell me what code 'DD' means on my W-2?"" the brunette asked.

The accountant was relishing in this moment.  He answered the question while trying not to stare at the brunette's chest.

""Great, thank you!"" the brunette said as she walked out happy.

After those two sexy walk-ins the accountant decided to stay a little later in case a 3rd women came in.  He hadn't had sex in months (that's busy season for ya, folks) and enjoyed any excitement he could get.

Five minutes later a tall, red haired woman in heals walked in, with a stack of papers in front of her.  And yes, her rack was the best the accountant had ever seven.

""How can I help you, miss?"" the accountant asked, loosening his tie.

""Well you see,"" the women said as she took off her coat to reveal the biggest bosom the accountant has ever seen, ""I have this tax form..."" as she sat down.

The accountant thoughturned he would flirt with her to see where it went.  Stupidly, he said, ""Let me guess, you are wondering what code 'DDD' on your W-2 means?""

The woman stood up and almost walked out the door, offended.  ""How dare you!  I can't go one day without a man saying something about my body!  You should be ashamed of yourself!""

The accountant turned bright red.  ""I'm sorry, miss, my mind was in another place today...  I've been so overworked.""

To his surprise, the woman sat back down and said, ""I'm sorry, I had a rough day, too.  How about I make it up to the both of us with a nice dinner at my apartment?"" she asked flirtatiously.

The accountant was bewildered by the sudden turn of events.  ""Sure,"" he said, ""that would be great!""  He knew he was finally going to get laid that night, and was so excited that he called his wife to tell her he'd be home late.  He and the beautiful woman rose from the desk and started to leave the office.
 
 ""So what question did you have for me?"" he asked the tall, beautiful woman as they headed out the door.

""Oh!"" the woman said, remembering why she was there in the first place, ""on my 1099-R, what does code '9' mean?""

Readers from all around the local area would send in jokes, with the top 5 published.

The rules of the competition were simple, all jokes had to be original and had to be written by the sender.

The man was sure he was on to a winner with a joke he had written which made him crack up every time he thought about it. 

He wrote down his joke, and checked to make sure the spelling was correct before mailing it in to the newspaper.

A few weeks later the results were released and the man was shocked that his joke didn't make the cut.

He called up the newspaper and spoke to the lady who judged the entries. She said that she had not received the joke, but to send it in the next year.

The next year rolls around and the man once again writes down his joke and sends it in. Just like the previous year he doesn't win, and calls the paper to find they had no record of his entry.

This happens again the following year, and the following year and the next. Finally the man gives up.

Moral of the story: It doesn't matter how many times a joke is reposted, some people will never get it.

post,5z6heg,2qh72,jokes,false,1489427458,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5z6heg/apocalypse/,self.jokes,,"A zombie apocalypse had taken over the world, everywhere had become a wasteland and most of the world’s population had been annihilated. Carl, lone survivor from Wayland Kentucky, was venturing the land looking for somewhere to take shelter.

One day, starving and desperate, he encountered a prison. The place was full of survivors armed with swords, spears, axes and all kinds of hand held weaponry. The settlers took him in, fed him and made him feel human again.

That night, they heard loud groans start to surround the prison. Zombies had breached the prison gates and minutes later had besieged the prison. The settlers did all they could but their weapons just weren’t up to the task. Everyone was killed, all apart from our lone survivor, Carl, who escaped as the last few were eaten alive.
 
Stumbling through the night, with zombies closing in behind, Carl discovered a wrecked shopping mall. The settlers let him inside. They were armed to the teeth with an arsenal of firearms. Pistols, assault rifles, military grade weapons, the lot.

Carl hastily warned them that there was a pack of zombies in pursuit, but when they looked hundreds had gathered behind Carl and were now headed straight for the mall. The settlers fired every weapon they had at them, but the zombies bulldozed through the wall of bullets and all of the settlers in the shopping mall were massacred. All apart from our lone survivor, Carl, who eluded death once again.

He escaped into a dark wood behind the mall, stumbling over fallen foliage. With an army of zombies hunting him down, he ran into a huge wooden wall. As he got closer to the entrance, he saw a chicken dressed in military fatigues. The chicken scratched its feet on the floor, clucked three times and pecked on the huge wooden gates. They opened with an enormous “Creeeeek”. Inside was a farm, an old redneck farmer and his wife. “Hi there sonny”, said the farmer, “come on in ayn ava drink”

Swiftly, Carl warned them that there were hundreds of zombies chasing him, maybe even thousands by now, but they didn’t seem bothered at all.

“Shouldn’t we do something? Where are your weapons? Haven’t you even got any weapons at all” Carl bellowed.

“Naw, we won't need em”, said the farmer

“The chick’n will deal with em” said his wife, calmly.

Carl was anxious, but he was fed up of running and wanted to see what this chicken could do, so he watched in anticipation... 

The Zombies approached, and one by one the chicken took them down. It pecked through their brains, scratched off their heads and kicked the living dead crap out of thousands of them.

Astounded, Carl said, “I’ve just seen that group of zombies tear through two settlements, both armed to the teeth with an incredible armoury of weapons, and your chicken has just taken all of them all out single handed, how? How did that just happen!?”

“Well”, said the farmer, “we figur’d it out a lon lon time ago. We dun' need any weapon’s at all, for the Hen is mightier than the Horde.”



I wrote and posted this joke a few weeks back, but made some improvements​ recently and wondered how the joke now fairs.

Hope you liked it and feedback is very welcome. I'd like to somehow make the punchline more fitting... Maybe Carl should be a lawyer or something? Any thoughts? Thanks guys",Apocalypse,1

A zombie apocalypse had enveloped the earth. 99.9% of the world’s population had been annihilated and Carl, lone survivor, was venturing the land looking for somewhere to take shelter.

One day, he came across a prison. The place was full of people armed with swords, spears, axes and all kinds of hand held weaponry. The settlers took him in and after a while he finally felt safe.

One night, they heard loud groans start to surround the place. Zombies had broken in and after a few minutes had overrun the prison. The settlers did all they could but their weapons just weren’t up to the task and everyone was killed, apart from our lone survivor, Carl, who escaped as the last few were eaten alive.

Stumbling through the night, with zombies close behind in trail, Carl discovered a huge shopping mall. The settlers let him inside. They were armed to the teeth with a huge arsenal of Pistols, assault rifles, military grade weapons, the lot.

Carl warned them that there was a pack of zombies following him, but when they looked hundreds had gathered behind Carl and were now headed straight for the mall. The settlers fired every weapon they had at them, but wave after wave of zombies ploughed on through the wall of bullets and the settlers of the shopping mall were slaughtered. All apart from our lone survivor, Carl, who eluded death once again.

He ventured into a deep dark wood, stumbling over fallen foliage, with an Armageddon of zombies behind him, he ran into a huge wooden wall. As he got closer to the entrance, he saw a chicken dressed in military fatigues. The chicken scratched its feet on the floor, clucked three times and pecked on the huge wooden gates. They opened with an enormous “Creeeeek”. Inside was a farm, an old redneck farmer and his wife. “nice ta meet ya sonny”, said the farmer, “come on in ayn' have ay drink”

Carl quickly warned them that there were hundreds of zombies chasing him, maybe even thousands by now, but they didn’t seem bothered at all. “Shouldn’t we do something? Haven’t you even got any weapons at all” Carl shouted... 

“Naw, we won't need em”, said the farmer

“The chick’n will deal with em” said his wife, calmly.

Carl was anxious, but he was fed up of running and wanted to see what this chicken could do, so he watched in anticipation... 

The Zombies approached, and one by one the chicken took them down. It pecked through their zombie brains, scratched off their heads and kicked the living dead crap out of thousands of them.

Amazed, Carl said, “I’ve just seen that group of zombies tear through two settlements, both armed to the teeth with an incredible arsenal of weapons, and your chicken has just taken all of them all out single handed, how? how did that just happen!?”

“Well”, said the farmer, “we figured it’out a lon lon time ago. We dun' need any weapon’s at all, for the Hen is mightier than the Horde.”

And every year Ken would say,
'Edna, I'd like to ride in that helicopter'
Edna always replied,
'I know Ken, but that helicopter ride is fifty bucks,
And fifty bucks is fifty bucks'
One year Ken and Edna went to the fair, and Ken said,
'Edna, I'm 75 years old.
If I don't ride that helicopter, I might never get another chance'
To this, Edna replied
""Ken that helicopter ride is fifty bucks, and fifty bucks is fifty bucks'
The pilot overheard the couple and said,
'Folks I'll make you a deal. I'll take the both of you for a ride.
If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and don't say a word I won't charge you a penny!
But if you say one word it's fifty dollars.'
Ken and Edna agreed and up they went.
The pilot did all kinds of fancy maneuvers, but not a word was heard.
He did his daredevil tricks over and over again,
But still not a word...
When they landed, the pilot turned to Ken and said,
'By golly, I did everything I could to get you to yell out, but you didn't.
I'm impressed!
Ken replied,
'Well, to tell you the truth, I almost said something when Edna fell out,

The doctor tells him he has two years to live unless he can find a rare wriggly wiggly worm found in Africa.

So he flies over to deepest darkest Africa and searches for 4 months till he finds and collects some wriggly wiggly worms in a match box he rushes back home and goes back to the doctor only to find the worm has disappeared.

So he flies back over, and searches again for months before he finds more worms and puts them in a match box and tapes it up but once again he turns up home and un-tapes the box to find the worms gone!

So John with only one year left to live flies back, and now is more proficient at finding these worms so he puts them them in the match box, tapes it up, puts it in a small cardboard box and tapes that up. He flies back, John opens the little cardboard box, then the matchbox, and they’re not there! 
 
John is losing faith now so he flies out once more and catches the worms and put them in match box, tapes it up, puts it in a small cardboard box and tapes that up, then he puts it in a safe and puts that on a private jet. He flies back as fast as possible and finds the worms gone again! 

He only has one week left now so John is exhausting all his resources to get these worms back, he flies out and gets some more, he then puts them in a match box, tapes it up, puts it in a small cardboard box and tapes that up, then puts them in the safe, then welds the safe up and then chained it down. He flies back and cracks open the safe, a rips open the cardboard box and pops open the matchbox. The worms have gone.

John is overwhelmed with sadness, he only has three days left so he decides to make a cup of tea and live out his days in peace. So he goes to the tap to fill up the kettle. And guess what comes out??? 

Water.

John dies.

Due to the darkness and haze, the pilot could not determine the helicopter's position and course to get back to the airport.

The pilot saw a tall building with lights on and flew toward it, the pilot had the passenger draw a handwritten sign reading, ""WHERE AM I?"", and hold it up for the building's occupants to see.

People in the building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a large sign, and held it in a building window.

Their sign said, ""YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER.""

The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his map, determined the course to steer to SEATAC airport, and landed safely.

After they were on the ground, the passenger asked the pilot how the ""YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER"" sign helped determine their position.

The pilot responded, ""I knew that had to be the Microsoft support building, they gave me a technically correct but entirely useless answer.""

Finally after a fourth night, the turkey was proudly perched at the top of the tree.

He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot him out of the tree.

On the third day, Jesus looked up to see a bewildered old man standing in front of him. He asked the old man to tell him something about himself.

The altar boy looks on in amazement: So much is the priest's faith that he can walk on water!

They fish for a while longer, then decide to break for lunch. As the bishop reaches into his bag, the boat is suddenly jostled and the bag splashes off the side.

""This won't take a moment,"" says the bishop. He steps off the side of the boat, walks across the water's surface to fetch the bag, and walks straight back.

The altar boy cannot believe it. Twice in one day he has experienced a miracle! By virtue of their faith alone, the priest and the bishop were able to do what should be impossible!

At this point, the altar boy is filled with religious zeal. In the face of such miracles, his own faith is overflowing. He grabs the tackle box, throws it overboard, and jumps over the side of the boat and drowns.

The priest leans over to the bishop and asks, ""Think we should've told him about the rocks?","A priest, a bishop, and an altar boy are out fishing...",43

He just loved all things hunting and fishing, and being new in town, started asking around where the good fishing holes were.  Finally he came to this little country bar, and asked the bartender.  ""Charlie catches more fish than anybody around here.""  The other patrons nodded in agreement.  They said show up just before dawn right here, and they'd let Charlie know you wanted to go fishing with him.  

So the Game Warden showed up the next morning with all his fishing gear.  He was ready for anything - bass lures, catfish bait, three different fishing rods, electronic fish finder, the works.  There's an old fellow standing on the porch of the bar, with just a tackle box and a net.  ""You Charlie?"" the warden asked.  Charlie just nodded and pointed to an old beat-up truck.  

They loaded their stuff in the back, and Charlie drove.  All the way to the fishing hole, the Game Warden was really excited, and kept talking about different rods and reels, techniques for casting, what the best kinds of fish were in different seasons, what the best bass boats were.  Charlie didn't say anything.  

They got to the end of a little gravel road, and Charlie stopped the truck.  He retrieved his tacklebox and his net from the back.  ""Is this the place?"" asked the Game Warden.  Charlie just nodded and didn't say anything.  He started walking down a well-worn path through the woods.  The Game Warden started asking him about the fishing hole.  ""Is it a natural pond or manmade?  Spring fed?  What's the best kind of lure to use here?  Do you like to fly fish here, or is it better to use live bait?""  Charlie didn't say anything.   

Finally they came to a rather dinky little pond, and Charlie motioned toward a boat tied up there.  They stepped in, and Charlie rowed out to the middle of the lake.  All the while the Game Warden talked excitedly about fishing.  

Finally they reached the middle of the lake.  Charlie lit up a cee-gar, opened up his tacklebox, and pulled out a big red stick of dynamite.  He lit the fuse off the stogie, and nonchalantly tossed it into the lake.  There was a huge explosion that soaked both of them, and fish started floating up.  Charlie pulled out his net and started shoveling the stunned fish into the boat.  Bluegill, crappie, bass, catfish, minnows, grass carp, turtles, snakes, crawdads, just about anything that might live underwater was floating up.   

The Game Warden was shocked.  Finally he blurted out ""Charlie!  You know dynamite fishing is totally illegal! and you know I'm a Game Warden.  I can't believe you're doing this!  Do you know I could arrest you right now?  Dynamite fishing breaks every law in the books!"" 

Charlie stopped scooping fish, and picked up another stick of dynamite, lit it from his cheroot and tossed it in the water.  Another explosion rocked the boat and splashed them both.  He started shoveling fish into the boat again by the dozens. 

""Charlie!  I can't believe you are doing this!  I ought to bust you right now!  Do you have any idea what the fine for this is gonna be?  Thousands!""  

Charlie stopped shoveling fish into the boat, and lit another stick of dynamite on his cigar.  This time he tossed it into the Game Warden's lap.  

He said, to the stunned Warden ""Are you gonna talk, or fish?""  ",Game Warden goes fishing [long],6

(Our middle school was 6th-8th grade) After school we would usually ride around town on our bikes like a little gang and mess with the ""older kids"". We saw them getting high on weed and wanted to look cool in their eyes. So one day, one of my friends, Jeff, had some whitish colored powder and wanted to look ""bad"" in front of the middle schoolers. He busts it out (with none of us knowing he had it) and made a line for each of us.. The middle schoolers were shaking in their boots, as was I. No one wanted to try it. Like an animal, Jeff snorts the powder wildly and starts slobbering, sneezing, and dripping snot all over the place. The older kids fled without a trace. Jeff fell to the ground nauseated and were were freaking the fuck out.. We doused him with a pitcher of water and 2/3 minutes later he was fine. He was pissed livid and asked us. ""Why the fuck didnt you guys do that shit with me!? They're just pixie sticks!"" apparently he thought we'd get a sugar high.",Jr. High,3

So he often would thin down his paint to make it go a little bit further. As it happened, he got away with this for some time.

Eventually the Presbyterian Church decided to do a big restoration job on one of their biggest churches. Jack put in a painting bid and because his price was so competitive, he got the job. And so he set to, with a right good will, erecting the trestles and putting up the planks, and buying the paint and...yes, I am sorry to say, thinning it down with the turpentine.

Well, Jack was up on the scaffolding, painting away, the job nearly done, when suddenly there was a horrendous clap of thunder. The sky opened and the rain poured down, washing the thin paint from all over the church and knocking Jock fair off the scaffold to land on the lawn.

Now, Jack was no fool. He knew this was a judgement from the Almighty, so he fell on his knees and cried, ""Oh, God! Forgive me! What should I do?""

And from the thunder, a mighty Voice spoke, ""Repaint! Repaint! And thin no more!""",The Scottish Painter,53

Then, one day, some hooligans were messing around the train yard and as the train was coming in, they managed to divert the train and it crashed into a neighboring house.

City A was flourishing, with a strong toyal guard and booming economies. City B wasn't as prosperous as City A, but they got along fine. City C, however, was doing terribly, with only an old knight well past his prime and his trusty squire as their defence.

Then, there came a day where both City A and B made an alliance to attack City C. City A sent 5,000 knights and squires while City B sent 1,000 knights and squires. However, City C only sent their old knight and squire. 

The day before the fight, the knights and squires of City A and B celebrated their near-certain victory with beer and gin. The old knight and squire, however, had a simpler meal. The squire took a pot and tied it to a high branch with a noose, where they enjoyed a humble stew.

The next day rolled around, where the knights and squires of both cities were rather tipsy. With the old knight being too old to fight, the squire, with a bit of luck, managed to defeat all the other squires of the two cities.

What does this amazing tale tell us? It simply tells us the the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the squires of the two sides.

(Read it aloud and fast and you'll see what I mean.)

She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.""",Read this.. It will put smile on your face * GUARANTEED *,36

A man walked into the ladies department of one of the largest department store chains. He shyly walked up to the woman behind the counter and said. 'I'd like to buy a bra for my wife'

'What type of bra?' asked the clerk.

'Type?' inquires the man 'There is more than one type?'

'Look Around,' said the saleslady, as she showed a sea of bras in every shape, size color and material.

'Actually, even with all of this variety, there are really only three types of bras,' replied the salesclerk.

Confused, the man asked what were the types.

The saleslady replied 'The Catholic type, the, Salvation Army type, and the Baptist type. Which one do you need?'

Still confused the man asked 'What is the difference between them?'

The lady responded 'It is all really quite simple. The Catholic type supports the masses, the Salvation Army type lifts up the fallen, and the and the Baptist type makes mountains out of mole hills.

post,5yu3xg,2qh72,jokes,false,1489257398,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5yu3xg/a_russian_and_an_irish_wrestler/,self.jokes,,"A Russian and an Irish wrestler were set to square off for the Olympic gold medal. Before the final match, the Irish wrestler's trainer came to him and said 'Now, don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian. He's never lost a match because of this 'pretzel' hold he has. It ties you up in knots. Whatever you do, do not let him get you in that hold! If he does, you're finished.'

The Irishman nodded in acknowledgment. As the match started, the Irishman and the Russian circled each otherseveral times, looking for an opening. All of a sudden, the Russian lunged forward,grabbing the Irishman and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold. A sigh of disappointment arose from the crowd and the trainer buried his face in his hands, for he knew all was lost. He couldn't watch the inevitable happen.

Suddenly, there was a Long, High Pitched Scream, then a cheer from the crowd and the trainer raised his eyes just in time to watch the Russian go flying up in the air. His back hit the mat with a thud and the Irishman collapsed on top of him, making the pin and winning the match.

The trainer was astounded.When he finally got his wrestler alone, he asked 'How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!'

The wrestler answered 'Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of testicles right in front of my face. I had nothing to lose so with my last ounce of strength, I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could.'

The trainer exclaimed 'Oh, so that's what finished him off?!!'

'Not really. You'd be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls'
