Her breasts were so huge they bounced and jiggled while she played the organ. Unfortunately that distracted the congregation considerably.
The very proper church ladies were appalled. They said something had to be done about this or they would have to get another organist.
So one of the ladies approached her very discreetly and told her to mash up some green persimmons and rub them on the nipples of her breasts and maybe they would shrink in size. She warned her though, not to eat any of the green persimmons because they were so sour they would make her mouth pucker up and she wouldn't be able to speak properly for a couple of days.
She agreed to try it.

The old rooster begs the young one ""Please, just let me have one hen for myself. Just one, you can have all the others, and I won't touch them."" The young and cocky one would have none of that, so eventually, the old rooster uses his last idea. ""Tell you what. You race me from here to the end of the yard.

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. 

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!
With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.

'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'

'Great!', said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'

St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?', asked the frightened couple.

He decided to go and ask if she was lost, but as he got closer he noticed that she was crying. Slowing his approach to a cautious sidle, he inquired in perfect Japanese why she was crying. As she lifted her head, she removed what looked like a pair of headphones, but as they came free of her head, he saw there was only one driver. As he moved round in front of her, he saw that she was missing an ear.

He didn't want anyone to know about it, so whan he came back home, he immediately went out to the backyard of his house, dug a hole and planted the money in it. 
The next morning he walked outside and found only an empty hole. He noticed footsteps leading from the hole to the house next door, which was owned by a deaf-mute. On the same street lived a professor who understood sign language and was a friend of the deaf man. Grabbing his pistol, the enraged man went to awaken the professor and dragged him to the deaf man's house. He screamed at the professor: 
""You tell this guy that if he doesn't give me back my money I'll kill him!"" 
The professor conveyed the message to his friend, and his friend replied in sign language: ""I hid it in my backyard, underneath the cherry tree.""

The professor turned to the man with the gun and said: ""He's not going to tell you. He said he'd rather die first.""

And the family that lived there grew dairy. 

During the night, with no trace of a sight. 
The daughter decided to shower. 

But in that same hour just over down yonder, 
There was a band of mischevious boys. 

One said to the others ""oh listen here brothers, for I have a plan for us three""

""We shall go over yonder to the house on the prairie, to see a marvelous wonder""

""For during this hour there is a beautiful flower having her midnight shower""

So off they did go, feeling gung ho for the mighty adventure which awaited. 

For what you don't know, will make your mind blow, because the three boys have never masturbated. 

When they arrived the eldest went first, for this was the one who was high on the thirst. 

He climbed on the roof, no feelings aloof, 
But unfortunately made a sound. 

The daughter turned around at hearing the sound and said ""father, what's on the roof?""

The dad with his gun ready for fun said ""hey! Who goes there now?""

The boy being smart, with a plan from the start, let out a slight ""me-owww"" 

Hearing just that, the father said ""rats! Honey, it's just a cat""

Now the second went up but just sure enough, made a sound that was really abrupt. 

The daughter turned around upon hearing the sound and said ""father, what's on the roof?""

The dad with his gun ready for fun said ""hey! Show yourself, twerp""

But the thing with this twerp was that he was no derp. So he made a slight ""chirp chirp""

Upon hearing this word, the father said ""ermagherd, honey, it's just a bird""

Now after the bird, up went the third. 
Who made his to up to the roof. 

And just the like the others, whom were his brothers. He unfortunately made a sound. 

At hearing this sound, the daughter turned around and said ""father, what's on the roof?""

The dad with his gun ready for fun said ""hey! Who are you?""

So what did this idiot do. 
When asked ""hey who are you?""
Without even thinking, nor even blinking. 
Let out a glorious ""MOOOOOO""",Animals on the Roof,3

You've brought your grades up, and I've observed that you have been studying your Bible, and participating a lot more in the Bible study groups. But, I'm real disappointed, since you haven't gotten your hair cut.""

An old hermit has been living alone in the wilderness for many, many years. He decides that it is finally time to rejoin society. He sees in the local paper that the circus is coming to a nearby town and decides that a circus would be a wonderful way to do so.

He takes his seat and first the clowns come out. One sees the old man and says, ""Hey old man! Are you a horse's head?""

""Um... no."" the old man replies, a little confused over such an odd question.

""Well, then you must be a horse's ass!"" The crowd bursts out laughing. The old man is devastated at the humiliation. His first day, his first interaction in decades and he gets laughed at. He tries to think of a witty comeback but try as he might he can't think of *anything* to say in response. He hangs his head in shame.

The next day he heads to the library to grab a few books on witty comebacks. He reads every one twice. He knows he's got it.

He tracks down the circus a few towns over by now. He buys a ticket, sits down, and the same clown comes out. Seeing the same old man he asks, ""Hey old man! Are you a horse's head?""

""No, sir, I am not!"" The old man replies.

""Well, then you must be a horse's ass!"" Everyone cracks up. The old man thinks and thinks and can't come up with anything to say back! Once again, he is devastated.

Now the old man enrolls himself at university, majoring in the field of witty comebacks. He studies hard and graduates top of his class. He's confident he's got it now.

The old man finds the circus again and buys a ticket. Sits down. Out come the clowns. He stares intensely at the villainous jester, who stares right back.

""Hey old man! Are you a horse's head?""

""No, I ain't no horse's head, clown!""

""Then you must be a horse's ass!"" The crowd laughs hysterically. The old man knows he's got this. But try as he might, he still cannot think of anything clever to say in response to this agonizing insult. A degree in witty comebacks and nothing to show for it. He's furious now, and storms out.

The old man has had enough. No way the clown is going to get him again. He buys a ticket for China. He travels to the mountains of the Orient, and studies under the Zen Masters of wit and one-liners. Spending hours, days and nights meditating on the fine art of verbal retaliations. Under a shady tree one evening, he finally achieves Nirvana in the ancient art of witty comebacks.

He heads back to the States, and once again finds that circus. He takes his seat, anticipating that it will soon be over. The clown is stunned to see him after all this time, assuming he would have given up by now. You know the question he asks...

""Hey old man! Are you a horse's head?""

""No, I ain't no horses head!""

""Then you must be a horse's ass!"" Everyone bursts out laughing.

But finally it's the old man's time to shine. ""HEY CLOWN!""

""WHAT, OLD MAN!?""

Was reading ""The Odyssey"" and early on in the novel  Homer wrote about a man buying a person for 20 oxen. At first I was thinking about how stupid that was to not use money for that transaction (and obviously slave trade= terrible) but then I started thinking about how back then most people were farmers and 20 oxen means a good number of teams to draw farm equipment and getting the work done a lot faster. But if you are in the slave trade your primary source of income would be in the selling of slaves. I guess they could liquidate their assets at any time in exchange for other services, money, or even more slaves. But it wouldn't really make sense to just be constantly flipping for more oxen cause in the end you would just have to find a way to store, feed, and protect an ever expanding oxen herd. I guess one could go the organized crime route and have a few safe houses/properties to graze/store your oxen so even if one house gets raided you still have the majority of your wealth protected. But that would mean paying a bunch of dudes/families to watch over the oxen and they probably won't accept oxen for pay. I'm hungry but I want to figure out this ox thing. *Hits bowl to push off munchies and for inspiration* score I made jello earlier. Of course I'm on here instead of reading again. I guess it should just sorta end so I can get back to reading. Now where was I?",and i digress...,0

He climbed out of the mine and made the trek to the nearest town. He went back to the saloon and approached the bartender.

The camel dealer says ""It will take you 7 days to get to the first oasis and I have several camels who can make it if you brick them.""

The tourist, not wanting to look ignorant, hesitated to ask what he meant by ""brick"", but agreed to take one of these camels.  He took the camel to the river by the edge of town and let the camel drink his fill.  As soon as the camel was done drinking and he had filled his water skins, he set off across the desert towards the oasis.

Everything went fine for the first few days, but by the 4th day he could tell the camel was starting to struggle.  On the 5th day the camel started out well, but by the evening it was starting to slow down again.  On the morning of the 6th day, the camel started out slow and got slower all day long, and finally dropped dead in the heat of the afternoon.

The tourist knew the oasis was a day away at camel speed, so was probably a day and a half by his walking speed.  He was down to his last few sips of water, and realized he had no other options but to start walking.  He walked for the rest of the day and collapsed beside a sand dune as night fell.  The next morning he got up and started walking again, but soon collapsed due to dehydration.  Fortunately, a caravan passed by close enough to find him before he died in the desert and they picked him up and nursed him back to health.

Once he could talk, the caravan leader came and talked to him.  ""What are you doing all the way out here in the desert by yourself?"" he asked.

The tourist replied ""I wasn't out here by myself, I had a camel that died after 6 days.""

The caravan leader asked ""Didn't you brick him?""

The tourist answered ""I was afraid of looking ignorant, so I didn't ask what bricking was.""

The caravan leader said ""It's easy - camels normally only drink enough water to survive 6 days, so when they have their heads in the water drinking, you wait until they are almost full.  Then you take two bricks, one on either side of their balls, and clap them together.  When the camel goes 'Woooooop', he sucks up one more day of water!""",Bricking,2

The man decided that it was about time to use the bathroom, so he approached the bartender and asked the bartender politely, ""Exchuze me... whre kn-I take... take a.... where's the shhhitter?"" 

Luckily for the man, the bartender was fluent in drunk language. ""Down that hall, to the left!"" he said with his southern New Orleans charm. 

The man staggered down the hall and, in his stupor, crashed through the door on the right. Inside the room sat the greatest golden toilet that the man had ever laid his eyes upon. 

The drunk enjoyed emptying out the spicy Cajun food from his bowels. He enjoyed the toilet so much as it seemed to perfectly wrap around his bottom, so he decided to just keep using it. And using it. And using it. He truly was in love with the great golden toilet. 

The next morning was a haze and a headache. The man didn't remember much, but he remembered that golden toilet. He remembered the connection that it seemed to have with his bottom. He considered the experience to be sublime, perhaps even intimate. Therefore, he decided, no matter the cost, he must have that toilet. 

After drinking two bottles of pedialite and taking a few ibupeofen, he felt as though his hangover had subsided enough to return to the bar where he once met his toilet. He recognized the bartender from the night before and hastily approached him. 

""Sir. This is going to sound crazy, but last night I used your establishments golden toilet. Now, I demand a price!"" 

""Sir, I remember you from last night. We do not have a golden toilet. Maybe you imagined it in your stupor?"" 

The man was horrified. Not because he was embarassed, but because he really needed to use that toilet. He went to find it, and went through the door to the right. Alas, the toilet was gone. He was so upset that he returned to the bar to order a drink. 

Meanwhile, the daytime jazz band was being introduced. The man was excited as he remembered, ""Sing, Sing, Sing!"" from his childhood.

The conductor held his arms up to prepare the band. The man took another sip off of his Bourbon. 

Suddenly, as the band began to play, brown lumps, chunks, and liquids exploded from the tuba. 

The man had realized his mistake and quietly left New Orleans. The legend has it that he bought his own tuba on Amazon later that week, but alas, we can not say for sure.",The Legend of the Man Who Went on Vacation to New Orleans,3

One night as they were driving to yet another rubber-chicken dinner, Einstein mentioned to his chauffeur (a man who somewhat resembled Einstein in looks &amp; manner) that he was tired of speechmaking.
""I have an idea, boss,"" his chauffeur said. ""I've heard you give this speech so many times. I'll bet I could give it for you."" Einstein laughed loudly and said, ""Why not? Let's do it!""
When they arrived at the dinner, Einstein donned the chauffeur's cap and jacket and sat in the back of the room. The chauffeur gave a beautiful rendition of Einstein's speech and even answered a few questions expertly.
Then a supremely pompous professor asked an extremely esoteric question about anti-matter formation, digressing here and there to let everyone in the audience know that he was nobody's fool. Without missing a beat, the chauffeur fixed the professor with a steely stare and said, ""Sir, the answer to that question is so simple that I will let my chauffeur, who is sitting in the back, answer it for me.""",My Most Favorite,571

A Mom visits her son for dinner who lives with a girl roommate
submitted 11 months ago * by oxxoMind
A Mom visits her son for dinner who lives with a girl roommate.
During the course of the meal, his mother couldn't help but notice how pretty his roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship between the two, and this had only made her more curious.
Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and his roommate than met the eye.
Reading his mom's thoughts, the son volunteered, “I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, we are just roommates.""
About a week later, his roommate came to him saying, “Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?""
He said ,""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure.""
He sat down and wrote :
Dear Mother:
I'm not saying that you ‘did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you ‘did not' take the silver plate .. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.
Love,
your son
Several days later, he received an email from his Mother which read:
Dear Son:
I'm not saying that you ‘do' sleep with your roommate, and I'm not saying that you ‘do not' sleep with her. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver plate by now, under the pillow…
Love,
Mom.﻿",A Mom visits her son for dinner who lives with a girl roommate...,63

'Well, sister, this looks to be pretty serious.'
'I know, father. As a matter of fact, I don't think it's likely for us to survive more than a day or two.'
'I agree' affirms the priest. 'Sister, since we likely won't escape here alive, could you do something for me?'
'Anything, father.'
'I haven't seen breasts and I was wondering if I could see yours.'
'Well... under these circumstances, I don't see anything bad in it...'
The nun undresses and the priests was content, commenting on their beauty:
'Sister, do you mind if I touch them?'
She agrees, so the priest feels them up for several minutes.
'Father, may I ask you something?'
'Certainly!'
'I haven't seen a penis. Can I see yours?'
'I think it would be alright' responds the priest, lifting his robe.
'Oh, father, can I touch it?'
The priest agrees and after a few minutes of fondling he finds himself with a pretty serious erection.
'You know, sister, if I introduce my penis in the right place, it can give life.'
'Is this true, father?!'
'Yes, it is, sister.'
'Oh, father, that's wonderful! Then stick it in that camel so we can get the fuck out of here!'

One man was a mechanic, but try as he might, he couldn't get the car to start. They checked, but there was no cell phone reception for at least a hundred yards in every direction. Looking around, they saw a dim light far in the distance, and with no other option, they headed towards it. About halfway there, the wind was becoming fierce. A storm was brewing. They had a brief debate on whether or not to go back to the car, but decided if they were to go back, the wind would be against them, and so continued on. As the rain started to come down, they found the light was from a bed and breakfast. The proprietor was a skinny old woman, so deaf the men needed to shout to get her attention, but polite enough, and was not at all unhappy about them checking in so late. They decided it was late, so they would call a tow truck in the morning, and went to bed. They woke up the next morning and went downstairs for breakfast. The first man ordered Corn Flakes, the second man ordered Corn Flakes, and the third man ordered Fruit Loops.

""Well, I don't have that kind of money, but I do have this.""

The dog produced a ceramic rabbit from a table in the walkway.

""What are the three tests?"" asks the man

""Gotta pay first.""

So the guy gives him the $10 bucks, and the bartender adds it to the jar.

""OK, here's what you have to do. First, you have to drink that whole bottle of pepper tequila -- the WHOLE thing at once -- and you can't make a face while doing it. Second, there's a pit bull chained up out back with a sore tooth. You have to remove the tooth with your bare hands. Third, there is a 90-year-old woman upstairs who's never had an orgasm in her life. You gotta make things right for her.""

""Well, I know I've paid my $10 bucks,"" says the man, ""but I'm not an idiot. No wonder you've collected so much money -- that's impossible!""
The new guy proceeds to drink several whiskeys, and eventually, he gets up his nerve.

""Wherez zat teeqeelah?"" he slurs. He grabs the bottle of pepper tequila with both hands and downs it, gulp by gulp. Tears are streaming down his cheeks, but he doesn't make a face. 

Next, he staggers out back. Everyone in the bar hears a huge scuffle outside -- barking, yelping and growling, then silence.

He lived a simple life and was quite content, nothing out of the ordinary ever seemed to happen in his life. However, one day as he was settling down to watch his favourite shows with a mug of hot cocoa, he saw on the weather channel that a horrible storm was headed in his direction. He thought nothing of it and went to bed later that night. In the early hours of the morning, however, he was awoken by a loud banging on his front door, he threw on his robe and slippers before running downstairs to answer the door. Upon opening the door he was met by a homeless man who asked for refuge during the storm as his home was the only shelter for miles. Being a religious and kind man, the Monk saw to the homeless man and gave him the spare bed before going back to bed. The next morning the Monk decided he would treat the homeless man to breakfast in bed as he figured he had been through a lot. He knocked on the spare bedroom door, although there was no answer. He entered the room and immediately dropped his prepared breakfast in horror as he saw that there was blood smeared on the bed and the curtains, no sight of the homeless man and a tiny pickle in a jar in the corner of the room. Perplexed and with no explanation, the Monk proceeded to clean the mess and carry on with his life, trying to explain this unfortunate series of events to himself. The next night the Monk was once again awoken by a loud banging on his front door. When he answered he was confronted by another homeless man also seeking refuge. Once again here obliged and provided shelter. The next morning he went to check on his guest and found the exact same scene he saw the previous morning. Blood stained curtains and bed sheets, no sign of his guest and a tiny little pickle in a jar in the corner of the room. The Monk vowed to not allow this to happen again and after cleaning up the mess and going to bed the following night, He was awoken one final time by a banging on his front door and immediately answered it exclaiming ""no no no! You cannot stay here, I will not allow another catastrophe in my home!"". To his surprise, the Monk noticed he was not speaking to a homeless man, but rather a small gentlemen with a long beard and pointy hat. The man said ""listen here, Monk. Do you want to know why every time you let a homeless person seek refuge in your house, you wind up with blood stained curtains and bed sheets, the absence of a guest and a tiny little pickle in a jar in the corner of the room?"". ""YES! More than anything! Please tell me!"", the Monk gasped. The man replied, ""I shall tell you, but you must promise not to tell another living soul as long as you live."".

""The Lord will not allow you to drink from the Holy Water and enter his holy palace until you have lived the full human experience.""

One man, seemingly confused, stepped forward. ""Where shall we go? We have never sinned: we can not be condemned to Hell,"" he said. 

""You are right,"" began the angel,  and under the circumstance the Lord has agreed to allow you to redeem yourselves. His generosity has determined that I shall send each of you back to Earth for no more than one hour.

An hour passed and the three men returned to the angel. The first approached, looking miserable and filled with guilt. 

""My Lord,"" he began, "" I have broken one of your few commandments. I have stolen from a women who had done no harm to me."" 

The angel forgave the first man and allowed him to drink from the holy water. 

The second man looked even more miserable than the last. 

""My Lord,"" he cried, "" I have destroyed the life of an entire family that I have never even met. I lit their entire home on fire and watched as their possessions were engulfed by the flames! Please, forgive me Lord!"" 

The angel forgave the second man as well, and allowed him to drink the holy water.

Well, for example, the other day I went downtown and entered a shop; I wasn't there for even five minutes.

When I exited, a cop was filling out a ticket for double-parking. I quickly approached him and said, ""Wow, officer! I didn't spend more than five minutes in the store! God would reward you if you made a kind gesture toward an old, retired man, such as myself."" He completely ignored me and continued filling out the ticket.

The truth is, I went a little overboard, so I apologized. The cop looked at me coldly and started to fill out a second ticket, saying that besides being double-parked, my license plate was crooked. I then raised my voice and called him every name in the book. He finished the second ticket and placed it under the windshield wiper.

I didn't desist, and continued to insult him with all I had. To every insult, he smiled vengefully and filled out yet another ticket. After the fifteenth infraction, I told him, ""I'm afraid I must leave you, officer - my bus has arrived!""",Happy Retirement,26

He quickly claims it as his sleeping spot. The second student walks upstairs and discovers a bathroom with no windows that is warmer than the other rooms.

It's easier to understand if you remember he has a thick Italian accent, which I'll try to type phonetically.

""So one-a day I'm-a decide I go back to visit my hometown-a Malta. I get on de plane, I fly into Italy, I take-a da bus to de hotel, I check into da hotel and I fall asleep.

De next day, I wake uppa with a very hunger and I go down to de hotel rest-a-raunt. I order big-a breakfast, I order me three eggs, three bacons, and two pisses toast. De waiter he came, he put down de plate, and de plate has-a de three eggs, de three bacons, but only one piss toast. I say to waiter, ""What-a happen here? I order breakfast and I want two piss."" The waiter say, ""you should go to de restroom,"" and I say, ""no, I mean I want-a two piss on de plate."" De waiter say ""you better not piss on de plate you sonnamabitch!"" I not know this man two minutes, he call-a me de sonnamabitch. 

Anyway, I leave that restaurant and I go have a wonderful time in de city. That night, I am de very hungry again and I go to de different restaurant and I order a big-a plate-a de spaghetti and meatballs and a bottle-a de red wine. De waiter, he bring me a knife, and a spoon, but no fock. How-a I supposed to eat-a my spaghettis and I have-a no fock? I tell de waiter, ""I can't eat yet, I need a fock."" De waiter, he says, ""Malta has-a many prostitutes,"" and I say to him, ""no, no, I mean, I want-a fock on de table,"" and he says to me, ""you betta not fock on de table, you sonnamabitch!"" Again, a waiter call me a sonnamabitch!

Anyway, now I am tired of Italy and I decide I'm-a going to go to bed. I get up to my room, and the housekeepings have been, and they change-a de linens, and I have a blanket, and a pillow, but no sheeit. I call the front desk, and I-a say to de man, ""I need a sheeit."" He say, ""there is bathroom in your suite, go there,"" and I say, ""no, you no understand, I wanna sheeit on de bed,"" and he say, ""you better not sheeit on de bed, you sonnamabitch!""

That's it! I have-a had it with Italy. I pack-a my bags, I go down to check out. The girl at de front desk very kind to me, but as she hand me my receipt, she say, ""Peace on you."" I say ""Piss on you too, you sonnamabitch, I'm-a go back to America!""

And the hotel was great! They'd just finished a $5 million remodeling job, and now it's a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra charge!""

""Well,"" muttered the hairdresser, ""that's all well and good, but I know you didn't get to see the Pope.""

""Actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder, and explained that the Pope likes to meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me.

A little skeptical at first, Timmy asked the company representative a few questions.

It went like this:

ABC: Trust me, this company could really use someone new

Timmy: If there is too much work, I'm going to quit...

ABC: We'd NEVER let something like that happen

Timmy: Do employees get every Saturday and Sunday off?

ABC: That's a granted.

Timmy: Are employees required to work overtime without pay?

ABC: No way. Where did you even come up with such a ridiculous idea?

Timmy: Are meals subsidized?

ABC: You BET.

Timmy: Do the new employees usually end up doing ALL the work?

ABC: That's impossible. There are so many other experienced people in our company.

Timmy: If I did well, would I ever become a manager?

ABC: Yes. Absolutely.

Timmy: Wow. Is this for real?

After working there for several months, Timmy noticed that the job wasn't panning out the way he had been promised. Quite upset, he went to file a complaint to the HR dept. The next day, Timmy was summoned into the management's office, where they threatened to fire him for voicing out.
