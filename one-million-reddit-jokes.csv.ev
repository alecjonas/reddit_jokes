Some are wearing a shirt with the Cross. They are shouting racial slurs, hold a sign that read “Murdering Negro!” A woman has an artistic depiction of Jesus Christ in her right arm.

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know.

If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?

The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk. The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

He says, I have traveled the earth and have found out that for every grass that dies, another is born and for every pebble lost, a new one is created. There’s no change in the world and the true change comes from within.

The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.

The monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.

He says, Real funny. May I have the key? The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.

The man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end .

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But he can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery.,8

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

Woman: “I would love more than anything to be able to let you two take some shelter, but I’ve recently been widowed. I’m afraid the neighbors will get a bad idea if I let you stay in the house.”

Bill: “No worries, we are happy to stay in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we will be gone by morning.”

One day, the little red man was getting ready to go to his little red job. He followed his regular little red routine, made himself a bowl of little red cereal, did some little red stretches, and then went upstairs to have a little red shower. He took off his little red pyjamas and put on his little red shower cap, then hopped in his little red shower.
Just as he was about to turn on the little red taps, he heard a knock at his little red door. The little red man hopped out of the little red shower, put his little red towel around his waist, and went down his little red stairs to answer the little red door.
He opened his little red door and who else is there but the little red girl scouts! The little red scouts asked the little red man if he would like to purchase some little red girl scout cookies, to which the little red man said he gladly would.
And so the little red man reached down to his little red pocket, but he forgot that he was only wearing a little red towel, and so as he reached down he accidentally undid his little red towel and it fell off, revealing the little red man's little red genitals. The little red girl scouts screamed and ran away from the little red house and onto the little red road where they got hit by a little red bus.

Finally, after many attempts, he passed the training and became a fully fledged police horse. He was thrilled!  
But on his very first patrol with his partner he saw some people laughing at him, saying he was too little to be a police horse, that his uniform looked silly on him.  
He was upset, and his rider and partner noticed.  
""What's up, buddy?"" his partner asked when they got back to the stables.  
""Well,"" the horse sighed, ""I just feel like I'm not respected like the human police officers are.""

After that, the woman decides to call Ikea and have the closet checked for any issues, and so a man from the company arrives at her home and starts inspecting the closet. He builds it again and when the underground arrives, it collapses.

The man can't belive his eyes. After thinking for a bit, he says:
""I'll get in the closet, we will wait for the underground to arrive and I'll check if it's any piece from the inside which doesn't work""

And so he gets into the closet and they wait.

A moment after that, the woman's husband gets home from work and enters the bedroom.

""Hey, that's a nice closet!"" He says.

Then he opens the door and finds the ikea man inside and asks him:
""And what are you doing in here?""

""You wouldn't believe me.""

Returning to his truck, an officer has parked his car behind his truck.

So, he opens the box and picks up the letter. He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

*Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong.*

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

However, he was on a small budget and needed something small he could get, his mind went on his favorite bird, a Noisy Miner bird. But, obviously, he needed to get more than just birds, so, he went to the coast and asked a pirate for animals.

""Arggh.."" the pirate said, ""We have some porpoises, but these ones are different.""

""How so?"" Joseph responded

""These porpoises are evil and immoral"" he said

However, even with the warning from the pirate, Joseph went up and bought the porpoises for cheap.

His small zoo was a success and He got some support and got some Lions from the state, for free of charge.

However, the porpoises were starting to get hungry and when Joseph found out the Miner birds were not popular, he decided he was going to feed them to the porpoises.

Joseph was taking a shortcut over the lion sanctuary when he was stopped by the police and was about to be arrested.

^(sorry i forgot to flair the post)

A man walks into a bank. At the teller’s window, he deposits $5,000. When he leaves, the manager walks up to the teller, concerned. 

“Where does he get all that money?” said the manager to the teller, “There’s something mighty suspicious about that man”

“I don’t know,” the teller responded, “but he comes here every day and deposits the same $5,000.”

“Tomorrow,” followed the manager, “tell him to come see me in my office. I have some questions for him.”

The teller agreed, and the man came back in for his daily deposit the next day. When he went to make his deposit at the window, the teller escorted to the manager’s office. When he sat down, the manager asked him, “Where is it that you get all this money? I appreciate that you’re doing your business with us, but I’d like to make sure that nothing illegal is going on here.”

“It’s simple,” said the man. “I make bets, and I win them.”

“Impossible!” replied the manager, noticeably in disbelief. “What kind of casino do you go to that lets you win so much money every single day?”

The man said, “Oh, I go to no casino. I make bets with regular everyday people. For example, I bet you $100 that I can lick my left eyeball.”

Seeing such an easy way for cash, the manager agreed to the bet and placed his 100 dollars on the desk. To his amazement, the man popped out his prosthetic eye and proceeded to thoroughly lick it. “Well, I cant deny that you licked your eye. Take your hundred dollars,” said the manager. 

To take it one step further, the man offered the manager a rematch. “Here, I’ll give you an opportunity to win back your money. I bet you 500 dollars that my balls are square.”

“Square??? There’s no way that’s true. This is easy money!” They agreed and put their money down.

The man proceeds to pull down his pants. Then his underwear. His testicles were clearly visible to the manager. Not surprised, the manager comments, “Those are nothing but square. How could you be so stupid as to make a bet you’re guaranteed to lose?”

In response, the man insisted that the manager see up close for himself that his balls were, in fact, square. Completely aware of their round nature, he said. “Here, feel them! It’s true, I can feel the corners right here!”

The manager felt one, then the other, in his hands. They were indeed not square. He then asked the man, “Why would you willingly lose so much money in a bet you know you’d lose? This doesn’t seem very much like a way to make 5,000 dollars a day”

“Well you see here,” he said as he pointed toward the window of the office, “I had bet your teller 5,000 dollars that I could get you to grab my balls.”",He walks into a bank,4

Kicking pop music’s ass and taking the throne. I tried so hard to sign to a major label, but nobody told me how stressful touring would be. I had to spend the whole year touring for my new breakout album at the time. It actually beat out Michael Jackson’s new album, so that’s cool. But honestly, why? He’s so much better than the shit that was on that album. It’s all just lazy garage pop tunes shat out by my ADHD-riddened ass.

All it takes is one popular song for you to have fangirls eating at your ass. Half of my fan base doesn’t even know any songs outside of my most popular one, and I don’t even like the song. They play it on KEXP one hundred and fifteen times a day. I shit you not. It was so much better when they played November Rain, and I hate Guns ‘N Roses.

Even with other songs outside of my most popular song, people who listen to songs outside of that one song still overrate my work and give no fair criticism. We got these elitists over here thinking they’re cool because they bought my first album which no one bought at the time, and these retards over here thinking my David Bowie cover at a live acoustic show was an original fucking song of mine.

And don’t get me started on the celebrity drama shit. I’m married to a complete fucking bitch, but I still love her because she’s really the only one I will probably ever date. We have a daughter, but she’s such a shitty parent and recently we have accusations of injected our daughter with heroin because the media is full of assholes with no form of empathy whatsoever. I always get the fear that she’s cheating on me to. After all, she dated my weird jackass friend from Chicago who no one cares about(yet)before me. Perhaps she’s still fucking with him? I don’t know, she’s definitely bitchy enough to abandon me though.

One day, an elderly woman was hospitalized because of a cerebrovascular accident. Her daughter, Lillian Smith, approached William.

""Doctor, will you help my mother?"" she asked.

""Oh, those are the bees."" Lillian opened her trench coat and demonstrated a colony of bees inside. ""My mother is  a beekeeper, and these are her favourite bees. They once belonged to John F. Kennedy! You can keep them, if you want to. Their house was destroyed last night in a hurricane.""

Startled, William went to look at the patient, and things were looking okay, so he told Lillian. He found out that Lillian had a difficult financial situation and was actually all the way from Providence, and her mother's 81st birthday was next month. He felt bad for Lillian and even considered giving her a small piece of jewelry he had with him, so that she could sell it. William also considered keeping the bees, since they were once owned by JFK. Before the surgery he phoned his wife to ask for an advice. After hearing his story, she said:

""Billy Rock, her mother's suffered a stroke. You're a doc, do your work. You can keep the whole hive, its owner was our number 35. Give the lady from Rhode Island a small yellow diamond. Mrs Smith should be okay and turn 81 in May.""",William Rock was a surgeon...,0

The healer says: “You see, in every man’s soul there is a lot of rage and violence. But as he grows older and wiser, he will learn to control his anger. My ancestors believed that all this violence is locked up behind the fah-kahb, the gate of wisdom. Well, what happens when a man’s fah-kahb breaks open? I think you know the answer. But don’t worry, I have a very strong potion that will protect you. Be warned though, it is also poisonous. Whatever you do, don’t swallow it. Just take a sip and keep it in your mouth. It will keep you safe until your husband goes to bed, then you can spit it out.”

And so he opens a drawer, gives her a little brown bottle and with another warning about never swallowing the potion, he sends her on her way.

The next day she comes back: “I can’t believe it. I tried the potion yesterday and my husband came home, gave me a kiss, made dinner, cleaned up afterwards and then poured a bath for me. I’ve never seen him so gentle and loving. You have to tell me how the potion works!”

Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, then he made love to her all day, made love to her all night, made love to her all the next day, made love to her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!   

What is the moral of this story?   You can't kill two birds with one stone.",There was once an Indian called ‘One Stone’,82

St. Peter greets them and says, ""Well I have good news and bad news. The bad news is you backed the wrong horse.

He turns to the atheist and asks, ""What is the meaning of Easter?""
The atheist responds, ""Oh that's easy! That's when that rabbit gives eggs to kids!""

A trapdoor opens beneath the atheist, and he falls into the flames of hell.

St. Peter turns to the Hindu and again asks, ""What is the meaning of Easter?""

The Hindu nervously answers, ""Is that when the fat man in a red suit brings toys to children.""

Again a trapdoor opens and he banishes into the smoke and brimstone.

Finally, St. Peter asks the Buddhist, ""What is the meaning of Easter?""

The Buddhist ponders for a second before answering slowly and solemnly.

""Great teacher, Jesus, comes to earth preaching a message of peace and love, but He is betrayed. Jesus is nailed to a cross and dies. His disciples carry His body and place it into a hole. After 3 days He rises, and if He sees His shadow you have 2 more weeks of winter. """,Easter Joke,6

**Lesson 1:**

A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next door neighbour. Before she says a word, Bob says, “I’ll give you $800 to drop that towel.” After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob.

After a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,…

“Who was that?” “It was Bob the next door neighbour,” she replies. “Great!” the husband says, “Did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?”

*Moral of the story:*

If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.

**Lesson 2:**

A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, “I’ll give each of you just one wish” “Me first! Me first!” says the administration clerk. “I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.” Poof! She’s gone. “Me next! Me next!” says the sales rep. “I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life.” Poof! He’s gone. “OK, you’re up,” the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, “I want those two back in the office after lunch.”

*Moral of the story:*

Always let your boss have the first say

**Lesson 3:**

A priest offered a lift to a Nun. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said,” Father, remember Psalm 129?” The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again said, “Father, remember Psalm 129?” The priest apologized “Sorry sister but the flesh is weak.” Arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, “Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.”

*Moral of the story:*

If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity

**Lesson 4**

A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A rabbit asked him, ”Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day long?” The crow answered: “Sure, why not.” So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.

A fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.

*Moral of the story:*

To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very high up

**Lesson 5:**

Power of Charisma

A turkey was chatting with a bull “I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,” sighed the turkey, but I haven’t got the energy.” “Well, why don’t you nibble on my droppings?” replied the bull. “They’re packed with nutrients.” The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.

*Moral of the story:*

Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there

**Lesson 6**

A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.

*Moral of the story:*

1. Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy
2. Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend
3. And when you’re in deep shit, it’s best to keep your mouth shut!",6 Life Lessons,41

The woman hesitated for a moment, but reassured herself that she'd be able to retrain the parrot in no time. She paid and brought the bird home in its cage. Once her new friend was in place in the living room, she pulled the cloth off the cage. The parrot blinked and looked around.

A man walks into a new bar his friends told him about and they decided to check out together. He goes up to the bartender to give a description of his friends and ask him if he's seen them, but before he gets the question off he sees his friends on the far side of the bar, and he notices a large jar jam packed full of 20s and 10s.

He waves to his friends to let them know he'll be there in a moment as he turns to the bartender pointing at the jar full of cash and he says. ""Hey, what's this about?""

The bartender smiles and points at the jar with a soft chuckle. ""That's the bar's challenge, you pay 30 bucks to hear the challenge just like everybody else, then I give you three challenges, if you complete all three you get to keep the whole jar. There's gotta be over 5 grand in there by now.""

The man looks it over and grins, he's usually pretty good at this sort of stuff and he has some cash to burn so he goes to his wallet and hands over 30 bucks. The bartender opens the jar, putting the money inside and he says. ""Ok, the first challenge is you gotta chug this 40 of 120 proof vodka in a single breath...""

The man cringes already feeling like he's lost, but the bartender continues. ""Second... we got Ole Pete out back, my Pitbull, he's got a bad tooth, you gotta go out back and pull his tooth without dying of course. Then third and finally, my grandma is upstairs... and well, she hasn't gotten any since the 60s. That one speaks for itself...""

Recoiling the man wore a very sour face and asked for his money back, but the bartender just laughed and shook his head. The man figured it was the rules, the money was as good as gone, so he went to his friends and started drinking.

Hours passed and the man started to get a shade or two more brave with the help of a few rounds, talking with his friends finally he rounded up a hefty level of bravado and came back to the bartender.

""Yo! Does my money still count? Can I do the challenge?""

The bartender looked at him with a smile, laughing and shrugging. ""Sure, go for it kid...""

The bartender slid the 40 of vodka his way and the man tipped it up and miraculously drained it all in one breath with ease. This got everyone's attention and he strutted to the back door. The whole bar murmured as he went out back and they heard Ole Pete savagely growling and barking.

There were some worried voices but suddenly they heard a yip and some yelping before the man came back in triumphantly roaring. The whole bar lit up with applause and joined in his revelry. 

The man smiled wide, turning to the bartender and shouted with fervor in his voice. ""Aye! Now where's that grandma with a bad tooth?!""",Bad tooth NSFW,20

&amp;#x200B;

Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and everybody lives on credit.

&amp;#x200B;

On this particular day a rich German tourist is driving through the village, stops at the local hotel and lays a €100 note on the desk, telling the hotel owner he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night.

&amp;#x200B;

The owner gives him some keys and, as soon as the visitor has walked upstairs, the hotelier grabs the €100 note and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.

&amp;#x200B;

The butcher takes the €100 note and runs down the street to repay his debt to the pig farmer.

&amp;#x200B;

The pig farmer takes the €100 note and heads off to pay his bill at the supplier of feed and fuel.

&amp;#x200B;

The guy at the Farmers' Co-op takes the €100 note and runs to pay his drinks bill at the taverna.

&amp;#x200B;

The publican slips the money along to the local prostitute drinking at the bar, who has also been facing hard times and has had to offer him 'services' on credit.

&amp;#x200B;

The hooker then rushes to the hotel and pays off her room bill to the hotel owner with the €100 note.

&amp;#x200B;

The hotel proprietor then places the €100 note back on the counter so the rich traveller will not suspect anything.

&amp;#x200B;

At that moment the traveller comes down the stairs, picks up the €100 note, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, pockets the money, and leaves town.

&amp;#x200B;

No one produced anything.

No one earned anything.

However, the whole village is now out of debt and looking to the future with a lot more optimism.",How the Germans bailed out Greece,1646

* 1 Elephant 
* Brown gravy, and lots of it
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 2 Rabbits (optional)

## Directions

Cut elephant into small, bite-size pieces.

This should take about 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Add enough brown gravy to cover,

cook over kerosene fire for about four weeks at 465 degrees F.

&amp;#x200B;

This will serve 3800 people.

If more are expected, two rabbits may be added, but do this only if necessary,

Weather Service. “Does it still look like a cold winter?” asked the
chief. 

“It sure does,” replied the meteorologist. “It looks like a very
cold winter.” The chief advised the tribe to gather up every scrap
of wood they could find.

A couple of weeks later, the chief called the Weather Service
again and asked how the winter was looking at that point. The
meteorologist said, “We’re now forecasting that it will be one of
the coldest winters on record!”

“Really?” said the chief. “How can you be so sure?”

The meteorologist replied, “The natives are collecting wood
like crazy!”","It was autumn, and the natives on the reservation asked their new chief if it was going to be a cold winter.",458
