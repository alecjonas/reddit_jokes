There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I answered honestly “No, this is my first time.”

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. Apparently I still looked really confused. She looked all around the store to make sure it was empty. It was empty. “Just a minute.” She said, and walked to the door and locked it. Taking my hand she led me to the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. “Does this excite you?” She asked. 

Well I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she removed the rest of her clothes and laid down on a desk. 

“Well come on.”, She said, “we don’t have much time.” So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately I could no longer hold back and KAPOOOW, I was done within moments. She looked at me with a bit of a frown 
“Did you put the condom on?”

I said “I sure did.”, and held up my thumb to show her.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,24

I then asked my Mexican friend

“Es un chihuahua” he replied

I proceeded to ask my friend of Texas

“Chi-hoo-uh-hoo-uh” he proudly exclaimed

At this point I seemed to be coming to a clear consensus that it was in fact a chihuahua although still possibly an undersized sewer rat, but unlikely.

I hadn’t picked a name for the little guy yet and I was walking through China Town the next day when a man seemed very intrigued by my dog.

When I approached and asked him if he knew what it was his only reply was “Dina! Dina!”

I assume he must be the owner of the dog since he clearly knew its name and I heard his other dogs barking from the back so I handed it to him and walked away glad I had returned this man’s pet to him.

God gave her big arms and strong legs and she managed to cross the river in two hours.
She almost drowned a few times.

When she saw this, the second woman prayed to God:

""God, give me the strength ... and the means to cross this river.'

God gave her a rowboat and so she managed to cross the river in an hour.
A few times, however, she had almost gone under.

After a little investigating, he found this to be true. They met up every Thursday afternoon in a hotel. 

The man was heartbroken.
So much so, that he decided both her and her new man had to go, they had to die, that was the only way. He decided he couldn't do it himself, he didn't have the skills, nor the guts to pull off something like that. So he hired a hitman. 

He spoke with the hitman over the phone, they arranged a date, location and payment. ""$10,000 a bullet, that's my fare"". Declared the hitman. 
The man replied agitated ""$10,000? But what if you miss?""
""I never miss"" replied the hitman. And hung up. 

Thursday afternoon rolled around and the hitman was in position looking through the hotel room window from the roof of a building across the street. Both targets in sight through the scope of his sniper rifle. 
He rang the man and up and asked "" I can see them both, is there any particular way you'd like me to do this?"" 
The man said ""yes actually, I want you to shoot my stupid wife in the head and the other guy in the dick"". They both stayed on the phone. 

5 or so minutes passed and the man asked ""Well..? What the hell are you waiting for? Just get it done and collect your $20,000!""

From a very early age he was amazed by all the machinery on his farm, but especially the tractors, his father owned four, each unique to their tasks. The large red one for the tonnes of wheat, the slightly smaller green one for all the tomatoes, the even smaller one for carrots, and the very small one with a tow for his wife to assist and the children to sit in the back.

As Ryan grew, he got more and more fascinated by the tractors, at just age 8 he could identify all the parts of the tractor including the tiny pieces in the engine.

By 14 he had started to learn to drive them as his brother before him had too, he grew jealous of their skills and wanted to be the best on the farm.

He practices and practiced and in less than 3 months he had mastered the skills of all the tractors and was much better than his older two brothers.

Ryan however wasn’t the most social of kids, when he turned 16 he got his first girlfriend which ended very quickly when she knew he was a farm boy and was obsessed about farming, he pictures all over his walls of various machines and automotives, so he was rather upset. 

The years went by and his brothers both left the farming business behind and became a lawyer and a firefighter as they had been searching for a different life, along with that came their wives too.

Ryan was not happy though he wanted to find love too, and at the ripe old age of 26 he went bar to bar, club to club trying to find the one. He got a couple dates here and there but nothing lasted. Until a beautiful angel fell right in front of him at a farmers market. It was his first day alone as both his parents were too tired to help him. Their eyes darted side to side as their checks started to redden, to avoid anymore awkwardness, 
“My names Chole” she grinned.
“Ryan” he chuckled back, 
“Do you need any help, I’ve been looking for a job in acting for a while and can’t find anything” Chole exclaims,
“Of-of course” Ryan blurts out in nervousness.

So as the next day Chloe meets Ryan at the market and this continues for a while and they eventually start dating, and fall in love, and get married. 

Ryan is so happy with his life now that he’s finally caught up to his older brothers. However his parents both get very sick and in the next few years the pass away only moths apart from each other

Next on the agenda is children, they’ve talked long about the idea and Ryan says it will be very beneficial in the futures as his parents aren’t around anymore for ever to help. So they try for children for a year but sadly nothing comes of it, except an argument; Chloe becomes very stressed out and explains “I know this is your business, but I’m done, I want to carry on with acting and I want my dream role, I’m done with your stupid tractors, ENOUGH!” 

Ryan very shocked by this is hurt and doesn’t know what to say but he still loves his wife, they deliberate much more until Chole gives an ultimatum; “it’s the tractors or me!” And Ryan takes a few confusing minutes but decides to stay with Chole and sell the farm to buy a new house for them and try for children in other ways.

Eventually they’re all settled in to their cramped city apartment, and set out to see the doctors after many tests.
The doctors gives the upsetting news that Ryan is unable to have children, distraught by the fact and his new completely different life, his rushes out the room slamming the door behind him, leaving Chloe in tears.

He marches down to the nearest bar to grab a drink and sit in his wallows. When suddenly a fire bursts out in the kitchen, in shock the other guest all run straight out the building and call the fire brigade, who are then followed by the employees who try to get Ryan to leave but he’s too sad to move. Unfortunately before the employee can escape a fiery beam drops from the ceiling trapping their exit.

However Ryan stays calm and tries to ignore the situation but the employees are screaming as the smoke billows up and traps them in the building. 

Ryan finishes the last sip of his drink and stands up.

He goes over to the employees and says everything is going to be ok as the start to choke,

He then sucks in as hard as he can filling his lungs with smoke and clears the room allowing the others to breathe.

Just when the dust starts to settle, none other than his brother burst in to stop the flames.

He is confused though as there is no longer smoke, he says “woah little bro, how did you do that?”

Ryan says, “because Chloe hates them, now I’m an

 ex tractor fan”","A child who loved tractors (sorry if it’s a repost, haven’t seen it yet)",12

He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.


He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out
and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.


He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon
how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,
he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication
later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give
him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle
in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the
direction he thinks is right.


He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's
been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and
whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.


He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.


By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.


As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,
he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.


Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back
up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.


He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.


He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.


He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in
his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't
find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.


Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.


Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.


As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.


He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait
any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large
rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly
swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry
and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes
another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.
He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to
make some difference and keep himself from passing out.


He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,
it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty
sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.


He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,
dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.
Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.


After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat
stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.


After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He
knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing
donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy
enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if
he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,
trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.


He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.


He walks through the sand.


After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't
remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he
doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.


But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures
that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from
there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.


Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third
time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll
just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.


While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally
gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through
the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert
in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any
rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -
shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.


He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,
he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees
is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he
sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more
dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.


Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper
fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the
cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look.


He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.
After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.


He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough
energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When
he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot
in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.


So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins
to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to
have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages
of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't
have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last
chance.


He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the
dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting
his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just
keeps crawling.


Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,
where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone
area.


His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark
stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun
overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying
down on the nice cool surface.


Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's
probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and
dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the
beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him
a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.


He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here
in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the
center before he goes. He keeps crawling.


It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's
hearing. He would swear that someone just said, ""Greetings, traveler. You do
not look well. Do you hear me?""


He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and
knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something
different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few
seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and
tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands
and tries again. Better this time.


Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse
of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or
pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet
out of the stone, at an angle.


And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and
seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long
desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.


He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and
run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his
final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to
move from this spot.


Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than
dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a
little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves
it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a
moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.


Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -
that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.


He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here
because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was
likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was
now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had
actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white
post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe
they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake
was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.


He tries to clear his throat to say, ""Hello,"" but his throat is too dry. All
that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going
to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the
bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,
almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't
good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes
out.


He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,
and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then
swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk
now.


He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to
spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, ""Hello? Is there anyone here?""


He hears, from his side, ""Greetings. What is it that you want?""


He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed
to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a
speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides
to try asking for help.


""Please,"" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, ""I'd love to not be
thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?""


Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was
coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its
mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he
falls forward, face first on the stone, ""Very well. Coming up.""


A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits
up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily
disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the
sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped
around the tilted white post, still looking at him.


He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.
He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder
again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -
they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been
bitten. By the snake.


""It'll feel better in a minute."" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He
hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more
importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!


""Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the
afterlife?""


""Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,"" says the snake. ""That's the way I
work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.""


""You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a
drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be
thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for
the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?
Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?""


""No,"" says the snake, ""I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I
didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I
bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just
sitting around here.""


The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the
desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a
snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not
great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no
longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt
hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool
stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer
dying of thirst.


""I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your
system with the next request,"" continued the snake. ""I can guess why you
drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left
in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or
two, if you drank enough of it.""


""Ummm, n-next request?"" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting
shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.


""That's the way it works. If you like, that is,"" explained the snake. ""You
get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish."" The snake grinned at his
own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.


""But there are rules,"" the snake continued. ""The first request is free. The
second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of
responsibility."" The snake looks at the man seriously.


""By the way,"" the snake says suddenly, ""my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,
Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound
used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand
for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into
names. You can call me Nate, if you wish."" Again, the snake grinned. ""Sorry
if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds
somewhat threatening."" The snake give his rattle a little shake.


""Umm, my name is Jack,"" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. ""Jack
Samson.


""Can I ask you a question?"" Jack says suddenly. ""What happened to the
poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?
What do you mean by that's how you work?""


""That's more than one question,"" grins Nate. ""But I'll still try to answer
all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question."" The snake's grin gets
wider. ""Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need
to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not
be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make
it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at
all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to
get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.
You've been changed.


""For the third question,"" Nate continues, ""you are still dying. Besides the
effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.
In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.
Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is."" Nate seemed vastly
amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.


""As for the fourth question,"" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack
could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read
talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, ""first you have to agree
to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell
you.""


""Wait,"" joked Jack, ""isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd
have to kill me?""


""I thought that was implied."" Nate continued to look serious.


""Ummm...yeah."" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was
talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a
nasty temper. ""So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really
stop the effects of the methanol?"" Jack thought for a second. ""And, what do
you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper
fluid, and just denature it?""


""They may, I don't really know,"" said Nate. ""I haven't gotten out in a
while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and
on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you
pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume
that they still color wiper fluid blue?""


""Yeah, they do,"" said Jack.


""I figured,"" replied Nate. ""As for being bound by secrecy - with the
fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,
this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you
decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,
write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will
lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of
course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm
guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding
anyway, so you won't notice."" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.


Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a
little nervous at this. ""Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know
that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?""


Well, Jack,"" said Nate sadly, ""I can't tell you that, unless you make the
second request."" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.


""Umm, well, ok,"" said Jack, ""what is this about a second request? What can I
ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?""


""Sure!"" said Nate, brightening. ""You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes
to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and
before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or
omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous
and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and
sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be
omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very
useful, at least in my opinion."" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was
staring at him.


""Well, anyway,"" continued Nate, ""I'd probably suggest giving you permanent
good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be
immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long
time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to
recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a
request to me.""


""Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?"" said Jack. ""And keep me healthy for a
long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request
about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not
really a change to me?""


""Right,"" nodded Nate.


""Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?"" Jack asked, hopefully.


""That takes two requests, Jack.""


""Yeah, I figured so,"" said Jack. ""But I could ask to be a genius? I could
become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?""


""Well, I could make you very smart,"" admitted Nate, ""but that wouldn't
necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you
very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.
You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some
truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It
all depends on what you decide to do with it.""


""Hmmm,"" said Jack. ""Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,
after this one?""


""Maybe,"" said Nate, ""it depends on what you decide then. There are more
rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second
request. You know how it goes."" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had
shoulders.


""Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent
health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.
Do I need to sign in blood or something?""


""No,"" said Nate. ""Just hold out your hand. Or heel."" Nate grinned. ""Or
whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,
that's how it works - the poison, you know,"" Nate said apologetically.


Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it
didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better
about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot
snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to
be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack
tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it
wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.


""Hey, Jack,"" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind
him, ""is that someone else coming up over there?""


Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of
nowhere? And did they bring food?


Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...


Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through
his jeans...


Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. ""I would have
decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to
hoodwink me like that.""


""I've been doing this a long time, Jack,"" said Nate, confidently. ""You
humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -
especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of
minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the
health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.""


""Yeah, well, still,"" said Jack, ""it's the principle of the thing. And nobody
likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or
something instead?""


""More meat in the typical human butt,"" replied Nate. ""And less chance you
accidentally kick me or move at the last second.""


""Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify
to hear,"" answered Jack.


""Ok,"" said Nate. ""Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to
just start talking?""


""Just talk,"" said Jack. ""I'll sit here and try to not think about food.""


""We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,""
answered Nate.


""Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!"" Jack jumped up.
""What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically
whip up food along with your other powers?"" Jack was almost shouting with
excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.


""I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite
it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,
that is,"" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.


""Ugh,"" said Jack, sitting back down. ""I think I'll pass. I can last a little
longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it
is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.
No thanks. Just talk.""


""Ok,"" replied Nate, still grinning. ""But I'd better hurry, before you start
looking at me as food.


Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.
""You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.""


Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate
sceptically.


""Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,"" said Nate. ""Stand up
and look at the symbol on the rock here."" Nate gestured around the dark
stone they were both sitting on with his nose.


Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a
representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around
was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches
left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it
looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and
embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.


Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the
setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the
sky.


Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another
night out here! Arrrgh!


Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and
stood next to Nate. ""In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,"" said
Jack. ""Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to
have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw
desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.""


""It's about 30 miles that way."" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail
this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to
the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. ""But that's 30 miles by
the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be
able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head
out early tomorrow, Jack.""


Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and
then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading
out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting
stuff. ""Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?""


""Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,"" said Nate. ""He
figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a
'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he
could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from
across the ocean. He worried about that for a while.""


""Garden of Eden, hunh?"" said Jack. ""How long have you been here, Nate?""


""No idea, really,"" replied Nate. ""A long time. It never occurred to me to
count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I
do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands
of years, at least.""


""So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?"" said Jack.


""Beats me,"" said Nate. ""Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your
kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it
could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant
requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.""


""Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out
of the stone there?"" asked Jack.


""Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much
bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember
if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But
one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do
something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've
been here ever since.


""What is this place?"" said Jack. ""And what did he ask you to do?""


""Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?"" Nate loosened his
coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into
the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to
enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned
over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as
Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but
Nate was suddenly there in the way.


""You can't touch that yet, Jack,"" said Nate.


""Why not?"" asked Jack.


""I haven't explained it to you yet,"" replied Nate.


""Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,"" said Jack. ""You'd push it
that way, and it would move in the slot.""


""Yep, that's what it is,"" replied Nate.


""What does it do?"" asked Jack. ""End the world?""


""Oh, no,"" said Nate. ""Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it
'The Lever of Doom'."" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing
voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and
grinned.


Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned
Jack laughed. ""Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it
really do?""


""Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,"" smirked Nate. ""I just thought
the voice I used was funny, didn't you?""


Nate continued to grin.


""A lever to end humanity?"" asked Jack. ""What in the world is that for? Why
would anyone need to end humanity?""


""Well,"" replied Nate, ""I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.
Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really
bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are
the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I
didn't think to ask back when I started here.""


""Rules? What rules?"" asked Jack.


""The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it
unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human
can be bound in that way at a time. That's it."" explained Nate.


Jack looked somewhat shocked. ""You mean that I could pull the lever now?
You'd let me end humanity?""


""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""if you want to."" Nate looked at Jack carefully. ""Do
you want to, Jack?""


""Umm, no."" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. ""Why in
the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want
that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,
wouldn't it?""


""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""being as he'd be human too.""


""Has anyone ever seriously considered it?"" asked Nate. ""Any of those bound
to secrecy, that is?""


""Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or
another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and
think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get
disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.
But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here."" Nate grinned some more.


Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at
the same time. After a bit, he said, ""So this makes me the Judge of
humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?""


""That seems to be it,"" agreed Nate.


""What kind of criteria do I use to decide?"" said Jack. ""How do I make this
decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are
bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?""


""Nope,"" replied Nate. ""You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's
up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed
to know.""


""But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel
horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?""
protested Jack.


Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. ""You don't. You just have to
try your best, Jack.""


Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly
getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.


Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. ""Nate, was Samuel the
one bound to this before me?""


""Yep,"" replied Nate. ""He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to
read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried
in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months
ago.""


""Sounds like a good guy,"" agreed Jack. ""How did he handle this, when you
first told him. What did he do?""


""Well,"" said Nate, ""he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and
then asked me some questions, much like you're doing.""


""What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?"" asked Jack.


""He asked me about the third request,"" replied Nate.


""Aha!"" It was Jack's turn to grin. ""And what did you tell him?""


""I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request
you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point
that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here
and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out."" Nate looked serious
again. ""And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.""

The first redneck says, ""Well, I think the fastest thing in the world is thinking. 'Cause I can think 'bout a million thoughts just as fast as light'nin.""

He nods as though to approve of his own superior reasoning, and then takes a satisfied swig of his beer.

The second redneck speaks up and says, ""Naw man, that's where you're wrong. The fastest thing in the world is blinkin'. Hell, I can blink my eyes so fast I cain't even SEE it!""

He looks to the first redneck, gets a nod from him, and then sits back down, delighted in his own intelligence.

Knowing he'd bested his two friends, the third redneck sat down, happy in the knowledge that he was clearly the smartest man in the room.

post,8s3u3s,2qh72,jokes,false,1529361988,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8s3u3s/i_can_see_the_future/,self.jokes,,"A man walks into his local pub for a pint after work. After being served his drink, he turns to find a table to sit down and enjoy his pint.
There are two tables free, one near the entrance and another towards the back. He opts for the one near the entrance, sits down, and takes a nice refreshing swig of his beer.
He's only been sat down for a minute when a strange bloke sits down next to him.

""Do I know you?"" asks the man.
""No"" replies the stranger ""But if I were you I'd get up and go and sit at the other free table near the back.""
""Why would I want to do that?"" says the man.
""Because I can see the future and I'm telling you that a lorry is going to smash through these doors in two minutes and destroy this table we're sat at, and you, if you don't move.""

With that, the stranger gets up and goes to stand by the bar, a good few meters away.
The man initially thinks this blokes a weirdo, but after a moment, decides it couldn't hurt to move, if only to get a bit further away from the strange bloke.

He takes his seat at his new table, has a drink of his pint, but before he can put his beer back down, a lorry comes smashing in through the entrance and totally wipes out the table he was sitting at only two minutes earlier. Just like the stranger said. Every other table in the pub is fine apart from the one he just left.

Feeling shaken, he goes up to the stranger and says ""Thank you so much for telling me to move, but how the fuck did you know that was going to happen?"" 

""Like I said before, I can see the future"" replied the stranger with a shrug.

""That's amazing, could you teach me how to see the future too?"" asks the man.

""I could....but it's not easy. It took me years to learn. I will teach you.  But you'd have to be fully committed.  You'd have to follow my instructions to the letter or I'm afraid it simply wouldn't work.  Are you sure you want to learn?""

""Absolutely,  one hundred percent."" says the man.  ""I can't wait to be able to see the future myself"" 

The stranger hands him a slip of paper with an address and tells him to be there at midnight tonight. 
With that the stranger leaves, and still shaken, but with a growing excitement,  the man goes home, eagerly awaiting the beginning of his training.

At midnight, the man arrives at the address he was given, and knocks on the door. The stranger answers and with a straight face asks if he is ready to begin.

""Yes, I'm raring to get started. Let's do it.""

""Excellent, follow me. We'll have you seeing the future in no time, but again, you have to do exactly as I tell you or it won't work"".

The man follows the stranger inside, and is led down a narrow staircase into a cellar.
The cellar is furnished with only a small table and a simple lightbulb hanging overhead.

""OK, go ahead and undress, and pop your clothes on the table there please"" says the stranger.

Feeling like this is a bit off to say the least the man says ""Is this really necessary?  I don't see how this will help"".

""I told you"" said the stranger ""Do as I say or I guarantee it won't work. Do you want to learn how to see the future or not?""

""OK, OK,  I'm sorry.  I really do.  I won't question you again"" says the man.

He proceeds to strip naked and puts his clothes on the table as instructed. 

The stranger then says "" Very good,  I can see you do indeed want to learn. Now go ahead and bend over and grab your ankles for me please.""

The man does as is asked. The stranger then takes out a roll of duct tape and tapes the man's hands and wrists to his ankles, and then walks behind him out of view. Bent over, with his arse in the air, the man tells himself there must be a good reason for this, and it will all be worth it when he gains the knowledge of seeing the future. 
At that moment, the man hears what can only be the sound of the stranger unzipping his fly.

""Oh fuck, you're going to bum me, aren't you?!"" asks the man in a panic.

The stranger replies ""See? It's working already!""

The kid's screaming, demanding, whining, and it's absolute hell. Finally, the dad's had enough.

He rushes to his son's room and sits down on the bed. He starts the story, ""Son, I'm going to tell you a story with a moral. A fable. One day, in London, there was a hole of water. It was considered sacred to all, all animals, even those that cannot speak. So a group of 100 birds gathered together to get that water to rise up so they could drink it.""

The son was eagerly asking question after question, seemingly never finding a time to stop for breath. Always talking. So much. The dad shushed him and continued.

""The first bird, being the chief, took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 2nd bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 3rd bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 4th bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 5th bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 6th bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 7th bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 8th bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 9th bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 10th bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 11th bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back...""

The father continued the endless sequence as the child got more and more agitated. He started flailing and screaming, shouting that the story was crap and he needed a new dad. 

...""The 100th bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back. All the birds had contributed. Yet, the hole was not filled. So, the first bird, being the chief, took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 2nd bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 3rd bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 4th bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 5th bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back.

The 6th bird took a single pebble from the ground, and dropped it into the hole, and flew back...""

And this went on another time. And again. And again. On the 4th time repeating the cycle, the son just yelled ""DAD! WHAT'S THE MORAL OF THIS STUPID STORY?!""

The dad says,

""Shut the fuck up and go to sleep.""

Suddenly, an older woman comes through the door. She's elegant in her manner, but her looks certainly aren't flattering. Behind her however, were 20 women of age 18 and older, but still younger than 25. They were each sexy in their own manner, some flirtatious, some shy, others bratty, and others slutty. They all peered at the 3 men, sending many signals their way. The men all had one goal- to get into their bed.

The first man approaches the woman in the front and asks her hurriedly, overcome by his anxiety, ""Ma'am, ma-may I please s-sleep here tonight-t in the bed of your daughters?""

Not amused by his clearly unprepared tone, she says, ""Though I'm happy to provide you somewhere to sleep, I'd rather you sleep in the pig pen."" The man nods in defeat and slinks away.

The second man steps up and appears more confident, yet he's coming on...too strong. He bellows ""Hey! I want to sleep with all 20 of those beautiful daughters of yours! How about it?!""

The woman's disgusted by his tone and waves him off. ""I'll offer you a place to sleep with the cows instead."" His face contorts in anger, but he obliges.

Next comes the last man. In contrast to the other two, he speaks in a perfect tone, humble and mannered, innocent and posh. He says, ""Madam, I would kindly appreciate it if I could sleep in the bed of your 20 daughters as I have nowhere to sleep. May I?""

The woman, impressed by him, obliges and says, ""You know what, darling? Sure. The bed's yours and theirs."" The daughters in the background have their eyes light up in anticipation. The man smiles knowingly and walks in.

The next morning, the men get ready to leave, and the woman sends them off. Before they embark on a new path, she asks them a final question. ""How did you all sleep last night?""

The first one says, ""Well, I-I slept like a pig, rolling in the m-mud.""

The second one says, ""I slept like a goddamn cow, grazing on that fiiiine grass.""

The last one says, ""Well, madam, I slept like a golfer.""

Taken aback by this reply, she says, ""Huh? What does that mean?""

About nine months later, just about the time she is going to give birth, a kazi goes into the hospital for a prostate gland infection.

The smart doctor says to the woman, ""I know what we'll do. After I've operated on the mulla, I'll give the baby to him and tell him it was a miracle.""

""Do you think... it will work?"" she asks.

""It's worth a try."" he says. 
So, the doctor delivers the baby and then operates on the kazi.

After the operation he goes in to the kazi and says, ""Huzoor Kazisaab, you're not going to believe this."".

""What?"" asks the mulla, ""what happened?"".
""You gave birth to a child!"".
""But that's impossible!"" says the bewildered mulla.
""I just did the operation,"" insists the doctor, ""it's a miracle! Here's your baby.""

About fifteen years go by, and the kazi realizes he must tell his son the truth. 
One day, he sits the boy down and says,
""Son, I have something to tell you. I'm not your father."" 
The son says,
""What do you mean, you're not my father?"" The mullaji replies,
""I am your mother. The Bada Imam is your father."".",A woman starts dating a doctor.,3

Her next client is a successful doctor. She takes him on a tour of a nice home in the gated community of Bridge Wood Hills. Once again the client leaves visibly happier. Tasha is once again hopeful and her boss is confident that this one will go better. After two days the doctor calls the agency and declines to buy the house. Once again Tasha is disappointed.

 Tasha states “I am doing my best”. Realizing that he is not getting anywhere he decides to do some digging. He looks at customer feedback online. He notices that most of the reviews are about Tasha and all are extremely positive. Surprised her boss becomes perplexed as to why she isn't making any sales. He decides to follow her to on her next tour. He watches Tasha pull out of the parking lot and starts tailing her.

Tasha soon stops at the designated property and goes inside with the customer. Her boss follows behind. Looking through the window he doesn't see anyone. He waits a moment then slowly enters the house. He notices that it is eerily quiet.

  When he first began his job, he noticed that a bunch of Dolphins would always show up when he took his vessels out into the bay on test runs turning around at a buoy to come back in and fix any issues he spotted during the test.
When he left the marina, he would turn out into the bay, slowly picking up speed to see how his maintenance was and what the motors could handle.
He started with small boats (with accompanying small engines), and the dolphins would show up. But, in his head, he figured out they were trying to compete with him because they always stayed in front of the boats.
After he’d been doing this a while, he moved into larger boats and their larger engines. He noticed that now the dolphins could just barely stay in front of the boats.
Finally, after many years of working on larger vessels, he gave power and jet boats a go. After completing some work on one of the more powerful boats, he decided a trip around the buoy was needed.
As he pulled out into the bay, the dolphins showed up and he started gunning the engine. He flew across the water, easily outpacing the dolphins. In his excitement, he exclaimed, “Now THIS is pod-racing!”","Once, there was a young man...",1

Her soul arrived up in heaven where she was greeted by God himself.


""Welcome to Heaven,"" said God. 


""Well, what we're going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in.""


""Actually, I think I've made up my mind, I prefer to stay in Heaven"", said the woman.


""Sorry, we have rules.""


And with that God put the HR Manager in an elevator and it went down-down-down to hell.


The doors opened and she found herself stepping out into the hell with a beautiful golf course. And a country club and standing in front of her were all her friends - fellow executives that she had worked with and they were well dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. they talked about old times.


She met the Devil who was really a nice guy and she was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was time to leave.


Everybody waved goodbye as she got on the elevator.

 
The elevator went up-up-up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates and found God waiting for her.


""Now it's time to spend a day in heaven,"" he said. So she spent the next 24 hours around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. 


She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and God came and got her.


""So, you've spent a day in hell and in heaven. Now you must choose your eternity,""


The woman paused for a second and then replied, ""Well, I never thought I'd say this, I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell.""


So God escorted her to the elevator and again she went down-down-down back to Hell.


When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. 


She saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks.


The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her.


""I don't understand,"" stammered the woman, ""Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.""


The Devil looked at her smiled and said:

There was a problem though – everything the princess touched would melt. It didn’t matter what it was made of: metal, wood, stone… anything she touched would melt.

Because of this, men were afraid of her. Nobody would dare marry her. The king despaired. What could he do to help his daughter? He consulted his wizards and magicians. One wizard told the king, “If your daughter touches one thing that does not melt in her hands, she will be cured.” The king was overjoyed and came up with a plan.

The next day, he held a competition. Any man who could bring his daughter an object that would not melt would marry her and inherit the king’s wealth.

Three young princes took the challenge.

The first brought a sword of the finest steel. But alas, when the princess touched it, it melted. The prince went away sadly.

The second prince brought diamonds. He thought diamonds were the hardest substance in the world and would not melt. But alas, once the princess touched them, they melted. He too was sent away disappointed.

The third prince approached. He told the princess, “Put your hand in my pocket and feel what is in there.” The princess did as she was told, though she turned red. She felt something hard. 

She pulled her hand away and opened it for the crowd to see. In it was a small pile of m&amp;m's. The prince, overcome by joy, threw his hands into the air and screamed, ""THEY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH NOT YOUR HAND!""",Once upon a time there lived a king.,243

""Vasya, remember in 1921 you were almost executed? Well, you should know that I ratted you out to the Cheka. I hope you forgive me.""

""Oh, no worries buddy."" says Vasya.

The Communist then turns to another friend.

""Petya, remember being sentenced in 1937 to 25 years in the gulag? Well, it was me who went to the NKVD. Please forgive me.""

""No hard feelings, my friend. You are forgiven"" says Petya.

""Misha, I must confess to you that I had you sent to the penal battalion in 1942. I am terribly sorry about that day.""

""Please my friend, we all forgive you. You may go in peace"" says Misha.

""Thank you so much guys for being with me throughout all these years"" says the old communist with a tear streaming down his face. ""I don't know where I'd be if it wasn't for you. I never knew you loved me that much despite me being a stool pigeon and a complete dick.""

His friends are visibly touched by his words. Finally, he gathers his last strength and says.

""And in honor of our deep friendship I want you to fulfill my last wish. See that cactus plant on the windowsill? As soon as I die, I want you to take it and shove it up my ass.""

Just as his friends were about to say something, the old communist took his last breath and died.

So Petya rushes to the window, takes the cactus plant off and together they shove it up their dead friend's butt. Suddenly, the friends hear a loud banging on the door followed by a gruff voice shouting:

""Open up, it's the KGB. We've received information that an old Bolshevik has been tortured to death.""",An old Russian Communist is on his deathbed.,202

post,8rznt9,2qh72,jokes,false,1529329970,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8rznt9/there_was_this_tramp/,self.jokes,,"One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

He turned to see a little girl struggling in the broken ice in the middle of the lake.  She'd been skating and had fallen into the icy water.
Without a moment's hesitation the tramp ran onto the ice and slipped and slided over to the little girl.  He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and he carried her back to the road.  

He took off his coat and wrapped the little girl in it and began looking for a car to flag down. A few moments later a huge chauffeur-driven limo pulled up, and who stepped out but the little girl's father - the mayor of the nearby town and a multi-millionaire.

""How can I ever thank you sir?"" says the father after putting his daughterinto the warmth of the limo.  

""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ahem, well ..."" stammered the tramp ""...eh I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out""

""Certainly"" says the girl's father and he pulls out his wallet.

""Oh dear"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten dollars - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten dollars is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that will be plenty"".

""Well, if you insist"" says the father - ""now what will you do with your money?""

""Oh that's easy"" says the tramp ""I've not had a rest in 20 years.  I think I'll buy myself a holiday""

""Well good luck"" says the father, and he gets into the car and signals his chauffeur to drive home.

""Ten Dollars"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich!  I'm rich!"", and off he goes to the town, to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk.  

""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind"" replied the tramp.

""Well how much money does sir have to spend on sir's holiday?""

""Oh lots - anything up to ten dollars""

""TEN DOLLARS!!  You'll *never* get a holiday for ten dollars"" says the girl incredulously.

""Oh dear"" said the tramp, ""and I was so looking forward to a holiday - I'll probably never get another chance - isn't there anything you can do?""

""Well I don't think so sir, but hold on and I'll check""

The girl goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find.  There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop.

""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten dollars""

""Yippee"", exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it""

The tramp takes the tickets and, shouldering his dirty old pack, he heads out the door to hitch-hike to the port where the ship is waiting.

*************************

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Amazed at his luck and good fortune, he slings his pack over his shoulder, and marches up the gangplank.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""Super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

Hardly believeing his eyes, the captain examines the ticket and admits that our man the tramp is correct.

""Ahem, well O.K."", says the captain, ""But you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you.  Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst"", says a voice, waking him with a start.  It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship! The tramp had *never* in his wildest dreams imagined luxury like this. 

First they went doen through the first class level:

Oriental carpets - 6"" pile.

A genuine Rembrahndt on every wall.

Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair.

24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class:

As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep.

and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class,

down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with, a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing...""

""Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep.  So that's what the alarm clock is for.  Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time.  Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool.  He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived....

...and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple. Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Eh, well I've never actually dived before"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen ....""

He broke off.

""Hey, I've an idea"", he started again.

""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers.  I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man.

For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Then one morning the captain came to talk.

""O.K. I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days.  We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""O.K."" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived.  The ship was humming with excitement.  Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck.

Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Then the tramp turned to regard the diving board. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well tramp"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do.""

And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie.

And the tramp began to climb....

up and up ...

up and up ...

higher and higher ...

below him the ship grew smaller ...

up and up ...

on and on ...

past a solitary albatross ...

and still higher, till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below ...

still further, till the ocean grew dim, and the earth itself began to shrink...

and higher, ever higher ...

on and on ....

higher, and higher, and on and on towards the diving board,

He climbed on top and radioed the captain .... and then...

he jumped . 

slowly at first     

but speeding up     

faster, and faster

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance,

the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster...

past the albatross,

faster

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

DOWN!

THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!

THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL..........

SMASH!  into into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping....

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

HERO!  WONDERFUL!  AMAZING!  BLOODY GOOD SHOW WHAT!

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have *NEVER* seen anything like that, *EVER*. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on:

""But tell me; most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly:

""Well you see I'm a poor tramp so you must understand...

I've been through many a hardship in my life""",There was this tramp,14972

As a further step to reduce the price tag, the three sisters resolved to spend their honeymoon night at home. 

Later that night, their mother couldn't sleep, so she went to the kitchen for a cup of tea. On her way, she tiptoed by her oldest daughter's bedroom and heard her screaming. 

The mother thought to herself, ""That's normal, especially on her wedding night."" 

She snuck by her second oldest daughter's room and heard her laughing. ""That's normal too,"" she said, smiling to herself. 

Finally, she slipped by her youngest daughter's room where she didn't hear a peep, but she thought nothing of it. 

The next morning in the kitchen, after the husbands had gone out, the woman asked her eldest daughter about last night's noises. 

""Well Mom,"" she replied, ""you always said if it hurt I should scream."" 

""You're absolutely right sweetheart,"" the mother assured her, turning to her middle daughter. 

""Now why were you laughing?"" she asked.

Naturally I couldn’t turn them down. When I got them back to their place, they insisted on thanking me with a drink. I tried to decline but they wouldn’t budge. 

As soon as I got into their apartment, they were all over me. There was nothing I could do, there were two of them! Before I knew it, they had stripped me naked and were having their way with me! First it was one of them, then the other, then both at the same time! When all was done, I got dressed and left. It wasn’t till I got back home that I realized that while I was busy with one of them the other had stolen my wallet!

I didn’t want it to suffer, so I took out the shovel we keep for snowy days and hit it a few times to finish it off. I was running late and didn’t want the owner to find it like this, so I put it in a mail sack and put it in the back of my van, and carried on, as I would give it a decent burial later. Anyway, I get back to the depot and the police are waiting for me. ‘We have had a complaint’ the sergeant said. ‘A little old lady has contacted us to say that her cat was asleep on the grass. Suddenly a post van came round the corner, skidded all over the road and came to a stop. The Postman got out, beat her cat to death with a shovel, put it in a mail sack and drove off. And we have traced this to being you!’ Before I could say anything another copper came in. ‘Looks like he’s a bad one Sarge. We found a dead cat in a sack in the boot, and another one stuck behind the front wheel.’ ",So there I was on my postal round today.,1

The captain did his best to skirt the edge of the storm, but it was a pretty rough ride just the same – rough enough that the flight attendants were ordered to strap themselves into their seats for about half an hour, and many of the passengers were putting the little plastic-lined bags in their seat pockets to good use. When the turbulence finally abated, the flight attendants unbuckled themselves, and the captain’s voice came on over the intercom: “Well, folks, that was quite some ride, wasn’t it? But we came through it fine, just the way we always do, and I’m happy to report that it looks like the remainder of our trip should be much calmer. On behalf of myself and today’s flight crew, I’d like to thank you very much for your calmness and cooperation, and extend our best wishes for a pleasant stay in Boston.”

After a short pause and several clicks:

“Jesus Christ – whadda bitchin’ ride. Boy, I sure could use a cup of good strong coffee and a blow job, right about now.”

Dad orders up the biggest, strongest drink for his boy. With all the bar patrons looking on curiously and the bartender shaking his head in disbelief, the boy takes his first sip of alcohol. Swoooop! A torso pops out!

The bar is dead silent; then bursts into a whoop of joy. The father, shocked, begs his son to drink again. The patrons chant ""Take another drink!""

The bartender still shakes his head in dismay. Swoooop! Two arms pops out.

The bar goes wild, but the bartender is clearly disapproving.

The father, crying and wailing, begs his son to drink again. The patrons chant ""Take another drink!"" The bartender ignores the whole affair.

By now the boy is getting tipsy, and with his new hands he reaches down, grabs his drink and guzzles the last of it. Swoooop! Two legs pop out. The bar is in chaos. The father falls to his knees and tearfully thanks God.

The boy stands up on his new legs and stumbles to the left... then to the right... right through the front door, into the street, where a truck runs over him and kills him instantly. The bar falls silent. The father moans in grief.

The husband and father became very eager since it had been quite a while since the couple had been intimate. 

After a while the wife comes in from making breakfast, locks the door behind her.  ""The kids are eating breakfast and watching cartoons, time for business,"" she says. 

A few minutes later, he's lying on the bed feeling very satisfied and knowing he's got four more rounds to go that day.  What a way to celebrate he thinks to himself.

He quickly regains his strength and sees his wife standing naked in front of the bathroom mirror getting herself ready for the day. 

He pops out of bed and walks up behind her whispering in her ear that he is ready for round two.

“What are your wishes?”

The snake grants these but then reminds the man that the third wish comes with a favor. The snake says that he is guarding a magic lever, that, if it is pulled, it will destroy the universe. He is going to be succeeded by his son one day, and he wants the man to show his little snake son what he will one day protect.

post,8rpeof,2qh72,jokes,false,1529218270,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8rpeof/a_football_manager_signs_his_new_star/,self.jokes,,"A manager for a football club signs his new star, a centipede.  It’s the debut game for their new club and all the other players are out on the field when the match starts. The team starts conceding goals and is down 5-0 at half time. 

During the break, the manager substitutes the centipede on and the tactical switch changed the momentum of the game. The skill was unnatural, footwork you haven’t seen before while dribbling around every opponent player, and scoring every shot taken. The team had come back to win 7-5 by full time, the centipede scoring all 7 while winning the man-of-the-match award!

During the post match interview, the press asked the centipede “That was an amazing second half for you and your team, coming back like that to win after that halftime deficit. It certainly looks like you’re fitting into your new squad well. However, with that ability and goal scoring prowess, is there a reason why you didn’t start the match?”

“Thanks. Err... yeah, I was still putting on me boots!”",A football manager signs his new star...,5
