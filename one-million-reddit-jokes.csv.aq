So he said to the taxi driver, ""hey man, why do you say conservatives are stupid?"", ""Because they are!"", said the taxi driver...

    One fine spring day, a boy on a playground had a burning question. It was a rather odd question, so he decided to confide in a fellow child
     He walked up to a little girl on the playground, and asked her, “Do you know what the hamstrung limpet is?” 
     A moment later she was doing her best to beat him to a pulp. A teacher was forced to separate them, but afterwards, they asked the boy what had happened.        
      “Well, see, I just asked her a question. Then she started hitting me. Do you know what the Hamstrung Limpet is?”
    The teacher, restraining an apoplectic fit, sent the boy to the principal. The principal was perplexed by the silent teacher, so they asked the boy what had happened. 
      “Well, see, I just asked a girl a question. Then she started hitting me. Then I asked the teacher. She got real mad and sent me to you. Do you know what the Hamstrung Limpet is?” 
      The principal, after turning several shades of green, collapsed. A few months later, the principal pressed charges against the child for assault (the state had some very loose laws). 
      In court, the prosecutor asked the boy to explain what had happened. 
      “Well, see, I just asked a girl a question. Then she started hitting me. Then I asked the teacher. She got real mad and sent me to the principal. Then the principal fell over when I asked her, and sent me here. Ms. Prosecutor, do you know what the Hamstrung Limpet is?”
       The entire court reeled in disgust. It was several decades later, when the boy (now a man) was to be executed, that he would be asked by the executioner what his last wish was.
      “Well, see, I just asked a girl a question. Then she started hitting me. Then I asked the teacher. She got real mad and sent me to the principal. Then the principal fell over when I asked her, and sent me to court. Then I asked the prosecutor, and everyone in court got mad, so now I’m here. So Mr. Executioner , do you know what the Hamstrung Limpet is?” 
      The executioner blinked. “Do you not know?” he asked. The man shook his head. “Well now I feel kinda sorry for ya. The Hamstrung is one of the dirtiest, most disgusting things you can imagine. It’s a five minute long joke...                              ...with no punchline.”",The Hamstrung Limpet,10

At the first house, a woman complained, “I’ve been a little sick to my stomach.”

As they left the younger man said, “You didn’t even examine that woman. How did you arrive at your diagnosis so quickly?”

“I didn’t have to. You noticed I dropped my stethoscope on the floor in there? When I bent over to pick it up, I noticed a half-dozen banana peels in the trash. That was what probably was making her sick.”

“Huh,” the younger doctor said, “pretty clever. I think I’ll try that at the next house.”

Arriving at the next house, they spent several minutes talking with a younger woman. She complained that she just didn’t have the energy she once did. “I’m feeling terribly run down lately.”

“You’ve probably been doing too much work for the church,” the younger doctor told her. “Perhaps you should cut back a bit and see if that helps.”

As they left, the elder doc said, “Your diagnosis is almost certainly correct, but how did you arrive at it?”

It wasn’t long before Captain Smith noticed that Airman Jones had almost a 100% record for insurance sales, which had never happened before.
Rather than ask about this, the Captain stood in the back of the room and listened to Jones’s sales pitch.

Jones explained the basics of the GI Insurance to the new recruits, and then said: “If you have GI Insurance and go into battle and are killed, the government has to pay $200,000 to your beneficiaries. If you don’t have GI insurance, and you go into battle and get killed, the government only has to pay a maximum of $6000.”

in all the activity going on next door and spend much of each day
observing the workers.

Eventually the construction crew, all of them gems-in-the-rough,
more or less adopted her as a kind of project mascot. They chatted
with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch
breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel
important. At the end of the first week they even presented her with
a pay envelope containing a couple of dollars.

The little girl took this home to her mother who said all the
appropriate words of admiration and suggested that they take the two
dollar ""pay"" she had received to the bank the next day to start a
savings account.

When they got to the bank the teller was equally impressed and asked
the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such
a young age. The little girl proudly replied, ""I worked last week
with the crew building the house next door to us.""

""My goodness gracious,"" said the teller, ""and will you be
working on the house again this week, too?""

The little girl replied, ""I will if those lumberyard assholes ever deliver 
the fucking sheet rock.""",A young family moved into a house next door to a vacant lot,138

It soon became apparent that this was no task for a common knight, but only the holiest and most dedicated - a living saint.

Fortunately, one was found in the person of Saint Honorius, a man with the noblest of deeds to his credit and the humblest mien ever to be found in a man at arms. And in response to the entreaties of the poor and oppressed of the Thames folk, Saint Honorius took up his sword and his armour and set out to duel the monster.

Following the cunning stratagem adopted in the affair of the Lambton Worm, Saint Honorius had many sharp spikes welded to his armour, so that if the Thames wyrm tried to crush him in its dread coils, it would lacerate itself to death. Then, bearing a silver-inlaid horn of the wild Russian ox, the saint went forth to challenge the beast to mortal combat.

Of the tale of this battle no tongue can adequately sing. Suffice it to say that the mighty knight, puissant at arms and borne up by the holiness of his faith, triumphed over the monster, and the beast was slain, and its carcass lay in the river for many days, befouling the water and threatening to raise a stench to affront Heaven itself once it began to rot. No carters could bear it away nor teams of draught horses or kine haul it, and none knew what could be done. Save one man:

For by great good fortune, a man from far Hanover, a sausage-butcher by trade, happened upon the scene, and being of a curious turn of mind, he hewed off a chunk of the creature's flesh and fed it into his meat-mincer, stuffing the ground meat into a skin after the fashion of his profession; and the resulting viands proved to be delectable, with excellent keeping qualities, and was much sought after; and thereby the inconvenient and potentially noisome carcass was disposed of and the sausage-maker's fortune assured at one and the same time.

Saint Honorius cared naught for such dealings, beyond a quiet contentment that matters were so satisfactorily resolved (and it is recorded that he too was delighted at the gift of sausage that was brought to his humble cot). But when the time came to commemorate the adventure, a scribe of renown was commissioned, and began to write upon this wise:

*It was the beast of Thames, it was the wurst of Thames...*",In the days of old the River Thames was once plagued with a giant wyrm.,4

While in the bar, he boasted that he could tell any animal and how it was killed by the feel of the pelt and the bullet hole. And he could do it blindfolded. 

Of course, no one believed him. So they bet drinks, blindfold him, and bring the first pelt. 

He feels it, ponders a moment, and says, ""Lion, killed with a 30-06.""

The others are amazed. Double or nothing they say. Another round of drinks and another pelt are brought. ""Rhino, killed with a 45-70,"" he proclaims. The patrons are again amazed at his accuracy.  

This goes on for several more rounds. After a few hours he is so drunk he blacks out. 

He wakes up the next morning with his wife making breakfast and he has a black eye. He asks her why he has a black eye, that he doesn't remember fighting. 

She says, ""There was no fight. But if you slide your hand into my panties and say 'skunk, killed with an axe,"" ever again, I will kill YOU with the axe.""",The Hunter.,62

As he switches over with the marine currently stationed there, he realises there is no bed, no clean water, no toilet, just him, his weapon and the dirt on the floor.

The next morning he wakes up to find a queue of naked men leading into the mosque. At the front, the mosque leader is in prayer with the man leading the line.

As the prayer finishes, he drops to his knees and swings his fist into the naked guys balls, flooring him! The naked guy slowly comes to his senses and crawls out of the mosque.

Confused, the marine asks the mosque leader what's going on...

""These men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over Afghanistan."" He says, ""Instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive Allah's justice, then return home.""

The marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.

After 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.

""Hey, my last post was in Korea, how is it here?"" Asks the replacement. ""And what's with this queue of naked guys in the middle of nowhere!?""

It was, of course, a national tragedy for all of France and quite a problem, not the least of which being the fact that airplanes could very easily fly right into the thing. 

The French government called every last engineer or electrician they could think of, and each one tried to fix the lights with no success. It was a baffling, befuddling problem that it seemed nobody could solve. 

Then, out of nowhere, a man with the smallest hands anyone had ever seen came to the French officials and said, “I’ll do it. I’ll fix lights.”

The officials asked him what qualifications he had. 

“None.”

They asked him his plan.

“None.”

The officials laughed, but they were out of options. So they sent the man up to the top of the tower with no hope that he could succeed. 

But he did.

Their talk drifted to the subject of women, of course, with each man claiming that the women in their home country were the sexiest and most sensual.

""If we were in a bar in Roma,"" the Italian guy said, ""you would note that the cocktails served to women are served with extra long straws. Now this is not because Italian women have need of a long straw to grasp it, no, no, it is because our women have such long and beautiful necks. Ah, I tell you, Italian women are simply so magnifica, the best in the world.

The Frenchman shook his head. ""Ah, but non, let me tell you about French women. If we were in a bar in Paris, you would note that the women sitting on the bar stools all have their feet on the floor. Now this is not because we have low bar stools in France, no, no, it is because our women have such long and beautiful legs. Ah, I tell you, a French woman's long legs in sheer nylon stockings are magnifique, the best in the world.

The Danish guy had the feeling that he had to defend Danish women, but he had to admit that although he did think Danish women were the best (of course), he was finding it difficult to express himself as eloquently as the Italian and the Frenchman. Still, the honor of his country was at stake, so he had to make the effort. ""Well, let me tell you,"" he said. ""When a Danish man says goodbye to his wife when he's leaving the house to go to work, he kisses her and he gives her a slap on the behind. And when he comes home from work, do you know what? His wife's behind is still vibrating!

The bartender says to the man ""in the back room I have a magic genie, and for $1,000 dollars I will let you make a wish.""

The man runs off to the bank, returns with the $1,000 and heads into tbe back room to make his wish.

Suddenly the bar is filled with ducks wall to wall.

A different man walks into a different bar and in the corner is a horse chewing on some hay. The man orders a drink and asks the bartender ""what's the deal with the horse?""

The bartender says to the man ""if you can make that horse laugh and cry in the same night you get drinks for free for the rest of your life.""

The man drinks his drink, walks over to the horse, and whispers in his ear. Suddenly the horse bursts out in laughter. The man walks back to the bar and asks for his free drink. The bartender tells him ""the rules are you have to make him laugh, and cry, you're only halfway there friend."" So the man walks back over to the horse and soon after the horse starts balling his eyes out.

The bartender is a gasp. He tells the man ""before I give you your free drink you have to tell me what you said.""

The man says ""first I told the horse my dick was bigger than his, then I proved it to him.""

Miss Russell had taught grammar school for 30-some-odd years. Despite her mounting fears, she asked little Robbie what he meant by that.

Full of grins and mischief, and in the flower of his youth, little Robbie and trouble were old friends but he always told the truth.

""You see, Miss Russell, out at the farm we got this here low down fox. The last few nights, he done ate six hens. Last night, when Daddy heard a noise out in the chicken pen, he grabbed his double barreled shot gun and said to my Ma, ""That fox is back again... I'm a gonna git him!''

""Stay back,"" Daddy whispered to all us kids!

""My Daddy was naked as a jaybird -- no boots, no pants, no shirt! To the hen house he crawled, just like an Injun on the snoop. Then, he stuck that double-barrelled 12-gauge shotgun through the window of the coop. As he stared into the darkness, with a fox on his mind, our old hound dog, Rip, had done gone and woke up and comes sneaking up behind Daddy. Then, as we all looked on, plumb helpless, old Rip done went and stuck his cold nose in my Daddy's crack!""

He starts to get a headache by the end of the day but the voice does not stop nagging him. “Black 22, Caesars Tahoe”, it does not stop as his head hits the pillow. 
He climbs out of bed after after a hard night of no sleep. The voice is louder, more insistent. “Black 22, Caesars Tahoe”. All next day, same thing until that evening it is screaming “Black 22, Cesars Tahoe bet everything!” Its a pounding sound in his head. Insisting that he bet everything. 
After a third night of no sleep he is convinced it must mean something. “Black 22, Caesars Tahoe bet it all!” He cleans out his bank accounts, retirement accounts, hawks his wife rings and sells the car. Jumps on a bus and the voice is screaming in his head, “Black 22, Cesars Tahoe bet it all!” He’s near crazed from lack of sleep and the screaming in his head.
When he finally reaches the roulette wheel and sets his life savings down. The voice stops. The dealer drops the ball and the wheel spins. He is basking in the glory of this silence knowing his about to be rich 35 to 1 on everything he owns. $ signs appear in the air above the table. This was a sign from god. Every moment of his life built up to this. Standing at the table ball bouncing along the spinning wheel. Sweet relief he will leave the casino having beaten the house.

Then, he would take a glance around the office, smile and nod to himself, and go on with his day normally. 

His employees were curious about the contents of the yellow envelope but the old accountant refused to talk about it. 

After many years and a successful career, he decided to retire. Choosing a successor from the employees, he showed him the ropes, introduced him to the clients and left him his old desk and computer. 

“Sir,” said the successor. “Before you leave, can you give me one more thing? May I have your yellow envelope and its contents?”

The old accountant was silent for a minute but then he shrugged.

“I reckon I have no more use for it. Here, you can have it. Good luck, sonny.”

And left.

The next day, the new senior accountant arrived at the office and went straight to the desk. He took the yellow envelope from the drawer and with trembling fingers opened it and removed the single sheet of paper. He read it and it said:

You have 10 birds in a tree. You shot one. How many are left?

There is a programmer version for this question:

One day, when the teacher wanted to test the students' IQ in class, he asked a boy, ""There are 10 birds in a tree. You shot one. How many are left?""

The boy asked, ""is it a silent pistol, or other guns without sound?""

""No, it has gunshot.""

""How loud is the gunshot?""

""80-100 decibels.""

""That is to say, the sound of the gunshot will make your ears ache?""

""Yes.""

""Is it illegal to shoot birds in this city?""

""No, it won't break the law.""

""Are you sure that bird was really killed? How do you verify that?""

""Sure."" the teacher is impatient. ""Please, tell me how many are left, OK?""

""OK. Are there any deaf one in the birds?""

""No.""

""Is there a bird with mental problems in it, which too stupid to know to fly away when it hear the gunshot?""

""No, they all have an IQ of more than 200!""

""Are there any birds kept in cages?""

""No.""

""Are there any other trees by the side and any other birds on the trees?""

""No.""

""How about…ten miles around?""

"" There are just such a tree! ""

""Are there any disabled or hungry birds that can't fly?""

""No, their health and body all in great shape.""

""Do we count the birds in the pregnant belly? Can they also be counted as one?""

""They are all male.""

""They can't be pregnant?""

""No... It's impossible. ""

""Is the shooter dazzling? Is his eyesight good? How does he make sure 'they are ten birds'? ""

""He has no dim eyesight or blurred vision. There are only ten birds."" the sweat on the teacher's forehead has come down,

After class, the bell rang, but the boy continued to ask, ""are there any birds that are too stupid to be afraid of death?""

""No. They all are afraid of death.""

""Did some of them choose to stay and ready to die, because his lover was shot?""

""Fool, I said that they were all male!""

""Is homosexuality OK? How do you determine their sexual orientation? ""

“... their sexual orientation is hetero! ""

""Will he kill two birds with one shot?""

""No.""

""kill three birds with one shot?""

""No!""

""How about four?""

""No!!""

""And five?""

""Absolutely not!!!""

...

""Will the bullet have knocked out the tree? If there were no trees, there would be no birds! ""

""No. It's just an ordinary pistol which is not so powerful. ""

""... Well, are all the birds free to fly? ""

""Absolutely yes.""

""Will they panic and bump into each other when they take off?""

""No, every bird has installed a satellite navigation system, and it can fly automatically.""

""Well, if your reply is not deceiving me…"" this student replied confidently, ""if the dead bird is hanging on a tree and does not fall from it, there will be one left; if he falls, there will be no one left.""

""No hard feelings, my friend. You are forgiven"" says Petya.

""Please my friend, we all forgive you. You may go in peace"" says Misha.

His friends are visibly touched by his words. Finally, gathers his last strength and says.

""And in honor of our deep friendship I want you to fulfill my last wish. See that cactus plant on the windowsill? As soon as I die, I want you to take it and shove it up my ass.""

Just as his friends were about to say something, the old communist took his last breath and died.

So Petya rushes to the window, takes the cactus plant off and together they shove it up their dead friend's butt. Suddenly, the friends hear a loud banging on the door followed by a gruff voice shouting:

We all said our answers out loud and they all had the same answers, mine was the only different one.

""Hey, why the horse in the back of the bar""

The man thinks for a moment, removes $100 from his wallet, places the money on the bar, walks back, and whispers something in Jim's (the horse's) ear. The horse starts laughing hysterically. 


The man walks back to the bar, orders another whiskey, shoots it, takes his winnings and leaves. 


A few months later this strange man comes back to the bar. Again he orders a drink and again he asks about the horse. The bar tender replies:


""Well, since you were last here we needed a new wager. Same deal only now we are looking for someone that can make Jim cry"". Then places his money on the bar and walks back to the horse and moments later returns ; a weeping horse in his wake and inquires to his prize money.

Joe sunk the ball easily, only using one more stroke. Bill takes two more strokes to sink the ball, because his ball was far away. I also take two strokes, but only because I missed the first putt. Finally Ross took his turn after looking closely at the terrain and practicing some putts. He taps the ball, gently rolling it into the hole. As we add up the score, we notice the almost all of us had a score over 2 for the hole, albatross.

post,f5uzcd,2qh72,jokes,false,1582045665,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/f5uzcd/the_voodoo_dildo/,self.jokes,,"*A businessman is getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knows his wife is always horny, so he decides to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn’t much like the idea of her screwing someone else.*

*So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.*

*“Well, I don’t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except a” said the old man, and then he stopped.*

*“Except what?” asked the businessman.*

*“Nothing, nothing,” said the old man.*

*“C’mon, tell me! I need something!” protested the businessman.“Well, sir, I don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘voodoo dildo,’” the old man said.*

*“The voodoo dildo?” the businessman asked.*

*The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, “Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!”*

*The old man said, “But you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.”*

*He pointed to a door and said “Voodoo dildo, the door.”*

*The voodoo dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, “Voodoo dildo, box!”*

*The voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.*

*The businessman said, “I’ll take it!”*

*The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, “Voodoo dildo, my pussy.”*

*He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.*

*After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said “Voodoo dildo, my pussy!” The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before.*

*After three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn’t been drinking, but that a voodoo dildo was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn’t stop screwing her.*

*The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, “Yeah, right. Voodoo dildo, my ass!""*",The voodoo dildo,38
