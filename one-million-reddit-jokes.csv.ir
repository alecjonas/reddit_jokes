The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk",A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery.,8

A magician was working on a cruise ship. Since the audience was different each week, the magician did the same tricks over and over again. There was only one problem: The captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the Magician did every trick.

Once he understood, he started shouting in the middle of the show, ""Look, it's not the same hat!"" or, ""Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table!"" Or ""Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?""

The magician was furious but couldn't do anything. It was, after all, the Captain's parrot.

Then one stormy night on the Pacific, the ship unfortunately sank.

The magician luckily found himself on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea, as fate would have it ... With the parrot.

They stared at each other with hatred, but did not utter a word.

This went on for a day... And then 2 days. And then 3 days. Finally on the 4th day, the parrot could not hold back any longer and said...

down by docks. He ran into Patrick, the local firsherman who just about to head off in his boat.


Patrick offered to take the Father out fishing for the afternoon since he was bored so they headed off.
About an hour of fishing later the priest got a huge bite and reeled in one of the biggest fish Patrick
had seen, astounded and not thinking he blurted out ""Wow Father would you look at the size of that fucker!""

The priest said, ""Exsuse me son you are in the company of a man of the cloth would you mind watching your
language."" 

Patrick thinking quick to save face said ""No no Father, you got me all wrong, thats what it is
called a fucker."" 

Anyways the priest go back to the parish and runs into sister Mary ""Sister Mary, would you
mind cleaing and gutting this fucker for me?"" 

She too was astouned at the language used but the priest
explained that was what type of fish it was. So she cleans it and takes it to the Mother superior. ""Mother
superior, do you feel like cooking a meal with this fucker this evening?"" 

She was taken aback too, but sister
Mary expalined and it was off to the stove. Now believe it or not, by fluke, the Pope decided to drop by that
night and they invited him to stay for tea. After they had eaten the pope declared ""That was a beautiful dish!""


To which the priest replied ""I caught the fucker!"" 

Sister Mary ""I cleaned and gutted the fucker!"" 

And the Mother superior, ""And I cooked the fucker!"" 

Well you could of heard a pin drop, the Pope was flabbergasted, his
expression deadpan, he pushed his seat back and stared at all 3 of them. Then he pulled a bottle of whisky
out of his pocket, lit up a cigarett and said ""You know what, you c@#nts are ok""",Twas a slow and quiet day in the little Irish parish,75

post,8yr54x,2qh72,jokes,false,1531547416,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8yr54x/what_happens_in_vegas/,self.jokes,,"A perpetual gambler had a rare turn of luck and hit a 500k jackpot. The casino, determined to get their money back, comped him one of their best luxury suites. Lonely, he was seeking some lady company for the evening. He called down to the concierge’s desk and requested the best looking call girl in Vegas to be sent up to his suite. 

About 30 minutes later. he opened the door to see the hottest woman he’d ever laid eyes on in person.

This was a first for him. I mean sure, he’d always stored this fantasy somewhere in the “that’d be amazing, but would NEVER happen to me.” file. But yet here he was...

Thankfully though, she was a pro and used to the shy boy mentality. She made herself a stiff drink and got right down to business, “Tell me what you’d like, honey?”

Taken off guard, he stammers, “Umm. Uhh So how much for a hand job?”

“A hand job.? That’ll be $500.”, she replied.

“$500!!? For a hand job?!!”, he says in shock.

She gets up and strolls over to the window and motions for him to join.

She points down and says, “Do you see that strip mall right over there?”

“Yeah.”, he replies.

“Well, I own it. I bought it with the money I earn from giving hand jobs, so I must be pretty damn good at it.”

Surprised, but curious, he agrees, “Okay. Tonight I’m celebrating.”

A little while later he’s sitting there in absolute bliss amazed by the best damn hand job he didn’t even know was possible. The two share another cocktail, and after a bit he works up the courage to ask, “So how much for a blowjob?”

“A blowjob? That’ll be $5,000.”, she replies.

“WHAT? WHOA! $5,000?!!! For a blow job?!!!l”, .he says in a raised voice.

Again, she stands up and motions for him to join her back at the window. Mainly out of curiosity, he complies.

“Honey, do you see that 10 story hotel and casino right over there?”, she points.

“Yeah.”, he replies.

She tells him, “Well, I own it and I bought it with the money I got from giving blowjobs so I must be pretty damn good at it!”

“Okay, okay. Tonight, money is no option. I’m celebrating!! Let’s do this.”, he replies.

Holy Mother of God. It was the blowjob to end all blowjobs. He was a changed man on a spiritual level. He was still lost in glorious bliss when he said, “Okay, I’m a really afraid to ask this, but how much for some pussy?”

She laughed and said, “Honey, IF I had a pussy I’d own this whole Goddamn town!!”

I didn't need more than a head of lettuce though, so I grab one out of a box and head up to the front.

The cashier looks at the lettuce, looks at me, and says, ""I'm sorry, sir, but I can't sell you that.""

""Why not?""

""Well, sir, we only sell the entire box. You can go back and get the entire box and buy that or you need to return the lettuce.""

""That's ridiculous!"" I say, ""There must be over a hundred heads in each of those boxes.""

""That's right, sir. There's one hundred and forty-four.""

""You mean you have to buy one hundred and forty-four heads of lettuce?? That's absurd! Who would need that much!"" I was so upset at that point that I just left the lettuce with the cashier. I looked her straight in the eye and said, ""This is the worst supermarket I've ever seen.""

""Fuck off!"" replies the bloke. ""And where's the fucking piano?""

""Pardon?"" says the manager.

""Fucking deaf as well are we? You little piece of sniveling shit, show us your pissing piano.""

""Ahhhh,"" replies the manager. ""You've come about the pianist's job,"" and shows the bloke to the piano. ""Can you play any blues?""

""Of course I fucking can,"" and the bloke proceeds to play the most inspiring and beautiful sounding honky tonk blues that the manager has ever heard.

""Why, that's superb, what's it called?""

""I want to fuck your missus on the sofa but the springs keep hurting my knob,"" replies the pianist.

The manager is highly upset by the bloke's language but offers him the job on condition that he doesn't introduce any of his songs or talk to any of the customers.

This arrangement works well for a couple of months until one night, sitting opposite him, is the most gorgeous blonde he has ever laid his eyes on. She's wearing an almost see through dress, her tits are almost falling out the top and the skimpy little 'G' string she's wearing is riding up the crack of her arse. She is sitting there with her legs slightly open, sucking suggestively on asparagus shoots and the butter is dripping down her chin! It's too much for the bloke and he runs off to the bogs to 'wrestle with his bald headed champ'. He's pulling away furiously when he hears the manager's voice...

""Where's that bloody pianist?""

He just has time to shoot his bolt and in a fluster he runs back to the piano, not having bothered to adjust himself properly, sits down and starts playing some more tunes. The blonde steps up and walks over to the piano, leans over and whispers in his ear:

""Do you know your knob and balls are hanging out your trousers and dripping spunk on your shoes?"".

I, the Penis, hereby request a raise in salary for the following reasons: 

I do physical labor.

I work at great depths. 

I plunge headfirst into everything I do.

I do not get weekends or public holidays off.

I work in a damp environment.

I work in a dark workplace that has poor ventilation. 

I work in high temperatures.

My work exposes me to contagious diseases. 

Sincerely,

P. Niss


Dear Penis:

After assessing your request, and considering the arguments you have raised, the administration rejects your request for the following reasons: 

You do not work 8 hours straight.

You fall asleep after brief work periods.

You do not always follow the orders of the management team. You do not stay in your designated area and are often seen visiting other locations. 

You do not take initiative - you need to be pressured and stimulated in order to start working.

You leave the workplace rather messy at the end of your shift.

You don't always observe necessary safety regulations, such as wearing the Correct protective clothing.

You will retire well before you are 65.

You are unable to work double shifts.

You sometimes leave your designated work area before you have completed the assigned task.. 

And if that were not all, you have been seen constantly entering and exiting the workplace carrying two suspicious-looking bags.

Sincerely,

V. Gina",The Day the Penis asked for a Raise,8

Having foolishly stopped out of curiosity he approached me. “Global Warming is having a drastic effect on the globes axis!”, he yelped. “The rotation of the Earth is speeding up dramatically, and within the next few years you will find yourself constantly spinning!”. Being relatively gullible, I listened through all of wild explanations. He then gave me an intense look an handed over a brochure with his main talking points. On its back was large, inexplicable “L”. Then, saying nothing, the man created the symbolic letter with his hand. 

I found this encounter strange but didn’t think too much of it and went about my day. Later on I was inclined to stop again when I noticed another odd sight in the street. An old lady in long, white robes was working fervently at a spinning wheel. Her face was obscured by a mess of unkempt, withering grey hair. Whilst she spun, I gawked at her technique. She was using only her forefinger and thumb, twisting them wildly, and I then realised it was because the rest of her fingers were severed stumps. The whole image looked ridiculous. She must have noticed me staring because she suddenly stopped and stared at me intensely. My heart nearly stopped. Then she slowly raised her thumb and forefinger to her head, where she made what I instantly recognised as that same “L” symbol. 

TL;DR: Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me, I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb, in the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead.","So I was walking down the street one day, when an oddly dressed man caught my attention.",6

The Manager says, ""Do you have any sales experience?""

The kid says ""Yeah. I was a vacuum salesman back in North Dakota .""

Well, the boss was unsure, but he liked the kid and figured he'd give him a shot, so he gave him the job. ""You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did.""

His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor. ""How many customers bought something from you today?""

The kid frowns and looks at the floor and mutters, ""One"".

The boss says ""Just one?!!? Our sales people average sales to 20 to 30 customers a day. That will have to change, and soon, if you'd like to continue your employment here. We have very strict standards for our sales force here in Florida . One sale a day might have been acceptable in North Dakota , but you're not on the farm anymore, son.""

The kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing him out on his first day. He asked (semi-sarcastically), ""So, how much was your one sale for?""

The kid looks up at his boss and says ""$101,237.65"".

The boss, astonished, says $101,237.65?!? What the heck did you sell?""

The kid says, ""Well, first, I sold him some new fish hooks. Then I sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 Expedition.""

The boss said ""A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and a TRUCK!?""

The kid said ""No, the guy came in here to buy tampons for his wife, and I said, 'Dude, your weekend's shot, you should go fishing.’",A young guy from North Dakota moves to Florida,1219

Morris and Esther agreed and up they went. The pilot did all kinds of fancy maneuvers, but not a word was heard. He did his daredevil tricks over and over again, but still not a word. When they landed, the pilot turned to Morris and said, “By golly, I did everything I could to get you to yell out, but you didn’t. I’m impressed!”

He tells everyone to get down and he demands the teller to empty the contents of the safe into his bag. The teller frantically does so and the bank robber tells him he'd best not call the police. The bank robber grabs his bag and just before he reaches the door, he trips on his shoe lace and his mask falls off! He gets up, puts the mask back on and realizes people must have seen his face. He lines up everyone in the bank and starts asking them if they saw his face. 

The first man is the teller, the robber asks: ""Did you see my face?"" The teller replies: ""Why yes sir I did."" BANG! The robber shoots the teller dead.

The robber moves to the next person, it is a man who was there to make a deposit before the weekend. The robber asks him the same question and the man replies: ""Yes sir but I won't tell a soul."" BANG! The robber shoots him dead as well.

I had never heard of it before and asked her what was so great about it. However she refused  to tell me why it was so good.

So we scheduled a visit for the following Sunday and when we arrived I realised why I’d never heard of it before. It was literally named ‘Day Spa’

When we arrived we were greeted by this pretty looking receptionist who checked us in and directed us to a dressing room to get changed into the spa provided dressing gowns.

We left our things in a nearby locker and walked deeper into the spa. At this point my friend has this huge grin on her face and finally decides to tell me why this place is so good.

She explains that there are 26 different rooms of treatment each labelled A-Z and each specialising in different treatments from foot rubs to full body massages to hot stones.

So we agreed to split up and meet back up in 2 hours.

The first room I go into is room A. It’s quiet, and the only thing in the room is a single seat with an A engraved on it as well as a curtain. 

So I sit down and almost instantly this beautiful woman pops out from behind the curtain and starts placing various hot towels on different parts of my body.

15 mins later she takes them away and I get off of the seat, thoroughly relaxed and a lot less tense.

Next I go into room F and, just like in room A there sits a single seat with the letter F engraved on it.

I take a seat and hear a clanking sound beneath me. Before I can wonder what it is, the floor suddenly sinks into a circular hole.

I was quite startled, that is until the hole started filling with warm water and the air was filled with a sweet, thick aroma.

‘Herbal bath’ I realised. ‘Not bad’

Another 30 minutes pass and I decide I want to try something else, so I go to stand up but at that moment the floor starts to rise again and the water sinks back into the floor. ‘Neat’ I think to myself.

I try a few other rooms and they’re all pretty similar at first glance with the seats being engraved with whatever room number they were in.

That is until is get to room O, where I see a big line has formed with people waiting excitedly at the door. 

I spot my friend at the end of the line and ask her why everyone’s so eager to get into this room.

She tells me that this is the best room in the entire day spa and that people sometimes book months in advance to reserve the seat.

After 30 minutes or so of queueing, it’s my friend’s turn, 5 minutes later she comes out with the most relaxed and calm look on her face. 

I ask her what happened but she just winks at me and said I’ll “find out”

I walk into the room and excitedly sit myself on seat O.

Suddenly, a team of masseuses walk out from behind the curtain and begin to massage all over my body. They use hot wax, stones, towels, and every type of lotion and ointment I can recognise, and many I can’t. The music is also stunning, with angelic choirs and lustrous saxophones playing softly in the back ground

5 minutes later I meet my friend outside and we leave the day spa, feeling utterly calm and relaxed.

About a week later, some other friends of mine are discussing ways they like to relax. One of them says that music helps her unwind, another says she uses walks through the forest.

They turn to me and ask what I use to relax.

I reply:

Day Spa, Seat O.",Everyone needs a little relaxation time once in a while [Long],6

They're a few days in to their vacation and they're about fed up with one another's company.

They do exactly that and what a wonder it did. On the final night, they gathered, both upbeat and cheerful, excited and eager to share their respective stories. They agree the best way to settle who goes first, is to flip a coin. Frank called heads as the coin reached the air, however it landed tails, and so Jim won, and would go first.

Jim began to speak, ""Frank, you won't believe the sights I saw. About 4 or 5 miles North from here is a beautiful lake, surrounded by the trees, offering the most extravagant view of the mountains. It was truly serene and peaceful. I felt as if I was one with nature, with God. I camped out of my tent every night to watch the stars, and every morning I was awakened by the beautiful songs of birds. We must do this again next year so I can show you!""

Frank was excited to hear this, nodding in agreement, ""Yes, absolutely. But I must say, I feel my experience was better.""

Jim laughed, ""Impossible!""

""No, it's true,"" replied Frank. ""I went about a mile South from here and while I found no serenity, I did happen upon a set of rail road tracks. Tied to these, was a woman whose beauty I had never before seen. I hastily untied her, rescuing her from the tracks, and I made love to her in every way you could possibly imagine! I only wish you had come with me, you could have had a turn as well!""

Jim's jaw dropped, he was astounded to hear that he had missed a chance to score. Regaining his composure, Jim asked, ""Every way imaginable?"" Frank nodded. ""Then,"" began Jim, ""How well could she suck dick?""

In those days, a few brave, strong men made their living by protecting common people from these beasts. This is a story about one such man named Erik and the adventure he had. 

There was a small village on the edge of a wide prairie, next to a very thick forest that led up into the cold, dark mountains. In these mountains lived the dreaded Medicrin. The Medicrin would stalk down from the mountains in the dead of night, sneak into the village, and snatch a sleeping villager. He would take the poor soul away and eat him for breakfast. This happened every week so you can imagine the villagers became quite tired of it. 

The terrified villagers called a meeting, and decided to hire the greatest hero around - Erik the Brave! 

Erik rode into town on his trusty steed, entered the city hall, and listened to the story the villagers told of the monster that attacked at night each week. When they were finished, Erik told them he would have a plan in the morning and he went to his hotel room. 

In his room, he consulted his Great Hero's Book of Vile Monsters, and found the chapter about the Medicrin. He learned that Medicrins stink like rotten eggs. He learned they have 6 fingers with long claws. He learned they never brush their teeth. He learned they have very good noses. And he learned they love to eat human flesh, but even more, they love to eat Loons. 

So, early the next morning, actually very, very early the next morning, Erik hunted high and low, near and far, to find a loon. He finally found one just before breakfast, captured it, tied it up, and brought it back to the village. He then told the villagers his plan. 
He had them dig a pit that was 20 feet deep (because the Medicrin was 9 feet tall) and 10 feet around. While they were digging, Erik tied a big rock to the leg of the loon, so it could not fly away. 
When the pit was finished, just about a half hour before sunset, Erik tossed in the rock, and of course the loon went in too. Then, he told the villagers to go to their homes while he waited for the Medicrin. 
Erik jumped in the bushes and waited with his great broadsword with which to slay the Medicrin. 

That night, the Medicrin snuck into the village . . . 
It smelled the loon . . . 
It came closer to the pit . . . 
But then it smelled DANGER, and it ran off. On the way out of the village, it grabbed one of the villagers for a snack. 

Needless to say, the villagers were not happy. Some demanded their money back, others wanted to throw Erik into the pit. After calming the villagers, the next day, Erik again consulted his Great Hero's Book of Vile Monsters, and learned more about the Medicrin. He learned it wore the same underwear for 3 weeks in a row. He learned it could not sing at all, but enjoyed listening to opera music. But, most importantly, he learned that Medicrins love sugar more than anything else in the world, even turnip-spinach surprise! 

So, Erik used some of the money the villagers had given him and rode his trusty steed to the next village, bought all the sugar he could carry and returned - this took two days because villages were far apart in those days. The next day, he rode to a different village and bought their sugar. The next day, he went to yet another village. It had now been a week and the Medicrin was due to come again this night. 
Erik gathered all this sugar and threw it into the pit. The loon, that was still stuck down in the pit, had not eaten in a week now and was extremely hungry. As fast as Erik could throw the sugar in the pit, the loon ate it up. It ate ALL the sugar! 

Erik was struck with panic, and ran to and fro trying to figure out what to do next, but night had fallen, and the Medicrin would be there soon, so Erik crossed his fingers, and hoped for the best. 

That night, the Medicrin came . . . 
It smelled the loon . . . 
It came closer to the pit . . . 
It smelled sugar . . . 
It came closer to the pit . . . 
It smelled DANGER and turned to run away. 
But, that smell of sugar was just too overpowering. 
It couldn't resist. 
The Medicrin ran up and dove down into the pit. 
And, it was trapped! 
Brave Erik leaped from behind the bush, raised his sword, and jumped down onto the Medicrin, driving his sword into its neck, and slew it. 

Which just goes to show: A loon full of sugar helps the Medicrin go down. ",The Medicrin Story - taken from a Boy Scouting website,10

The soldier stands up, and drops trow, exposing himself before his wife. Looking down, he says boldly, ""ATTEN-TION!"" and immediately his little soldier springs to life, standing firm. ""At-ease"", he commands, and suddenly, the little soldier slumbers limply.

After doing this several more times, the wife is mighty impressed, even amused by this trick, and asks to show the new neighbor who has moved in next door. The soldier, rather proud of himself and willing to show off, doesn't protest.

The wife rings their neighbor, telling them her husband has come home and wanting to show off his new skills he learned in the military. Not but a few moments later, there's a knock on the door and the wife, having answered, brings into the room where the soldier is standing exposed, the most outrageously gorgeous woman he has ever seen.

The wife prompts her husband to begin, and so he does. ""ATTEN-TION!"" Unsurprisingly, the little soldier snaps to life once again, as it did before. ""At-ease"", he says, but nothing happens. ""AT. EASE!"" He states, louder this time, but still, the little soldier does not budge from his post.

She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money.


After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office.

 
The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'.

 
The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money . The elderly woman replied that she made bets.
 

The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?'
 

The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.'

 
The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.           


The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?'


'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.'

 
'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 
 

'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently.


That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that way, up and down, turned it around, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.


The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square


The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.


The president was happy to oblige.
 

The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked  the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.'

The bear is thinking that if this fly would just drop 4 inches then the fish would jump out of the water, and I could have some supper.

A haggard voice replies, “It’s me...the blind guy.”

As soon as I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging from the railing!  By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him but he just wouldn't fall off! So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I was INCENSED so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge, and pushed it over the railing and it landed on him- killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony."" 

""Wow- that sounds like a pretty bad day to me, please enter in” said Saint Peter, and let the man in. 

The second man comes up and explains:

""Saint Peter- I have to tell you it's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I exercise out on my balcony. Well, this morning I lost my balance doing lunges and fell backward. When I went to grab the railing it gave way under my body weight, and I fell over the edge! Thankfully, the railing on the balcony below me was within reach as I was falling and by some stroke of luck I was able to reach out and grab it before falling to my death. I was so stunned and exhausted as much as I tried I couldn’t pull myself up. I hung there- exhausted, trying to get the energy to try again or the  breath to scream when suddenly this man throw open is sliding door and burst out onto the balcony, screaming like a maniac. I thought for sure I was saved, but instead he started beating and kicking me! I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my fingers and hands. Finally I just let go, deciding it would be better to die than to bear any more torture at the hands of this mad man. It may sound unbelievable but I swear to... you know... your boss... that I somehow fell into the bushes below- which broke my fall and saved my life!! I was stunned and exhausted, my hands had been beaten to a bloody pulp- every finger broken and twisted... but I was ALIVE! Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this REFRIGERATOR comes falling out of the sky and crushes me, instantly! ... and well... now I'm here."" 

St. Peter was amazed at the story and immediately conceded that his grisly story sounded like a very horrible death. 

As the third man came to the front of the line,  St. Peter again explained that heaven was full and asked for his story. 

""Ok... picture this,"" says the third man, ""You’re hiding naked in a refrigerator..."" ",Three men were standing in line...,12
