The top was down, the breeze was blowing through what was left of his hair and he decided to see what the engine had. As the needle jumped up to 80 mph, he suddenly saw flashing red and blue lights behind him.

“There’s no way they can catch a BMW,” he thought to himself and opened her up further. The needle hit 90, then 100, and finally reality hit him and he knew he shouldn’t run from the police, so he slowed down and pulled over.

The cop came up to him, took his license without a word and examined it and the car. “It’s been a long day, this is the end of my shift and it’s Friday the 13th. I don’t feel like more paperwork, so if you can give me an excuse for your driving that I haven’t heard before, you can go.”

The guy thinks for a second and says, “Last week my wife ran off with a cop. I was afraid you were trying to give her back.”

“Have a nice weekend,” said the officer and he walked away.

The bishop decided that he would conduct the interviews personally and went up into the belfry to begin the screening process. After observing several applicants demonstrate their skills, he decided to call it a day when a lone, armless man approached him and announced that he was there to apply for the bellringers job. The bishop was incredulous.

""You have no arms!""

""No matter,"" said the man, ""observe!""

He then began striking the bells with his face, producing a beautiful melody on the carillon. The bishop listened in astonishment, convinced that he had finally found a suitable replacement for Quasimodo.

Suddenly, rushing forward to strike a bell, the armless man tripped, and plunged headlong out of the belfry window to his death in the street below. The stunned bishop rushed to his side.

When he reached the street, a crowd had gathered around the fallen figure, drawn by the beautiful music they had heard only moments before. As they silently parted to let the bishop through, one of them asked, ""Bishop, who was this man?""

""I don't know his name,"" the bishop sadly replied, ""but his face rings a bell.""

The following day, despite the sadness that weighed heavily on his heart due to the unfortunate death of the armless campanologist (now there's a trivia question for you), the bishop continued his interviews for the bellringer of Notre Dame. The first man to approach him said, ""Your excellency, I am the brother of the poor, armless wretch that fell to his death from this very belfry yesterday. I pray that you honour his life by allowing me to replace him in this duty.""

The bishop agreed to give the man an audition but, as the armless man's brother stooped to pick up a mallet to strike the first bell, he groaned, clutched at his chest and died on the spot. Two monks, hearing the bishop's cries of grief at this second tragedy, rushed up the stairs to his side. ""What has happened?"" the first breathlessly asked, ""Who is this man?""

""I don't know his name,"" sighed the distraught bishop, ""but he's a deadringer for his brother.""

But another tragedy took place on that same ship on this same date.

Along with the souls aboard the HMS Titanic bound for New York,

She carried in her belly a massive shipment of gourmet Mayonnaise from France.

The Mayonnaise was bound for the eastern port of Tampico, Mexico.

Then, the unthinkable happened.

And while history remembers the lives lost on that fateful day,

The proud Mexican people will forever remember that day as…….

The father looks at his son, ""Ok, Bernard..."" and the son steps forward and starts to sing the Star Spangled Banner. His voice is absolutely angelic and the agent, not one for sentimentality, can't help but be mesmerized by the boy's singing. ""By the dawn's early light...""

The father whistles and the family dog, a large labradoodle, jumps up on the boys head. The boy strains but his voice remains even and gorgeous, ""Whose broad stripes and bright stars...""

Without any cue, the mother jumps up on the boys outstretched left arm. Still the boy's voice never waivers ""And the rocket's red glare...""

The agent can't believe his eyes, the kid is holding up his mother, balancing the dog on his head, and still singing so beautifully when the father does a short hop and lands on the boy's outstretched right arm. ""That our flag was still there...""

As the boy strains to hold the weight of both his parents and the family dog, he starts into the final, rousing lines and is still singing flawlessly. ""For the land of the free...""

Suddenly, the father calls out the the daughter, ""Hillary, big finish!"" at which point the daughter punctuates that final line by kicking the fuck out of the boy's crotch.

A little known fact is that back in 1912, Hellmann’s mayonnaise was manufactured in England. In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico but as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York.

The ship hit an iceberg and sank and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day.

The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5 and is known, of course, as Sinko de Mayo.",Sinko da mayo,2

There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""

The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost.

When they arrive at the gates of heaven, there is a man standing there. He says, ""There is only one more space in heaven, so whoever has the best story of how they died gets to enter.""

So the first man tells his story:
""I was heading home from work. I was really tired, and ready to see my wife again. When I arrived at my apartment, I noticed that my door was locked. Strange. My wife usually leaves it unlocked. I'm about to unlock it, when I hear a man's voice inside. I instantly panic, and instinctively charge into the door, which surprisingly breaks off the wall. I run inside and look around for the man, when I see a pair of hands on the windowsill. I run over to them and pound on them, until the man falls. I see him bounce off of a balcony below, and land in a bush. I see him move again. I am so angry that he is still alive that I tear my fridge out of the wall and throw it down at him. I am so happy that he is dead that I have a heart attack and die.""

Now the second man tells his story:
""So I was washing windows, when some crazy dude starts pounding on my hands! I'm forced to let go, and I bounce off of a balcony and land in a bush and survive! I was so happy! But hen a fridge falls out of the maniac's windows and crushes me. That's how I died.""

And finally, the third man starts to tell his story:
""...so I was hiding in this fridge...""",3 men die.,2

The idea is simple, put a small group of people on an island each with their own strengths and weaknesses and see how they work together in isolation. 

For the first experiment they decide that they'll need someone who can build. This will be the backbone of the community and this person will be charge of designing and fabricating the structures on the island. For this they turned to the Germans, and they recruited a random German woman. 

Next they needed someone who was skilled in the culinary arts. They continued down this stereotyping path and settled on picking a random French man from the streets of Paris. He would be in charge of providing nutrition for he inhabitants of this island. 

Finally, before they could continue down his experiment they noted the immense amount of materials and equipment that they would leave on the island. They needed someone who could manage and account for everything. They needed someone who was good with numbers. Again in true stereotypical fashion they turned to China and picked a random Chinese man to volunteer for the study.

With this small group, the researchers decided it was time to do a pilot study. They picked a small uninhabited island in the pacific and dropped the three volunteers. Giving each person their title: The German was in charge of engineering, the Frenchman in charge of cooking, and the Chinese man was in charge of supplies. 


They departed the island to leave the three in total isolation to return in three months. 

Three months passed and they have come back. The researchers start onto the island and make it about 20 meters into the jungle to be met with a 10m wall. They notice it stretches through the brush disappearing into the jungle. It is then the thin German girl sticks her head out and greets them. 
""Gutten tag! Come on in! The door is just to your right. ""

They come in and see the compound is vast with reinforcements to protect against the harsh tropical storms. A strong breeze comes through bringing with it the smell of fresh bread. They follow it to a underground kitchen where the Frenchman is cooking up a storm. 

Fresh baked crab legs, coconut pies, and various other baked goods are coming out of the oven. The researchers note how the two have thrived in this harsh environment. 

""But, where is the Jin, the man from China?"" They ask Pierre the Frenchman. 

""I do not know! Come to think of it I haven't seen him since we landed here three months ago. I think he's been working with Frida building up the compound.""

They go to the German woman who states that she's been working along since they got there. She's been so busy these fast few months she just goes down grabs a quick bite from the kitchen and continues working. 

Fearing the worst they decide to cancel the test. They call in for a search party to scour the island, but it's been so long there is little hope that they will find him alive. 

The search party leaves the compound and gets about 50 meters from the jungle when Jin jumps down from the canopy screaming ""SUPPLIES!!""

On the bar, he see a jar full of money, all twenties. On it it says ""Win this jar of Money! Just ask the Bartender."" He asks, ""Hey, what's up with this jar?""

""Oh, well you have three tasks I would need you to finish and you can win all that money, with a small donation to the jar, of course."" explained the Bartender.

""Well, what are they?""
""First, you see that bouncer over there. Go punch him."" This guys was huge, like Kevin Nash big.  

""You are crazy."" he laughed

""Second, there is a dog in the bed of my buddies truck, he has a horrible tooth ache and I need you to pull it out."" Our guest looks outside and see's the meanest looking dog he has ever seen. Foam out of that mouth and all.

""That is just plain stupid."" Our guest exclaimed

""Last, this regular of mine, a real nice old dame."" the bartender point to the end of the bar at this old, decrepit shrew that had to be in her late 80's. ""Go fuck her.""

""DUDE! that's just gross! No way.""

So after awhile and quite a few drinks, he stares at the very large jar of money and decided to try. He donates to the jar and takes a shot, goes up to the bouncer and punches him as hard as he could. Obviously, he gets his ass beat.

He comes back to the bar with a bloody nose and asks for a couple more shots. Now being completely piss-drunk and with whatever bravery he has, he ventured out to help the dog. You hear barking outside and a loud yelp and him screaming. 

Our guest comes back inside with a bloody arm and ripped clothes and asks ""Alright, where's the old lady with the sore tooth.""",Win this jar of money!,7

For every revolutionary with a rifle, or every two revolutionaries without a rifle, the dictator hires a mercenary.

Egyptians don't talk much but they agree to help. “Just call us 1 week before the elections and let us inside the Federal Elections HQ. And don't disturb us for 48 hours prior to the announcement of official results.”

The son was working at his part-time job at a pizza place. The dad, at home, said, ""I have an idea."" He laid out a handful of hundred dollar bills, a Bible, and a bottle of whiskey

His wife said, ""what's this for?"" 
The husband, ""This will give us an idea of what path our son will take. If he takes the money, he's going to be a successful businessman. If he takes the Bible, he's going to be a preacher. But, if he takes the Whiskey, our son will be a deadbeat drunkard.""

With the son coming home any minute, the couple hid in the closet to see which item their son will choose.

The son comes home, sees the items lying on the table. He grabs the wad of cash, skims through it, and puts it in his pocket. He grabs the Bible, skims through it for a good while, and puts it in his back pocket. He grabs the bottle of whiskey, opens it, smells the aroma as if it were a fine wine, then drinks half the bottle and takes it with him as he leaves the room.

""Now what?"" The wife asked. ""Our son took them all!""

""It's even worse than I thought,"" the father replied. ""He's going to be a politician!""

Realizing this would probably be the only hotel on the deserted road he traveled, he parked his car and ran inside. He asked the girl at the front desk if she had a room. ""I'm sorry but we seemed to be all booked up"" she told him. The man pleaded with the girl and she told him that she had one room, but he had to promise her that he wouldn't look under the rug. The man quickly promised and ran up to the room. He got into his pajamas and went into his bed. He was so tired but he couldn't fall asleep. He kept wondering what it is that was so horrible that was under the rug. After a long time of deliberating with himself, he decided it would be best to look under the rug so he could go to sleep. He got out of bed and very slowly and carefully lifted the rug. Under the rug there was a trap door. ""Oh okay, so thats what is under the rug, a trap door."" He put the rug over the door and went back to bed.

After a while, he found himself wondering what was through the trap door. He couldn't fall asleep without knowing so he lifted up the rug and opened the trap door very carefully. He saw a long stairway that seemed to go on forever. ""So there is a stairway in the trap door."" He told himself. He closed the trap door, put the rug back down and went back into bed. But, he wondered, what is at the bottom of the stairs?

So the man lifted the rug, opened the trap door and walked down the stairs. He walked for days and days and days until he finally reached the end. At the end of the stairs was a desert. So there is a desert at the end of the stairs, he thought. He walked back up the stairs for days and days and days, closed the trap door and put the rug back over it. But, he wondered, what was at the other side of the desert?

So the man lifted the rug, opened the trap door and walked down the stairs for days and days and days, crossed the desert for weeks and weeks and weeks until he came to an ocean. So there is an ocean at the end of the desert, he thought. So the man crossed the desert for weeks and weeks and weeks, walked back up the stairs for days and days and days, closed the trap door and put the rug back over it. But, he thought, what is on the other side of the ocean?

So the man lifted the rug, opened the trap door and walked down the stairs for days and days and days, crossed the desert for weeks and weeks and weeks, swam across the ocean for months and months and months until he reached a jungle. So there is a jungle at the other end of the ocean, he thought. So the man swam back across the ocean for months and months and months, crossed the desert for weeks and weeks and weeks, walked back up the stairs for days and days and days, closed the trap door and put the rug back over it. But what is in the jungle, he wondered.

So the man lifted the rug, opened the trap door and walked down the stairs for days and days and days, crossed the desert for weeks and weeks and weeks, swam across the ocean for months and months and months, took out a machete he just happened to keep in his back pocket and hacked through the jungle for years and years and years until he found a giant tree. The tree seemed to go on forever. So, he thought, there is a giant tree in the jungle. The man got out a machete he just happened to keep in his back pocket and hacked through the jungle for years and years and years swam back across the ocean for months and months and months, crossed the desert for weeks and weeks and weeks, walked back up the stairs for days and days and days, closed the trap door and put the rug back over it. But what was up the tree?

So the man lifted the rug, opened the trap door and walked down the stairs for days and days and days, crossed the desert for weeks and weeks and weeks, swam across the ocean for months and months and months, took out a machete he just happened to keep in his back pocket and hacked through the jungle for years and years and years until he found the giant tree and he climbed the tree for hours and hours and hours until he reached the top. At the top he found a pink monkey in lotus position with it's eyes closed, meditating. Next to the monkey was a giant neon sign that read ""Don't Touch The Monkey!"". So, he thought, there is a pink monkey at the top of the tree. The man climbed down the tree for hours and hours and hours, got out a machete he just happened to keep in his back pocket and hacked through the jungle for years and years and years swam back across the ocean for months and months and months, crossed the desert for weeks and weeks and weeks, walked back up the stairs for days and days and days, closed the trap door and put the rug back over it. But, he thought, what happens when you touch the monkey?

So the man lifted the rug, opened the trap door and walked down the stairs for days and days and days, crossed the desert for weeks and weeks and weeks, swam across the ocean for months and months and months, took out a machete he just happened to keep in his back pocket and hacked through the jungle for years and years and years until he found the giant tree and he climbed the tree for hours and hours and hours until he reached the top. When he reached the top he went up to the monkey and very slowly and softly touched the monkey on the nose with one finger. The monkey opened one, big red blood shot eye. Then it opened another big, red, bloodshot eye. It just stared at him. The man got vvery scared and started to climb down the tree as fast has he could for hour and hour and hours. The monkey just jumped from branch to branch. The man took out a machete he just happened to keep in his back pocket and hacked through the jungle for years and years and years as fast has he could. The monkey swung from vine to vine. The man swam as fast as he could across the ocean for months and months and months. The monkey took a jet ski. The man ran across the desert for weeks and weeks and weeks. The monkey drove his jeep. The man ran up the stairs for days and days and days. The monkey took the elevator. The man slammed the trap door closed and covered it with the rug, hoped back into bed and pulled the covers over his head.

He stayed like that for a long time but he couldn't help but wonder what was happening. So he slowly pulled the covers down and saw the monkey levitating in lotus position with both big, red, bloodshot eyes looking straight at him. The monkey reached out one finger and came as close as it could to him. He touched the man ever so slightly with one finger and shouted

One has a cross in front of him; the other one the Star of David. Many people go by and look at both beggars, but only put money into the hat of the beggar sitting behind the cross.

A priest comes by, stops and watches throngs of people giving money to the beggar behind the cross, but none give to the beggar behind the Star of David.

Finally, the priest goes over to the beggar behind the Star of David and says, ""My poor fellow, don't you understand? This is a Catholic country; this city is the seat of Catholicism. People aren't going to give you money if you sit there with a Star of David in front of you, especially when you're sitting beside a beggar who has a cross. In fact, they would probably give to him just out of spite.""

The beggar behind the Star of David listened to the priest, turned to the other beggar with the cross and said: ""Moishe, look who's trying to teach the Goldman brothers about marketing.""",A tale of 2 Beggars,7

The writer is confused, but smells a story brewing; a strong one at that. He hoofs it up to the bar, passing most other patrons on their way out, and slaps a whole dollar bill on the table, ""Barkeep, give me a beer and a story, and you can keep the change.""

After taking a quick glance at the clock, the bartender shakes his head, pours the beer, and pushes the bill back to the reporter. ""The drink is on the house, but I suggest you drink it quick and leave. Wild Bill is coming to town."" Without another word the 'tender puts his last glass away and walks right out the swinging doors, leaving the reporter in an empty bar.

Now fear in his gut tears at him as he hears the emptiness in that bar. This emptiness seems to seep in as he realizes that he's about to be the last man in this town, alone with only the sound of that ticking clock to keep him company. Still, a story of this caliber must be worth something; so he waits...

Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, Bong&lt;CRACK!&gt;- Just as the clock strikes the first chime of twelve, a sound like thunder splitting a mountain is heard outside. The reporter runs to the doors to see what it is. In the distance and closing fast is a tornado coming right for the bar. The reporter hits the ground and watches as the tornado comes up to the bar and stops.

The wind settles and there is a giant of a man riding a grizzly bear. He steps off the bear, and instead of hitching it, he punches the great beast right in the face &lt;WHAM!&gt;, knocking it cold on the ground.

The reporter is so scared he runs back into the bar and dives behind the counter, sure that this is the last of his days. &lt;KaPLOW!&gt; the giant kicks in the saloon doors, and they turn to splinters that imbed themselves into the walls and break bottles and glasses that they touch.

The man walks up to the bar, breaking every floor board with each thundering step. He looks down at the reporter and slams his fist on the bar, cracking it down the middle, ""GIMME A DRINK!""

The reporter comes up, shakily holding out two bottles of whisky; which the giant snatches up, chews the glass tops off of, and drinks down as fast as the amber liquid can spill from the bottles. He throws both bottles in the air, whips out his six-shooter and fires off a round. The single bullet rips through both bottles showering the reporter with shards that rain down.

Regretting his curiosity and repenting of his life, the reporter stands on weakened legs and whimpers out, ""W-w-w-would y-you like a-another drink?""

The man turns to him, fire in his eyes, then glances at the clock... ""Nah, I gotta go. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""",Wild Bill,3

post,6950jr,2qh72,jokes,false,1493865916,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6950jr/roman_jews/,self.jokes,,"Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to 
convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from 
the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal: he'd have a 
religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community. If the Jews 
won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert 
or leave. 

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent 
them in the debate. However, as the rabbi spoke no Italian, and the 
Pope spoke no Yiddish, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate. 

On the chosen day the Pope and rabbi sat opposite each other. 
The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The rabbi looked back and raised one finger. 
Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. 
The rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat. 
The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. 
The rabbi pulled out an apple. 
With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that 
the rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy.

Later the Cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. 
The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the 
Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there 
is still only one God common to both our faiths. 
Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all 
around us. The rabbi responded by pointing to the ground to show that 
God was also right here with us. 
I pulled out the wine and host to show that through the perfect 
sacrifice Jesus has atoned for our sins, but the rabbi pulled out an 
apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and 
I could not continue.""

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he'd won. 
""I haven't a clue,"" said the rabbi. ""First, he told me that we had 
three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. 
Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews 
but I told him emphatically that we were staying right here."" 
""And then what?"" asked a woman.

We decided to help pull it out so we hooked a chain to the tractor trailer and hooked the other end to one of the trucks we sell.  But our truck just got stuck in the mud and spun its wheels spraying mud everywhere.  So to get both trucks out we got another truck and hooked it into the first one and tried pulling both out.  It just spun its wheels and sprayed mud all over the first truck.  So we got yet another truck and hooked it in and it also got stuck. Finally, all the salesmen and some customers had hooked up a line of 10 trucks all trying to pull out the tractor trailer.  We started the whole line of trucks and revved them up all at the same time.  But unfortunately all the trucks got stuck and spun their wheels and sprayed mud all over the trucks.  The moral of this story is, you can't get any traction with a dirty pickup line.",Working at the car dealership.,9

Two beggars in London
Ali and Habib are beggars. They beg in different areas of London ...
Habib begs just as long as Ali does, but only collects £2 to £3 every day.
Ali brings home a suitcase FULL of £10 notes, drives a Mercedes, lives in a mortgage-free house and has a lot of money to spend.
Habib asks Ali :- 'I work just as long and hard as you do but how is it that you bring home a suitcase full of £10 notes every day?'
Ali says, 'Look at your sign, what does it say'?
Habib's sign reads 'I have no work, a wife and 6 kids to support'.
Ali says No wonder you only get £2- £3
Habib says... 'So what does your sign say'?
Ali shows Habib his sign.... It reads,
'I only need another £10 to move back to Pakistan'.",Two Pakistani beggars in London,20

One day, the dog was strolling through the forest when he encountered a bear. Delighted, the dog asked the bear to convert him into bearhood. 

The bear thought about it for a bit and agreed. He'd help the dog become a bear. 

He skinned an old bear that had just died and dressed the dog in the bear skin. He offered the dog an important piece of advice - whatever you do and wherever you go, always remember that us bears are not like you dogs who greet each other's ass! Us bears kiss each other on the face! 

And so the dog-turned-bear and the bear parted ways. The dog-turned-bear became very good at greeting each and every bear with the traditional bear hug and kiss on the face. 

One day, the dog-turned-bear meets up with the original bear. He's about to greet him with the traditional bear hug and kiss on the face when the bear tells him...

Listen here buddy, I know who you are, you can kiss my ass! ",There was once a dog who wanted to be a bear....,10

They were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny, silver walls that could move apart and then slide back together again.
The boy asked, ""What is this Father?""
The father (never having seen an elevator) responded, ""Son, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I don""t know what it is.""
While the boy and his father were watching with amazement, a fat old lady in a wheel chair moved up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened, and the lady rolled between them into a small room. 
The walls closed, and the boy and his father watched the small numbers above the walls light up sequentially.
They continued to watch until it reached the last number, and then the numbers began to light in the reverse order.
Finally the walls opened up again and a gorgeous 24-year-old blond stepped out.
The father, not taking his eyes off the young woman, said quietly to his son...
""Go get your Mother.""

""Alrighty,"" says the little boy, ""my turn!""

The little boy then takes his fiddle and whacks the devil on the head numerous times.

So Jesus wandered into a second house and asked for water. He was again politely greeted by family. He once again told that he was Jesus and how his father sent him back to see how his folks are getting along. Next thing he knew he was kicked out on the curb and called crazy bastard.

It was getting late and he wandered into the third house where a guy was smoking a joint. He asked Jesus to sit down and offered him a nice big puff. Then he smiled and said: ""Now hows that? So stranger, whats your name?"". Jesus said: ""Jeeessuuusss"". The guy smiled again and said: ""I told you this was some good shit!""
