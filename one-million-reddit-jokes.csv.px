One year, he excitedly arrives, and stumbles upon a small new booth with an old carney sitting behind it. Two apples sit on the table; one labeled ""Cotton Candy"", and one labeled ""Watermelon"". 

The man approached the booth and asked, ""What is this?"" 

""I can make apples taste like anything."" 

The man was skeptical. ""I don't know, that seems kinda far fetched."" 

""Well, here, go ahead and try one,"" the carney said, handing him the apple labeled ""cotton candy.""

The man takes a bite, and with a big smile, says, ""Holy shit, that tastes like cotton candy!"" 

The carney offers him another, with the same result. The man is in awe, tasting apples that taste just like watermelon, apple pie, chocolate cake, anything he asks for. After some time has passed, the carney leans over, and says, 

""You know, if you'd like, I've even got one that tastes like pussy.""

The man hesitates. ""...Really?"" 

""Sure do. Wanna try?""

The man looks around, and figures, why not? So the carney reaches deep down to the bottom of his basket, and hands a plump red apple over to the man. 

The man takes a bite, and immediately starts coughing, and spitting out bits of apple. 

""Man, this tastes like shit!"" He exclaims.

For lunch the old man made hamburgers. Again, Larry was concerned about the plates as it appeared to have tiny specks around the edge that looked like dried egg and asked, “Are you sure these plates are clean?”

Without looking up the old man said, “I told you before, those dishes are as clean as cold water can get them. Now don’t you worry, I don’t want to hear another word about it”.

Later that afternoon, as he was leaving, his grandfather’s dog started to growl, and wouldn’t let him pass. Larry yelled and said, “Grandfather, your dog won’t let me get to my car”.

Without diverting his attention from the football game he was watching on TV, the old man shouted, ‘COLDWATER, GO LAY DOWN NOW, YEH HERE ME!!!”",As Clean As Cold Water Can Get Them,5

There are twenty-six different types of tubes, because there are equally many types of robots, and every type of robot needs a special tube, otherwise there will be compatability problems. Every tube thus has a different kind of rail embedded in it that the robots can attach their feet to. Furthermore, every type of tube is labelled with a letter of the alphabet, as there happened to be exactly as many types of robots as there are letters in the alphabet. Thus, there is the A-tube, the B-tube, etc.  
  
But some very advanced and rich robots have the ability to switch their feet; they can buy different types of feet that can make them compatible with all the different tubes.  
  
One such robot became obsessed with this and started building a collection of feet. When he had obtained all twenty-six types of feet, a documentary maker became interested in his story. He filmed him wearing his feet in all the different tubes and interviewed him on his motivations.  
  
Some time later, the finished documentary appeared on the robot video website. The feet collector went to the site and opened the video, that had appeared on his home screen. Just as it reached the segment in which they were in the U-tube, his brother walked in and asked him what he was doing.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

A blonde decided to get over her fear of horses and go horseback riding. She located a horse, payed, and started riding. At first it seemed gentle enough, everything was going well, and she thought this is nothing, I can do this! 

After a little bit, the horse started going faster and it got a bit bumpy, but she was enjoying the thrill of the ride! Suddenly it really sped up. It took all her strength to hang on. Eventually she slipped from the saddle but a piece of her clothing got caught. She was stuck upside-down. Her head started smashing on the ground and she started losing consciousness.

He was intelligent, and a great kid. He always wanted to help people out. One day, there was new club at his school in which students could give a tour to new students, so that they would understand how the school worked. Xavier signed up. A week later, a new student arrives and Xavier is told to give him a tour of the school. He is excused from class and goes to the main office, and he meets the new kid. He is massively overweight and seems dangerous. The principal greets the two children.

""Xavier Damian, meet Chad Thompson"" he said.

They shook hands, and Chad nearly broke Xavier's.

The principal handed Chad his schedule and then they both left. Chad's first class was science, so he walked with him over there. Chad looked shady, like he was ready to attack. In science, they were having a test on photosynthesis. They had to write the equation, balanced equation, and prove it using a REP table. When they were done, their teacher told them to hand their quizzes to someone else. Xavier and Chad switched their tests. Xavier saw that Chad only put the equation. He did not balance it, nor use a REP table. 

""Ok, I want you to correct your partner's work with a red pen, and when you are done correcting their work, write your initials on top."" the teacher said.

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

This was a man who had dodged a snipers bullet in the Falklands, had survived many armed patrols in Northern Ireland. A man who had walked away from a high speed motorbike crash.


At the hospital, just before he went, he beckoned me toward him, he couldn't speak due to the pipes and tubes so I moved closer as he pointed at his mouth. I said I didn't know what he wanted and asked if he could write, he nodded vigorously so I passed him some paper from his bedside cabinet and took the pen from my pocket. Unfortunately, as he was writing, he stopped, the machine that he was attached to started to make that ominous monotone that tells you its all over.


The paper dropped from his hand as the nurses rushed in and tried in vain to revive him but all to no avail, he now knew all the answers to all the questions ever asked, including the ultimate. I returned to my bike in the car park with heavy heart, trying to avoid looking into the faces of the mixed patients, visitors and hospital workers. I got to the bike without breaking up, and, as I fumbled for my keys I rediscovered the note from the recently deceased. By now it was all crumpled up so I attempted to iron it out on the petrol tank.


It just looked gibberish so I returned it to my coat pocket. I have now got home and was about to throw it away but the though hit me, it might be some sort of final message with hidden importance, there are no spaces between the words, it just appears to be a jumble of letters. I decided to share it on reddit to see if anyone could decipher it, I never was any good at anagrams or conundrums so here it is in its entirety (I'm not sure whether or not he finished before he shuffled from our mortal coil ) it says ""GETOFFMYFXXXXXXOXYGENPIPEYOUFATTWA""",Sad Times,7

He then gathers up his belongings and leaves the plane. The second person does the same thing and so do all others. The flight attendant is absolutely livid. Finally, the last Jew in the group walks up to him and says.

""We have all been very impressed with your wonderful service. So to show our gratitude, on behalf of everyone in my group, I present a check for $5,000.""

Three guys crash land on an island. Immediately they are captured by the indigenous tribal people. It becomes clear that these people are cannibals. The men beg for their lives, as anyone  would. Through a bunch of hand-waving, drawing pictures in the sand, etc the men learn of a ritual the tribal people let prisoners perform in a chance to save their lives. 

First, the men are sent out into the jungle to collect 10 pieces of any fruit they find. So off they go. 

The first guy comes back with 10 oranges. The tribe chief explains that now he must put all 10 pieces of fruit up his ass without making any noise. The guy gets to like one and a half before he cries out in pain. He's immediately killed and eaten. 

The second guy comes back with grapes. The chief explains the next challenge to the guy. He gets to 9 grapes and he laughs. The tribe kills and eats him right there on the spot. 

The first two guys meet up at the pearly gates. The first guys asks the second: ""what happened? you were almost home free!""

The second guy replies: ""yeah, I know... but right as I was almost done I saw the third guy coming back with pineapples.""

EDIT: I apologize to anyone annoyed at this being a repost. I've not been on Reddit long enough to have a feel for what's been said before. I confessed I didn't come up with this one, just thought it was a funny one. It came up because at work recently we were talking about how it seems like no one tells jokes anymore and how it's usually just telling other people about funny things we've seen online lately.",Three guys stranded on an island,2134

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.
Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.
""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked!

So the amazing thing about this gardener is that he always knows exactly how many bags of mulch he needs for a job, just by looking. Like he gets it right, every time. He's the best.
So one day, he looks at a yard he's working on and he's like... 18 bags. So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags of mulch and goes to work. 
And when he's finished, the flower beds are amazing! Beautiful roses, beautiful lillies and beautfil orchid bushes.

But there's one problem, he still has 1 bag of mulch left. He can't believe it! This has never happened before.
Well, the extra bag of mulch drives him crazy, because he's THE GUY who always gets the right amount of mulch!

He's like... aaaH! Extra mulch! Oh no!

So... on the drive home, he throws the bag of mulch out the window, over the side of the freeway 101.

~
(Space out this time between jokes as much as possible when telling it)

So, there's this couple who just started dating and things are going really well. One day the girl finds an old box of love letters from her highschool boyfriend. 
She reads them and just loves how silly they are, the drama of young romance.
So on a whim, she sends the letters to her ex-boyfriend thinking he might find them funny too!

So that night she tells her current boyfriend about it and he loses his shit.
They get in a huge fight about it. He's all like, ""Why would you send your ex the old love letters! He's going to think you're still in love with him!
And she's like, ""Relax Brandon!"" (The current boyfriends name btw)

Now the night is ruined because Brandon is obsessed. He's like, ""That ex-boyfriend is going to come back for you, he knows where you live!""

So after dinner he drives her home, she lives in one of those big apartment buildings by the freeway and he walks her to her door.

But he forgets to lock the car, and leaves the windows down.

He kisses her goodnight, but things are kind of wierd. Then he gets back in his car and starts to drive away. 
But when he glances in his rear view mirror his blood turns cold. Guess what's in the back seat?

The bag of Mulch!",[Long] One of my favorite jokes from BoJack Horseman,5

The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people. The second kingdom is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power, too. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.
The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it’s a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armor and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armor and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.
The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and make merry, partying into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren’t as well off, but have their own supply of grog and also drink late into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.
The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hung over and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night, but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.
..and it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

post,5oeldj,2qh72,jokes,false,1484611852,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5oeldj/the_three_cheerio_worlds/,self.jokes,,"Once upon time in a land far, far away lived three Cheerio worlds: Perfect Cheerio World, Mediocre Cheerio World, and Non-perfect Cheerio World. Anybody who was anybody wanted to reside in Perfect Cheerio World, but unfortunately only the lucky few got the honor of living in Perfect Cheerio World. In Non-perfect Cheerio World there was a Cheerio named Joe. Non-perfect Cheerio Joe was a regular person just like you and me. Day in and day out though he wished for a better world to live in. He believed he deserved the chance to experience Perfect Cheerio World because he worked his Cheerio butt off 24/7.
One night when Non-perfect Cheerio Joe was on his way home from work, a Cheerio Genie visited him. The Cheerio Genie had noticed Non-perfect Cheerio Joe's constant dedication to his job, friends, and family and thought that he deserved a little loving himself. The Cheerio Genie allowed Non-perfect Cheerio Joe to have one wish. Non-perfect Cheerio Joe wished that he could go to Perfect Cheerio World for a day. The Cheerio Genie, being the good cheerio that he is, granted Non-perfect Cheerio Joe his wish.
Come Saturday morning after a long week at the office, Non-perfect Cheerio Joe awoke in a place unfamiliar to him. He knew immediately that he was in Perfect Cheerio World. A Perfect Cheerio soon approached him. Oh how Non-perfect Cheerio Joe was envious of this cheerio. He wasn’t cracked or broken and looked like he had taken a nice dip in Skim Milk. A world with Skim Milk? Non-perfect Cheerio Joe was jealous, that’s for sure. The Perfect Cheerio introduced himself and coincidentally his name was Joe as well. What are the odds?
Perfect Cheerio Joe started to tell Non-perfect Cheerio Joe about all the fun and exciting things that Perfect Cheerio World has to offer. Perfect Cheerio Joe offered to be Non-perfect Cheerio Joe’s tour guide for the day. “First things first,” Perfect Cheerio Joe said, “We must go get some breakfast!”
Perfect Cheerio Joe and Non-perfect Joe walked into a little café and went to the front of the line. The cashier politely told them that they had to wait at the back of the line. “Where’s that?” Non-perfect Cheerio Joe asked.
""Go five blocks down. Take three rights, and two lefts, and then six more rights. Then one more left and then you’ll reach the end of the line,"" said the cashier.
Perfect Cheerio Joe and Non-perfect Cheerio Joe obliged and waited on the long line to get their breakfast. Next, Perfect Cheerio Joe said that Non-perfect Cheerio Joe had to go to the National Cheerio Museum. Non-perfect Cheerio Joe loved museums so he happily agreed. When they arrived at the National Cheerio Museum, they first had to purchase tickets to see some exhibits. They walked up to the ticket booth where they were told to head to back of the line. “Where’s that?” Non-perfect Cheerio Joe asked.
""Go five blocks down. Take three rights, and two lefts, and then six more rights. Then one more left and then you’ll reach the end of the line.""
Although the line was long, Non-perfect Cheerio Joe was ecstatic because he got to see the first Cheerio ever created. Perfect Cheerio Joe then recommended they go see a movie because Non-perfect Cheerio World doesn’t have any movie theaters. Non-perfect Cheerio Joe picked the movie, Unrequited Love for a Honey Nut Cheerio. Even Cheerios love romantic comedies. The movie theater was gorgeous and Non-perfect Cheerio Joe was so happy until they had to buy tickets for the movie and they had to go to the back of the line. “Where’s that?” Non-perfect Cheerio Joe asked.
""Go five blocks down. Take three rights, and two lefts, and then six more rights. Then one more left and then you’ll reach the end of the line.""
Once they were in the movie theater, Non-perfect Cheerio Joe knew that he couldn’t have the full movie experience without popcorn. He quickly left the theater during the previews and went to buy some popcorn. He was told to head to the back of the line. These long lines were really starting to bother Non-perfect Cheerio Joe, but he knew he was only here for a day so he had to experience it all. “Where’s the back of the line?” Nonperfect Cheerio Joe asked.
""It wraps around the theater, so head south on Strawberry Street. Then make two rights. Next walk two blocks down and make a left onto Grain Road, then you’ll be at the end of the line.""
Non-perfect Cheerio Joe hoped the popcorn would be worth it. Just as he sat down in his seat with his popcorn the movie was beginning. I know what luck! Damn previews. After the movie was finished, Perfect Cheerio Joe recommended going to a party so that Non-perfect Cheerio Joe could meet a bunch of Perfect Cheerios. Non-perfect Cheerio Joe loved all Cheerios so he was pumped! When they arrived outside of the party they had to wait in line to enter. Non-perfect Cheerio Joe was getting a wee bit frustrated when he asked where the end of the line was.
""Walk 1.37 miles. Then when you get to the fork in the road take a right. Then you need to make one right, one left, one right, and one left. After that you’ll be at the end of the line.""
Although Non-perfect Cheerio Joe was exhausted by the time they got into the party he was still ready to dance the night away. Non-perfect Cheerio Joe and Perfect Cheerio Joe headed straight to the dance floor and boogied all night. Two hours in, Non-perfect Cheerio Joe got thirsty. Perfect Cheerio Joe mentioned that the punch at this place was the bomb dot com. Non-perfect Cheerio Joe decided that without punch he would probably pass out. After waiting all day on so many lines Non-perfect Cheerio Joe knew what to expect. He walked up to the Cheerio serving the punch and said, “Where’s the punch line?”
The server looked at him confused, “There is no punch line.”",The Three Cheerio Worlds.,24

His parents were astounded, and as a result decided to name him Tractor Timothy. 

By the time Tractor Timothy was four, he was already piloting his parents' tractors across the fields. He still couldn't read or write, but he was driving the tractor just fine without any instruction manuals.

When Tractor Timothy was 8, he could disassemble, repair, and rebuild an entire tractor all by himself. He wasn't very bright at math, but tractors seemed to be his one god-given talent.

Later, when he enters middle school, Tractor Timothy meets his first love. They start going out, but eventually she says that she can't handle all the tractors- there are too many, she's done, she's tired of hearing tractor sounds all day. Tractor Timothy is heartbroken, but eventually recovers and moves on.

Come high school, Tractor Timothy meets the love of his life, Tractor Tabitha. Tractor Tabitha loves tractors, just like Tractor Timothy, and everyone agrees that they are perfect for each other.

After graduating from college, Tractor Timothy takes the big leap and proposes to Tractor Tabitha. She agrees, and they get married. They have a large family with several kids.

Tractor Timothy decides to start his own tractor company by himself. Starting small, it grows and grows, until it becomes a tractor empire spanning the entire globe. He becomes a millionaire, and hosts all kinds of tractor events, like tractor stunting, tractor racing, etc.

However, one day, Tractor Tabitha tells him that she's done with tractors as well, and can't handle the constant vrooming of tractors  every day. She tells him to choose- between his tractors or her and their kids.

Tractor Timothy is in a terrible plight, and thinks about it constantly for days on end. Finally, he chooses her, and liquefies all of his assets in the tractor industry. He sells his tractors, sells his patents, everything.

Tractor Tabitha divorces him and takes everything.

She takes the money, she takes the kids, takes the house, and goes off on her own adventure. Tractor Timothy is left with nothing, except a few friends in the tractor business and the clothes on his back.

Devastated, Tractor Timothy goes into a bar one day to get a drink. One of his friends sees him, and decides to use this to earn some quick money.

Over in the corner of the bar, there are some Japanese Businessmen having a drink. The friend walks up to them and says, ""Hey, do you want to see something amazing? I'll bet you one million dollars that that guy over there"" he points to Tractor Timothy ""can suck up all the smoke in this bar and blow it out the window"".

The Japanese businessmen think he's insane. There's a ton of smoke in the bar, from all the cigarettes and things like that, filled up in every single nook and cranny. ""There's no way someone could suck up all that smoke"" they say. So they agree to the bet. One million dollars is on the table.

So the friend walks over to Tractor Timothy and says a few words to him. And Tractor Timothy gets up, takes a breath, and the sucks up all the smoke in the bar. He then walks over to the window and breathes it all out into the night.

The Japanese businessmen are dumbfounded. What are they going to tell their superiors at the company who ask them how they lost one million dollars? They as the friend, ""How did he do it? How did he get rid of all that smoke in just one breath?""

The friend smiles and says, ""Oh, he's an ex-tractor fan.""","In a farm in the middle of nowhere, a baby is born...",0

He repeated the operation three times, and returned home with $60. 

The man realised that he can survive this way, and started to go everyday earlier and return late. Thus, his money doubled or tripled everyday.

Shortly, he bought a cart, then a truck, then he had his own fleet of delivery vehicles. 5 years later, the man is one of the biggest food retailers in the US .

He started to plan his family's future, and decided to have a life Insurance. He called an insurance broker, and chose a protection plan.

When the conversation was concluded, the broker asked him his email. The man replied, ""I don't have an email.""

They were so confident that the weekend before the final they decided to go up to U Virginia and party with some friends up there. 

They had a great time, but were so hung-over that they overslept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Duke until late Monday morning. 

They rushed to their professor to give their excuses as to why they missed the final. They told him that they went up to UVA for the weekend, and had planned to come back in time, but that they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare and couldn't get help for a long time. 

The professor thought it over and then agreed that they could make up the final on the following day. The friends were relieved and very proud of their story. 

They studied that night and went in the next day to take the test. The professor placed them all in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin. 

The first problem was something simple about molarity and solutions and was worth 5 points. 

""Cool,"" they thought, ""this is going to be easy."" 

They did that problem and turned the page. They were unprepared, however, for the question they saw on the next page.

WHICH TIRE? (95 points)

The bike looks better than a new one, and although it is 10 years old. It's shiny and in mint condition.

He buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.

'Well, it's quite simple,' says the seller, 'Whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome.It protects it from the rain, and he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline. 

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. Naturally, they take the bike there.

Just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, 'I have to tell you something about my family.

'When we eat dinner, we don't talk. In fact, the FIRST person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.'

'No problem,' he says.. And in they go.

Joe is shocked.Right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.
In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks dirty dishes.

They sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.

As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.
He leans over and kisses Sandra.No one says a word.
He reaches over and fondles her breasts. Nobody says a word.
So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table and screws her, right there in front of her parents.

His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. She's got a great body too.

Joe grabs mom, bends her over the table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way. She has a big orgasm, &amp; Joe sits down.

His girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, &amp; Mom is beaming from ear to ear. But still ... Total silence.

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.

Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.

Suddenly the father shouts, ""OK, OK... I'll do the fuckin’ dishes!""",[NSFW] Joe wanted to buy a Harley motorcycle.,409

The witch doctor strokes his beard for a few moments. ""Wait here"" He says and goes into the back of his home. There flashes of light and echoing chants can be heard, right before the man gets ready to leave everything goes quiet. The witch doctor comes around with a small vial of clear liquid. 

""Now listen closely"" he says, ""you must only take one drop per night, when the vial is emptied you will no longer have any problems."" the man takes the vial and hands the witch doctor his payment. Hastily he takes down his number and goes home. Eager to do right by his wife.

The next night he takes another drop, to find the sex just as good. 

The next night he decides to try two drops. He and his wife have better sex.

The next night he decides ""screw what the witch doctor said"" and drinks the rest of the vial.

Now, Rick loved to ride his motorcycle, but was tired of driving up and down the same roads, day after day. 

One morning, he woke up, and decided to travel the world. So he saved up some money, got on a plane, along with his trusty Harley, and set out to explore the globe.

For the next few weeks, Rick spent his days riding to and through some of the most popular European cities like Paris, London, and Rome.

After seeing all Europe had to offer, he moved on to explore the rest of the world. 
Over the next few months, he rode through the African savannas, the deserts of Egypt, and even made it to the top of Mount Everest.

He was having the time of his life until he reached a small town in China. 
Unexpectedly, and out of nowhere, a beautiful Chinese maiden crossed his path, causing him to fly off and crash his motorcycle. 
Apologizing, the maiden offered Rick to pay for the repairs and a place to stay while they fixed his bike.
""My name is Yu! It's an honor to meet you!"" the beautiful maiden introduced herself to Rick. 

It turned out she was the daughter of a rich magistrate, so he spent the night in a small palace in the center of town. 
However, due to the scarcity of motorcycle parts, Rick had to spend several days in the palace, in the presence of Yu.
Over the next few days, she took a liking to him and his strange American ways. As expected, Rick took a liking to her, too.

The two quickly became inseparable, but Yu's father did not approve, for Rick was an outsider. 
By the time the motorcycle was finally up and running, Rick had fallen madly in love with Yu and refused to leave. 
Yu begged her father to let him stay, but instead, the Magistrate had Rick banished from the town. He warned him if he ever came back, he would have him beheaded.

Rick was devastated, he had no motivation to continue on the rest of his journey. It seemed as though there was nothing left for him in the world, if he didn't have his beloved Chinese maiden.


So he did the only thing any other sane guy would do....

*Rick rolled* back into town screaming,

*""I'm never gonna give Yu up!""*

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can't tell you because you're not a monk.",A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery...,20
