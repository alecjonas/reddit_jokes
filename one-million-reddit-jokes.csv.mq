Mr. Tilley knows everyone in town, and everyone knows him. When anyone sees him, they smile, wave, and say ""Blessed day, Mr. Tilley!"" To which he replied ""Every day is God's grace! Peace be with you!""

Mr. Tilley's book business has done so well that he was able to move into his own standalone building. He adores this as he can decorate the entire shop and lawn with imagery related to his faith. There are crosses, statues of the Virgin Mary and little white lambs, and more. It's tasteful and pleasing even for those of other faiths. 

As the years go by, other businesses start opening factories, mechanical shops, and other noisey ventures nearby, so Mr. Tilley has a 7 foot white fence installed around the property to try to keep the noise down. That way, his customers can enjoy more peace and tranquility. He even hires an artist to paint a mural on the fence depicting a blue sky with the heavenly rays of God's eternal light shining through the clouds. 

And life is good. 

Well, in recent years the economy, has taken a downturn, and most of the local businesses have suffered, including Mr. Tilley's bookstore. He isn't able to keep as many staff hired, and the property isn't maintained as well as previously. The fence has gotten dirty and the mural difficult to see, the statues need new paint, and the flowers and grass just aren't as trim as Mr. Tilley intended. 

People are still friendly when they see Mr.Tilley, but the economic troubles have clearly taken their toll, as people's vibrancy is apparently drained from their smiles. At a town meeting, Mr. Tilley makes an announcement that he's going to reinvest at great cost into his shop, as well as donating back to some of the community centers and parks to reinvigorate the town, and asks other business owners to do the same. The town rallies behind Mr. Tilley's leadership, and dozens of other businesses file in line and make similar promises. 

The town is bustling again! The streets are clean, people are happy and inspired and working vigorously to restore the town to its former state. The smiles are no longer forced, and in a few short weeks everything is looking great. 

One detail is bugging Mr. Tilley though: as much as his fence has been a point of pride with the mural, he wanted it to be something new, to show exemplify the town's rebirth in biblical imagery. So he hires one of his neighbors who is a contractor to rebuild the fence. They get the details down so the contractor knows exactly what to do. 

In a week, it's finished! Mr. Tilley goes to inspect it, and is concerned when he asks what happened to the debris from the old fence as he thought there should still be some rubbish to be taken for disposal. The contractor tells him that he was able to save a lot of money by using a lot of the old fence that was sturdy into the construction of the new fence. Mr. Tilley is upset, and asks why he wasn't made part of the decision.

The contractor just says ""Well, we've been a big community for years, and I'm sorry but I've never had anyone complain about a repost before.""",Mr. Tilley is running a Christian book store in a strip mall. [Long],7

They were the only three that survive.
Whilst figuring out what to do, they are surrounded by an angry tribe.
""We are going to kill you and make boats out of your body"" says the tribal leader.
""But you get to choose how you die""
The American says ""give me a gun""
The Englishman says ""give me some poison""
And the Australian says ""give me a fork""
So the tribe hands the American the gun and he says ""see you on the other side"" and shoots himself
They give the Englishman his poison to which he drinks and says ""it's been a good run boys"" then dies
Lastly they give the Australian the fork.
He takes it from them, hesitates for a second, then frantically begins staring himself all over his body while screaming.
""TRY BUILD A BOAT WITH THIS MOTHERFUCKERS""

Having made the order, I noticed that the waiter who served us, has a spoon in his shirt pocket. 

At first I did not pay any particular attention to this, but after looking around, I found out that ALL waiters were carrying a spoon in the shirt pocket.

""What's the spoon for?"" - I asked the waiter who came by again. 

- You see, the management of our restaurant hired ""A%&amp;#*$^@ Consulting"" to optimize our processes. These guys poked around here for several months and came to the conclusion that we spend a lot of time trying to get to the kitchen for a clean spoon, in case the client drops it on the floor. This happens about 3 times per hour at each table. Having a spoon in your pocket, we save one and a half person-hours per shift ...

""Cunning!"", I thought, and continued the meal. As I kept eating, my attention grew more acute and I noticed that a thin string sticks out of all the waiters' pants. 

- Excuse me, but why do you have a lace in your trousers? - I asked the same waiter.

Leaning towards me and lowering his voice, he replied:

- The same consulting firm, analyzing our work, came to the conclusion that we spend a lot of time in the washroom. Well, you know, get it out, pee, wash and dry your hands ... So, tying the string to ... hmm ... you know what, we can quickly get it without using our hands, which means we do not need to wash our hands after visiting the washroom, therefore we save 75% of the time.

- Yes, but how can you ... pardon me ... how can you put IT back without using your hands?

Disheartened and down to his last few dollars, Bob walked sullenly down the street. On the corner of the block was a sign that read:

'World's Wisest Man! A solution to all your problems or your money back!'

Intrigued, Bob entered the building. After a short wait he was ushered in to a small room, where a monk with a beard curling along the ground meditated. A nameplate on the floor proclaimed the monk as Weng Li.

Before Bob could say a word, Weng Li began to speak. 'Heed my words child. I know of the issues that plague you. Take this insect and let it climb along yourself every morning.'

Bewildered, Bob took the jar containing the bug and left. Once back at home, he fell into a conflicted sleep. But, he decided, his smell had ruined his life for years. Surely even this was worth a shot?

He let the bug out and it dutifully climbed on him for a few minutes. Suddenly, he realized his smell was gone! Jumping for joy, he ran back into to town to thank Weng Li.

-The client: is room 39 empty?
-The boss: yes, sir.
-The client: can I book it?
-The boss: of course you can.
-The client: thank you.

Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.

The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.

The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.

Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.

In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.

He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.

The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.

The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.

The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 73g.

This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.

Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.

The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.

The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up. 

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.

The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.

In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.

-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''
-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.
-''Swear''
-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''
So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss. 

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.

When he does, I will let you know.",A handsome man went into a hotel.......,0

His people believed a man's strength and courage came from his beard, and thus the man with the biggest beard was their chief.

After leading the band for many years, Benny began to feel uncomfortable wearing the beards, in this hot and dusty land. He wanted to shave it off, so he called his council together to get their advice.

When he said he wanted to shave, the councilmen were shocked. One said, ""Do you now remember the ancient legend, dire? The leader who removes his beard is cursed and made into a piece of earthenware.""

Benny had heard this legend, but being a modern man, he scoffed at the tale.

Being headstrong, he went ahead and cut and scraped away his once magnificent beard. As the final whisker was cut off, a huge dust storm came up. It lasted only a few seconds, and when it cleared, there was a man-sized clay vessel where only moments before had stood their leader.

The council then knew the legend must be true. Their conclusion? 

A Benny shaved is a Benny urned.",In a great desert lived a group of nomads,66

The king ruled over a small kingdom he had inherited from his father.
The king was not a particularly bad ruler, considering.
However, one of the dukedoms his late father had conquered, started to plot against him, in order to liberate themselves from his kingdom.

The king naturally had spies in the rebellious duke's castle, and so he soon found out about their plans. And he had the duke brought to him to be questioned.

Naturally, the duke denied all knowledge.
So the king, sighing heavily, summoned the royal torturer, and told him to cut the duke's toes off.

After the torturer has done as told, the king started to question the duke again.  
And again, the duke told the king he did not know what he was talking about.  
So the torturer cut the duke's fingers off.  
And again the king asked the duke about the rebellion planned.  
And again the duke told him he knew naught about it.  
So the torturer cut away his ears (Nothing), removed his nose (I know nothing), and gouged out his eyes (I do not know what you are talking about, your highness).  

Amazed and taken by the duke's courage, the king told the torturer to end the duke's suffering.  
The torturer picked up his wide, heavy axe, lifted it high, aimed and swung towards the duke's neck.   
Yet, right as he started the swing, the count screamed ""No! Wait! I'll talk!""
Of course, by then it was too late, and the torturer took his head clean off. 

Moral of the story: Don't kill your count before he chickens.","So, here's a story...",5

Might be long IDK if its long for r/jokes

I am a teacher, but i am specially trained to help with self-esteem, adhd and other mental difficulties, due to my type of work i work closely with the families as well.

Many times religion is brought up, me being an Atheist in a very religious area is never something i want to talk about.

But many parents press the issue b.c for some reason its more important that i'm a man of god rather teaching their child to control their angry, respect themselves and others, and just be happy in general.

Well when it comes out time to time that i am an Atheist shit hits the fan so to say.

They don't leave or fire me, but they just look at me like i am the devil himself, they give me the glaring eye, turn their backs to me and this is the MOST important part, they ""literally"" wish i would go to Hell, they tell me ""you are going to hell"" ""you are the worst type of person"" ""Jesus will make sure you burn"".

I mean.. WOW these people LITERALLY hate my existence so much they want me to BURN IN HELL FOR ETERNITY. They want the single worst thing in all existence  to happen to me.

Do you know what it is like to have a large group of people to just hate you, your existence, every little thing about you b.c of something that doesn't harm or take away from them in anyway regardless of your personality?

Wait a minute...... is this what its like to be black?

Edit: Sorry about my bad grammar, English is a bit hard for me. (luckily i don't teach English)","Epiphany, do i get it now?",0

post,6xfbjz,2qh72,jokes,false,1504280339,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6xfbjz/my_sister_got_turned_into_a_deer/,self.jokes,,"So I have this really strange story to tell.  It all started when my sister was turned into a deer.  It all started when she was walking through the forest and a fairy came up to her and said, âHey, I think you should be a deer.â  The fairy waved her wand and she was a deer before she could even reply.

Youâd think this is where the story ends, but no, it gets even weirder.  So she is walking through the forest, now as a deer.  Trotting? I guess.  So she gets to a clearing and a booming voice goes, âRIIIITA!!! I FOUND YOU ONE.â A giant troll reaches down and picks her up.  Now this isnât just any troll, this troll is part of a witch troll gang or something.

They tied my sister, the deer up.  Then they did this absurd dance like the OA and she started to turn pink.  She looked at her hooves and in terror let out a scream.  Then something even weirder happens.  She gets picked up and the trolls start using her pinkness to rub on their lips.  When she gets put down, she looks up and they all have bright pink lipstick on.  

While they are admiring themselves my sister ran away.  In the process though, she fell down a cliff and got all scraped up on rocks and thorns.  She dragged herself home and knocked on the door.  When I opened it all I could see was a pink mess in front of me.  I didnât believe it was her until she started talking.

I called the vet because I didnât think a doctor would take care of her.  The vet comes to my house and takes a look.  With an astonished look on her face the vet says, âIâve never seen anything like this.  The bones of this deer are made completely of glass.  She must be the most fragile deer in the whole world.  And bright pink? Thatâs absurd.  Give her an asprin and plenty of rest.â

I took care of her for days and let her play a bunch of RPG games.  She was for some reason able to level up absurdly fast.  I donât know how she even did it considering she had hooves for hands.  She was some sort of experience gaining god now.  Over the course of a week she healed up while getting better and better at video games.  Her skin was all callused though from the fall.

Now I know what you are thinking.  There is no way that this story can get any weirder.  Well, there is just one more thing that happened.  Batman, Superman, the whole justice league showed up at our house.  âWe need you to come fight crime with us.  You have to come up with a super hero name though.â  

So this is the origin of my super callused fragile lipstick xp allah doe sis.

Yes, you may call any pig Honourable Minister.''

The new neighbor says, ""I'm a professor."" The first neigbhbor then asks, ""Oh yeah, what do you teach?""

""Logic,"" the professor reponds.

""What is that?"" the neighbor inquires.

""Well, let me see if I can give you an example...you have a dog, right?""

""Yeah, that's right,"" neighbor #1 responds.

""And you have children too, right?"" says the professor.

""Wow, right again!"" exclaims the neighbor.

""So, then you must be married and that would make you a heterosexual, right?'' proclaims the professor.

""Unbelievable, you're absolutely correct. How do you know all this about me?""

""Well,"" the professor says, ""I observed there was a dog house in your backyard, so you must have a dog. I also saw bicycles next to your garage, so you must have children. And if you have children, you are probably married and if your married, you are most likely heterosexual... it was all logical!""

The next afternoon, the neighbor runs into his old friend. His friend asks if he has met the new neighbor. The man says that he met him yesterday.

""What's he like?""

""Well,"" the man says, ""he's nice and he is a professor of logic.""

""Oh,"" says the friend, ""what's logic?""

""Maybe I can give you an example. Do you have a dog house?""

""Why, no, I do not,"" responds the friend.

âItâs certainly not a ship,â he thinks to himself. As the speck gets closer and closer, he begins to rule out the possibilities of a small boat, then even a raft.
Suddenly, emerging from the surf is a drop-dead gorgeous blonde woman wearing a wet suit and scuba gear.
She approaches the stunned man and says to him, âTell me how long itâs been since youâve had a cigarette?â
âTen years,â replies the Scotsman.
With that, she reaches over and unzips a waterproof pocket on her left sleeve and pulls out a pack of fresh cigarettes. He takes one, lights it, takes a long drag and says, âOch â in the name of the wee man is that good!â
âAnd how long has it been since youâve had a sip of good scotch?â she asks him.
Trembling, the castaway replies, âTen years.â She reaches over, unzips her right sleeve, pulls out a flask and hands it to him. He opens the flask, takes a long swig and says, âTis absolutely fantastic!â
At this point, she starts slowly unzipping the long zipper that runs down the front of her wet suit, looks at the man and asks, âAnd how long has it been since youâve played around?â

Hearing this great news Jimmy asks his dad if he could take Jimmy to the tractor exhibition and his dad agrees.

""You just tried to kill me,"" says the bear.
""N-n-nuh-no,"" replies the hunter, denying the obvious.
""I'll give you a choice,"" says the bear, ""you can drop your pants and bend over that fallen tree -- or I can kill you right now."" Hunter realizes he really doesn't have much choice, so he drops his pants, and the bear has its way with him.

Bear finishes up then says, ""Off you go -- and let that be a lesson to you. Don't let me see you back in these woods again.""

The following weekend, the hunter is bent on revenge, so he returns to the woods to shoot the bear. Unfortunately his efforts meet with exactly the same result.

Hunter, terribly humiliated for a 2nd time, is driving home when he sees a Sporting Goods store. So he goes inside and buys the biggest most powerful rifle they have, and returns to the woods for revenge.

He sees the same bear in the same blueberry patch, takes careful aim, and BANG! the bear goes down. ""Got the s.o.b. this time,"" he mutters as he starts searching for the corpse. Strangely enough, there's no sign of the bear -- until he feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns, and there's his old enemy.

""OK,"" sighs the bear, ""you know the drill.....And you know what? I don't think you're really in this for the hunting, are you?""",The Bear Hunter (LONG),3

So the man immediately schedules an appointment to go to the doctor's. The following week, at the doctor's office, the doctor inspects the area, and asks the man several questions. After thinking for awhile, the doctor just says, âI see.â
âSo, what do you think Doc?! It's not cancer is it?!â

âNo, it's definitely not cancer, don't worry.â

âEh, how can you be so sure?! If not that, then what is it?â

âIt's just a simple ganglion. It'll go away eventually, but if the pain becomes too much, I can remove it for you.â

âSimple?! But it hurts so much and I've never even heard of thatâ¦Are you sure it isn't cancer doc?â

âAlright alright, hold on.â

After saying those words, the doctor walks out of the room, and after several minutes he returns with a Black Labrador. He points to the man and the Labrador comes up to him and sniffs the man briefly. Afterwards, it sits on its haunches, and shakes it's head. The doctor pets the dog then leads it out of the room. After another moment, the doctor returns with a cat and he again points to the man. The cat goes up to the man, jumps on the table and sniffs him just like the dog. Afterwards, the cat also sits on its haunches, shakes it's head, then jumps off the table and walks out of the room. The man sits there, bewildered, but the doctor seeing this merely responds, âAs you can see, I can guarantee you that you absolutely, 100%, do not have cancer.â

âAlright then, thank you doc,â the man says skeptically, âbut when can I get this g-gayn-ganglion thing removed?â

âYes, ganglion, and I'll schedule an appointment to have it removed next week. Just try not to stress that area of your body. And some simple pain killers should help you deal with it.â 
Afterwards the doctor goes to his desk and begins writing some things down. Then he hands the paper to the man, and the man inspects it. He can't read the doctor's scribbles, but at the bottom, some numbers catch his eye.
â$320?! What the hell?! Why is it $320 just for you to tell me that I don't have cancer?!â

âWell, I was originally gonna charge you $20 for the visit, but since you didn't believe me, I had to charge you $300 for the lab report and the cat scan.""",Going to the Doctor,14

The waitress asks them for their orders.

The man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke,' and turns to the ostrich, 'What's yours?'

'I'll have the same,' says the ostrich.

A short time later the waitress returns with the order 'That will be $9.40 please,' and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment.

The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke'

The ostrich says, 'I'll have the same'

Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change.

This becomes routine until the two enter again.

'The usual?' asks the waitress.

'No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and a salad,' says the man.

'Same,' says the ostrich.

Shortly the waitress brings the order and says, 'That will be $32.62.'

Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table.

The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer.

""Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time?""

Says the man, ""Well, several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes.

The first wish I asked was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.""

The waitress said ""That's brilliant! Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live. How smart of you!''

""That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact amount of money is always there"" says the man proudly.

The waitress asks, ""But, what's that ostrich all about?""

post,6x5tn6,2qh72,jokes,false,1504171583,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6x5tn6/infamous_juan_joke/,self.jokes,,"There once was a guy named Juan. He was a really nice guy....didn't beat hisÂ wife, didn't beat hisÂ kids, didn't beat theÂ aardvarkÂ in theÂ backyard. He lived in a small country inÂ South America. Juan lived a simple life, and was simply happy.

One day, he was sitting in aÂ coffeeshopÂ with a few friends, when the topic of theÂ electionÂ for mayor came up. One of his friends said 'Hey Juan, why don't you run? You're a really great guy!' Juan smiled and thanked his friends for their kindness, but they were persistant, as they should be...he was a greatÂ candidateÂ and a great guy; he didn't beat his wife, or his kids, or the aardvark in the backyard. Juan reluctantly agreed, and posted a few signs out to announce his candidacy; he thought of it as kinda a joke Well, as it turned out, when word got around that Juan was running, hisÂ popularityÂ grew fast. 'Wow, Juan is running?' 'What a great guy!' 'I heard he doesn't beat his wife, or his kids!' 'Yeah, nor the aarvark in the backyard!' Well, to nobodies surprise (except Juan), he won by a landslide (the other candidate wasÂ Oliver North), and was sworn into office with a very surprised look on his face. Well, he saw that there was do getting out of it, so he decided to do his best.

And his best was quite good. The town prospered like it never had before. The crime for the year consisted of someone dropping aÂ lollipopÂ stick on the sidewalk. He spent 6% of the budget, and donated the rest to the Dum Fiters Relief Fund. TheÂ townspeopleÂ wereÂ ecstatic, and his performance turned a lot of heads. Everyone in the town was thrilled with Juan as mayor; he didn't beat his wife, or his kids, or the aardvark in the backyard. Well, at the end of the year, with his term almost up, Juan was pretty pooped. As he sat in the coffeeshop with his friends, reflecting on the year, one suggested that, despite the town's success, the province was in some financial trouble. 'Heck, with Juan's record, he should be governor!' another smiled. Juan wondered why everyone's eyes lit up suddenly. Within hours the campaign was on. All the ads and posters had the same theme: 'Vote for Juan! He doesn't beat his wife, or his kids, or the aardvark in the backyard!' When election day came, there was no doubt about the winner; Juan had been in the lead since the week he had entered. Governer Juan sat back in his padded chair and went to work once again.

His record was brilliant for the two years he spent as governor. The crime rate fell by 2/3, the budget was balanced, education rose sharply, and the province'sÂ Soccer TeamÂ sold out every game that Juan attended (he was a bigÂ SoccerÂ Buff). The whole country was now buzzing with Juan;s work. Everyone commented how he was such a great guy, how he didn't beat his wife, how he didn't beat his kids, and how he didn't beat the aardvark in the backyard. Then the President was shot. This meant that they needed a new president. Normally, they would turn to the vice-president, except for the fact in this case was that the vice-president was the murderer. Hmm. The Governors got together to decide on a new President for the remaining three years of the term. Each one walked into the room with a mailsack full of letters, all of which has similar messages: 'Juan for President!' 'Let Juan preside as President!' 'How can you not select Juan? He doesn't beat his wife, doesn't beat his kids, and doesn't beat the aardavrk in the backyard? What else do you want?' To make a very long story not quite as long, Juan was quickly named president, and the country was glad he did. The country prospered; newÂ trade agreementsÂ were made, old disputes were settled, and there was peace throughout the country. Juan was aÂ national hero. One day Juan came home from work exhausted. He put his briefcase down and plopped down in his easy chair. His mind was racing, but he was exhausted. He couldn't concentrate...pressure from everyone...lobbiests want this...governors want that....everyone wants this and that and acccccckkkkk!!!!!! Juan looked out the window into the backyard. As usual, the aardvark was out there slurping up ants. Wander....wander....sluuuurp! Wander.....wander....sluuuurp! The monotonous repetition snapped something in Juan's mind. A sudden rage built up inside of him, something evil and uncontrollable. He stood Unfortunatelty for Juan, his neighbour heard theÂ CRACKs and quickly moved theÂ telescopeÂ from Juan's upstairs window, where his daughter was undressing, down to the yard, and witnessed the brutal attack. He immediately phoned the police, and within hours, Juan was behind bars, the aardvark rushed to the hospital, and the telescope back up to the upstairs window. The country was horrified, and the citizens called for nothing less than the usual penalty given out for this type of crime....death by firing squad. It was granted, and the punishment was to be carried out swiftly. Juan stood there, broken and insane.

TheÂ firing squadÂ levied their guns at him. 'Ready.......' 'Aim.........' Suddenly, and without warning, the aardvark leapt from the shadows, aimed at Juan and fired aÂ golf gun. The shot boomed throughout the town, and the shot itself went clear through Juan's heart and out his back.

You may be asking yourself in between sobs what a golf gun is? This in itself is theÂ moraleÂ of theÂ story....
