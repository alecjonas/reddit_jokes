The  Presbyterian church called a meeting to decide what to do about the squirrel problem. After much prayer and discussion, they concluded the squirrels infesting the church were predestined to be there and the church elders and congregation shouldn't interfere with God's divine will.  

At the  Baptist church the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistery.  The  deacons met and put a water slide leading to the font in hopes the the squirrels would drown themselves. However, being instinctive swimmers like many rodents, the squirrels took to the slide as a game and found it fun;  twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.

The Methodist church decided they were not in a position to harm any of God's creatures, so they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free at night next to the Baptist Church. Two weeks later the squirrels were back when the Baptists gave up and took down the water slide.

The Catholic Church came up with a very creative strategy. They baptized all the squirrels in their house of worship and consecrated them as members of the church. Now the parishioners only see them on Christmas and Easter.   

The Jewish synagogue reported little trouble. They took the first squirrel they found and circumcised him. They haven't seen a squirrel since.",Squirrels infested a small town and each house of worship called a meeting to decide what to do.,4

They walk on and the area gets even nicer. There are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere. They arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. She looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. The man couldn´t be any happier. The devil says ""Everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!""

As they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. He peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. There are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. Other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. A stench of sulfur is in the air.

Tesla Sentry Mode is the name of the car's feature that detects when someone is near the car when it is parked; it saves video from that time period and notifies the owner how many incidents have occurred while s/he's been away from the car. It also puts a message up on the screen on the dash telling anyone looking in that they are being recorded.

A person writes that they are Dutch, and had driven to Spain, where the cars are less common and a lot of people walk up to look. Those people were getting a message on the screen in Dutch, which they might not be able to understand.

So they suggested the message be put up in multiple languages.

Someone else suggested that the language used be selectable by the owner.

Someone else suggested that the language used be based on the GPS location of the car.

Someone else suggested that the Tesla neural networks do an analysis of an image of the face(s) of anyone looking in, discern their country of origin, and display the message in the language(s) most likely to be understood by that person.

Someone else pointed out that, if you just put ""Fuck Off!"" on the screen, that usually works...",Suggestions for Tesla sentry mode...,10

They had a great time, hitting bar after bar, knocking back drinks, but being so genetically different, the alcohol affected them each in different ways: the lemon got very acidic and refluxy; the potato, being a big starchy chap, took the booze in his stride; while the little pea reacted to all the sugar and started to get a touch hyperactive.

At the end of the night, the three friends found themselves leaving a bar at the top of a tall hill, when all of a sudden the pea started bouncing up and down excitedly: ""Lads! Lads! I've got a great idea! We’re all vaguely round in shape, let's not get a cab home, let's just roll down the hill!"" and before the others could protest he was off - shooting down the hill at a rate of knots.

The lemon lurched after him, but soon started listing violently from side to side as he went, owing to his oval shape, which did nothing for his unsettled stomach. With a sigh, the potato trundled along slowly behind.

By the time the potato had bounced his way to the bottom of the hill, the lemon was spewing lemon juice all over the pavement, but the pea was already jumping up and down again ""that was great, that was great, let's do it again!"".

The lemon was now chundering up pips with the acid, but the pea didn't seem to care ""Come on! let's go again, that was great!"".

The potato turned to him and said ""Easy peasy, lemon's queasy.""","A lemon, a potato, and a pea all had a tough week working at the grocery store..",27

One day as they were cruising through the Atlantic, the ship encountered a massive storm. Though severely damaged the ship’s crew managed the keep her afloat but just barely.After the storm ended the ship was still in critical condition so the captain ordered to dump all cargo to the ocean but still this wasn’t enough. Then they dumped all their food and water and to their despair even this wasn’t enough. So the chief engineer made a calculation and judged that dumping a person would be enough to keep the ship afloat. The captain declared that there will be a drawing of a lot to find the unlucky person who would be dumped to the sea. Ever unlucky, our one balled fellow’s name came up from the lot.Not accepting his fate, he offered the captain a question if the captain knows it correctly, our fellow would jump to the cold waters willingly if not the captain would take the leap. So he asked: ‘Captain how many balls do the chief engineer and I have in total?’. the captain said the obvious answer. ‘Of course you have 4 in total’. Our one balled fellow sighed in relief and dropped his pants showing his only ball, but when chief dropped his pants the old seawolf had three!

One was a lawyer. Again, a successful professional. A real tiger. She had practiced several forms of law, including divorces. She knew all there was to know about the legal side of a marriage, and had offered to make sure both of them were protected.

One was an entrepreneur. She had started as a teen working in a bakery and eventually had opened her own, successful string of bakeries. She was creative, and sweet. She was in touch with her softer side, and he knew that her creativity would bring him out of his shell.

The last was a woman of relatively ordinary means. She was pretty, but shy. She worked in an office and enjoyed her sometimes mundane work. Her goal in life was to be a perfect wife and mother. She longed to help her future husband achieve his full potential as a human being, and then to raise children that would be strong and independent thinkers. He was 100% convinced of her loyalty.

He thought long and hard about his choices, he considered every aspect of each woman's strengths. After days of deliberation, he finally made his choice....

post,dloy3n,2qh72,jokes,false,1571780292,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dloy3n/is_hell_endothermic_or_exothermic/,self.jokes,,"Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.

One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving.

As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different Religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.

With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.

This gives two possibilities:
1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.
2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.
So which is it?

If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, ""it will be a cold day in Hell before I go out with you"", and take into account the fact that I went out with her last night, then number 2 must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over.
The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct . . . leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting ""Oh my God.""

was a gifted portrait artist.

Over a short number of years, his fame grew and soon people from all
over Ireland were coming to the town of Miltown in County Clare, to
get him to paint their likenesses.

One day, a beautiful young English woman arrived at his house in a
stretch limo and asked if he would paint her in the nude.  This being
the first time anyone had made such a request he was a bit perturbed,
particularly when the woman told him that money was no object; in
fact, and she was willing to pay up to 10,000 pounds.

Not wanting to get into any marital strife, he asked her to wait while
he went into the house to confer with Mary, his wife.  They talked
much about the Rightness and Wrongness of it.  It was hard to make the
decision but finally his wife agreed, on one condition.

In a few minutes he returned.

""T'would be me pleasure to paint yer portrait, missus,"" he said ""The
wife says it's okay.

""I'll paint you in the nude all right; but I have to at least leave me
socks on, so I have a place to wipe me brushes.""",An Irish Painter,15

post,dlkj8n,2qh72,jokes,false,1571762465,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dlkj8n/yuri_and_the_ship/,self.jokes,,"Yuri had lived in Russia all of his life, in a small town near Moscow. The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.

Every day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, ""SWIMMING LESSONS"" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.

Yuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, ""If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough..."" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.

Every day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri's.

A few months had passed, and Yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.

Later that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words ""DIVING PRACTICES"" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles.

Yuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.

The practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.

Many people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. ""It is only something I am fond of, a hobby"" Yuri would say. ""I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy."" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.

For yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. ""TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!"" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.

Yuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.

Finally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. ""It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life..."" Yuri would always respond to his fans.

One day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. ""Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!"" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, ""And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!"" Yuri replied, ""Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.""

Yuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.

Unfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. ""Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!"" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.

""It is OK, everybody"" Yuri yelled back. ""I have endured many hardships in my life.""

She responded, 'Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'

The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?'

She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'

The defense attorney nearly died.

The judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said,

Thinking it's early, he decides to order another drink and wait it out.

Not long after, a bus driver and several dentists promptly announce themselves and go in the back. The lawyer takes a look again but the nuns and the newcomers are just drinking somberly in silence. 

He goes back to his drink and shortly, a bunch of inmates arrive followed by a genie and a fly who immediately head to the back. The lawyer thinks this must be it and takes another look. Instead, everyone is sitting with sad expressions on their faces while a few others wait at the punch line.

Feeling mildly disturbed, he goes back to his drink. It's nearly 9 now. Not long after, a few Mexicans, Dave and an endless number of mathematicians arrive whom all once again head straight to the back room. The lawyer hurriedly peeks into the crowded room but still sees everybody depressed and nobody talking. 

Baffled and furious he stomps right up to the bartender.

Father John says he has soap in his room and goes to get it, not bothering to dress.

He grabs two bars of soap, one in each hand, while he is halfway down the hall when he sees three newly inducted nuns from other city heading his way.

Having no place to hide, he stands against the wall and freezes like he's a statue.

The nuns stop and comment on how life-like he looks.

The first nun suddenly reaches out and pulls on his manhood.

Startled, he drops a bar of soap.

""Oh look"" says the first nun, ""it's a soap dispenser"".

To test her theory the second nun also pulls on his manhood. Sure enough, he drops the second bar of soap.

Now the third nun decides to have a go. She pulls once, then twice, and three times but nothing happens.

So she gives several more tugs, then yells:

Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to their farms. The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey, let alone catch it!

The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $50! However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy on behalf of him.

In the absence of the man, the assistant told the villagers; ""Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected. I will sell them to you at $35 and when the man returns from the city, you can sell them to him for $50 each.""

The first snow of the year was falling, and earlier than usual.  

The ‘white doe’ tribe of the Northeast had been falling upon hard times in recent years with the advance of white settlements. Skirmishes with them and competition for food continued to dwindle the numbers of the tribe even as it was getting pushed further and further up the barren mountains. Only Black Wolf’s adept leadership and immense ability was keeping the tribe intact at this time, as material shortages and internal conflict threatened to tear it apart altogether. Black Wolf himself was a vastly experienced hunter and forager, and he himself managed to provide much of the tribe’s much needed sustenance. But as his salt and pepper mane of wavy hair evidenced, he was getting old. 

As he coughed in the cold, Black Wolf mused to himself that he did not have much time left either. The elders were already pressuring him to step down, and he had to pass on the leadership soon or the tribe could very well disintegrate. To this end, Black Wolf favoured a young and whip-smart brave called ‘Falling Rocks’. While slight of build and not the strongest, Falling Rocks was not only very courageous but also had great general acumen. Known for his astute tactical mind and signature move of jumping off ledges and trees to kill prey and enemies alike, Falling Rocks had Black Wolf’s complete faith. However, a large number favoured his brutish rival, ‘Tall Bear’, who was an absolute physical specimen and formidable warrior but who was however not necessarily the sharpest tool in the shed. Black Wolf knew that he could not possibly just name Falling Rocks as the leader without holding a fair contest, so he called all the aspiring leaders to meet him on a neighbouring plateau the following morning. Dutifully, 5 brave warriors including Falling Rocks and Tall Bear turned up, and Black Wolf addressed the small group.

‘Braves of the white doe, I have led this tribe for 32 years and my time is rightfully ending. I now challenge all of you to compete for the leadership and your task is as follows: hike west as far as you can, and the one who goes the furthest while bringing me back something as proof of your travels shall be the new leader.’ 

Henceforth, Black Wolf returned to the plateau every day from dusk till dawn to wait for any returning warriors. After 1 month, the first brave returned and met the veteran leader. ‘Sir, I hiked westwards as you instructed until I reached a white man settlement that was so densely patrolled that I dared not venture further, and it was there I decided to turn back.’ After handing Black Wolf the head of a decapitated patrol, the first brave was sent back to resume his normal duties.

Another 2 months saw the return of a second brave, who told Black Wolf, ‘Sir, I hiked west so far as to reach a vast lake that seemed endless on every side, that I felt that I could go no further and it was there I decided to turn back.’ Handing Black Wolf a tangle of lake weeds, the second brave was also sent back to continue his life. 

Only after 4 months did the third brave return, and he told Black Wolf, ‘Sir, I travelled west all the way to a colossal range of mountains, far taller than the one we have here. Seeing no way around or over it, I felt that I could go no further and it was there I decided to turn back. He passed Black Wolf the horn of a mountain goat and returned to the tribe.

A year on from the original challenge, neither Tall Bear nor Falling Rocks had returned, and winter was approaching again. Hungry and angry, the elders and the rest of the tribe were beginning to heap pressure on Black Wolf to end this nonsensical challenge and name the third brave as the new leader. Yet, Black Wolf held out, as he still wanted Falling Rocks to succeed him. But as it got progressively colder and the dissent started boiling over, Black Wolf knew that he could not control the tribe for much longer. On a day where a rebellious and a loyalist faction almost started fighting, Black Wolf intervened with the last vestige of his waning authority. 

‘Tribe, I will go out one last day tomorrow, and if nobody returns, I will name the third brave as the new leader.’ 

And so, Black Wolf climbed onto the plateau the next morning, and waited till it was almost dark. But just as he was about to resign to fate and head back, a lone figure approached against the backdrop of the last bit of sun. It was Tall Bear! Addressing Black Wolf, Tall Bear recounted, ‘Sir, I went so far as to reach another sea. I knew it was not the same sea as here as the fish were different and the water tasted different, but it was definitely the sea nevertheless. Seeing no end to the shore, I felt that I could go no further and it was there that I decided to turn back.’ 

That night, the tribe conducted their age-old handover ritual, and Tall Bear became the new leader. Relieved from his duties and without a sense of purpose anymore, Black Wolf’s health fell off a cliff and he tragically began a steep and terminal decline. Only weeks later, he was on his deathbed. With the entire white doe kneeling and weeping before his bed with Tall Bear at the front, Black Wolf raised his voice to make one last address to the tribe.

‘Tribe, I have led you for 33 years and I only have 1 last request. Falling Rocks has not returned but I know he is out there and he will return. The only thing I want you to promise me is that none of you will ever forget him, and you will wait for him until he comes back.’ 

And with that, Black Wolf breathed his last breath. A grieving tribe mourned throughout the night, and they collectively promised to honour Black Wolf’s last wish. That is why till this day

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite.

To boost morale, a submarine captain decides to hold a party for the seamen while underwater. Given the tight space, they setup various areas throughout the boat to serve the crew. Despite the long lines at each area, the party is going well, with everyone happily eating and drinking.

About midway through the party, a young ensign, looking to fast track his advancement to lieutenant, notices that the captain's drink is getting low. He approaches, and after thanking the captain for the party, offers to refresh his drink. The captain takes him up on his offer, and asks for another Coke. The ensign searches for the line serving Coke, and after a long wait, learns someone else grabbed the last one. Defeated, he returns to his captain to give him the bad news.

""It's ok"", replies the captain, ""see if you can find a Sprite."". Once again, the ensign takes off across the boat, and finally finds the line serving cans of Sprite. However, as before, by the time he gets to the front of the line, the Sprite is gone. Nervous, he returns again to his captain with bad news.

""That's too bad"", says the captain, ""but I really wanted something sweet to drink."" Having heard the ship's cook was making his special fruit punch, the ensign eagerly offers back to the captain to get him a cup of the famous drink. The captain agrees, and the ensign takes off across the boat in search for the drink. However, after an exauhstive search, the ensign comes up empty handed. As he's failed his captain three times, the ensign is extremely anxious to give him the bad news.

He approaches the captain, who notices a lack of beverage in the ensign's hands. Frustrated, the captain asks why the ensign has come back again empty handed. The ensign timidly replies, ""I'm sorry sir, I've searched this entire sub, but couldn't find the punch line"".",The Submarine Party,11
