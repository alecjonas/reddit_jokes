The first kingdom had 12 knights, and each knight had five squires, all of whom were busily polishing armor, brushing horses, and cooking food. The second kingdom had twenty knights, and each knight had 10 squires. Everyone at that camp was also busy preparing for battle.

He busied himself preparing the meal, while the knight polished his own armor. When the hour of the battle came, the three kingdoms sent their squires out to fight (this was too trivial a matter for the knights to join in).

The certificate paid for a visit to a medicine man living on a nearby reservation who was rumored to have a wonderful cure for erectile dysfunction. 
After being persuaded, he drove to the reservation, handed his ticket to the medicine man, and wondered what he was in for.

The old man handed a potion to him, and with a grip on his shoulder, warned, 'This is a powerful medicine. You take only a teaspoonful, and then say '1-2-3.'

When you do, you will become more manly than you have ever been in your life, and you can perform as long as you want.""
The man was encouraged. As he walked away, he turned and asked, ""How do I stop the medicine from working?""

""Your partner must say '1-2-3-4,'"" he responded, ""but when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon.""
He was very eager to see if it worked so he went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine, and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom. When she came in, he took off his clothes and said, ""1-2-3!""

Immediately, he was the manliest of men. His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes, and then she asked, ""What was the 1-2-3 for?""

And that, boys and girls, is why we should never end our sentences with a preposition, because we could end up with a dangling participle.",On his 74th birthday,10

“Where’s the toast?” he said.

“Oh, I ran out of bread and didn’t have time to get some. There’s waffles and pancakes though.”

That’s when he snapped. He went into a blind rage, flipping over my table, making dishes and food flying around the room. I didn’t know what had happened. After a minute or so, he calmed himself down and said, “I’m really sorry man, I never told you about this part of me.”

At the very last minute, she realized that she 
didn't have any snails for this dinner party, so
she asked her husband to run down to the beach 
with the bucket she was handing him to gather 
some snails. 

Very grudgingly he agreed. He took the bucket, 
walked out the door, down the steps, and out to
the beach. As he was collecting the snails, he 
noticed a beautiful woman strolling alongside 
the water just a little further down the beach.
He kept thinking to himself 'Wouldn't it be great
if she would even just come down and talk to me.'
He went back to gathering the snails. All of a 
sudden he looked up, and the beautiful woman was
standing right over him. They got to talking, and
she invited him back to her place. They were at 
her apartment a ways down the beach, and they 
started messing around. It got so hot and heavy,
that he was exhausted afterwards and passed out 
there. 

At seven o'clock the next morning he woke up and
exclaimed, 'Oh no!!! My wife's dinner party!!!' 
He gathered all his clothes, put them on real 
fast, grabbed his bucket, and ran out the door.
He ran down the beach all the way to his 
apartment. He ran up the stairs of his apartment.
He was in such a hurry that when he got to the 
top of the stairs, he dropped the bucket of 
snails. There were snails all down the stairs.
The door opened just then, with a very angry wife
standing in the door way wondering where he's 
been all this time. He looked at the snails all
down the steps, then he looked at her, then back
at the snails and said: 'Come on guys, we're 
almost there!' ","A wife and her husband were having a dinner party for all the major status figures in Rome, Italy. The wife was very excited about this and wanted everything to be perfect.",68

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone.

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""","A horse is sitting at home, watching MTV...",84

The plumber comes over and quickly fixes the sink. The professor is happy until he gets the bill. He tells the plumber, ""How can you charge this much? This is half of my paycheck."" But he pays it anyways.

The plumber tells him, ""Hey, we are looking for more plumbers. You could become a plumber and triple your salary. Just make sure you say you only made it to 6th grade, they don't like educated people.""

The professor takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But the company makes an announcement that all of their plumbers must get a 7th grade education. So they all go to night school.

On the first day of night school they all attend math class. The teacher wants to gauge the class so he asks John, ""What is the formula for the area of a circle?""

John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is negative pi times radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong so he starts over, but again he comes up with the same equation. After staring at the board for a minute he looks out at the other plumbers and sees that they are all whispering, ""Switch the limits on the integral!""","A math professor, John, is having problems with his sink",10

The first kingdom had 12 knights, and each knight had five squires, all of whom were busily polishing armor, brushing horses, and cooking food. The second kingdom had twenty knights, and each knight had 10 squires. Everyone at that camp was also busy preparing for battle.

He busied himself preparing the meal, while the knight polished his own armor.

The new element, Governmentium(Gv), has one neutron, 25 assistant neutrons, 88 deputy neutrons, and 198 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of 312.

These 312 particles are held together by forces called morons, which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called peons. Since Governmentium has no electrons, it is inert; however, it can be detected, because it impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact.

A tiny amount of Governmentium can cause a reaction that would normally take less than a second, to take from four days to four years to complete.

Governmentium has a normal half-life of 2- 6 years; It does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which a portion of the assistant neutrons and deputy neutrons exchange places.

In fact, Governmentium’s mass will actually increase over time, since each reorganization will cause more morons to become neutrons, forming isodopes. This characteristic of moron promotion leads some scientists to believe that Governmentium is formed whenever morons reach a critical concentration.

This hypothetical quantity is referred to as critical morass. When catalyzed with money, Governmentium becomes Administratium, an element that radiates just as much energy as Governmentium since it has half as many peons but twice as many morons",Rare elements,17

A ranch woman takes her three sons to the doctor for physicals for the first time in their lives. 

The doctor examines the boys and tells the woman that they are healthy but she needs to give them iron supplements. She goes home and wonders exactly what iron supplements are. Finally, she goes to the hardware store and buys iron ball bearings (BB's) and mixes them into their food.


Several days later the youngest son comes to her and tells her that he is pissing BB's. She tells him that it is normal because she had put them in his food. Later the middle son comes to her and says that he is crapping BB's. Again, she says that it is ok.


That evening the eldest son comes in very upset. He says ""Ma, you won't believe what happened"". She says ""I know, you're passing BB's"". ""No"", he says.

I entered the pub around dusk to it being completely empty. The owner was behind the bar stereotypically cleaning a pint glass. I walked up the bar and he poured me a pint.

""Yes.""

""I built that with me bare hands. I like working with what nature gives you. Did you notice the pub built and crafted from wood?""

the night with her for $500. They did their thing,   
and, before he left, he told her that he did  
not have any cash with him, but he would have his  
secretary write a check and mail it to her, calling  
the payment 'RENT FOR APARTMENT.'  

&amp;nbsp;
  
On the way to the office, he regretted what he had  
done, realizing that the whole event had not been  
worth the price. So he had his secretary send a check for $250 and enclose the following typed note:  
'Dear Madam:  
Enclosed find a check for $250 for rent of your  
apartment . I am not sending the amount agreed upon,  
because when I rented the place, I was under the  
impression that:  
1 - it had never been occupied;  
2 - there was plenty of heat; and  
3 - it was small enough to make me feel cozy and at home.  
However, I found out that:  
1 - it had been previously occupied,   
2 - there wasn't any heat, and  
3 - it was entirely too large.'  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately  
returned the check for $250 with the following note:  
'Dear Sir:  
1 - I cannot understand how you could expect a  
beautiful apartment to remain unoccupied indefinitely.  
2 - As for the heat, there is plenty of it, if you know how to turn it on.  
3 - Regarding the space, the apartment is indeed of  
regular size, but if you don't have enough furniture  
to fill it, please do not blame the management.  
So, Please send the rent in full or we will be forced  
to contact your present landlady.'

The first kingdom sends all 100 of its finest knights with all of their finest squires dressed in the best of armor and armed with the finest of weapons. The second kingdom sends all 50 of its knights with all of their 50 squires dressed in decent leather and armed with long swords. The third kingdom sends its only knight, an old and weary soldier, and his squire.

That night the knights of the first kingdom throw a feast and all drink extremely heavily. The men of the second kingdom also consume massive amounts of alcohol. But in the third k, the squire set up a pot and a noose off a tree branch and had a calm stew dinner with the knight. 

The next morning, the knights of the first and second kingdoms were too hungover to battle, and the knight of the third kingdom lacked the stamina, so they sent their squires instead. The battle raged, and when it ended, the only one standing was from the third kingdom.

he asks, 'Just out of curiosity, Miss. We can understand your

measuring tape for your height is obvious, but what were you doing when we asked you your name?'

his leg.

the door for her and just as she was about to

THE HUSBAND STORE

A store that sells new husbands has just opened in New York City, where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates. 

You may visit the store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the attributes of the men increase as the shopper ascends the flights. There is, however, a catch: you may choose any man from a particular floor, or you may choose to go up a floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building! 

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband... 

On each floor the signs on the doors read: 

Floor 1 - These men have jobs. 

Floor 2 - These men have jobs and love kids.

Floor 3 - These men have jobs, love kids, and are extremely good looking. ""Wow,"" she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. She goes to the fourth floor and sign reads: 

Floor 4 - These men have jobs, love kids, are drop-dead good looking and help with the housework. ""Oh, mercy me!"" she exclaims, ""I can hardly stand it!"" Still, she goes to the fifth floor and sign reads: 

Floor 5 - These men have jobs, love kids, are drop-dead gorgeous, help with the housework, and have a strong romantic streak. She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor and the sign reads: 

Floor 6 - You are visitor 3,261,496,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store. 


THE WIFE STORE 

Floor 1 - has wives that love sex. 

Floor 2 - has wives that love sex and have money. 

The third through sixth floors have never been visited.",Husband/Wife store (Long),8

lying on the beach who is surrounded by adoring women.
