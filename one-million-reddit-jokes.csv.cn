Many tried, unsuccessfully. Finally, one young brave declared that the third wife had given birth to twin boys.

And every year the carnival roll into town and have these $50 helicopter rides. He always wanted to take one of these helicopter rides but his wife told him they weren’t going to waste money on it. Then one year when they’re both in their late 60s the man turns to his wife and tells her: 

“Mabel, I’m in my twilight years and I ain’t leaving this damn carnival until I get a helicopter ride”

“No Harold! Fifty dollars is fifty dollars!”

Then a loud argument ensues, to which the whole carnival could hear. However, the pilot of the helicopter over hears these two people arguing about the helicopter ride and he sees an opportunity. 

“Hey you two!” He said “If you two can get on and stay quite, the whole thing is free. But if one of you makes the slightest noise...well....fifty dollars is fifty dollars.”

Well, the old man took up that deal,  and they both set off in the helicopter. Well, the pilot wants to get that $50 and he starts doing twirls, spins, and all sorts of tricks in order to get this money. However, not a sound from either of them. By the time the pilot lands is playing, he’s exhausted.

“Jesus, y’all sure were quite throughout that ride.”

Then Harold spoke.

“We’ll I would’ve told you Mabel fell out of the plane 10 minutes ago but fifty dollars is fifty dollars.”",Fifty dollars is fifty dollars.,9

1. A number from 1-6 is assigned to each player
2. A die is rolled, and whoever has the number that corresponds to the number rolled is the dealer
3. Each player then draws a card to determine who is a Jedi and who is a Sith Lord. There is only one Sith Lord.
4. There are two main decks, one with the numbers -13 to 13, excluding zero, repeated twice, and the other with the same numbers except they're all absolute values and also repeated twice.
5. The dealer gets to choose whether or not to shuffle the two decks together, or only use one deck. This choice is made while all the other players close their eyes. The dealer deals around until they're out of cards.
6. The goal of the game is to guess which player is the Sith
7. To be able to guess, people play cards (In a clockwise order from the dealer) and try to get the numbers to add up to exactly -30 or 30 (any player who makes the total number go over or under busts and the total restarts at zero)
8. Once either number is reached, the player who added the last card gets to guess the Sith.
9. If the guess is correct, the Jedi win and the game is over. If not, the guesser is out and the gameplay continues until either the Sith Lord is guessed or there are only two people left, in which case the player who is the Sith wins

In this round, Anakin is assigned the dealer. Then everyone chooses the card that determines their status as Sith or Jedi. Everyone else closes their eyes as Anakin deals out the cards. When he is finished, everyone opens their eyes and they start playing. Obi-Wan plays the card that brings the total of the pile up to 30, and calmly points at Anakin and declares, ""You are the Sith Lord.""

Surprised, Anakin asks his master, ""How could you tell?""

""It's quite simple,"" Obi-Wan replies. He uses the force and reveals everyone's cards including his own. ""Only a Sith deals in absolutes.""","Obi-Wan, Anakin, Yoda, and Master Windu are playing a card game.",0

Of course, the wife promptly hacked her first shot right through the window of the biggest house adjacent to the course. 

The husband shouted , ""I warned you to be careful! Now we'll have apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us."" 

So the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. 

A warm voice said, ""Come on in."" When they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the broken window. 

A man reclining on the couch asked, ""Are you the people that broke my window?"" 

""Uh...yeah, sir. We're sure sorry about that,"" the husband replied. 

""Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you. You see, I'm a ghost, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll Give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for myself."" 

""Wow, that's great!"" the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, ""I'd like a million dollars a year for! the rest of my life.""

""No problem,"" said the ghost. ""You've got it, it's the least I can do. And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!"" 

""And now you, young lady, what do you want?"" the ghost asked. ""I'd like to own a gorgeous home complete with servants in every country in the world,"" she said. 

""Consider it done,"" the ghost said. ""And your homes will always be safe from fire,burglary and natural disasters!"" 

""And now,"" the couple asked in unison, ""what's your wish, ghost?"" 

""Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have your wife."" 

The husband looked at his wife and said, ""honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?"" 

She mulled it over for a few moments and said, ""You know, you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?"" 

""You know I love you sweetheart,"" said the husband. 

""I'd do the same for you!"" So the ghost and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon. The ghost was insatiable. 
After about three hours of non-stop fun, the ghost  looked directly into her eyes and asked, ""How old are you and your husband?"" 

""Why, we're both 35,"" she responded breathlessly.

On her way home, she stops at a news stand to buy a newspaper. Before leaving, she says to the clerk, ‘I hope you don’t mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?”.

‘About 32,’ is the reply.’

‘Nope! I’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily.

A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.

The girl replies, ‘I’d guess about 29.’ The woman replies with a big smile, ‘Nope, I’m 50.’

Now she’s feeling really good about herself. She stops at a candy shop on her way down the street.

She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.

The clerk responds, ‘Oh, I’d say 30.’

Again she proudly responds, ‘I’m 50, but thank you!’

While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.

He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going. Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

Stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘That was incredible, how could you tell?’

‘I was behind you at McDonalds’.",Probably a blonde!,52

Genie says, ""I will grant each of you three wishes. What will they be?""

The first man says, ""I wish for a billion dollars."" Immediately, he is given a paper showing his account balance to be 1,000,000,000 dollars.

The second man says, ""I wish to be the richest man in the world."" He too is given a paper showing his bank account balance, well over 100 billion dollars. 

The third man has been thinking about his wishes, and when the genie turns to him, he says, ""I wish for my right arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" His arm begins to rotate.

Genie says, ""Ok... Now what will be your second wishes?""

The first man says, ""I wish to have the most beautiful woman in the world as my wife."" A woman appears and wraps herself around him.

The second man says, ""I wish to be the most handsome man in the world so that I can have every woman I want."" The first man's wife immediately begins to flirt with him.

The third man says without hesitation, ""I wish for my left arm to rotate counterclockwise for the rest of my life."" His left arm begins rotating in the opposite direction of his right.

The genie says, ""All right, this is your last wish. Make it count.""

The first man thinks for a bit and says, ""I wish to never get sick or hurt again."" The ache in his legs from hiking and his slight cough vanish.

The second man thinks for a while and eventually says, ""I wish to stay 22 years old forever.""

The first two men then look at the third man, wondering what his third wish will be.

The third man thinks for a long time, and says, ""I wish... for my head to nod back and forth for the rest of my life.""

The three men then agree to meet up again in 15 years to see how each of them were doing.

*15 years later*

The first man appears extremely happy. ""I have a wonderful life,"" he said. ""I live in a 3 story mansion and have donated half my money to charity, my wife is a freak in the sheets, and I haven't gotten so much as a cold in 15 years.""

The second man, looking the same as he had the day they found the genie, smiles, ""I haven't aged a day, I have my own private island, and you're right, your wife is pretty good in bed.""

The third man walks up, arms flailing, head bobbing wildly, and says, ""Guys, I think I screwed up.""",Three men come across a genie,4

Soon, the king's tiny hut was rigged with an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys. He could lower the huge throne for use during the day, and at night, he could haul the throne up, and lower his bed. This was truly the best of both worlds for the king.

Unfortunately, after a few months of constant use, the ropes frayed, and one night, the throne slipped and came crashing down on the king, killing him. The wise men of the island recognized a lesson in this experience and added to the lore of their people this statement: ""People who live in grass houses should not stow thrones.""","There was once an island kingdom whose people were all fabulously wealthy.

The man groans, but the doctor goes on… ""You do have £9,000 in insurance compensation coming though, and we now have the technology to build a new penis. They work great but they don't come cheap. It's roughly £1,000 an inch.

The man perks up. So, the doctor says, ""You must decide how many inches you want. But understand that you have been married for over thirty years and this is something you should discuss with your wife. If you had a five incher before and get a nine incher now, she might be a bit uncomfortable. If you had a nine incher before and you decide to only invest in a five incher now, she might be disappointed. Ill give you the night to consider your options.""

The doctor comes back the next day, ""So, have you spoken with your wife?”

""Yes I have,"" says the man.

""And has she helped you make a decision?”

""Yes,"" says the man.

""What is your decision?"" asks the doctor.

“Something for this I have.” Yoda says. He reaches into his bag and takes out a bunch of regular dinner table forks and a roll of duct tape.

He tapes several forks together to make a bridge and lays it down, allowing the two of them to get across.

When they get back to Yoda’s hovel, they find that some creature has chewed a hole in the fence around Yoda’s garden.

“Something I have for this.” Yoda says again. Once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole.

Yoda and Luke return to Yoda’s home, where Yoda looks through his bag. He’s used all his forks but one, he discovers.

“That’s ok Master."" Luke says, wanting to be helpful. “I’ll write us a note reminding us to buy more.”

So he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board.

He looks down at Yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror.

“Master Yoda!” he asks. “What did I do wrong?”

Yoda replies sagely, “A Jedi uses the forks for no ledge and the fence. Never for a tack!”","Yoda and Luke are walking through the swamp. Part of their usual training course involves shimmying along a cliff ledge, but today, there’s a long break in the ledge they can’t cross...",25013

Hubby and I felt sorry for her so we put her in a carrier and took her to the vet. We didn't know what to call her so we named her 'Pussycat.' The vet decided to keep her for a day or so. He said he would let us know when we could come to get her.

My hubby (the complainer) said, 'OK, but don't forget to wash her, she stinks.' He reminded the vet that it was his WIFE (me) that wanted the dirty cat, not him.

My hubby and my Vet don't see eye to eye.
The vet calls my hubby 'El-Cheap-O,' and my hubby calls the vet 'El-Charge-O.' They love to hate each other and constantly 'snipe' at one another. It's a contest of who can get the better of the other.

The next day my hubby had an appointment with his doctor, who is located in the same building, next door to the vet.

The Dr's waiting room and office was full of people waiting. A side door opened and the vet leaned in - he had obviously seen my hubby arrive.

He looked straight at my hubby and in a loud voice said,

'Your wife's pussy doesn't stink any more. We washed and shaved it, and now she smells like a rose! Oh, and, by the way, she's pregnant! God only knows who the father is!'

THEN HE CLOSED THE DOOR.",A lost cat,330

I am **94** years old.

**Defense Attorney:**  
Will you tell us, in your own words, what happened the night of **April 1st?**  
   
**Little Old Lady:**  
There I was, sitting there in my swing on my front porch on a warm spring evening,   
when a young man comes creeping up on the porch and sat down beside me.  
 

**Defense Attorney:**  
Did you know him?  
 

**Little Old Lady:**  
No, but he sure was friendly.  
 

**Defense Attorney:**  
What happened after he sat down?  
 

**Little Old Lady:**  
He started to rub my thigh.  
 

**Defense Attorney:**  
Did you stop him?  
 

**Little Old Lady:**  
No, I didn't stop him.  
 

**Defense Attorney:**  
Why not?  
 

**Little Old Lady:**  
It felt good.  
Nobody had done that since my Albert died some 30 years ago.  
 

**Defense Attorney:**  
What happened next?  
 

**Little Old Lady:**  
He began to rub my breasts.  
 

**Defense Attorney:**  
Did you stop him then?  
 

**Little Old Lady:**  
No, I did not stop him.  
 

**Defense Attorney:**  
Why not?  
 

**Little Old Lady:**  
His rubbing made me feel all alive and excited.   
I haven't felt that good in years!   
 

**Defense Attorney:**   
What happened next?  
 

**Little Old Lady:**  
Well, by then, I was feeling so 'spicy' that I just laid down and told him,  
'Take me, young man. Take me now!'  
 

**Defense Attorney:**  
Did he take you?  
 

**Little Old Lady:**  
Hell, no!  
He just yelled, **'April Fool!'**   
And that's when I shot him, the little bastard.",Grandma in Court,25

He was brought before a judge who was a notorious cat lover. The jury consisted of only elderly spinsters. The man's lawyer requested for a different judge and jury, but his request was rejected. The court found the man ""extremely guilty and a possible dog lover"". He was sentenced to 4 months in prison.

The man was given an early parole hearing due to good behaviour. Unfortunately, he got the samw judge and jury. His lawyer demanded for a change again and was rejected again. Furthermore, the judge sentence the man to 4 more months for ""contempt"". 

3 months later he was given another early parole hearing for good behaviour. Once again he got the same judge and jury. Once again his lawyer requested a change. Once again the request was rejected. Once again the man was sentenced to 6 more months of prison. This time for ""looking rudely at juror no. 4's cat"".

This cycle kept on repeating month after month, year after year. 6 months turned to 8 turned to 10 turned to a year. And so 30 years had passed. The  same situation was repeated again except this time the man was fighting the case himself. His lawyer had died of shame 2 years ago. When the court once again declared him guilty and sentenced him to an even longer term, he couldn't hold it any longer.

How many people have sex everyday?  The people who raised their hands where happy good looking and seemed to be doing great in there lives.

Doctor says good,

Then he asks how money people have sex every other day?

The people who raised there hands where also good looking and doing well but not like the first batch.

Doctor says good let’s keep going!

How many people have sex once a week?

Few people raised there hands and they where kinda ho hum they where ok not ugly long time married types 

Ok good the doctor says!

How many people have sex once a month?

Very few raised there hands they where homely,  not attractive some even looked like they would have to pay for even to have sex once a month.  They where unhappy and you could tell.

Ok good the doctor say!  Last question how many people have sex once a year?


One guy stands up and he is happy, just in the best mood.

Doctors says what the hell?   You only have sex once a year?  My theory is that people who have sex more often are happier!  Why the hell are you so happy????

Well she doesn’t believe this so she asks another man who has 4 feathers in his head dress, he states the same answer, how many women he sleeps with. 

Not accepting this answer either she decides to take it straight to the top, the chief. She asks the chief the same question, he has many feathers in his head dress, his answer is “Big or small, short or tall, I fuck em all!”  Barbara is shocked and exclaims “Oh dear!”  The chief looks here dead in the eye and says “Oh no, no fuck deer, mother fuckers run too fast and asshole too tight!”

This time the camera pans out from a Roman standing with his arms folded to show Jesus on the cross. The Roman looks up at him and says, ""Wilson's Nails, they'll hold anything."" Wilson is beside himself. ""You don't understand. I don't want anything with Jesus on the cross! Now listen, I'll give you one last chance.

The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulation requiring that family unity be maintained to the highest degree possible.
The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him.
After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.
After two recesses to check legal references and confer with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Miami Dolphins, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone.",In the Best Interest of the Child...,38

The man takes the gun, steps around the desk and enters the next room. Ready to fire the gun he realizes that the gagged person tied to a chair in front of him is his wife. For about two minutes there is silence. Then, the man and his wife come out, sobbing and hugging each other. The man puts the gun back on the desk. All he can utter is: ""I am sorry.""
When the next recruit takes his turn, everything happens in a quite similar manner except for the fact that he is furious at the people who asked him to kill his wife. What he said to the agent upon returning his gun is not to be repeated here.
Now there is only one recruit left: the woman. She takes the gun, steps around the desk and proceeds into the next room, closing the door behind her to face her husband. For about five minutes no sound seems to escape the little room but then it seems to turn into a war zone: screams, breaking and bursting, and finally a thud.
The woman comes out of the room. Alone. Her clothes are torn, and her face is scratched. She places the gun back on the desk and says: ""Sorry it took so long. That damn gun was not loaded. I had to beat him to death with the chair.""",The CIA is testing recruits,17

A Mafia Godfather finds out that his bookkeeper, Guido, has cheated him out of $10,000,000.00

 
His bookkeeper is deaf. That was the reason he got the job in the first place.

 
It was assumed that Guido would hear nothing so he would not have to testify in court.

 
When the Godfather goes to confront Guido about his missing $10 million, he takes along his 
lawyer who knows sign language.

 
The Godfather tells the lawyer, ""Ask him where the money is!""

 
The lawyer, using sign language, asks Guido, Where's the money?

 
Guido signals back, ""I don't know what you are talking about.""

 
The lawyer tells the Godfather, ""He says he doesn't know what you're talking about."" 

 
The Godfather pulls out a pistol, puts it to Guido's head and says, ""Ask him again or I'll kill him!""

 
The lawyer signals to Guido, ""He'll kill you if you don't tell him.""

 
Guido trembles and signals, ""OK! You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the 
shed at my cousin Bruno's house.

 
The Godfather asks the lawyer, ""What did he say?""

 
The lawyer replies, ""He says fuck you, you don't have the balls to pull the trigger.""",A DEAF ITALIAN BOOKKEEPER,121

 When I was 17, I went on a class trip to a beach but I snuck away to explore on my own. I went into this bar. It had nautical stuff on the wall, a bunch of shark jaws, but also streamers and balloons about the place. It looked like there was a party going on. Seated at the bar, I saw an old man with a peg leg, a hook for a hand, and an eye patch. The man looked exactly like a cliche pirate. My 17 year old self was gonna go meet that man if it was the last thing I did. There was a stool open next to him so I sat down.

“What’s the occasion?” I asked.

“Ay matey!” he said, just like I thought he would.

I didn’t think he had actually answered my question, but then the bartender brought him a large cake with two number candles, eight and zero, on top. The patrons sang to him and we all got cake. I congratulated him and almost asked about the codpiece with the steering wheel next to him, but then decided I didn’t want to know. “You seem quite popular. What do you do around here?” I asked.

“Oh, after years o’ sailing I retired here and started an ear piercing business. I charge a buccaneer.” He giggled at himself. “Sometimes, I prizefight.” he said. “I always win.”

“Yeah?”

“Yarr, they never see me right hook.” he giggled again. “I’m part of the 3.14% of sailors, ya know?” he said. I didn’t understand what he meant by that. We talk for a bit, then he starts to ask me some questions. 

“You know what happened to Bluebeard when he fell outta his boat in the Red Sea?”

“He was marooned?” I answered. 

“You’re alright there, laddie. Ya know what’s a pirate’s favorite letter?”

“R?” I asked, because that seemed the obvious answer.

“R, yeah- ye’d think it be that but a pirates first love be always the C” He chuckled at himself and then said, “Narr, I be kidding. It actually be P, because without the P, all pirates would just be irate.” We laughed for a bit and finally I mustered up the courage to ask: “So how’d you lose all those various parts of yourself.”

“Oof, well, the leg was bit off by a shark.”

“A shark?!”

“Aye, a shark.”

“That’s badass.”

“Yarr. Badass indeed, but surely painful.”

“Yes, yes of course. Sorry.”

“The new leg caught fire one time. I was burned to the ground.”

I wasn’t sure how to react to that, so I just asked: “What happened to your hand?”

“That story’s not so badass. Cinched a knot up wrong on me ship, sudden gale picked up and popped it right off.”

“Wow. “

“Yarr, I knew I was addicted to being a pirate that day.”

“Well yeah, clearly you were hooked.” I said. “What about your eye?”

“A bird pooped in it.” he answered.

“And you wear a patch because of that?”

“Well, it was the same day I got me hook.”

Suddenly shots of rum were being passed out, the management figured out I wasn’t old enough and kicked me out. It wasn’t until I rejoined my class that I understood what he meant about being in the “3.14 % of sailors.”",In honor of Talk Like a Pirate Day,6

Saul was a man of roving and adventurous disposition, always ready to travel and explore. One day, an itinerant *maggid* told him about a faraway country where onions were unknown. 

""No Onions!"" mused the Dreamer. ""Now what kind of pleasure can they derive from their food without onions? I'll go there and introduce this delicious vegetable."" 

Without any further delay he acquired a wagon-load of onions and started out for that country. It was a distant land and the journey took many months. 

Immediately upon his arrival he went directly to the royal court and asked for an audience with the emperor. 

""Your Highness, I bring you a new vegetable that possesses the unique quality of improving all food,"" began Saul. ""Even by itself it is a gourmet's delight. I urge you to try it. 

""Very well,"" agreed the monarch. ""But if this strange vegetable should prove injurious you will forfeit your head.""

The dinner at which the onions were to be served was a formal one. All the ministers of state, the nobles and high priests of the mighty realm, were invited. The dishes which contained the onions were tasted first by Saul the Dreamer, then by the slaves, and then, in turn, by the potentates and prelates. Finally the king tasted the new vegetable. The reaction among all was one of great enthusiasm. Serf and sovereign alike pronounced it most excellent in flavor and succulence. 

The monarch appropriated the wagon-load of onions for his court and gave Saul their weight in gold. 

When the adventurer returned home, a committee of prominent citizens gathered to congratulate im on his good fortune. For hours he told his curious *landsleit* of the splendor and magnificence he had witnessed in that distant land and mysterious country where gold was cheaper than onions. 

Fired by these tales, one enterprising individual, Kolboynik by name, conceived a plan by which he was certain to make even a bigger fortune than had Saul the Dreamer. Garlic, he figured, is not only more expensive than onions but infinitely more fragrant, so why not take a few sacks of that delicacy to the far-away land? Surely, if they would exchange gold for onions, they would give him the equivalent weight in diamonds! Whereupon he set out for that mystic country with a cargo of five bags or garlic. 

As dis Saul the Dreamer, he succeeded in inducing the king to give his innovation a trial. And, just as he had foretold, the garlic was relished much more than the onions. The monarch held a consultation with his ministers as to the form of recompense to be paid to this noble visitor.  Gold, they unanimously decided (and as Kolboynik had guessed), would not be an adequate remuneration for such delectable food in which even God and the angels might take delight. Therefore, they decided to reward him with the most precious commodity in all their kingdom.

Kolboynik returned home with his reward- Five sacks of onions!",Merry Mishmash from old Europe [long] [Jewish humor saga],2

Adam's parents had moved to Hong Kong in from a small village in the Xinjiang province of China in search of a better life for them and their family.

However, due to a lack of proper education in their village, they struggled to find work and both ended up working as cleaners in a University, earning minimum wage and they struggled day to day to get by. However, they were loving parents, and gave everything they could to their children. Adam had a happy childhood, a better education, and loved his mother and father dearly. 

The day after completing his final school exams, young Adam's world was torn apart.His parents had been killed in a tragic boating accident while they we celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary. This devastated the teenager, he adored his parents and felt he has lost his whole world. He decided to go travelling to get away from the life in Hong Kong, where every day he was reminded of those he had lost. Using his meagre inheritance, he booked a ticket to London and packed a single bag, not looking back.

Adam lived the high life, working in hotels and bars, he travelled Europe, drinking and partying his sorrows away. After a good six months, he met a girl and settled in Amsterdam, which was as good a city for the young man as you can imagine. He was fed up with the lifestyle of hospitality work, and found an ad for a job as apprentice cheese maker, of all things, studying the profession under the tutelage of Franciscus Veltman, a cheese maker world renowned, his Edam especially was constantly voted the best in all of the Netherlands. As such they technique and recipe was a closely guarded secret, only known to Franciscus himself.

Things unfortunately faded away with the girl, as young love tends to do, however Adam had inherited his parents work ethic, and turned out to be a natural at making cheese. He and his mentor formed a close bond, with Franciscus, who was unable to have a family of his own, loved and looked after Adam as if he was his was his own son; and Adam himself looked up to him as a father. He had even finally taught Adam the secret Edam recipe, strengthening the bond between the two.

With the help of Adam, Franciscus' business went from strength to strength, and after 3 years, he decided to take well deserved vacation for the first time in decades, such was his dedication to Caseiculture, safe in the knowledge that his livelihood was in good hands with Adam at the helm. He booked himself on a week long cruise down the Danube, as he'd always wanted to see the beauty of Budapest. 

Alas, tragedy struck again, as the cruise ship capsized, and Franciscus drowned in his cabin. For the second time on his still early life, Adam had been left heartbroken. He couldn't bring himself to stay in Amsterdam, packed his things and moved back to Hong Kong.

Never one to be fully hindered by adversity, Adam used his skills and started his own cheese shop in his hometown. Again, thanks to Adam's hard work, talent and dedication, this was a roaring success, he made cheeses from all over the world that delighted the taste buds off anyone who tried them. As a tribute to dear old Franciscus, he however never sold his world famous Edam, only keeping it to make at home and treat those nearest to his heart. Despite constant calls from cheese lovers the world over who had tasted the Edam in Holland, Adam never wavered, and the cheese was never sold to the baying public.

Adam at this point fell in love with the daughter of the owner of the florist next door to his shop, a beautiful young lady called Chen. He finally plucked up the courage to ask Chen out, ask took her to the finest restaurant in Hong Kong. Chen fell for Adam's wit and charm, and before long they were married in a lavish ceremony. 

Six months of marital bliss later, Chen becomes pregnant. Adam is delighted, with his life finally coming together. When Chen goes into labour, Adam rushes to the hospital. Ten painful hours later, and Chen gives birth, not to a child, but to a deer! Everyone is in shock, and experts the world over descend on Hong Kong to witness this miracle of science, but no one can explain it.

Nevertheless, Adam and Chen treat the deer as if it was human, and in a fitting tribute name him Franciscus after his mentor and father figure, but along the way, shorten it to Frank for ease. Young Frank, despite the media attention, lives a sheltered childhood, and learns to walk, speak, goes to school, and leads as normal a life as an anthropomorphic deer could do.

Adam continues to run his now thriving cheese business, and still keeps the masterful Edam just for special occasions with his new family, and Frank adores it, counting down the days until the next event when Adam brings it out to share.

Frank continues his education, but a final tragedy was awaiting Adam. Chen, while out on a sailing holiday in the South China Sea with her now retired parents, fell overboard and was killed by a shark attack. 

Adam, after another cruel accident taking another loved one, cannot take anymore, and moves back to his parents village in Xinjiang, as far away from any large water sources as possible. He lives as a recluse, hiding away from the world in grief and sorrow. 

It's left to young Frank to run the cheese business. He, unfortunately, is not as adept at cheese making or running a business as his father, and the company starts to struggle. Realising this, he writes to his father for the legendary Edam recipe to sell to help revive the fortunes. His father, now a stubborn, grouchy soul, steadfast refuses out of tribute to Franciscus. 

Frank continues to just about keep the business afloat for the next few years, but every six months sends the same letter to his father asking for the recipe that could turn around his fortunes, but is constantly refused.

Finally, Frank hears word that Adam is on his death bed, his grief stricken body as succumbed to cancer. Frank rushes to Xinjiang, to find Adam in a terrible state, with only hours to live. After a long and tearful goodbye, Frank again asks for the recipe. 

Adam, gives him a long look up and down, and says with his dying breath ""I don't know how many times I have to tell you this, but Frank Lee, my deer, I don't give Edam.""",Adam Lee was born to family in Hong Kong,16

_*They missed the R! They missed the R! They missed the bloody R!""*_
His forehead is all bloody and bruised and he is crying uncontrollably. The young monk asks the old Abbot, ""What's wrong, father?"" 
With a choking voice, the old Abbot replies, ""The word was _*CELEBRATE*_!""",A New Monk,14
