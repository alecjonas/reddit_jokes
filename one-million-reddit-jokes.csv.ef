One of the things that he finds most fascinating about the culture is that they believe that every object in the universe belongs to one of their pantheon of gods.

Even more interestingly, the names of these gods are all similar - Azi, Abi, Arti, Ani, etc. (The vowel sounds are all pronounced in a similar fashion to the ""Arby"" in ""Arby's restaurant,"" except that the emphasis is on the *second* syllable rather than  the first.)

Eventually, the American (who, due to the immersion factor he is experiencing, has mastered their language better than they've mastered English) has to leave for the States, and offers to take one of the natives of the culture he is studying with him. One young man is particularly excited about the prospect, and agrees to go to America.

The young man finds himself with the weighty but honorable responsibility of designating which American objects belong to which of his native gods.

Upon arriving at his first major airport, he tells his guide in halting but earnest English, ""That...is Azki plane.""

When the anthropologists takes the young man to New York City, he sees the Empire State Building and carefully intones, ""That is Abi building.""

The young man finally gets the chance to visit a Midwestern farm. He obviously feels a little more at home away from all the bustle of the city. He sees a fencepost and confidently exclaims:

“Erm, yes, ah, that’s right Father. It’s um, called a fucker fish.”

In fact, that error would be continued in all of the subsequent copies.

He's having an amazing time, although trailing behind in the leaderboards, he's still came in the final 8.  Before the final race in Spain his Crew chief tells him to be carful around these turns as there mountains are very dangerous and you never know what's around them. Being the young rookie he is, he agrees but brushes it off and gets to the starting line. 

The final 8 drivers line up on the starting line awaiting the pistol, and with a pop, the race begins! The young racer is keeping up with the pack, but being the first time driving this course he starts to slowly slip behind until he can't see any of the other racers. This obviously upsets him so he steps on the gas and begins taking the turns even faster and harder. He's making up time until he comes around a hairpin turn and has to slam on his brakes, almost colliding with another car. ""What the hell are you all doing!!"" He screams to himself as he sees all 7 other drives parked in the road, waiting in line.

At the front of the line he sees the first driver is busy talking to a old lady waving a stick at him on the side of the road. After a moment he thinks to himself that this must be some kind of joke the other drives are playing on him, so he swerves around them and races past, going so fast the air ruffles the old lady's hair. He gains a huge lead and comes in first, minutes before any of the other drivers. 

As the other drivers come in, the young American slowly and cockily makes his way to the podium to accept his trophy. But as he's standing there he sees the race coordinator talking to his Crew chief, who signals him to come over. He explains that the woman he blew past was the town's shaman, and he didn't get her blessings to drive these roads how every other driver had, so he was disqualified. ""What! That's stupid! We'd never have such a dumb rule back in America!"" He exclaims. ""I'm sorry man, different country, different rules."" His Crew chief says to him and he lays a hand on his shoulder.

During lunch at work, I ate 3 plates of beans (which I knew I shouldn't). When I got home, my husband seemed excited to see me and exclaimed delightedly, ""Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight."" He then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, ""Happy Birthday!""",A rip-roaring surprise!!,5

 on the beaches in Montego Bay , Jamaica .

Their domestic tranquility had long been the talk of

the town. People would say, 'What a peaceful &amp;

loving couple' The local newspaper reporter was

inquiring as to the secret of their long and happy

marriage.

The Husband replied: 'Well, it dates back to our

honeymoon in America ,' explained the man. 'We

visited the Grand Canyon, in Arizona , and took a

trip down to the bottom of the canyon, by horse. We

hadn't gone too far when my wife's horse stumbled

and she almost fell off. My wife looked down at the

horse and quietly said, 'That's once.' 'We proceeded

little further and her horse stumbled again. Again

my wife quietly said, 'That's twice.' We hadn't gone

half-mile when the horse stumbled for the third

time my wife quietly removed a revolver from her

purse and shot the horse dead.

I SHOUTED at her, 'What's wrong with you, Woman! Why

did you shoot the poor animal like that, are you

crazy?' She looked at ME, and quietly said, 'That's

once.'

And from that moment..... we have lived happily

every after.'",A couple was celebrating their wedding anniversary,3

Ivan agrees, Put his cap on backwards, and kicks in the door while stumbling from the vodka... The Officer closes the door behind him and listens closely.

when the bar door opened and the most gorgeous hunk of a man she had ever seen entered.

He was tall, muscular, and handsome, with thick dark hair and beautiful, sparkling green eyes,

and his every movement was so masculine and sensuous that the woman could not help but stare.

The man noticed that he was the object of the woman’s rapt attention,

and with a sly, sexy smile, approached her.

Blushing, she prepared to apologize for staring, but he leaned close and whispered in her ear.

“I’ll do anything,” he whispered in a deep, soft voice.

“Anything, absolutely anything you want, anything you have ever fantasized, for fifty dollars.

There’s just one condition…”

Trembling with anticipation, the woman asked him the condition.

The man said, “You have to tell me what you want me to do in just three words.”

The women gazed into his hypnotic eyes, considering the proposition,

then reached into her handbag and took out fifty dollars.

She scribbled her address on a napkin, folded it around the cash, and pressed it into his waiting hand.

She leaned over and whispered into his ear…

He is an excellent student but tends to get caught up in the strictness of the scientific method.

""It's all very well to engage in formal theorising, and precise calculation, and rigorous methodology,"" he says, ""but sometimes it's good to shake things up a bit. Be a little informal, curious, experimental. Playful, even.""

""O-kay..."" said the student. ""What do you propose?""

The teacher takes out a metal bracelet and says: ""How would you determine if this fits me?""

""Well,"" says the student, ""I suppose I could measure its diameter and compare that to the diameter of your wrist along its widest axis?""

""Yes, yes, sure,"" replies the teacher. ""But... why not just try it on? Fast. Simple. It may work, it may not. Don't underestimate the virtue of trial and error.""

""Oh, yeah,"" the student replies, ""of course.""

The student pushes the bracelet over the teacher's hand. It's a tight fit, but he gets it on without too much difficulty. ""Yeah, you can get it on OK,"" he says.

""Now,"" says the teacher, ""how would you determine if you could get it off again?""

""Oh, that's easy,"" says the student. ""As it went on successfully, and both the bracelet and your hand are experimental constants, it logically follows that you can get it off again.""

""Well,"" says the teacher, ""remember we're trying out experimental approaches here. Just seeing what works and what doesn't...""

""Ah, OK,"" says the student. ""So I'll just pull it off then.""

He grabs the bracelet and expectantly tugs at it, but is surprised to discover it can't be so easily taken off. It gets caught in folds of the teacher's skin and won't budge.

“Oh friendly milkman, won’t you do us a favor? This is a week of quiet reflection and prayer, and we are thus not permitted to leave the convent. However, we love our omelets. Would you be so kind as to bring us some fresh eggs tomorrow?”

“But of course,” replied the kind milkman, “it would be my pleasure.” After all, he had a regular delivery of eggs to the local baker so it would be at most a minor inconvenience. 

The next day, the milkman packed up two dozen eggs - one for the nuns and one for the baker. He delivered first to the nuns. However, while waiting for the mother superior in the kitchen, a beautiful young nun approached him flirtatiously. She smiled and winked and began tracing her finger seductively around one of the eggs, staring into the milkman’s eyes. He recoiled nervously and, in doing so, caused the egg to fall to the floor and crack. The young nun ran off giggling. The milkman picked up the eggshell and put it back in the carton. 

Now, the crack was a small one, barely noticeable, but the yolk had poured out nonetheless. Embarrassed, the milkman hurried off and started toward the baker’s instead. But the mother superior chased after him down the road and he reluctantly stopped to face her. 

“What about our eggs?” she insisted.

“Sorry, here they are, sister,” replied the milkman, handing her the carton.

“It feels a bit light,” she noted, picking up the empty eggshell. “What happened here?”

Finally, he started the car, switched the wipers on and off (it was a dry night), flicked the hazard flasher on and off, tooted the horn, and then switched on the lights.

At last ( when almost everyone had left) he pulled out of the parking lot &amp; started to drive slowly down the street.

 

The police officer, having patiently waited all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, promptly pulled the man over and carried out a breathalyser test.

The cashier comes to him and asks him what he wants, to which the man tells him his problem. ""I have a special toy just for you"" the cashier tells the man. They both go to the back room and the cashier pulls out a black velvet box. He opens it and there's a golden dildo inside it. 

""What's so special about this?"" asks the man. ""Check this out"" replies the cashier and says ""Voodoo Dildo, the door"".

To his delight, the hotel is exactly as it was all those years ago, with the only exception being that the room now has a computer. So he decides to type an email to his wife. But in his excitement he forgets one letter in the email address. One letter.

Meanwhile, in a different part of the world, a widow is returning from her late husbands funeral. She arrives home, grief stricken and mourning. She decides to check her email.

The emails are what you'd expect, the usual condolences from family and friends, the ""sorry for your loss"" messages and comforting emails from her loved ones. With the exception of one...

The title of the email, ""To my dearest wife...""
Sceptical, she opens the email. It reads:

""To my dearest wife,
It was such a shame I had to leave you behind today..."" 

""I was surprised when I got here to find they've got computers now so you can send emails! I just thought I'd let you know I got here safely""

At this point the widow doesn't know what to make of this, but with tears in her eyes, she continues.

""Everyone here is very friendly and the room is lovely... And I'm looking forward to seeing you here tomorrow... Until then, my love, be safe and I'll see you soon""

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Mufti looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Mufti pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Mufti pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Mufti was too clever.

As the night progresses the bartender sees them leave. A couple hours pass and the man returns covered in lashes and bite marks. The bartender raises an eyebrow and the man says ""forget about the recite for the air conditioner next time just tell them I am a feble caring man."" 

A couple days pass and the man returns to the bar which was unusually busy that night. The man sees a fine looking young curvy brunette inquiring about him to the bartender who responded as he was instructed. The brunette lookes to the man and gestured him over with a wave of a finger. Curious the man walks over and the brunette starts to walk out the door. The man follows thinking ""finally my luck has turned around."" The bartender sees them leave and after a couple hours pass the man returns and shuffles over to the bar pale as a ghost. He sits down and says ""next time tell me when there is a fucking drag show in town""",A Fairly Attractive Man Frequents a Bar,0

He leaves work that day, and instead of getting in his car he just starts walking through the city. He walks by a hot dog vendor. 

""Hey man, want a hot dog?"", asks the vendor.

""Uhhh. Well... I guess?"" He responds.

The Vendor makes the man a hot dog and asks what he wants on it.

""Oh, Uhmm. Uhhhhhh. Let me get.... uh. I dont know, uhh. Whatever you think.""

He pays for his hot dog, and walks away with a dog topped with relish, ketchup, and mustard. The man hates mustard but is unsure whether he should throw it away or give it to a homeless man.  He sits on a park bench, and watches the birds for a while, trying to figure out what to do.

He notices some young men with shaved heads and robes walking by. They notice his staring and stop to talk. They ask how he is doing, and begin a conversation. The man explains his situation as he eats his hot dog, and the robed men, who are actually monks, look at each other knowingly. They invite him to come with them to their monastery;

""There you will have the time to contemplate life, and look inside to hear what your heart has to say"", they urge.

&amp;#x200B;

The man is unsure, but eventually, the monks convince him. Once he is at the monastery, the man meditates for many hours a day. After a couple of weeks at the monastery, it is his turn to return to the city to pick up supplies. While walking through the streets, he runs into his coworkers. They are shocked to see him robed and hairless, and begin asking questions. The man tells his coworkers that he thinks that maybe he has heard the voice within his heart, and it could possibly be the solution to all, or maybe most of his problems, he guesses. 

&amp;#x200B;

The coworkers can't help but ask ""Well, what is it?""

He was a young man then and they all knew that he would likely be long dead by the time they reached their destination. They said their tearful goodbyes and drifted off to sleep.

In the years he spent alone on the ship, he became adept at building small robots to help him complete his tasks. He formed relationships with the little bots, but he found he missed the companionship of real humans. He would take small stints in the cryogenic chambers in order to prolong his life, so as to complete his mission of getting his friends and family to their new home. He didn't want to wake anyone to take over his duties and suffer the loneliness of space travel. But a long life with no one real to talk to is lacking.

With his knowledge of robotics, he took it upon himself to build an artificial human. Something that looked real. Something that felt real. Something that would make the unbearable loneliness go away.

He didn’t feel right copying the likeness of any members of the sleeping crew, so he modeled the robot on himself. By the time he was done, there “he” was, a perfect replica of Jacques himself. He named the robot Jacques 2.0, because who else was there to get confused? And as he grew older, it would be easier to remember his own name, he figured.

Well, years passed as they are wont to do. He grew old and frail on the journey, but Jacques 2.0 remained young and spry, helping his creator to complete the tasks the old man’s bones could no longer handle.

As the old man lay dying, he asked his robotic companion to do him a favor. He wanted his remains to be scattered among the stars, the asteroids, and the comets they passed. He did not want to be buried on a planet he would never see, but instead live on in the vastness of space that had become his home. So when the day finally came, Jacques 2.0 sent his creator’s ashes out of the airlock and into the universe.

But the journey was not over. Jacques 2.0 carried on his creator’s duties for years and helped the crew arrive on their new home. As the ship grew close to the planet, the crew began to wake up. One by one they woke from their long sleep and travelled to the observation deck to see their new home. When they arrived, though, they found themselves in complete shock. There was Jacques, as lively and youthful as ever, waiting for them.

“How can this be?” They asked. “Surely, you would at the very least be an old, old man by now. It has been so long since we left Earth.”

Jacques 2.0 raised his hands slightly in a calming gesture and said, “Do not worry. I am here to send you a message of love and care from Jacques. I was created to help him complete his mission. I may look like him, but in truth, I am not him. For you see,” and with this he gestured towards the stars and space above their heads, “the real Jacques is in the comets.”

The old man looks over the sleek, shiny red surface of the car and asks, ""What kind of car ya' got there, sonny?"" The young man replies, ""A 2001 Ferrari 360 Spider. They cost about a quarter of a million dollars!""

""That's a lot of money,"" says the old man, shocked. ""Why does it cost so much?"" ""Because this car can do over 200 miles an hour!"" states the cool dude proudly. The moped driver asks, ""Can I take a look inside?"" ""Sure,"" replies the owner.

So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around. Leaning back on his moped, the old man says, ""That's a pretty nice car, all right!""

Just then the light changes so the guy decides to show the old man what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds the speedometer reads 220 mph. Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer!

He slows down to see what it could be and suddenly, whhhoooossshhh! Something whips by him, going much faster! ""What on earth could be going faster than my Ferrari?!"" the young man asks himself.

Then, ahead of him, he sees a dot coming toward him. Whoooooosh! It goes by again, heading the opposite direction! And it almost looked like the old man on the moped!

""Couldn't be,"" thinks the guy. ""How could a moped outrun a Ferrari?!"" Again, he sees a dot in his rear view mirror! Whooooosh Ka-BbblaMMM! The moped plows into the back of his car, demolishing the rear end. The young man jumps out, and it IS the old man!!! Of course, the moped and the old man are hurting for certain. He runs up to the old man and says,

""You gotta tell me how you got that thing to be faster than my Ferrari!""

Even a small portion of their hamburger or steak seemed to remove her symptoms almost completely. And best of all, it was all derived from different flowers using special technologies: daisy, rose, sunflower, etc. It wasn't until she brought a new boyfriend there, who she was trying to turn to veganism, that things fell apart.

""Yeah, I work in accounting at the butcher that supplies this restaurant. They've been insisting that we only send them meat from cows and pigs with flower names.""

Deflated (and boyfriendless) Buttercup Sunshine avoided going out for months. And in that time, her problems started showing up again. Her doctor insisted that she try at least eggs, or she would suffer severe and permanent nerve damage.

Buttercup Sunshine left the doctor's and decided to try a Chinese place, figuring that Asian cuisine would have less meat in it. She looked at the menu, but her eyesight had already been affected, and she didn't have her reading glasses.

While asking questions, she decided to unload her problems on the waitress.

""So I'm trying to stay vegan, but if I do, I'm going to get sick. Do you people maybe have some special tofu or something that could help.""

The waitress didn't care, she was on her last day at the job, but being a dutiful seeker of tips, she wanted to satisfy the customer as best she could.

""Try General Tso,"" she suggested.

""Doesn't that have chicken in it?""

""No, no worries, no chicken.""

Desperate, Buttercup Sunshine ordered the food. She tried to convince herself that a waitress wouldn't lie about the food, so when it arrived, she was only a bit skeptical. But the batter looked like it surrounded something meaty, and being on frayed nerves, she called the waitress back.

""Are you sure this isn't chicken?""

""What, no. No chicken.""

""Then what is it.""

The waitress on her last day there, ""Tell you secret -- recycled mittens. Using secret special technology from Korea. Samsung, LG, you know?""

Mollified because she considered how technology worked a problem for someone else, Buttercup Sunshine ate her dish. And it was good. She felt full for the first time in months, feeling full of energy.

But in a week that energy boost had died down, and she was back at the restaurant.

Unfortunately, a notice from the food and health board of her city had been put up, and the restaurant was closed.

""Shame, really, they offered good money for strays.""

A smell was wafting her way. Behind her stood a homeless man. Frightened and out of her element, Buttercup Sunshine ran.

Maybe it was her weakened state, but it was a couple of hours before she realized what the man had meant.

Feeling sick and demoralized, Buttercup Sunshine walked the streets for days, only going home to sleep. Her phone died and she didn't care. She could never face her very vegan family. Finally, she disappeared altogether.

A week later, her sister came home from her high school. She was super excited.

""Mom, I gotta text sis. Is she picking up her phone? You wouldn't believe what they were serving for lunch today and what it was made out of!""

""It wasn't meat was it?""

""No, it was a 100% vegan meat substitute and super yummy. They used some kind of special technology that the old Soviets made but the Capitalists suppressed like daddy always says. I haven't felt this good after eating since forever.""

""Wait till your father finds out! What was it made out of then?""

""Sunshine and buttercups!""",Buttercup Sunshine was raised a strict vegan from birth [VERY LONG AND DARK],0

“Yes, that word,” says Johnny.  “And I’m gonna tell the bus driver you said that B word.”

So Johnny and Bubba board the bus, and Johnny whispers in the drivers ear what Bubba said. 

The bus driver turns around in his seat and demands that Bubba sits right behind him.  

As the bus get closer to the school, the driver tells Bubba he’s going to walk Bubba straight to the principle’s office. 

They arrive at the school, and the driver takes Bubba by his hand and walks him directly to the principle’s office. 

The driver tells the principle what Bubba said at the bus stop and the principle gasps.  “Bubba, how could you such things to your friends?”  “You are suspendes until further notice.  You need to walk home immediately.”

Bubba starts his short walk home, and as he is crossing the street to go to his house he gets hit by a car and killed.

 ""Shit, mate."" said the bloke as he listened to the story, trying not to stare at the Christmas bauble hanging off his mate's head. ""That explains the lump, what about the rest of you?"" he asked.

 ""Yeah, that"" his mate sighed and took a sip from his beer, ""I'd already finished my first beer and into the bar stomps this 150kg bikie. All leather and knuckles. You know the type.

**8 Years old**

As a kid I wanted a cat so my parents bought a 1 month old kitten for me and he was cheap due to his old owner had dyed the cats fur pitch black. I judged him not by the colour of his fur but by the content of his character. It didn't take long to find out that everyone one in the family were allergic to cats, except me. I had that cat for 2 days, and he only got 1 month and 2 days old because my dad said that he was in pain and that me and him got to put him out his misory. Dad stopped listening to my  ""silly arguments"".  I stopped my silly arguments because I was crying whilst dad tied multiple helium filled balloons to the cat. 

Dad laughed and said; Man up! That cat is going to heaven. He isn't going to die.

I saw him flying away and followed him. He couldn't get high into the sky due to the small amount of balloons. One hour had passed and he finally landed! I was exalted, for the moment atleast. Dad knew that I was going to retrieve the cat once it had landed. Dad killed the cat infront of me. 

**Back to the point:**

To be honest, I have no idea why I stole someones cat but what I do know is that I can no longer drink alcohol nor can I care for a cat. I haven't seen the cat since I stole him after a drunk night at the club which was 1 week ago. Thought he had managed to escape, until I found him inside my refrigerator. I recall that he seemed dead but was shaking a little. Dead or not, I seem to have thrown him out the window 5 stories down because I can see him flatten out through my window in the kitchen and there is fur &amp; cat sized poop in my refrigerator. Like father like son.",Yesterday I stole a someones cat,0

&amp;#x200B;

Where is my other dad?

I answered; Who? Im your dad.

He replied; Yes you are. But mommy told me that my other dad is a better dad than you. Please can you find him?

&amp;#x200B;

I could not wait and therefore chose to call my wife immediately, she answered and got the question. Who is the ""other dad"" that our son mentioned to me? I got hung up so I began snooping around in her clothes located in our bedroom. Finding nothing but mens wear got me worried but I kept calm and expected a good explanation when she comes home from work. Impatiently I spent the rest of the day waiting by the window where I can see our driveway. Finally her car is driving towards the house. Her tinted windows tell me it's her car before I even see the registration plate. She parked the car and as soon as the door opened up I opened the frontdoor to greet her. Once I walk towards the car I notice that something is very wrong because the driver is a man who somehow looks a bit like my wife. Asking who he was led to me fainting. Waking up inside our bedroom alone with a note, which said.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear husband,

You were home earlier than I had originally planned. I have been waiting for the perfect moment to tell you about everything that I have in my mind but not until you left with work did I realise that you would do all in your authority to prevent my actions. Because I find you as a bad rolemodel for our son who has more in common with me than you, I had to intervene. Therefore I cleverly came up with a brilliant plan; Instead of changing you into a better rolemodel which would still not be enough, I became the rolemodel. I no longer need you darling because I am you but a better version. I am no longer the mom who can't do what our sons father needs to do. From now on I am both you and myself, both mom and dad. I hope you understand what I mean by this and that you accept this in order for our son to not become a failiure. Me and our son is no longer reachable by you or any of our shared contacts because I have organized a new life for me and our son, new identities, new clothes, new friends, new daycare center and a new house. 

Love,

Your Dearest.

P.S I left a clue for you in your personal study,  if you still don't understand what I mean by becoming a mom and dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt cheated on and had no understanding whatsoever about her becoming a dad and mom. I found the ""clue"" which is nothing but a receipt from someone who has done a sex change but that did not make any sense to me. Feeling a bit like an investigator, I had to find more clues that fit into this puzzle. Finding the last piece of the puzzle was hard so I asked my good friend Tom who also is my neighbour.   


I told him everything that has to do with my wife leaving and after that,

 I said; I am absolutely sure now that she cheated on me because I am a bad rolemodel for our son and instead of talking with me, she left me for a better man.  


Tom said; Well it could be that too. 

I said; What do you mean? Has something else happened?

Tom said; Bro don't freak out but your wife went from woman to man. She or he, I don't know what to call your wife, has done a sex change which means that her vagina is a penis.

I totally freaked out and said; You are bullshitting. My wife would never do that. How dare you say such a thing to me your pal?

Tom said; Don't believe me? FINE! Here you go.

\*Hands his Iphone to me\*

I said; That's me naked on the frontporch. How and why did you take this photo?

Tom said; First of all that's not you. Secondly, that's your wife and her new dick. Thirdly I took the photo because I thought your house was being invaded by a lunatic but quickly realised that the lunatic was your wife. Last of all, you have always been stupid but you are really stupid. I understand why she did all of this and agree with her doing all of this. You're stupid, a bad fatherfigure and suck at being a husband. Not to mention that many I know have seen you buying ridiculous amounts of glue every fucking month, including me. You are abusing inhalants and have been doing that behind everyones back, including mine.

I said; You liar, stupid neighbour who only cares about collecting grass from your lawn. Okay I might be using glue every now and then but that is a secret none knows about. Your dad dissapeard 1 month ago, correct?

Tom nudged his head

I said; Yeah I was in a car accident that month. Me and my son were driving home but stopped for some ice cream and after that we got into the car to head home but there was this old man who ran after my car yelling cusswords towards me and my son for not paying with real money, stupid old man. I stopped the car, confronted the man with my fist to his face. He fell and showed no sign of being alive and therefore I just threw him into my trunk and then dumped him inside a old refrigerator that I found at the nearest dump. My son did not see anything but I did, I saw that it was your dad. That's right who's stupid now, Tom?

Tom said nothing. Instead he kicked me in the balls and called the police.

post,btzmhr,2qh72,jokes,false,1559047653,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/btzmhr/an_irish_peasant/,self.jokes,,"An Irish peasant named Kory Andrea grew up knowing nothing but potatoes. His dad farmed potatoes, and his dad farmed potatoes, all the way back a thousand years. He had spent the entirety of his first twenty years on this Earth farming and harvesting potatoes.

One day, as if suddenly, the potatoes stopped growing. Nothing could get them to grow. Not their homemade soil recipe, nor their special mixture of water and nutrients they sprayed on the soil his family had perfected over many centuries. It got so bad that Kory had to start stealing food just to survive. He started with just stealing a few items from his neighbors, but the thrill of thieving got him hooked. He soon became one of the most renowned thieves in all of Ireland, and had replenished much of his own food storages. He lived on the run for the next few years until the local constable arrested him. The county judge sentenced him to 20 years in prison for his crimes. 

Now at first, prison was horrible for him; he longer had his freedom. He couldn't do what he wanted, when he wanted. However, he soon got used to the monotony of the prison system, and after just a few short months, he actually began to enjoy his time there. He worked out every day and had three meals a day that he no longer had to scrounge and steal for. 

Now, the prison he had been sent to was prototyping a new way to generate power to control the prisoner cell blocks; instead of relying on candles and oil lamps for lighting, and mechanical levers for the doors, they had installed a new electrical rig that, when powered by the prisoners, would generate electricity. To convince prisoners to join the new project, the warden decided to incentivize participants with one extra potato per week. Kory eagerly signed up, knowing how delicious those precious potatoes might be. 

Fortunately for him, the warden picked him as one of the new recruits for his project. On the first day the new system was opened, he saw with his own eyes the magnanimity of the project. It was a massive wheel, laid on its side, that had poles sticking out of the sides for people to push. The wheel would turn various gears, which through the passing of other magnetic pieces, would produce electricity, a first of its kind in Ireland. 

He ran straight for the wheel, knowing that the harder he worked, the sooner he'd get his potatoes. The first week, he worked so hard he instantly became a sensation among this experimental crew. Sometimes, they would split the force into teams and see who could generate the most power. These competitions became a spectacle in and of themselves; Kory would almost always win. After one of the more exciting competitions, one of the other prisoners challenged him to turn the wheel by himself. He got up to the wheel, and began to push with all his might. The wheel didn't budge. He kept pushing, but the wheel still didn't budge. With one final push with all his might, he got the wheel to begin turning. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that is how the might o' Kory Andrea is the power house of the cells.",An Irish peasant,10

George had never been much close to his grandpa. But with his dying breath, grandpa told George “its the little things that matter in life.

He decided that a little presentation wouldn’t hurt. So he learned a few lines.
“A horse is an animal. It has 4 legs, one mouth, 2 ears. Its food mainly consists grass........”
Then he went to the nearest prop store and bought a costume and a horse mask.

He keeps to himself mostly, isolating himself in prayer and self-reflection with little care for the outside world. 


One day, the man notices it growing dark outside earlier than normal. He steps outside and feels the wind has picked up and the temperature has dropped. As the man is standing on his front porch, his neighbors bolt out of their house with suitcases in hand. As they run towards their car, they see the man standing alone.


“What are you doing just standing there?” one of the man’s neighbors yells out to him. “Don’t you know there’s a Category 5 hurricane coming in? The whole city is evacuating!”


The man smiles and calmly says to his neighbors “I am not afraid. My Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will take care of me.”


The neighbors, in disbelief, load up their car and flee down the road. Within hours, the rain starts to roll in and begin flooding the streets.


A few more hours pass and the streets are starting to completely flood. As the water levels approach 6 ft, the water begins to pour in through the man’s windows. Calm and focused, the man climbs up to his attic and out onto the roof to escape the rising floods. The rain has stopped but the waters continue to flood into the city. 


While sitting on his roof, the man notices a family in a boat passing by. The woman driving the boat sees the man on his roof and yells out to him. 


“Come get in the boat!” she shouts.  “The flooding is getting worse and you won’t be safe here much longer!”


The man smiles and calmly yells back to the family “I am not afraid. My Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will save me.”


The storm starts to pass, but the water levels continue to rise. The flooding becomes more severe, picking up cars and small trees as it rushes through the city. 


As the National Guard sends helicopters in to find survivors, one pilot notices the man stranded on his roof. A soldier drops a line from the helicopter and lowers himself to pick the man up.


“You have to come with me, now” the soldier says to the man. “A dam broke a few miles from here and the flooding is about get even worse. All of these houses are about to be demolished and completely washed away.”


The man smiles and calmly responds to the soldier “My Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will rescue me” and refused the soldier’s help.


The soldier, noticeably disturbed by the man’s reaction, acknowledges the man’s request and rushes off to help stranded survivors who actually want to escape.


As the helicopter flies off in the distance, the clouds part and the sun shines through directly onto the man. The man feels the sun’s warmth on his skin, opens his arms and exclaims “I’m ready to be saved, Lord!”


Suddenly, the waters surge beneath him, rising more quickly than the man is able to react. Without notice, the waters destroy the man’s roof around him and send a car flying on top of him. The man is crushed and killed instantly.


The man then opens his eyes, finding himself surrounded by white light. A figure approaches the man, extending a hand and revealing Himself to be Jesus Christ.


“My Lord!” exclaims the man. “You were supposed to save me! What happened?”


Jesus smiles at the man and calmly responds “My son, I tried. I sent a car, a boat, and a helicopter. You accepted none of them.”",A devout Christian man living in New Orleans refuses to leave his home after hearing news of an imminent hurricane and flood.,4
