And Dot Com was a comely woman, large of breast, broad of shoulder and long of leg.  Indeed, she was often called Amazon Dot Com.
 
And she said unto Abraham, her husband, ""Why dost thou travel so far from town to town with thy goods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy tent?""
 
And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, ""How, dear?""
 
And Dot replied, ""I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale, and they will reply telling you who hath the best price. The sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS).""
 
Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums.  And the drums rang out and were an immediate success.  Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever having to move from his tent.
 
To prevent neighboring countries from overhearing what the drums were saying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew.  It was known as Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS), and she also developed a language to transmit ideas and pictures - Hebrew to the People (HTTP).
 
And the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung.  They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Sybarites, or NERDS.  And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum dealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in the land. Indeed he did insist on drums to be made that would work only with Brother Gates' drum heads and drumsticks.
 
And Dot did say, ""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others."" And Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or eBay as it came to be known.  He said, ""We need a name that reflects what we are.""
 
And Dot replied, ""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.""  ""YAHOO,"" said Abraham. And because it was Dot's idea, they named it YAHOO Dot Com.
 
Abraham's cousin, Joshua, being the young Gregarious Energetic Educated Kid (GEEK) that he was, soon started using Dot's drums to locate things around the countryside.
 
It soon became known as God's Own Official Guide to Locating Everything (GOOGLE).
 
That is how it all began. And that's the truth.","How the Internet Started, According to the Bible",35

So the fish went about his business keeping an eye on the fly.
A bear walking along the pond sees the fish eyeing the fly and thinks. If that fly drops 6 inches the fish will go for the fly and I can grab the fish. So the bear crouches behind a bush and waits.

A little while later a hunter comes by the pond and sees the situation and thinks to himself if that fly were to drop just 6 inches then the fish would get the fly, the bear will go for the fish and I can get a clear shot on the bear. So the hunter sits down and starts to enjoy his lunch.

A small field mouse wanders up and looks over the situation and thinks to himself if that fly were to drop just 6 inches then the fish would jump to get the fly and the hunter would drop his cheese sandwich to take his shot so he could get the bear and I could run in and get a bit of his sandwich. And we would all be very happy.

Just about that time a sneaky sly cat wanders on to the situation and thinks to himself if that fly were to drop just 6 inches then the fish would jump to get the fly and the bear would go for the fish, the hunter would drop his cheese sandwich to get his gun to shoot the bear and the mouse would run in and get a bit of his sandwich. And I would run in get the mouse and we would all be so very happy.

A small time goes by and:

The fly drops 6 inches the fish jumps out to get the fly. The bear goes for the fish. The hunter drops his cheese sandwich to get his gun. The mouse runs in to get a bit of the cheese sandwich.  As the cat runs in, BOOM the hunter takes his shot and in all of the commotion the cat loses his balance and falls in the pond.

One by one he asks them each how they perished.

The first man: I live on the 6th floor of an apartment building in Manhattan, and for some months now I've been suspecting that my wife has been cheating on me.  I came home from work early today and find her in bed, fully naked and somewhat sweaty.  She insists she was just tired and hot, but I know the truth so I search the apartment.  I search and search, and I just can't find the guy who's been plowing her.  I give up and go out on my balcony for some air and to clear my head, and there the son of a bitch is, hanging from the bottom railing!  I was so angry I just started punching and kicking him, but he had some death grip or something; he just wouldn't let go.  I take off my shoe and I start beating his hands with it, and he eventually drops.  In my rage at my wife and at the horrible mess that is my life, I grabbed my refrigerator and hurled it over the balcony as well.  I then had a heart attack and died from the over exertion.

Saint Peter nods that this is indeed a horrible death, so the man is allowed to enter Heaven.

The second man:  I live on the 7th floor of an apartment building in Manhattan, and I was out on my balcony for some air and enjoying the view as I always do after work, but when I leaned against my railing it came loose and I fell.  I was able to grab on to the bottom railing of the balcony below mine, where I clung for dear life praying someone would come rescue me.  Eventually someone came, but to my dismay he started punching and kicking me.  I held on for as long as I could, but when he took off his shoe and started hitting my fingers I eventually fell.  Somehow I managed to land in some bushes and I was just stunned.  I started to get up but then a refrigerator fell on me and squashed me.

Saint Peter again agrees that this is horrible, so the man is allowed entry.

The third man:  Okay so picture this right?  I'm naked in a refrigerator...",Three men stand at the Pearly Gates,71

The US army is leading a charge towards the border in order to finish the job and end the war. A battalion of troops, blitzing through northern Kuwait, discovers a string of boulders scattered across the desert landscape, the remains of an old fortress blown to bits by airstrikes. With some difficulty, the soldiers devise a means of getting their tanks across the treacherous pass.

However, their general stops them right in their tracks. ""I have orders directly from the president! You are **not** to cross that stone wall, do you understand me?""

The troops question why their advance has been halted, and so the general puts the president on the line. The troops hear the voice of George Bush emanate from the phone, saying ""You must not try to advance beyond that boulder, to do so would be a waste of our resources. It's the border, so just hold the line.""

""But why?"", asks one young private. ""A simple boulder is no match for our forces. Surely you know that.""

George Bush, President of the United States, responds into the phone:

""It's not just a boulder, it's Iraq.""","1991, The Gulf War",0

Out of his right front pocket, he pulls out a small, thick book that says it is ""1001 Dad Jokes, 5th Edition"".     

Just then, a bartender asks them if they'd like another drink, or to try the house special. Wondering what the ""house special is"", they inquire about it only to be told that it is a special blend of ancient herbs from Guantanamo that are best combined with top shelf, Irish vodka.

""A bomb of ethnicity in your mouth"", the bartender says.

The two agree to have a last shot, and while the bartender is meticulously crafting the beverage, the son, with tears in his eyes, thanks his father for the gift of a near endless arsenal of dad jokes at his disposal now.

""Dad, truly, I'm honored"", the son says.

To which his father replies, ""hi honored, I'm dad""","A Man, A Proud New Dad of a Baby Boy, Sits Down With His Father At An Irish Pub",15

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.  
The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.  
The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.  
First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.  
Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.  
Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.  
The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.  
First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.

The brothers decided that this would be an ideal test case and agreed to each spend two months trying to cure the chicken. Hing immediately went back to the university. Having boned up on ornithology and traditional Chinese medicine, he decided that the answer was a prescription of gum-tree leaf tea. He gathered bushels of the tea leaves, brewed gallons of the tea, and poured it into the chicken for the two months. Meanwhile, Ming traveled all around China, praying at the shrines of his ancestors. One night he had a dream. His ancestors appeared and told him to feed the chicken tea made from gum-tree leaves!!! Ming, aware of his brother's lack of success, decided that the problem was quantity. He gathered whole CARTLOADS of leaves, and brewed BARRELS of the tea, and poured them into the chicken for the two months. At the end of the time, the poor chicken was still as naked as a bowling ball. Moral: All of Hing's courses, and all of Ming's kin; couldn't make gum tea refeather a hen!",The two brothers,2

They all go out into the forest and the first to return is the bosun who arrives with 10 orange-sized native fruits. The chief of the tribe explains that the next part of the test is that they will shove the fruits up his ass one at a time. If he flinches or makes a sound at all, he will be eaten.

Basically, his job was to do what his boss told him to do, whether it was cleaning the tanks or taking tickets at the entrance. Field trips were pretty common at this aquarium; school buses full of children would swarm the turtle exhibit at least twice a week. One such day, this guy was tasked with walking through the aquarium making sure everything was in order for a big group of children coming from a local school. The dude was fairly new to the job, so he didn't really know what to expect. However, when he came across the dolphin exhibit he knew at once it wasn't ""safe"" for kids. Apparently, it was mating season for these dolphins, and they were going at it. The worker could barely watch them, and he could only imagine what would happen if the middle school kids decided to stop by this favorite exhibit. He went to his boss immediately and asked what he could do to stop the dolphins' poor behavior. The boss said, ""You know, this has happened before, and it's a real simple fix. I want you to go to the cliffs nearby and collect about two dozen baby sea gulls and feed 'em to the dolphins."" Although shocked at the order to slaughter these gulls, this guy was a good worker. He went to the cliffs and started collecting these gulls. He got about twenty and decided he had enough. Collecting those gulls really wasn't easy, and he had a long walk to get back to aquarium on time. He turned back and starting briskly walking along the path to the aquarium. Twenty or so baby sea gulls in a bag slung across his back, this guy was eager to return and be done with the task. However, about halfway back, he came across an awful obstacle. A giant lion was just laying in the middle of the path. Fortunately, it was sleeping, and it didn't look like it was waking up. This guy was faced with a difficult decision. He couldn't go around it; the path wasn't wide enough. There was no way he was getting back to the aquarium without going over the beast. As terrified as he was to do it, the aquarium worker mustered up the courage to step over the lion. He took a deep breath and placed one foot over the lion, then the other. Immediately, he was arrested.

This test only has one question, but it's an important one.

THE SITUATION:

You are in Florida, Miami to be specific.

There is chaos all around you caused by a hurricane with severe flooding.

This is a flood of biblical proportions.

You are a photojournalist working for a major newspaper, and you're caught in the middle of this epic disaster.

The situation is nearly hopeless.

You're trying to shoot career-making photos.

There are houses and people swirling around you, some disappearing under the water.

Nature is unleashing all of its destructive fury.

THE TEST:

Suddenly you see a man in the water.

He is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken down with the debris.

You move closer.

Somehow the man looks familiar.

You suddenly realize who it is.

It's Donald Trump

At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him under forever.

YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS:

You can save the life of Donald Trump OR you can shoot a dramatic Pulitzer Prize winning photo, documenting the death of one of the world's most powerful Republican men hell bent on the destruction of the United States of America...

THE QUESTION:

Here's the question, and please give an honest answer.......

Alas, the police-bear happened to be in the vicinity of the crime. He didn't see it happening but let me tell you he had a nose for these kind of things, he even caught a pair of birds shitting off of a tree branch.

The rabbit quickly covers his misdoing with his hat. *""No, sir, but as others might say, does the bear shit in the wood""*

Rather angrily and not amused the police-bear answers *""Don't play smartass with me, I saw you covering your shit with your hat""*

*""But sir I mean it, I have not shat here. You see I was catching a butterfly, that's what I covered with my hat""*

*""Then lift your hat""*

*""No can do, it will fly away""*

The police-bear thinks, this rabbit won't outfox him like the fox did earlier. He readies his pistol and shoots a couple of rounds at the hat. ""Now it won't fly away, lift your hat""

*""Aye, sir""* and the rabbit slowly raises the hat, and as the police bear sees the shit beneath, the rabbit exclaims in a high pitched voice:

But did you know, Women are 57% more likely to kidnap small children than men, with a 200% higher chance of the children not being recovered. Women on average are at a higher tendency to snatch children both premeditated and spur of the moment. Where as men usually only do spur of the moment. What this means is that you can more easily prevent men from kidnapping by taking the proper precautions when going out with your children, but women pre plan and are more likely to actually break into someone's house (84% of the time in the middle of the night) and successfully kidnap your child. In fact, a woman named Rolyät T'fiws, is a Swedish lady who is wanted in connection to a string of 22 different kidnappings across the country. She came here on a visa from Sweden and after her visa expired, she remained in the country on the run. It is believed that her kidnapping plans were started long before she came to America but she seemed like a kind enough lady that no one really questioned her intentions. And she is just one of hundreds of cases like this. Another woman has a very similar story ""Imëd Ótavol"" was a girl from Norway who came over on a work visa and started working for a nanny business before she kidnapped 26 young children. The worst part is, both women got off on incredibly light sentences because the judge believed that ""these women are not capable of committing such crimes, just look at how sweet they look."" 

However a young, colored male was just enjoying a day in his home when a small child ran in on him. In an attempt to return the child to its parents he took hold of the child and carried him toward them. Police arrived and without question shot the young colored man on sight. He was just trying to do the right thing. RIP Harambe.

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.
Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.
""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""
The silence in the taxi was deafening.....",How my Husband and I Terrified a Taxi Driver,239

I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday.""
I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.
My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.
As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, ""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.""
I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""
We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.
She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.
On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?""
I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""
After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""
""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.
Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy birthday"". And I just sat there...

And so he went to Hell. As he arrives, he is received by Satan, who brings him a sexy blonde wearing lingerie and holding an ice-cold beer. He drinks the beer, bangs the blonde and goes back to Heaven, excited with his next visit.

In the second day he arrived there and the brought not only the same blonde but a a brunette friend, also ridiculously hot and holding two bottles of beer. He drinks it all and has a three-way with both women.

""Man, Hell is great"", said the man. ""Fuck Heaven, I'm moving to Hell.""

In his third and definitive arrival to Hell, Satan once again receives him, but instead of the blonde or the brunette the Devil brings him a fat, 45 year old bald man holding a bottle of piss.

The Army man said: ""That's bullshit, everyone knows the Army has the bravest men serving the country. The admiral blurted out that they were both full of shit and that everyone in the country knew that the U.S. sailors were the bravest of our fighting men.

The three bickered back and forth for some time and finally agreed that they should put their men to the test, which they would personally monitor.

First they went to the airbase where they boarded a bomber that was scheduled to make some practice bombing runs. They were about to come over the target when the Air Force general walked up to one of the crew and said: ""airman, I want you to ride that bomb down right to the dead center of that target."" Without hesitation, the airman saluted the general, climbed aboard the bomb, released the holding mechanism and rode the bomb right to the dead center of the target and was blown all to hell. The Air Force general looked at his friends and said: ""that's bravery.""

Their next stop was the Army camp where they were holding maneuvers to practice heavy armor tactics. The Army general walks up to one of his men and said, while pointing to a tank speeding toward them, ""Private stop that tank."" The Soldier ran toward the tank waving his arms and yelling ""STOP, STOP"" and was flattened flatter than a pancake. The Army man looked at his friends and said: ""that's bravery"".

The three adjourned for a quick drink and proceeded to the Admiral's flagship and went all the way up to the Admiral's bridge. When they had arrived on the bridge the three looked up and saw a man painting the mast way above them. 

The Admiral yelled out: ""Hey, you there aloft."" The seaman painting the mast looked down, saluted and replied: ""Yes sir"". The Admiral yelled up: ""Jump off that mast sailor""!
