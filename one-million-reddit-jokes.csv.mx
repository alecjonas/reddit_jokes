There was a huge outcry from the Muslim community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Muslim community. If the Muslims won, they could stay in Italy; and if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave. 

The Muslim people met and picked an aged and wise Mufti to represent them in the debate. However, as the Mufti spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Arabic, they agreed that it would be a ""silent"" debate.

On the chosen day the Pope and Mufti sat opposite each other. 

**The Pope**: Raised his hand and showed three fingers. 

**The Mufti**: Raised one finger. 

**The Pope** : Waved his finger around his head.

**The Mufti**: Pointed to the ground where he sat. 

**The Pope**: Brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. 

**The Mufti**: Pulled out an apple. 

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Moulana was too clever. The Muslims could stay in Italy. 

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity."" He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God!"" Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us."" He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us."" I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins."" He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin."" He beat me at every move and I could not continue!"" 

Meanwhile, the Muslim community gathered to ask the Mufti how he'd won."" I haven't a clue,"" the Mufti said."" First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger."" Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Muslims and I told him that we were staying right here!"" ""And then what?"" asked a woman.""Who knows?"" said the Mufti. ""He took out his lunch so I took out mine.""",Mufti debates Pope,305

As his eyes adjust to the dark, he notices an uncovered grave left by a lazy gravedigger. Feeling an uneasy chill, he averts his eyes from the coffin laid inside, missing the spade left by the gravedigger. 

Tripping on the spade, he falls into the grave, landing heavily on the coffin. As fear grips his heart, he scrambles to climb from the grave, only to be flung headlong out onto the mound of dirt lying beside the grave. In terror, he turns to see a black coffin, standing vertically by the foot of the grave. 

Screaming, he turns and runs at a full sprint in the opposite direction, ignoring the whip of low-lying tree branches on his neck and face. In the midst of his flight of terror, he hears a rhythmic 'THUMP, THUMP' following him. Turning mid stride, he sees the coffins now pursuing him, bounding effortlessly over headstones and leaving deep indentations where it lands. 

Squeezing what little power he has left from his legs, he vaults the perimeter wall of the graveyard in a single vault. Glancing behind, he sees the coffin barrel straight through the wall, doing the same to the house gate he hastily bolts behind himself. Reaching the front door of his home, he fumbles for the right key, hands shaking and scratching the wood surrounding the keyhole. 

Not bothering to close the door behind him, he sprints headlong up the stairs, thinking this obstacle would be enough to stop his pursuer. With a strangely pensive cadence the coffin moves up the stairs, taking them three at a time. 

With the certainty of his demise becoming evident, he rushes to the cabinet in the bathroom at the top of the landing, desperately looking for a weapon to defend himself. 

Rummaging blindly, his hand brushes and bumps past bandages, bottles of pills, searching for something as his eyes remained locked on his demise as it reaches the top of the stairs. 

Just as his last hope begins to fade, his hand grasps a solid object, a large glass bottle of cough syrup. As the coffin reaches the door of bathroom, he raises his hand and throws the heavy bottle in a last act of defiance, breaking it on the lid of his pursuer. 

And just like that, the coffin stops.",A man takes a shortcut home through a graveyard at night.,331

Suzy replied ""Hi, my name is Suzy Fuckbreak..."" 

The class went wild with hysterical laughter, and the teacher was horrified. ""Young lady, we don't use language like that in polite society. Now, tell me what your name really is, and no messing around, or else I'll take you in front of the principal."" 

Suzy replied ""My name is Suzy Fuckbreak, S-U-Z-Y F-U-C-K-B-R-E-A-K, honest!""

Suzy stood up straight and said ""My name's Suzy Fuckbreak, and if you don't believe me, you can ask my brother Johnny, he's in fourth grade here...."" 

The principal and the teacher both escorted Suzy down to the fourth grade classroom, went in, and conferred with the fourth grade teacher, who told them that yes, indeed, there was a new boy in the class, but that he had not been introduced yet.

The principal said in a commanding voice ""I'm the principal here and I want to know if there is another Fuckbreak in this class.""

The new prospect assured his holiness that there was no need for worry, just allow him access to the belfry where he would show that he was the man for the job. The Preacher showed the man the stairs to the bell tower and told the man to ring the bell in 15 minutes to signal afternoon mass. One of the deacons, aware of the man and curious as to how he was to pull it off, (*so to speak*) quietly followed the man up the stairs a short time later. From a hidden vantage point, he watched the man, at the appointed time, back up a little, run forward and slam his head hard into the bell, ringing it loudly, doing it several times. Satisfied, he retreated down the stairs. At the end of mass, he was assisting the Preacher and mentioned that it looked as if the church had a new bell ringer. The Preacher asked if the Deacon had met him, to which the Deacon replied, ""I didn't get his name, but his face rings a bell.""",For whom the bell tolls,6

Johnny: No ma'am. I want a hooker

Madame: I can't let you. you're way too young

So they start arguing for a few minutes until Johnny reaches into his pocket and grabs a fat wad of cash. The madame thinks about it for a few seconds and then relents.

Madame: OK fine. Let me get a lineup and you can pick out the one you want to have fun with

Johnny: Don't worry about that, I got it all figured out. I want a girl with diseases.

Madame: I have a girl with diseases, but i don't think you want her. Let me get a lineup and you can get one of my good girls

So they argue again for a few minutes until Johnny pulls out another, even larger wad of cash. The madame has to think about this a little longer but eventually relents

Madame: OK fine. I'll take you to Jenny's room and you can have fun with her

Johnny: Great. Thanks!

So Johnny goes to Jenny's room, does his thing and then comes down a few minutes later. Before he could leave, the madame stops him

Madame: Why were you so hell-bent on getting a girl with diseases?

Johnny: Well when I get home, mommy and daddy are going on a date night. The babysitter will come over, molest me and get the diseases.

When mommy and daddy get home, daddy will take the baby sitter home, fuck her and daddy will get the diseases

Surprised, the man replies ""woah hold on this is my manhood we're talking about, I'd like a second opinion.""
So the doctor leaves and shortly after a new one comes into the room. ""What do we have here?"" He asks.
The man once again unzips his pants and shows the doctor.
""Tell me you got some good news doc.""
This time the doctor closely examines his manhood and after a long inspection he said ""Sorry son, we have cut it off, there's nothing else we can do.""
Disheartened, the man replies ""Well if you're going to cut off my dick would you at least tell me what I have?""
""It appears to be an ancient infection I've only ever read about in the books"" The doctor explains. 
With a slight glimmer of hope the man replies ""Then what am I waisting my time talking to you jokers for!"" and abruptly leaves. 
After countless hours of research on the internet, the man tracks down an ancient healer and flies to Asia to meet him. 
When he gets there, the healer asked him to disrobe. The man does as he says and then explains ""I've been to two doctors and they both said they need to cut it off. Please tell me there's another way."" 
The healer takes one look at the grotesque nob and bursts out in laughter. ""Those white doctors all they want to do is snip snip cut cut, just wait two days and it will fall off on its own.""

""Well..., you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Ferrari.""

The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, ""What are the three tests?""

""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules.""

So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10 which he stuffs into the jar.

""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do: First - You have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less, and you can't make a face while doing it.""

""Second - There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth. You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.""

""Third - There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. You have to take care of that problem."" The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my $10 - but I'm not an idiot! I won't do it! You'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila and then do all those other things!""

""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is..""

As time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says, ""Where's the damn tequila?!"" He grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can.. Tears stream down both cheeks -- but he doesn't make a face -- and he drinks it in 58 seconds!

Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole. Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a terrible fight -- then nothing but silence!

Just when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar. His clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over his body.

He drunkenly says, ""Now..., where's that old woman with the bad tooth?","A man walks into a bar, notices a very large jar on the counter, and sees that it's filled to the brim with $10 bills. He guesses there must be at least ten thousand dollars in it.",3829

The soldiers tried and tried to rid the city of the rebels, but the latter was a strong resistance and were hard to defeat. Regardless of the many new personnel, bases and equipment that the soldiers received, the rebels somehow found a way to be one step ahead of them.

The commander of the soldier, Gen. Williams, decided this had to come to a stop. He ordered for the construction of multiple newly-fortified military posts around the city, installed with state-of-the-art weapons and communications systems, to provide round-the-clock surveillance. The construction was completed quickly, and new personnel and equipment soon arrived. The General then instructed the chief of each base to send a convoy of vehicles out to the city twice a day to ensure the rebels did not spread to other parts of the city. He also called for multiple airstrikes to deter the rebels. 

After a few weeks, the General was happy to see that there were fewer rebel attacks, and the civilians seemed much happier and thankful whenever the soldiers went into the city. The General had confidence that the city would soon be rid of the rebels for good, and that the people could rebuild their houses and lives.

A few months passed and all seemed well, until early one morning, at about 3am, the General was awoken by one of his deputies. ""Sir, one of our posts has been attacked by the rebels!"" The General rushed out of his bunk, but by the time he got to the post, it was up in flames. Infuriated, he ordered for increased security at all the other posts. However, the next morning brought the same tale, and by the end of the week, he had lost half of his posts.

Rather dismayed, the General held an urgent with his senior advisers. They analyzed the activity of the rebels and concluded that they were going to attack the biggest and most heavily protected base, as that was the one with most of the weaponry and supplies. The General sent many troops there, along with several tanks from the main headquarters. More high-tech surveillance equipment was sent in from a nearby base as well. The General, feeling satisfied that the post would withstand the bombardment of the rebels' firepower, went to bed early that night.

Lo and behold, the General was once again woken before sunrise the next morning. ""Sir, we have a problem - the post is not responding to our messages"". Shocked, the General rushed there. It was all deja vu - flames and rubble and nothing else. The General was feeling a mix of emotions, but all he could muster was: ""Well, I didn't expect this post to blow up overnight"".",A group of soldiers was fighting against a group of rebels...,17

As the curer of several diseases, the discoverer of many life supporting planets, and the inventor of many new robotics, he was given an option as he neared his death. He was visited by the Angel of Death when he was 108 (his new technology helped him to live far past the average lifespan).

The angel told him, ""normally we make the decision for everyone, but because you were so extraordinary during your time on Earth, I've decided to give you the choice. Would you like to go to heaven or hell?""

""W-Why would I want to go to hell?"" Evan replied, ""Heaven is the obvious choice, is it not?""

The angel told him, ""For you, I'll let you have a peak at both, and then you can decide. We've never let anyone do this, so this is a very special opportunity.""

Evan agreed to do this, and the angel took him to hell first. Once there, he found himself in the middle of a beautiful golf coarse. He walked a bit and found all his friends happily playing a game and they asked Evan to join them. After they finished what Evan considered to be the best golf game he had ever played, his friends invited him to play a round with the devil. Evan was hesitant at first, but his friends told him that the devil was a pretty great guy, so he agreed to do it.

They played a phenomenal game with Satan, and afterward, the Angle of Death asked Evan if he would like to see Heaven. He said yes, and the next day they went up so Evan could get a taste of heaven. When they arrived, Evan saw the stereotypical pearly gates and paradise within. However, it didn't seem as nice as living a simple life with his friends. So Evan told the angel, I've made my decision: I would like to go to hell. So the angel took him back down. 

When he got there, he was greeted to an entirely different scene. There was fire and sewage everywhere. Evan's friends were in chains, starving, and being whipped by the devil, who was laughing at their pain. Evan was bewildered by this and asked Satan why it was so different than before.

""Yesterday you were a prospect,"" Satan replied, ""Today you're a client.""",The Man who Chose Heaven Instead of Hell,7

""Sure I do,"" Dave says. ""I know five good mechanics in your neighborhood. I know everybody.""

""Sure, Dave. You know everybody.""

""No, I really do.""

""You don't know my ex wife.""

""Carol? Yes I do. I follow her on Twitter. We've talked a few times.""

""Bullshit, you don't know Carol. We were divorced before I ever moved here, how could you know her?""

""I'm telling you, we met. On a business trip. She mentioned you. I'm positive it's the same Carol.""

""That doesn't make sense.""

""I'm telling you, Bob, I know *everyone*. Name anybody, I'll tell you how I know them.""

Bob thinks for a second. ""Michael Jordan.""

""Mike? Sure I know Mike. I know his whole family.""

""You're full of shit. You do not know Michael Jordan.""

""I absolutely do. You know those contests where you win a day with a celebrity? I won one as a kid. Got to meet Mike, wound up meeting his whole family, and we've stayed in touch.""

""Bullshit.""

""Hey look, I'll prove it. This weekend, we'll fly out to his new place in Charlotte, and I'll introduce you.""

Sure enough, that weekend they fly to Charlotte, North Carolina, and a limo is waiting to take them to Michael Jordan's estate. Dave introduces Bob to Jordan, and they enjoy a game of basketball with his family. On the way to their hotel, Bob is flabbergasted.

""That was amazing. So cool that you actually know Michael Jordan. I'm...I'm amazed.""

""I told you, I know everyone.""

""You keep saying that, but Dave it's just not possible. Sure, you know some cool people, but you can't know everyone.""

""You name them, I know them.""

Bob thinks for a moment. ""What about Elon Musk?""

""Yep, sure do. Our kids played on the same golf team one year. We hit it off, Elon and me. I haven't seen him in a while, but I bet if we went to SpaceX, I could get us a private tour, and introduce you.""

""Alright, but if we don't meet Elon, you're paying for this whole trip.""

""You got it. We'll meet him.""

So they fly to California, and make their way to the SpaceX factory. The whole time, Dave keeps bumping into people he knows. While they're on the guided tour, they happen to pass Elon Musk and his entourage in the hallway.

Elon does a double take. ""Is that Dave?""

Dave grins. ""Elon! Long time!""

Elon leans in and gives Dave a firm hug. ""Gosh, Dave it's been so long! I was just on my way to a meeting, but I tell you what, I'm going to blow it off so we can catch up. The executive cafeteria here is great, let's grab a bite.""

So they follow Elon to the executive cafeteria, and have lunch with him. Bob is impressed at Dave's ability to conduct a conversation with this genius. When it's all over, they take a cab back to the airport.

At this point, Bob is shaken.

""Okay, Dave, this is legitimately weird. You know a lot of people. But there are billions of people in the world! You can't possibly know every one of them!""

""You'd be surprised what you can do, when you make time for people.""

""Dave, ten people have probably been born since we started this conversation, do you know them too?""

""Not yet. But I know their parents, and I'll meet them soon enough. Tell you what, name one more person: the craziest person you can think of, and I'll introduce you. If I don't know them, I'll quit my job and move to the desert and become a monk.""

So Bob thinks hard. Finally, he says ""Kim Jong Un.""

Dave's face goes dark. He looks out the window of the cab for a long time.

Finally, Dave sighs. ""Yes, I know Kim Jong-Un.""

Bob just stares.

""No, I do,"" Dave says. ""I went to North Korea when his father was still in power. He wanted me to talk to George W. Bush, to lift some sanctions back in the early 2000's, but I wouldn't do it. I met Jong-Un and his brothers on that trip. They were good kids, and I'm ashamed of what Jong-Un became. I thought he would be different.""

""Okay, Dave, this joke has gone on long enough. That's sick stuff you're talking about.""

""I wish it was a joke. Please don't make me prove it.""

""I'm sorry, Dave, but you're going to have to.""

Twenty hours and six planes later, they land in Pyongyang and make their way to the palace, where a large crowd has gathered to hear the Eternal Leader speak.

Dave looks around. ""You know, Jong-Un is never going to be able to see us in this crowd. But I tell you what, I know all the palace guards, so I'll head inside, and I'll come out with him when he does his speech.""

So Dave goes up to the palace gates, and sure enough, he gets right in. A guard takes him to Kim Jong-Un's office, and they catch up for a few minutes. When the time comes for Kim to address the crowd, Dave follows him onto the balcony. He scans the crowd for Bob, and notices a circle of people near where he was standing. Fearing the worst, Dave rushed out to find Bob lying on the ground in a swoon.

""Bob, what happened?""

Bob's voice is faint. It's clear to Dave that Bob is having a heart attack. He kneels down and leans in close to hear Bob's frail words.

""I was standing here, waiting...and then you walked out on the balcony...""

""Yes?"" Dave says, tears in his eyes.

""And the guy next to me looked up and said 'Hey, who's that up there with Dave?'""",Dave knows everybody - Redux [Long],5

her to the toilet seat.

any success whatsoever.

I drove her to the hospital emergency room. The ER Doctor got her into a position where he 
could study how to free her (Try to get a mental picture of this.)

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. 

Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""","A horse is sitting at home, watching MTV...",867

the far side for their first legal drink.

So when Paddy's 18th birthday came around, he and his pal Jim 
took a boat out to the middle of the lake, Paddy, stepped out 
of the boat... And nearly drowned!

Jim just barely managed to pull him to safety.

Furious and confused, Paddy went to see his grandmother . ""Grandma,"" he asked, ""Tis me 18th birthday, so why can't I walk across the lake like me father, his father and his father before 
him?""
Granny looked deeply into Paddy's, troubled blue eyes and said,

May I ask you - how do you run such an efficient government?  Are there any tips you can give me?” 
 
“Well,"" replied Her Majesty, ""the most important thing is to surround yourself with intelligent people.""
 
Trump frowned.
 
""But how do you know the people around you are really intelligent?"" he asked.
 
""Oh, that's easy” the Queen replied. “You just ask them to answer an intelligent riddle”.
 
She pushed a button on her intercom. “Please send Theresa May in here.""
 
The Prime Minister walked into the room.
 
“You called for me, Your Majesty?""
 
""Answer me this, if you would, Theresa. “ the Queen said. “Your mother and father have a child. It is not your brother  and it is not your sister. Who is it?” 
 
Without pausing for even a second, Theresa May answered, “That would be me.""
 
""Yes! Very good,” said the Queen.
 
Trump went back home, returned to the White House and the very next day called for Mike Pence to come and see him.
 
Pence duly trotted in to the Oval Office
 
“Mike, answer this for me,’ said the Don. “Your mother and your father have a child. It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is it?” 
 
""I'm not sure,"" said Pence. “Let me get back to you on that one.
 
Pence went panicking off to his advisers and asked everyone, but none of them could give him an answer. 
 
The next night, as it happened, Pence ran in to Hillary Clinton in a restaurant. By now, desperate for an answer to give to his tyrannical boss, he approached her – much to her surprise.
 
  “Hillary, I know we haven’t always seen eye to eye but I would really appreciate it if you could answer this riddle for me
 
“Sure, Mike “Hillary said. “I’m not one to hold a grudge. What is it?”
 
“Thanks, said Pence,” It’s this.  Your mother and father have a child and it's not your brother or your sister. Who is it?” 
 
Hillary answered right back, “That's easy, it's me!""
 
Pence smiled,  “Thanks!""
 
Pence then went back to speak with Trump. ""Say, boss, I did some research and I have the answer to that riddle.  It’s  Hillary Clinton.”
 
Trump got up, stomped over to Pence, and angrily yelled at him. ""No, you idiot! It's Teresa May!!""

The younger of the two men has never been outside their small community, and is subsequently very excited and also quite nervous. 

Rather than taking a full horse and buggy, they decide to ride a donkey the short distance to town and hold their chickens and roosters on their lap. 

When they arrive, they are quite surprised to see that there is no place to tether their donkey outside the open-air market. Fearing it will wander off, the two men decide to simply lead it by its reins through the market. 

To make sure one of them is not overburdened, they decide the younger should take the donkey and the rooster, and the older will take the old laying hens.

The older man gently speaks to the younger; ""Remember Brother Abram- our headstrong steed is often quite stubborn. Should he act out of turn, give him a gentle graze on his snout to calm his nerves."" 

Brother Abram nods and speaks to the older man, ""Yes, Brother Isaac. I shall heed your words."" 

As Brother Abram begins his walk to try to and sell their virile rooster, the donkey starts to resist Abram and bray softly. 

Suddenly, another man and his wife walks past Abram carrying a cage with another large, haughty looking rooster. Upon seeing this man's rooster, the rooster under Abram's arm becomes irate- pecking, clawing, and doing all he can to escape from under Abram's arm. The other man's rooster also becomes upset and begins to claw and peck at the cage. 

With all this commotion, the old donkey becomes started, braying and bleating loudly, and bucking wildly in the market. 

Upon hearing the commotion, Brother Isaac heads towards the noise only to turn a corner and see the old donkey running away, the two roosters fighting each other on the floor, and Brother Abram..holding a bloody nose and a few knocked out teeth. 

""Brother Abram! What has happened to you?!"" 

""Isaac, we must leave. I do not trust these English! They attacked me for asking them to do a simple favor!"" 

""Pray tell, Abram. For what favor did you ask?!"" 

""I but complimented that man on the size of his cock, and ask his wife to hold mine so I could scratch my ass between the cheeks!""
