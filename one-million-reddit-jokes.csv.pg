One day, Arianna notices her photographer seems sad. She asks him what's wrong, she'll do ANYTHING to make him happy. He says he loves her, but he misses his bros...and his ""bro time."" Maybe if she takes out her weave and cuts her hair short, he'll feel better?

Arianna, wanting him to be happy, finds a sharp shell,  cuts off her hair and goes to the other side of the beach. She puffs up her chest all manly-man, throws back her shoulders and comes walking back over to the photographer.

Business had been slow lately, so Wilson figures he might want to try putting out a television commercial to drum up some business.

He goes to an advertising agency and meets a man named Gary who assures him he can make the perfect commercial for Wilson's company. He tells Wilson to come back the next week.

The next week rolls around, and Wilson goes back to see what kind of commercial Gary has put together for him. Gary has Wilson sit down, and pops in a DVD. 

A scene of the crucifixion of Jesus comes on. He's screaming in agony as a Roman centurion hammers away at his wrists. The Roman stops, turns to the camera, smiles and says ""You always know you're doing the job right when you use Wilson nails!""

Wilson is less than thrilled. He explains to Gary that he's uncomfortable with his nails being driven into the body of Christ. Gary understands completely, and asks Wilson to come back next week to see another commercial. Wilson agrees.

Next week comes, and Wilson meets up with Gary again. Gary pops in another DVD and the scene begins. It's exactly the same as the last commercial, with the difference being that now there are small pieces of wood covering the wrists where the nails are piercing Jesus. The Roman stops his hammering, turns to the camera, smiles and says ""You always know you're doing the job right when you use Wilson nails!""

Wilson is irate. He yells at Gary, accusing him of trying to run him out of business. Gary manages to calm Wilson down, and begs for another chance. Reluctantly, Wilson agrees, and they set up a meeting for next week.

Wilson shows up to the meeting expecting to be disappointed, despite Gary's assurances that this time everything will be fine. Gary pops in a DVD and the scene begins. It's a beautiful desert scene, the blue sky merging perfectly with the rolling dunes. Suddenly, a naked, bearded man comes running from off screen, being followed closely by a pack of Roman centurions. The camera pans in on the group, and one of them, sweating and panting says sadly, ""I guess we should have used Wilson nails.""",Wilson Nails,14

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

Before the match, the Irish wrestler's trainer came to him and said, ""Now, don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian. He's never lost a match because of this 'pretzel' hold he has. It ties you up in knots. Whatever you do, do not let him get you in that hold! If he does, you're finished."" 

The Irishman nodded in acknowledgment. As the match started, the Irishman and the Russian circled each other several times, looking for an opening. All of a sudden, the Russian lunged forward, grabbing the Irishman and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold. A sigh of disappointment arose from the crowd and the trainer buried his face in his hands, for he knew all was lost. He couldn't watch the inevitable happen.

Suddenly, there was a long, high pitched scream, then a cheer from the crowd and the trainer raised his eyes just in time to watch the Russian go flying up in the air. His back hit the mat with a thud and the Irishman collapsed on top of him, making the pin and winning the match.

The trainer was astounded. When he finally got his wrestler alone, he asked, ""How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!""

The wrestler answered, ""Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of testicles right in front of my face. I had nothing to lose so with my last ounce of strength, I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could.""

The trainer exclaimed, ""Oh, so that's what finished him off?!!!""

""Not really. You'd be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls.""",When life gives you a last chance...,490

The lieutenant told him that on the first day, the plague victims became covered in pustules and boils. On the second day, an incredible fever started which never breaks. On the third day, without exception, the victim was dead. 

Pol Pot was extremely concerned for his life after hearing this. Unfortunately, the Khmer Rouge had already executed all of the doctors and intellectuals who he could turn to for help. One of his lieutenants reported that he knew of a wise old man in a small village not far from the capital who the killing squads had not yet gotten around to executing. Pol Pot took his bodyguards to the village to visit the man. 

Pol Pot explained that there were reports of a plague and explained all of the symptoms. He told the man that if he could keep him safe from the plague, he would spare him from the killing fields. The wise old man thought about it for a few moments, smiled, and nodded his head. 

""I know just what you need"" he said.

He went into his house for a moment, and then returned with a miniature clock and a thin piece of leather. After attaching the clock to the leather strip, he bound it around the dictator's wrist. 

""This, Brother Number One, will keep you safe from the plague""

Pol Pot returned to Phnom Penh after this and waited in his palace. Soon, the plague hit the city. On the first day of the plague, all of Pol Pot's bodyguards, lieutenants and servants broke out in terrible boils and pustules. On the second day, they all developed tremendous fevers which never broke. By the third day, they were all dead. Incredibly though, Pol Pot was spared the ravages of the plague, never developing any of the symptoms. 

The plague finally burned out after raging through Cambodia, further depleting its already terribly suffering population. Pol Pot was happy to be alive, but was still bothered by how his life had been saved. He returned to the small village near the capital and found that the little old man had been spared by the plague. 

""Tell me, old man, how this contraption saved my life"" the dictator said, showing him his wrist.

The old man responded:

""Ah well, everyone knows that a watched pot never boils"" ",Plague in Khmer Rouge Cambodia,3

No matter what they did, Paddy simply could not bring his wife orgasm.

One day, Paddys wife suggested they go and see a sex doctor. 

'I won't be seein no feckin sex doctor, a real man doesn't need one' Paddy exclaimed.

Paddys wife continued to push and prod until Paddy  finally gave in and agreed to visit the local doc.

The doctor was a strapping young lad, muscular and handsome as the devil. 

'Perhaps you two could try this blue pill. I've heard great things about' the doctor offered

'I won't be takin no feckin blue pill, a real man doesn't need one' Paddy grumbled. 'And besides, what's a young lad such as yourself know about sex and the like?'

'Well Paddy, when I was growing up I lived on a farm. When the sheep would go into geat, my father would send me out in to the fields with a towel. As soon as they began to mate I would start fanning them with the towel as fast as I could, the female sheep seemed to really like it, and it worked every time. I'm not saying it'll work on humans, but we could try?'

Seeing this as a better alternative to a pill, Paddy invites the doctor over that evening to work his magic.

As Paddy and his wife began to make love, the doctor started waving his towel... nothing. Paddy thrusted  harder and the doctor fanned that towel even faster but his wife still wasn't even close. After a few minutes of this, Paddy isnt any closer to pleasuring his wife, and is angry at the doctor, who clearly isn't doing it right . To the doctors surprise, Paddy suggests the switch. 

As the doctor climbs on top Paddys wife, Paddy begins to wave the towel. For the first time, his wife let's out a groan. Paddy begins to wave the towel faster, and pretty soon his wife is squirming with pleasure. With all of his might, Patty waves the towel as hard and as fast as he possibly, and sure enough his wife is overcome and reaches her climax.

Patty, exhausted and proud, looks at the doctor and with a smirk on his face says 'now that me boy, is how you wave a feckin towel'",A stubborn old Irishman named Paddy had recently taken himself a stunning young wife.,1

While the sermon was intended to tell his congregation about how sex is important to a healthy marriage, he just couldn't bring himself to actually write the word ""sex"". Instead, he just decided to use the letter ""S"" in his written notes.

The pastor's wife came in and saw him working. When she asked him what the ""S"" in his sermon notes stood for, the pastor nervously blurted out ""SAILING, It's about sailing!""

The next Sunday, the wife unfortunately had to visit her sick mother, so she missed the pastor's sermon. The pastor started his sermon, and was pretty nervous, but as he preached, he got more and more comfortable about the topic of sex. His congregation loved the sermon and thought that he did a wonderful job teaching of the important of sex in a marriage.

The next day, the wife ran into some of people of the congregation. They told her what a wonderful sermon her husband had performed the day before. The wife, baffled, said ""Wow, that's a bit unexpected. He's only ever done it twice, and both times he went overboard!""

“You are a disrespectful pig!” she cried. “How dare you do this to me! I’m a faithful wife, the mother of your children! I’m leaving you. I want a divorce right away!”

The husband replied, “Hang on just a minute love, so at least I can tell you what happened.”

“Go ahead,” she sobbed, “but they’ll be the last words you’ll say to me!”

So the husband began, “Well, I was getting into the car to drive home, and this young lady here asked me for a lift. She looked so down and out and defenseless that I took pity on her and let her into the car.

I noticed that she was thin, not well dressed and very dirty. She told me that she hadn’t eaten for three days. So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the lasagna I made for you last night. The ones you wouldn’t eat because you’re afraid you’ll put on weight. The poor thing devoured it all in moments!

Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so I threw them away. Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don’t wear because you say they are too tight.

I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don’t wear because I don’t have good taste. I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for your birthday that you don’t wear just to annoy her and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don’t wear because someone at work has a pair the same.”

The husband took a quick breath and continued, “She was so thankful for my understanding and help that as I walked her to the door, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said…” “Do you have anything else that your wife doesn’t use?”",A wife came back from work early...,67

They came to believe that, if fed just the right combination of nutrients, this particular porpoise could, in theory, live forever. 

To put this to the test, they studied the world's flora and fauna to see if any naturally occurring organism would fit the bill. They finally narrowed the selection down to an unusual species of mynah bird, and they sent a team of researchers off to gather a specimen. 

It turns out that the mynah bird in question was quite rare, living only in a single tree in Kenya. The research team finally arrived at the tree to capture a bird, only to find that the tree was surrounded by a pride of very hungry lions, precluding any reasonable attempt to approach and climb the tree. 

A suggestion was made that the lions might be manageable if they could be fed, and a couple of fat cape buffalo were captured and offered to the lions. The hungry lions devoured the hapless beasts and lay down upon the grass to sleep and to digest their meal.

At the end of this testing ordeal, the doctor is still stymied. He confronts the young man and says, “Son, I’ve run every test I can think of and all of them indicate that you are healthy as a horse. There must be something we are missing.”

The doctor sits down and says, “Perhaps , it’s not genetic and has to do with your lifestyle. Tell me, do you engage in any dangerous activities.”

“That’s just it, Doc,” says the young man, “I don’t really do anything exciting. Mostly, I just sit at home, surf the Internet and eat Cheetohs.”",The Orange Penis,10

""Can I help you?""

""I'm going to be honest with you. I have no money to pay for a meal. But I want to make a little wager with you. I want you to take any spoon that you want and then I want you to lick it. I will then take the same spoon and lick it as well. And if I can guess what you've had to eat today by tasting your licked spoon, then my meal is free""

The manager, rather intrigued, agrees to this ridiculous deal because he is believes that there's no way the man can pull this off. He goes to the kitchen, takes a spoon and licks it. 

""Alright then. Here you go."" Says the manager. 

The man takes the spoon and licks it once.

""Hmmm. Chicken Parmesan, unsweetened ice tea and, for desert, chocolate cake.""

""Holy hell that's exactly right! Well a deal is a deal. Order whatever you want for free.""

The man eats his meal then leaves. 

The next day the same man walks in to the same restaurant, sits and asks to speak to the manager again. The manager walks over to the man. 

""Manager! How 'bout it? Want to make another wager?""

""You got lucky the first time. Alright. Let's do this again."" Says the manager. 

The manager goes back to the kitchen, finds a spoon, licks it and takes it back to the man. 

""Ahhh let's see. Filet Mignon with a hint of parsley, Strawberry lemonade, and pistachio ice cream""

""... Motherfu--- Damn! Well a deal is a deal. Order anything on the menu. On the house, again, I guess"".

Once again, the man eats his meal and leaves. 

Next day the same thing transpires. Man walks into the restaurant, sits and asks for the manager and the manager walks over to the man.

""3rd time's the charm. What do you say?""

""Ok. I don't know what you did the first two times but this time will be different. You're on!""

The manager goes to the kitchen, gets a spoon and licks it. However, before he gives the man the spoon he takes it to one of his cooks, Maria.

""Psst, Maria. I need you to do something for me. I want you to take this spoon and shove up your, ahem, you're hoo-hah. Come on! I'll pay you double for today.""

So Maria takes the spoon and swirls it around her hoo-hah and gives it to the manager. He walks over to the man and gives him the spoon. The man takes the spoon and licks it once. 

""Hmmm.  Barbecue baby back ribs, a beer, Blue Moon, New York style cheescake and.... What the hell?

The homeless man, rather perplexed, licks the spoon a couple more times.

""Holy shit! Does Maria work here?""

One day he has finally saved up enough money so he goes down to the dealer. After picking out the perfect bike the dealer warns him that if he leaves his Harley in the rain the chrome has a tendency to rust. He tells the young man an old biker's trick is to keep a jar of Vaseline handy and smear it on the chrome if the bike must be left out in the rain.

A few months later the young man meets a woman and falls in love. She asks him to come home and meet her parents over dinner. He readily agrees and the date is set. At the appointed time he picks her up on his Harley and they ride to her parents house. Before they go in she tells him that they have a family tradition that whoever speaks first after dinner must do the dishes.

After a delicious dinner everyone sits in silence waiting for the first person to break and get stuck doing the dishes. After a long fifteen minutes the young man decides to speed things up so he reaches over and kisses the woman in front of her family.

And no one says a word...! Next he decides to take a more direct approach so he throws her on the table and has sex with her in front of everyone. And still no one says a word!

Now he is getting desperate, so he grabs her mother and throws her on the table. They have even wilder sex. But no one says a word!!!

By now he is getting very worried and is wondering what to do next when he hears thunder in the distance. His first thought is to protect the chrome on his Harley, so he reaches in his pocket and pulls out the Vaseline.

And the father says, ""Okay dammit, I'll do the dishes.""

A few weeks after the breakup, I met Korean exchange student named Yu Chan Wook. She was sweet and kind, and beautiful, and we immediately hit it off. Realatively early into our relationship she had expressed her sadness over a recent breakup, which she took really hard. We bonded over our mutual heartbreak, and it became a source of inspiration for our budding relationship. Lo and behold, I was eating lunch alone, as Yu and I had different lunch times three days a week, and an occasional friend of mine came to talk to me about Yu. He told me that Yu had dated the twin brother of my first high school girlfriend, which came as a shock because I had told Yu who I had been dating, and she said nothing about dating her brother. I was heartbroken when I realised that Yu had a boyfriend, who looked like the girlfriend, that I had in February of last year.",A pretty Killer joke.,4

Well, the passion started to heat up, but then she said “I don’t feel like it, I just want you to hold me.”

I said “WHAT??!! What was that?!”

So she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear…”You’re just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.”

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, “Can’t you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?”

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn’t decide which one to take so I told her we’d just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.

Let me tell you…she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn’t even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, “That’s fine, honey.”

She appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, “I think this is all dear; let’s go to the cashier.”

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, “No honey, I don’t feel like it.”

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, “WHAT?”

I then said “Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.

You’re just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.”

And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, “Why can’t you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?”

Still haven't had sex since then, though. ",In touch with each other's needs...,2

post,5wim9z,2qh72,jokes,false,1488222092,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5wim9z/the_aristrocrats_nsfw/,self.jokes,,"A family walks into a talent agency. It's a father, mother, son, daughter and dog. The father says to the talent agent, ""We have a really amazing act. You should represent us.""

The agent says, ""Sorry, I don't represent family acts. They're a little too cute.""

The mother says, ""Sir, if you just see our act, we know you would want to represent us.""

The agent says, ""OK. OK. I'll take a look.""
So the father lights into a chorus of ""America the Beautiful"", while the son executes the daughter and the dog, gangland-style. After the first verse the mother reaches into the father's pants and pulls out his giant dick. The father's dick is huge beyond description. If you were traveling with that dick, the tip would be in the bar, making friends, before the balls crossed the county line. Anyhow, the mother fits this huge cock in her mouth, dislocating her jaw in the process, and begins to deepthroat the father, while the son drops his pants. He pulls out his tiny, stack-of-dimes dick, (maybe he'll one day be as big as his dad, fingers crossed) and begins to fuck his mother in the ass. At the final note of the song, the dad explodes with come, so much it begins to shoot out the mother's nose. The son pushes her forward onto his dad's cock, and because the cock fills her mouth and come fills her nose, she suffocates and dies. The father removes his dick and pulls out a pair of pliers. He begins pulling the mom's, excuse me, dead mom's teeth out of her head, and begins to skull fuck the toothless bitch, working the jaw back and forth. The son finishes his fuck in the mom's, excuse me, dead mom's ass, and pulls out his pocketknife. He flips his dead mom over and performs a C-section, reaching into her snatch and finding a fetus. He pulls out the fetus, and notices it feels like scrambled eggs, cause, well, it kind of is. He bites the unformed head off the fetus, and makes a disgusted face. He then runs out to the car. Meanwhile, the dad has shoved his huge cock down his dead wife's throat until he can feel it from the outside, and then pumps the throat around his cock, using it as a masturbation sleeve. The son runs back in with a George Foreman grill, heats it up, and prepares a marinade for his dead fetus sibling. He cooks it on high for 10 minutes, until golden brown, and adds fajita seasoning. As he enjoys a delicious snack, the father shoots another quart of come down the dead bitch's throat. The son tosses him the pocketknife (closed, for safety, of course) and puts the remains of the fetus on a spike that was conveniently placed in the corner, as the father begins to cut the dead mom's face off and the son fucks his dead sister in the exit wound he made with the pistol minutes before. As the son feels his balls tighten up, he turns to the father, now wearing his dead wife's face as a funny mask, and shoots his come across his dead mom's face. They strike poses and proclaim ""Taa Daa.""

For the longest time, the agent just sits in silence. Finally, he manages, ""That's a hell of an act. What do you call it?""

And the father says, ""The Aristocrats!""",The Aristrocrats (NSFW),2

Every time somebody tried to use the draw-bridge, or swim across the moat, the monster’s yellow fingers would come up out of the moat and grab them, and the monster would eat them.   
   
Food in the castle was getting very low, all supplies running out.  They needed to get word out for help.  The king requested his bravest knights to try get across the moat.  One by one, no matter how brave and clever they were, the monster’s yellow fingers would rise up out of the moat and grab them.   
   
Then, there were no knights left.  So the king sent his foot-soldiers.  All we caught by the yellow fingers.   
   
Finally, all he had were two page boys.  “You are our last hope,” the king said.  “You must try.”   
   
The castle doors opened, and the two pages set off, walking across the draw-bridge.  They walked and walked and walked. The yellow fingers rose up.  But stopped, and did nothing! Wonder upon wonders, the pages made it across, and were able to get help.   
  
And to this day, we know that, when you need help, you should let your pages do the walking through the yellow fingers.

One day the dog starts chasing butterflies and before long the dog discovers that he is lost. So, wandering about, he notices a leopard heading rapidly in his direction with the obvious intention of having lunch.

The dog thinks, ""Oh boy, I'm in deep stuff now."" Then he notices some bones lying nearby on the ground and immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat.

Just as the leopard is about to leap, the dog exclaims loudly, ""That was one delicious leopard. I wonder if there are any more around here?""

Hearing this, the leopard halts his attack in mid-stride, and slinks away into the trees. ""Whew"", says the leopard. ""That was close. That dog nearly had me."" 

Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard.

So off he goes. But the dog sees him heading off after the leopard and figures that something is amiss. The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans about the dog's ruse and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard. The leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says, ""Hop on my back, monkey, and see what's going to happen to that conniving canine. ""Now the dog sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back, and thinks, ""Oh boy, it looks like I've really had it now.""

But instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to the leopard and the monkey and pretends that he hasn't seen them. And just when they get close enough to hear him, the dog says... ""Where is that monkey? .. I sent him off an hour ago to get me another leopard and he's still not back.""",A man decides to go to a safari.,1545

So he looked for any job he's qualified to do. Finally, a local film school hired him as a janitor. This guy loved movies so he thought working in a film school even as a janitor is fate. He needed a name to get a job so he named himself Sylvester Stalone. He loved action movies and his favorite actor was Sylvester Stalone. He kinda looked like him too.      

One day, the head of the film school saw him imitating Stalone and suggested that he audition for his stunt double for his upcoming movie. He went to the audition, and he was starstruck as he saw Stalone in the studio. He passed the first stage of the audition, and the second stage was an interview with Stalone himself!   

In the interview, he shared his life story, his memories with his family, although vague. He even showed him the only picture he has - it was him as a child. Stalone went blank. He thought of his own childhood and most of the things the guy said also happened to him. He remembered he had a friend that also looked like the child in the picture.    

He thought 
  
""That can't be... Are you my long lost twin brother?""   

After a DNA test, and a lineage test, it was confirmed that they were related. Sylvester, the homeless dude, was Sylvester Stalone's long lost brother! What a coincidence!   

Both Sylvesters were happy. They continued with the movie and it became a worldwide hit! After a couple of days, having bonded for a while, Sylvester Stalone was so moved by what happened, he decided to give his brother Sylvester Stalone a house, a car, and $4M dollars. He also decided to change his name to commemorate this life-changing experience. He asked his brother if he would like to do the same, he said yes.

Here's the joke:

A rural Irish parish is having trouble with ghosts, so the Vatican sends a very new and inexperienced priest there. He decides to hold a special meeting after weekly mass, just for people who have had trouble with ghosts.
He starts the meeting with a question: (Fake Irish Accent not required, but is a good touch) ""Who here has seen a ghost?""
Everyone puts their hands up. 
""Alright, who here has talked with a ghost?""
Half the people there put their hands up.
""Who here has touched a ghost?"" 
Five people raise their hands. 
The priest raises an eyebrow. ""Who here has had intercourse with a ghost?""
The whole congregation is shocked that the priest would ask that, bar one. Only one person in the church, the village's old man, raises his hand. 
The priest is shocked, so he calls the old man up to the front, and asks again.
The old man's face goes white, and he says weakly, ""I'm so sorry, father. I thought you said goat.""",The goat joke (long),3

He was wearing an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose and laying on the hospital bed.
A young nurse came to cleanse his body with a sponge.

The patient mumbled, ""are my testicles black?""

Nurse replied, ""I don't know Sir, I am just setting you clean""

The patient repeated again, ""Are my testicles black?""

The nurse was quite embarrassed to answer the question and said ""Sir everything should be OK""

The patient just kept asking again and again, ""Are my testicles black?""

The nurse could not bear the patient's concern so much, so she raised his gown, moved her hand to find and grab his penis and testicles, moved it all around, checked very closely and suddenly the man ejaculated on the nurse's hand.

The man pulls of his oxygen mask, embarrassed at the fiasco says loudly enough,

""Ma'am, thanks but I still need to know 'Are my test results back?'""

When the bartender sets his mug on the bar he can’t help but notice a large glass jar at the far end of the bar and it’s about half full of $100 bills. Taped to the side of the jar is a hand written piece of notebook paper that says “bar challenge”.
He can’t help but inquire about the jar and the bartender explains it is the on-going bar challenge:  “For a $100 bill you can participate in three very specific, very difficult tasks in which successful completion will be rewarded with the contents of the jar”.  
The bartender continues: 
1st, there’s Mad Dog Labronski over in the corner, our resident MMA champ and outlaw biker.  You got to knock him out cold with one single punch.
2nd, out back we have a 1500 lb. Grizzly bear chained up and he is as ornery as it gets.  You got to pull all his teeth out and survive.
3rd, upstairs is Old Lady Mcginty.  She’s 100 years old and her snatch has been dry for going on 40 years. You got to go up there and screw her and make her cum 3 times.  
“You complete the 3 tasks and the money is yours.” As you can see many men have tried but no one has been successful.  Just then the guy pulls a wrinkled up hundred out of his pocket and tosses it into the jar and says: “be right back, this won’t take long.”  Gets up walks over to Labronski, taps him on the shoulder and slams his fist into the bikers face.    One quick shot and the MMA fighter crashes to the floor, out cold.
The guy then walks to the back of the bar and exits out the back door.  After a few moments and a cacophony of crashing and screaming from the alley behind the bar the guy re-enters.  He is covered in blood, clothes torn and clearly out of breath.  Then the guy asks:  OK, where’s that old lady with the teeth?

Sad little jail cells, with only a solitary, tiny barred window to peek into the outside. So they pass the time as best they can by telling each other jokes.

One day, Tommy asks , ""Got any new jokes, Tony?""

""Sorry"" Tony says. ""I told you every joke I know months ago.  You got anymore new jokes?""

Tommy thinks for a moment and says, ""Well... I do have one more joke.  But it's one of those jokes you gotta write down.  It's not funny when you say it out loud. Gotta draw a picture and stuff.""

Tony suggests, ""Why don't you write it on a piece of paper, and throw it over here?""

Tommy agrees, and spends all week collecting the perfect materials, rewriting the perfect joke, drawing the perfect accommodating picture, and shaping that joke into a perfectly aerodynamic and balanced paper plane.

On Friday evening, when the lights go out, and the guards are changing shifts, Tommy tells Tony, ""Ok! Here comes the joke!""

He tosses the paper plane, it sails  across the prison hallway, slips between the prison cell bars, and glides directly towards Tony's awaiting hands.

Just as Tony is about to grab the paper plane, it gets caught in an updraft.  It bounces against the ceiling, changes direction, and then glides out the tiny cell window.

""Did you get the joke?"" Tommy asks.

Emergency talks with Al Qaeda have so far failed to produce an agreement.

The unrest began last Tuesday, when Al Qaeda announced that the number of virgins a suicide bomber would receive after his death, would be cut by 25%this February from 72 to 54. A spokesman said increases in recent years in the number of suicide bombings, has resulted in a shortage of virgins in the afterlife.

The suicide bombers' union, the British Organization of Occupational Martyrs (B.O.O.M.) responded with a statement saying the move was unacceptable to its members and called for a strike vote.

General Secretary Abdullah Aloud Bang told the press,""Our members are literally working themselves to death in the cause of Jihad. We don't ask for much in return but to be treated like this is like a kick in the teeth.""

Speaking from his shed in Tipton in the West Midlands , Al Qaeda chief executive Aisheet Mapants explained, ""I sympathize with our workers concerns but Al Qaeda is simply not in a position to meet their demands.

They are simply not accepting the realities of modern-day Jihad in a competitive marketplace. Thanks to Western depravity, there is now a chronic shortage of virgins in the afterlife. It's a straight choice between reducing expenditures or laying people off. I don't like cutting benefits but I'd hate to have to tell 3,000 of my staff that they won't be able to blow themselves up.""

Spokespersons for the union in the North East of England, Ireland, Wales and the entire Australian continent stated that the change would not hurt their membership as there are so few virgins in their areas anyway.

According to some industry sources, the recent drop in the number of suicide bombings has been attributed to Rosie O'Donnell. Many Muslim Jihadists now know what a virgin looks like and have reconsidered their benefit packages.",Jihadis on strike for better dying conditions,13

After a few weeks of this they decide that travelling together is no longer a good idea.

So the first brother goes on to a nearby township and decides finding a job would be the best way to avoid suspicion. He goes to a church nearby and asks the priest there if he has any work for him, the priest says, ""well of course, as luck has it, our bell ringer has fled town with the mallet he used to ring the bell, so his position is open."" The first of the brothers accepts the job and asks to be walked through his job particulars, so the priest walks his up the stairs and says, ""This is the bell, you ring it one time for every corresponding hour of the day that has passed. One ring for 1 o'clock, two rings for 2 o'clock and so on, however, we have no mallet for you to ring the bell with, so you're going to have to hit your face against the bell for each hour, do you understand?""
The first brother said yes and began his new job and new life at the turn of the next hour. 11pm rolls around and the first brother is starting to get a bit of a headache from hitting his head on the bell, but, being a new job and trying to avoid any trouble he began to hit his head 1, 2, 3, 4 ... 10 and 11! On the last strike of the bell the first brother knocked himself unconscious, rolled down the stairs the priest had taken him up earlier and broke his neck and died. When he hit the ground floor a nun heard the commotion and screamed when she saw his body mangled on the floor. The priest comes running and says ""whats happened?"" the nun replies ""who is he?"" ""oh he was the new bell ringer"".

A few years later the second brother moved from the town he had been hiding in to the same town as his now deceased brother, also looking for work he approached the same church and was given the same position, a bell ringer, excited to start his new position the priest walks him up the stairs and describes it exactly the same way he had to the previous bell ringer including not being able to fund a new mallet. The second brother began at the turn of the new hour.

Similarly when it hit 11pm the second brother noticed that his head was feeling rather pained, but, alas, he went ahead and banged his face against the bell 1,2,3,4 ... 10, 11! times. On the 11th strike the second brother passed out and fell down the stairs to his death, also breaking his neck, surprised by the noise the nun comes running to see what has happened, again shrieking in horror at another mangled corpse on the floor. Drawn by the commotion the priest asks what has happened, the nun tells him another man has died and says ""Do you know who it is?""

The priest replies ""no, I never did get a name from him, but his face certainly rings a bell.""
