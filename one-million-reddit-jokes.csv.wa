It seemed very out of place in the busy city. The man's curiosity was piqued, and he entered the shop. The store didn't seem to have much traffic, and the shelves were full of dusty, but interesting items. The man found himself strangely interested in a rather ugly brass rat on a shelf behind the counter. Ugly it was, but he had never seen anything like it -- it was so incredibly detailed, and life-like. He asked the shopkeeper for a price.

The man was pleased to learn that he could acquire the rat for only $5, and he handed the shopkeeper the money. But, before giving the man the rat, the shopkeeper sternly warned him, ""This sale is final. If you leave the shop with the brass rat, I won't take it back under any circumstances.""

The man thought the warning was curious, given that the rat only cost $5. Even if he decided he hated the rat, that was hardly an amount worth worrying about. He agreed to the shopkeeper's terms, and left with the rat.

At first, everything seemed perfectly normal. But as he walked back toward his car, the man started to hear strange rustling noises around him. Then he saw a life rat scurry out of an alley, and start to follow him. Suddenly, rats seemed to be appearing all around him, streaming out of sewers and dumpsters, all following him and milling about his feet.

The man began to run, but the rats kept up in increasing numbers. The man realized that he was being chased by literally tens of thousands of rats. The ground came alive, as the rats swarmed behind him.

The man suddenly realized the significance of the shopkeeper's warning, and knew what he had to do. He turned toward the bay, and ran as quickly as he could toward the water. When he reached the waterfront, he threw the brass rat as far as he could into the bay. The rats raced past him, following the brass rat into the water, where they drowned.

The man returned to the curio shop, and upon seeing him enter the shopkeeper shouted, ""I told you, no refunds. I don't want trouble here. The sale was final, and you can't return the merchandise.""

The man smiled, and replied, ""Oh, I don't want to return the rat. I just want to know -- do you have any brass lawyers?""",The Brass Rat,6

""You were going a little fast there,"" the officer says ""but it is the end of my shift and tonight the boys are coming over for beers and cards, so you have exactly one chance to explain yourself.""

The man, with all the sincerity he could muster, replied ""Sir, round about a year ago my wife left me for a state trooper. I tell ya, that nag leaving was the best thing that ever happened to me and I knew it was too good to be true because when I saw your lights in the rearview, I could have sworn you were bringing her back.""

He'd just opened a pub, yet came to find that all the names he'd wanted were taken; The Queen's head, The King's Arms, so on so forth. Until he realised nobody had named a pub after the Queen's legs, and as such, he choose to name his pub 'The Queen's legs'.

The new barman opened his pub and found it to be quite a success, being the only pub for miles around. Indeed 'The Queen's legs' attracted drinkers from all the local villages. Though the most memorable customer was Alan.

Now Alan was a quiet man, he kept to himself most days and nobody really knew where he was from, but he would come to the pub every day, rain or shine at exactly 8.00am, and would wait for one hour on the bench outside the church for the pub to open.

Now the local bobby, a nice, respectable man named Peter noticed this. Every day on his morning rounds he saw Alan there, waiting on the bench. Peter had never seen him before, and never saw him elsewhere, and Peter prided himself on knowing everyone that lived in the village. One day, his curiosity got the better of him. He rolled down the window and said ""Mornin' sir, might I ask what it is you're doing out here? Only I've been seeing you a lot recently""

To which Alan replied ""Morning mate! don't mind me, i'm just waiting for the Queen's legs to open so I can go in and 'ave a drink!""

The court magistrate showed the king a pair of metal panties, with a hole in the middle.

""SNAP!"", the pencil had cleanly sliced into two! ""Anything that enters the hole will be sliced off, sire"", said the magistrate.

Thoroughly impressed, the King instructed the Queen to wear it for the entire year and left for his expedition. Upon his return, the King called for a meeting of all his country folk.

They were all instructed to drop their pants, and the King made his rounds noticing that many were missing fingers as well as their most vital part. Then, he saw the quiet knight Sir Xavier, fingers and all still intact.

He was one of those freak carrots that had little appendages growing out of his sides that he was somehow able to make function like half-hearted arms.

Anyway, he hated working for this old guy-- partly because he could never understand the man with his heavy accent ... everything was like: ""Get the cah ready."" ...  ""Clean my ahhctapus"" ... ""Take me to tha pahk."" It was hard enough to hear as it was, as the carrot had pretty inadequate ears. The old man, was also really bossy and seemed to laugh whenever the carrot messed up, and the carrot, being a carrot, was easily flustered ... and so he kind of hated his job.

But the man paid him regularly, and so he made do.  Anyway. One day the old man had decided to move into a new apartment, a studio -- you know, the bed and sofa and kitchen all in the living room, and then just the bathroom. So the carrot, who spent the entire night before packing everything up, was really tired, and was now-- bright and early-- unpacking the boxes in the new place, putting dishes in the cupboards, knick-knacks on shelves, etc., eventually the carrot got to the box with the old man's fishing gear-- that he never used. The man asked the carrot to put the rod in the trunk of the car for now. As the carrot pulled the rod out of the box, the old man looked at him carrying it precariously by the thinner end, and began to worry it was going to snap -- and as the carrot headed toward the door, the old man shouted out, 'That's naht tha whay ya care it!' -- the carrot, exasperated, screamed back, ""What do you mean that's not the way! You want me to jump out the window?!"" A few days later he was fired.

She's about 5''7 with long black hair and beautiful, mysterious blue eyes. She's wearing a plain white shirt with the top two buttons undone, revealing modest cleavage. 

The guy, who we'll call Freddy, musters up his courage and goes up to this girl.

""Hey there, good lookin'"", he says, rather drunk. She's also drunk, and next thing you know, they're in bed together.

The next morning, Freddy wakes up and sees the woman, who shall be called Bonnie, cuddled next to him. He thought she'd leave after the wonderful sex they'd had, but she stayed.

After a few dozen dates, Freddy realizes he's genuinely in love with her. As is she.

Freddy gets fired from his job as a security guard at a pizza place for ~~murdering five kids~~ doing something unpleasant, so Bonnie gives him a job at her accounting company. 

It is there that he meets a nice man named Joe McHenry. This guy just randomly pops out of nowhere and becomes the janitor.

 He wears a very neat janitorial uniform with a baseball cap and a neat, white beard. The guy's eyes were obscured completely by thin sunglasses.

Anyway, Joe and Freddy quickly became best buddies.

It turns out that, as a janitor, Joe can't afford a home, so Freddy lets him stay with him.

One day, Freddy comes home and his girlfriend tells him that she's pregnant.

Freddy and Bonnie then sue the condom company they buy condoms from since they had sex last night and used a condom, which probably broke and resulted in the pregnancy.

After becoming millionaires from their lawsuit, the two moved into a mansion and got Joe his own house. He was very grateful.

Freddy decides to ask Bonnie to marry him. When he does, she begins crying and says no. She then reveals that she had been raped by Joe that day, and that was why she was pregnant. 

Outraged, Freddy drove all the way to Joe's house with his pistol. He knocked on the door.

When Joe answered, Freddy immediately pistol-whipped him right in the face. 

Joe collapsed, clutching his face in both hands. When he moved his hands, Freddy saw that Joe's sunglasses had been knocked off, and Joe's eye was now beginning to become white and puffy like cotton or wool.

Freddy aimed the gun at Joe and pulled the trigger, but the safety was on. When he turned it off, Joe instantly kicked him in the nuts, got up, and dashed away, but not before immediately pickpocketing Freddy's car keys and wallet.

Freddy tried to chase after Joe, but Joe was gone.

He was never seen again.

Freddy sighed and thought to himself,

“Son, it’s true it’s a fine fish, but you needn’t swear.”

“Oh, sorry, padre, but that’s what it’s called – it’s called a ‘son-of-a-bitch fish.’”

“Oh,” replied the priest, “Is it good to eat?”

“Oh, father, it may be the most delicious fish on the planet!”

So the priest finished his vacation with a fine catch, packed it in ice, and drove back to the Church. When he arrived, Sister Mary came running to the car, exclaiming, “Father, father, welcome back! I hope you enjoyed your vacation, and I have fantastic news! The Pope is going to visit our Church tomorrow!”

“Oh,” said Sister Mary; “in that case, I’ll clean the fish for Brother Isaac to cook,” and she took the fish into the kitchen.

Brother Isaac came into the kitchen and asked Mary what she was doing.

“I’m cleaning this son-of-a-bitch that the Father caught; we’re going to serve it for the Pope’s dinner tomorrow.”

“Oh Mary, if you don’t want to clean the fish, I’ll clean it.”

Laughing, Mary explained, “No, I’m not upset – that’s just the name of the fish – it’s a ‘son-of-a-bitch fish.’”

“Oh,” said Brother Isaac, “I see. Is it any good?”

And Mary said, “The son-of-a-bitch is supposed to be the most delicious fish in the world.”

“Hmmmm,” said Brother Isaac. “I know, I’ll prepare some special side dishes to go with the son-of-a-bitch.”

The evening of the Pope’s visit arrived, and the fish was served for dinner, and everyone enjoyed it.

“My goodness,” said the Pope, “that was the most delicious fish I’ve ever tasted!”

Having a good sense of smell, and not a stranger to the occasional toke, he follows it to the source and comes to the base of a truly mighty tree. High up in the branches is a monkey smoking a joint.

""Hey monkey"" he yells. 

The monkey looks around for a while before finally he sees the lizard. The monkey's eyes are extremely red - this is the stonedest animal the lizard has ever seen. ""Hey man"" says the monkey. 

""Can I get a hit?"" asks the lizard.

""Sure"" says the monkey, and our lizard friend climbs up the tree. The monkey offers him the spliff - it's king size, rolled out of a banana leaf. The lizard takes a long toke and it's really good. Nice thick smoke, with a slight taste of mango.

The two animals sit in a comfortable silence and smoke the joint to the butt. The lizard has rarely been this high before - either through weed or in terms of elevation. The sun is starting to go down, the canopy of the trees are lit with the brilliant reddish-gold of the sun, flocks of toucans are flying past, everything is at peace with the world.

He's in a great place, an hour passes and he starts to realise his mouth is extremely dry. He tries to ignore it for as long as possible, but he just can't forget about it. ""Hey man"", he says to the monkey, ""I've got the dries real bad. I've got to get a drink of water"".

The monkey says ""there's a river only a few minutes away. It's over there"" pointing off to the south. ""I'm about to roll another one, but I'll wait for you if you like"".

""Thanks. I'll be back soon"" says the lizard and starts climbing down the tree. The change from horizontal to vertical is a bit disorientating, not to mention he's high as a kite and hearing sounds like it's the first time he's ever heard them. He carefully makes his way down the tree, hesitates for a minute while he tries to remember which way the monkey had pointed, feels confident he remembers and ambles off through the bushes.

A few minutes later to his relief he he hears the sound of a slow moving river, and comes to a clearing where the sunlight is twinkling off the surface of a slow moving but wide river. The meandering water makes a soothing sound, the lizard is so incredibly calm that he doesn't notice that he log half submerged near the bank isn't a log at all.

The lizard ambles forward, and starts to take his much desired drink when the log quickly whips around - it's an enormous crocodile! Being in his calm and altered state, and totally not expecting this,  the lizard struggles to process what is happening and just stands there, still drinking and looking at the croc with a quizzical look on his face.

The croc is a bit stunned - normally animals try to get the hell away from his jaws of death as quickly as possible, but the lizard is just standing there, giving him a look of disbelief with his extremely red eyes. It takes a second, but the croc gets it.

""You are high, aren't you?"" he asks with a smile.

""..yeah.."" giggles the lizard, feeling a bit self concious.

""You got any weed?"" asks the dangerous croc.

""Nah"" says the lizard, ""but I know where you can get some"" as the reality of the situation starts becoming apparent - he's inches away from the most deadly animal in the jungle, and he might be able to get away with his life. ""I tell you what, if you promise not to eat me, I'll tell you how to find the guy with the stash"".

""Deal"" says the croc.

The lizard says ""go that way for abut 5 minutes, look for the biggest tree you can find. In it is a monkey with the dankest pot you've ever seen"".

""Thanks"" says the croc, and dragging his massive bulk onto the shore starts walking in the direction the lizard is pointing. Thanking his lucky stars, the lizard figures he's had enough adventure for the day, and heads off home and out of the story.

The croc walks for a few minutes, and he sees the monkey. a joint and cloud of smoke coming from the branches of a tree. 

""Hey monkey"" he yells.

""Sorry man, but you were taking too long, so I......"" starts the monkey before looking down and seeing the enormous reptile at the base of the tree. His eyes pop out of his head in surprise.

""Holy shit"" he exclaims. ""How much did you drink?""","Meanwhile, in a different part of the Jingle....",13

The next day, Goat also took the bus home. He didn't have any money so he told the bus driver he would get the money form home when they arrived. When they got there the goat exited the bus and quickly ran laughing.
The after that, Dog also took the bus. Thinking about how he was scammed yesterday, the bus driver told him he had no change for his bills but would be right back. Dog waited and waited, but the bus never came back.

This is explains why a cow on the road won't move for the bus: it has no business with the driver. Goats will always run away, as they are afraid the driver will demand his money. Dogs are the opposite: they will come from all over the village to chase the bus, trying to get their money.",Why do Malinese animals do what they do?,1

So he went to his mother first and asked her if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars and she said ""Well gee Joey I don't know, I love your father, but well, umm, we could really use a million dollars, so yeah I guess I would.""

Joey goes to his sister and asks the same thing and without hesistation she goes ""Hell yes I would!"".

Joey then goes to his brother and asks the same question to which his brother says ""Well, hey man, you know, I'm not gay, but fuck man, yeah, a million dollars, yeah I would.""

So Joey, utterly confused, goes back to his Dad and says ""Dad I asked them all and they all said yes. So will you tell me the difference between potentially and realistically now?""

Quite little known however, is the Roman equivalent of Achillies, Bophadee. The stories are similar. His mother dipped him in the river of the underworld to ensure his immortality, save for the one spot from which she held him. He became a great warrior, fighting in some of the most crucial battles, rising through the ranks of command.

And just like Achilles, Bophadee had a weakness. A weakness that, ultimately, led to his death. What was this weakness, that like Achillies' heel, slew the mighty warrior?

lawn?"" ""Yes,"" she said, ""aren't they darlings? They're retired

problem. The doctor told him to drop his pants and he would have a look. The midget dropped his pants. The doctor stood him up onto the  examining table, and started to examine him. The doctor put one finger under his left testicle and told the midget to turn his head and cough, the usual method to check for a hernia. 

""Hmm..."" mumbled the doctor, and as he put his finger under the right testicle, he asked the midget to cough again. 

""Aha!"" said the doctor, and reached for his surgical scissors.... Snip-snip-snip-snip on the right side . . . then snip-snip-snip-snip on the left side. 

The midget was so scared he was afraid to look, but noted with amazement that the snipping did not hurt. The doctor then told the midget to walk around the examining room to see if his testicles still hurt. 

The midget was absolutely delighted as he walked around and discovered his testicles were no longer aching. 

The doctor said, ""How does that feel now?"" 

The midget replied, ""Perfect Doc, and I didn't even feel it. What did you do?"" 


The doctor replied, ""I cut two inches off the top of your cowboy boots...""

I was about twenty minutes early. 

I'd got the time of the train wrong. I suppose it is at least equally possible,"" he added after a moment's reflection, ""that British Rail had got the time of the train wrong. Hadn't occurred to me before.""

             ""Get on with it."" Fenchurch laughed. 

""So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee.""

 	""You do the crossword?""

 ""Yes.""

 	""Which one?""

 ""The Guardian usually.""

 	""I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer The Times.  Did you solve it?"" 

""What?"" 

	""The crossword in The Guardian.""

 ""I haven't had a chance to look at it yet,"" said Arthur. ""I'm still trying to buy the coffee.""

 	""All right then. Buy the coffee."" 

""I'm buying it. I am also,"" said Arthur, ""buying some biscuits."" 

	""What sort?"" 

""Rich Tea."" 

	""Good choice.""

 ""I like them."" Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a table. And don't ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and I can't remember. It was probably round."" 

	""All right.""

 ""So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table, on my left, the newspaper, on my right, the cup of coffee, in the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits."" 

	""I see it perfectly.""

 ""What you don't see,"" said Arthur, ""because I haven't mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there opposite me."" 

	""What's he like?""

 ""Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn't look,"" said Arthur, ""as if he was about to do anything weird."" 

	""Ah. I know the type. What did he do?""

 ""He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and . . .""

 	""What?"" 

""Ate it.""

 	""What?""

 ""He ate it.""

 	Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment. ""What on earth did     you do?"" 

""Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled,"" said Arthur, ""to ignore it.""

 	""What? Why?""

 ""Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for, is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience, or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits.""

	""Well, you could . . ."" Fenchurch thought about it.

	""I must say I'm not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?""

""I stared furiously at the crossword,"" said Arthur, ""couldn't do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice,"" he added, ""that the packet was already mysteriously open. . . .""

	 ""But you're fighting back, taking a tough line.""

""After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit,"" said Arthur, ""it stays eaten.""

	""So what did he do?""

""Took another one. Honestly,"" insisted Arthur, ""this is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground.""

 	Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably. 

""And the problem was,"" said Arthur, ""that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around. What do you say? 'Excuse me ...I couldn't help noticing, er . . .' 

Doesn't work. No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigor than previously.""

  	""My man .. ."" 

""Stared at the crossword again, still couldn't budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St. Crispin's Day . ."" 

 	 ""What?"" 

""I went into the breach again. I took,"" said Arthur, ""an-other biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met.""

 	 ""Like this?"" 

""Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you,"" said Arthur,  ""that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension building up over the table. At about this time.""

	 ""I can imagine.""”

""We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me . . .""

  	""The whole packet?"" 

""Well, it was only eight biscuits, but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time.""

   	""Gladiators,"" said Fenchurch, ""would have had to do it in the sun. More physically gruelling.""
 
""There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead 
between us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a sigh of relief, of course. 

""As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper . . ."" 

   	""Yes?"" 

""Were my biscuits."" 

   	""What?"" said Fenchurch. ""What?""

""True.""

 	  ""No!""

The king announced to his people that at the end of the month, he would host a ball for the entire kingdom to find a suitable husband for his daughter. The night of the ball came, and all was well. It was the grandest ball any of the king's subjects had seen in quite a long time. Finally, after much dancing, courting, and festivities, the king had found three young men that would each make good husbands for his daughter. However, they were each so good, neither the king nor his daughter could choose between the three. The king thought and thought and thought. After a good hour of pondering, the king came up with an idea. He went to the three men and said, ""I will make you three a deal. As you know, my daughter and myself have had a difficult time deciding which of you would be the best man for her. I will give you all a quest to solve this issue. It does not matter how long it takes, but whichever of you brings me the most ping pong balls will earn my daughter's hand in marriage."" So, the three men depart on their quest. A month passes, and one of the three men returns to the castle carrying a burlap sack. He drops it at the feat of the king, saying, ""Sir, I have found one thousand ping pong balls on my quest!"" The king congratulates him on his good work, but does not marry off his daughter yet. A year passes. One day, the second of the three men leads an ox-drawn cart into the castle, saying, ""Sir, I have brought you one hundred thousand ping pong balls which I have found on my quest!"" The king congratulates him, but still waits to marry off his daughter until the third man returns. Five years pass, and the king starts to think that the third man will never return. One week before the wedding of the daughter and the second man, there is a knock on the castle doors. The guards open the doors and in walks a very ragged man. His hair is long and unkempt, his beard is scraggly, his clothes are torn, and he is matted with blood, dirt, and Nicolas Cage knows what else. His hands are also holding something in his pockets, which are dripping a mysterious goo. The king is in too great a state of shock to do anything about this strange man. He walks up to the throne and removes his hands from his pockets, revealing two large, green, slimy balls. The king suddenly realizes that this is the third man! He asks the third man, ""These aren't ping pong balls! Why didn't you bring me ping pong balls?"" The man is suddenly very surprised. He opens his mouth, saying:

The doctor thought for a moment and said ""Hmm, tricky situation. But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit.""  The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina.  The doctor said ""OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. The husband nodded and gave his approval. The young lady said ""Yes, Yes, whatever, just get on with it."" So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina.  After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, ""I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper.""  So the doctor went deeper and deeper.  After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed. The young lady began to quiver with excitement.  She began to moan and groan aloud. The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself, he then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises. The husband at this point suddenly became very annoyed and shouted, ""Now wait a minute! What the Hell do you think you're doing?""  The doctor, still concentrating, replied, ""Change of plan.

Everytime a boy was born, there was also a mammoth born. The boy had to hunt down the mammoth and kill it
to get free of his curse. Sadly there are no mammoths and all the males in this world have no mammoths to hunt.
Well let's go to a little village in Europe where a young boy was born. He came from a hunters family and destiny was
clear. At a very young age his training had begun. He was the best in his class and with the age of 16 he gratuated.
He had to leave his town and his family in order to hunt down his mammoth. He traveled for years without luck. But then, one day
while he was searching for a nice little place to take a shit. He saw a mammoth. Mighty and glorious it was. He decided to shit later
and began to plan. I watched the mammoth for a couple of hours until he was sure how to do it. He dug a whole in the ground and put some leafes
and sticks on it to cover it up. Then he took out a bag of bait and searched in it.Then he took out a single gummy bear and placed it on the trap he had built.The young mammoth-hunter hid behind a big rock and waited.He waited the whole night and the whole morning until
he saw the mammoth walking towards the trap. He held his breath and waited.
The mammoth stood in front of the trap and said: ""WOW, one gummy bear just for me? But stop, this could be a trap!""
The mammoth continued his walk.The mammoth-hunter did not want to give up and decided to place another gummy bear on the trap.

As they sat there, the sheep started looking better and better to the lonely man. Soon, he leaned over to the sheep and put his arm around it. The sheepdog, ever-protective of the sheep, growled fiercely until the man took his arm from around the sheep.

After that, the three of them continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but there was no more cuddling. A few weeks passed-by and, lo and behold, there was another shipwreck.

The only survivor was Hillary Clinton.

That evening, the man brought Hillary to the evening beach ritual. It was another beautiful evening - red sky, cirrus clouds, a warm and gentle breeze - perfect for a night of romance.

 Little guy says, ""All right, paint all of the horse's legs green, she'll talk to you.""
 Big guys says, ""All right. I do that, you better be right."" 
So he paints all four of the horse's legs green, and she comes out in an even more beautiful riding outfit, she looks amazing, she goes for a ride, comes back, goes in the house, doesn't say a word. 
Big guy says, ""I'm going to hurt you, you lie to me, make a fool of me.""
 And the little guy goes, ""Okay, you paint the whole horse green and you can beat the crap out of me if she doesn't talk to you."" 
Big guy stays up all night. Two coats on the horse—the horse is completely green. She comes out in her riding outfit looking gorgeous, she looks at the horse, and she says, ""Why is my horse painted green?"" 

The big guy responds: ""*You wanna fuck?*""",2 guys get a job on a ranch,0

       A ""friend of a friend"" put him in touch with a nefarious dark-side underworld figure who went by the name of ""Artie."" Artie explained to the husband that his going price for snuffing out a spouse was $5,000.

       The husband said he was willing to pay that amount but that he wouldn't have any cash on hand until he could collect his wife's insurance money. Artie Insisted on being paid at least something up front, so the man opened his wallet, displaying the single dollar bill that rested inside. Artie sighed, rolled his eyes, and reluctantly agreed to accept the dollar as down payment for the dirty deed.

       A few days later Artie followed the man's wife to the local Super Wal-Mart store. There, he surprised her in the produce department and proceeded to strangle her with his gloved hands. As the poor unsuspecting woman drew her last breath and slumped to the floor, the manager of the produce department stumbled unexpectedly onto the murder scene. Unwilling to leave any living witnesses behind, Artie had no choice but to strangle the produce manager as well.

       However, unknown to Artie, the entire proceedings were captured by the hidden security cameras and observed by the store's security guard, who immediately called the police. Artie was caught and arrested before he could even leave the store.

       Under intense questioning at the police station, Artie revealed the whole sordid plan, including his unusual financial arrangements with the hapless husband who was also quickly arrested.

       The next day the newspaper headline declared... (you're going to hate me for this...)

A woman goes into surgery for breast augmentation, as she had a very flat chest that she was self-conscious about.  When she woke up from the surgery, she saw no difference at all!  After recovering, she said to the surgeon, ""I don't understand it!  Why doesn't my chest look any different??""

The surgeon replies, ""This was a special kind of surgery--we are testing a prototype push-button pump.""  ""How does it work?"" she asks, puzzled.  The surgeon says, ""Remember those Reebok 'pump' shoes from the 90s?  Well, under your arm is a similar pump.  Just flap your arms like this (*flap your arms like a chicken*) and your breasts will gradually inflate with each pump.

So the woman tries it and is amazed by how she looks.  She is further amazed by the fact that she can inflate herself a little or a lot, depending on how she wants to look.

So the next day she goes to a bar, feeling super confident.  She sees a very handsome, well-dressed man sitting by himself at a table, so she goes up to him and says (*flap your arms like a chicken while saying what she says*), ""Hello there, I'm Cindy!  What's your name?""

The man says, (*now bend your knees slightly and flap them together while you say this--&gt;*) ""My name is Mike!  Nice to meet you!""


(The joke, of course, is that the knee-flapping makes it look like the guy had penis enlargement surgery using the same pumping device.)",New Breast Enlargement Technique,4

St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.
The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.
'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'
'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'
St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.

Bartender:I tell you what buddy, if you can make our mascot that donkey over there laugh, I'll let you drink the entire night for free.

The man walks back over and tells the bartender ""I'll take a knobb creak and a budweiser. Keep em coming"". The bartender being a man of his word pays his debt, and the gentleman drinks the night away on the house.

Bartender: I'll make the bet with ya, but this time make him cry. I don't mean calling and acting an ass, I mean legitimately crying.

Gentleman: You've got yourself a bet.

My boys, he says, I have lived a long life and have been very successful. I have done very many things, but I have one final request for you before I die. In the closet, on the shelf is a shoebox. Bring it to me. 

The oldest son glances at his brothers and heads to the closet. He comes back a moment later and sets the box on the bed. Jaíme lifts the lid. All the sons lean in. The box is filled with shriveled brown leathery things. 

These are all of the foreskins I have ever removed. I have saved every single one. I want you to take these o the leather maker and ask him to make something for me. Tell him it is my last request. 

With that, he took his last breath and he died. The boys looked at each other and decided that, well, as gross as it is, we have to honor our father's last wish. So they went to the leather maker. 

They entered the shop and placed the shoebox on the counter. The leather maker took the lid off and stared. 

This is our father's last wish, they said. He told us to come to you with all the foreskins and have you make something out of them. These foreskins are proof of all the hard work he did. Please, honor our father Jaíme's wish. The leather maker nodded and told them to come back to the shop in one week and he will have a wonderful gift. Jaíme was a good man. 

One week goes by and the sons go to the leather maker again. He disappears into the back room of the shop and comes back with the shoebox. He places it on the counter and pushes it towards the sons. 

They opened the box and peered inside. The oldest reached in and lifted out a wallet. 

They looked at each other and the oldest said this is the best you can come up with? You took all those foreskins and this is what you make for our father Jaíme the Moyel?
