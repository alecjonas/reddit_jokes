need to stay overnight to effect repairs to their ship.  The young couple
agrees and invite the aliens in for a snack. The aliens agree but say that
it would only be sociable to then invite the newlyweds for a snack.  ""We will
invite you aboard our spacecraft but you must abide by our customs. You must
stay the night and it is only courteous that we change partners for the
night."" The newlyweds talk it over and agree.  That night the wife is with
the male alien. He undresses and she stares at his perfect body. Then her gaze
crosses his groin and a look of disappointment comes over her. ""Is there
something wrong?"" asks the alien. ""Well you seem so ... uh... small."" ""No
problem"" replies the alien. He twists his ear and his organ grows longer. The
woman still seems disappointed. She indicates she would like the alien to be
""wider."" He twists the other ear and grows wider.  The next morning over
breakfast the wife tells her husband what a wonderful night she had with the
alien and that she can hardly wait to share some of the techniques with her
husband the next night.  ""Honey how was your night?"" she asks.  ""Terrible.""
he said.  ""The female alien was truly beautiful but all she did was twist my
ears all night long.""",A young man and woman have only been married for two days.,3

He first went to the wizard who enchanted his armor to protect him from the dragon’s scorching flames. He then went to the blacksmith, who gave him a mighty sword with which to slay the foul beast. He last visited the apothecary, who gave him a potion that would quicken his heart, infusing him with speed and vigor. Robin drank the potion down and took off for the dragon’s castle.

The dragon bellowed with anger when he spotted Robin at his gate. He swooped down from his perch and breathed a mighty flame. Miraculously, the wizard’s enchantment protected Robin from the terrible inferno. The dragon breathed and breathed, but he could not penetrate the wizard’s magic. When the dragon became exhausted, the invigorated Sir Robin ran under him and thrust his sword into the creature’s heart, killing him.

Robin left the dragon’s chamber and entered the castle’s main hall. There in the great room he saw an ordinary-looking man who introduced himself as Tim, of normal stature. Tim explained that he was the world’s tallest dwarf, who by sheer chance ended up regular height. He congratulated Robin on his victory and invited him to join him for some chai. Robin, hailing from fantasy-England, couldn’t pass up such a tempting offer and decided to sit down with the big little person.

As he sipped his drink, Robin recanted his journey, explaining to his average-height host how the wizard’s spell created a powerful barrier which the dragon’s fires could not defeat. Suddenly, Robin’s fast-beating heart, sped up even more from the refreshing drink, failed him. Robin clutched his chest and collapsed, dead. The moderately-sized man let out a wicked laugh! Robin, having survived the monstrous dragon, was defeated by the unremarkable trickster! Alas, Sir Robin. He was brave, but not wise. He failed to realize: It’s not the heat that kills you, it’s the huge midget’s tea.

He makes his way over to the bottle and tries to rub off the sand caked on the front of it so he can read it. However, this causes the bottle to start shaking violently in his hands so he throws it down on the beach. Suddenly, the cork flies off and a very disgruntled looking genie pops out. Before the man has time to gather what he just witnessed the genie asks ""So I'm going to grant you **one** wish, none of this 'three wishes' mumbo-jumbo. What will it be?""

The man, still alarmed, gathers his thoughts and ponders what he could possibly ask a genie. He finally replies, ""I've always wanted to surf Hawaii, but I get seasick on ships and I'm afraid to fly. Would you build me a highway all the way there from here?""

The genie responds rashly, ""Do you even know how much work that would take? I'm telling you, that would require an endless supply of cement and contracted labor, not to mention the supports required to reach the bottom of the ocean would be very unfeasible! Ask for something else.""

Taken aback from his rejected wish, the man ponders for yet a few more moments what else he could wish for and then replies, ""Well, I've had a lot of trouble with women in the past, but all I really want is to make a woman truly happy. Could you grant me the ability to understand women?""

After a deep sigh, the genie responds, ""So how many lanes did you want on that highway?"" ",Man wishes to understand women.,8

The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking, and pecking the ground. A rooster strolled past. 'So, you're the new hen, huh? How's your first day here?'
'Not bad,' replied Bob the hen, 'but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I'm gonna explode!'
'You're ovulating,' explained the rooster. Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before? '
'Never,' said Bob.
'Well, just relax and let it happen,' says the rooster. 'It's no big deal.'
Bob did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg!
Bob was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood. He soon laid another egg -- his joy was overwhelming.

Finally, he gave in, but demanded that the woman he marry be just as rich and religious as him, stunning beyond all comprehension, and never touched by any man. Not even her relatives.

His mother and father were dismayed, and thought the son arrogant for making such an impossible demand of the woman who would carry on their bloodline.

Funnily enough, the woman of his dreams turned up in town, asking for the most expensive suite in the rich family's lavish hotel. The religious son fell in love with the woman at once, but she had to meet his last demand. He asked her to dinner in the most expensive restaurant.

During the course of the meal, the rich man fell further and further in love with the perfect creature, who had very large, round breasts to boot, but finally mustered up the courage to ask her- has she ever been touched by another man?

""No,"" she purred, her sensual voice drawing him closer to her, ""my family and I are highly religious.""

The rich man rejoiced, and asked immediately for the woman's hand in marriage, handing her a box with the biggest diamond ring the woman had seen outside her family's treasury. She hastily put it on her hand, beaming. The wedding date was arranged for the next week.

ONE WEEK LATER

There was a huge commotion around the bride's room, with bridesmaids, the maid of honour and just regular maids all rushing around, organising and complimenting everything that the bride said or did.
""I'll do it myself!"" The bride snapped at a bridesmaid, who was trying to tighten her corset. The bride pushed her aside, tied the strings to a marble pillar in the room, and tugged hard.

The rich man stood at the altar, tears sliding down his cheeks, as his perfect bride began to walk down the aisle, her huge breasts pushed up almost impossibly by her pure white corset, sewn with pearls. Everyone in the room stood and sighed at the bride's beauty when disaster struck. The bride tripped on the hem of her dress.

More disturbingly, the force of the impact, combined with the tightness of her corset, ruptured the implant in her left breast.

A friend of the religious man's family, who happened to be a doctor sitting in an aisle seat, rushed to the bride's aid, undoing her corset and cupping her watery breast with his hands as an ambulance was called.

The religious man looked on in horror. He was ruining the sanktitty of their marriage.

He's so fascinated, in fact, that he's spent most of his life collecting them. On his massive ranch in his massive stables he has a collection of hundreds of horses, most of them rare. However, he ESPECIALLY has a thing for tiny horses (who wouldn't?) like shetlands and dwarf ponies. His pride and joy is a breeding pair of dwarf miniature show-horses, who one day give birth to a new baby, the smallest horse in the world.

Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, there's a study going on at QU Doha in Arabia who announces a huge discovery. A biology professor and his students have announced that they have found a way to introduce increased dwarfism in ungulates in-utero. Delighted that he might be able to make an EVEN TINIER horse, the man packs up the new baby pony and boards a train to Doha. It takes a lot of travel stops and baggage checks and customs officers asking him why he's transporting a tiny baby horse, but eventually he makes it to Qatar, to Doha, and eventually finds himself at the steps of QU's biology department.

Proudly, he takes the horse inside, attracting many ""awes"" and ""oohs"" with the tiny ungulate. He shakes many hands, has the horse photographed, and is finally introduced to the biology professor.

""I've heard of your work."" He tells the professor. ""And I must say I'm intrigued with what you and your team are doing.""

""Yes,"" the biologist says, ""my team's research is quite groundbreaking. But surely you didn't come all this way just to see a tiny horse fetus.""

""No, actually,"" the man says, ""I'm looking to make my own dwarf pony baby even smaller. He is the smallest horse in the world, and I want to make him even smaller.""

""I'm afraid that's not possible,"" says the professor. ""Even if he hadn't been born yet, our process only works on first-trimester horse fetuses. It's far too late.""

Distraught, the man says ""You don't mean...""

""I'm afraid so,"" says the professor. ""You can lead a horse to Qatar, but you can't make him shrink.""",So there's a British man with a fascination with horses...,3

So they tee off. About two holes into the game, the friends get curious about what the guy does for a living. So they ask him. The stranger tells them he's a hitman. The friends all laugh. 

The guy says, ''No really, I am a hitman. My gun is in my golf bag. I carry it everywhere. You can take a look at it if you like.'' 

So one of the friends dicides to check it out. He opened the bag and, sure enough, there is a rifle with a huge scope attached. He gets all excited and says, ''WOW! I bet I can see my house through here! May I look?'' The hit man replies, ''Sure.'' 

So the guy looks for a second and says, ''YEAH! You can see my house! I can even see through the windows into my bedroom. There's my wife, naked. Isn't she beautiful? WAIT! There's my next door neighbor! And he's naked too!'' 

This really upsets the guy, so he asks the hitman how much it would be for a hit. The hitman replies, ''I get $1000 everytime I pull the trigger.'' 

The guy responds, ''$1000??? Well, ok. I want two hits. I want you to shoot my wife right in the mouth. She's always nagging at me and I can't stand it. Second, I want you to shoot my neighbor in the penis, just for screwing around with my wife.'' 

The hit man agrees, gears up and looks through the scope. He's looking for about five minutes until finally the man starts to get really impatient and asks, ''What are you waitng for?!? 

The hitman replies, ''Just hold on..... I'm a about to save you a thousand bucks!''

The bad news is that it will require castration.
You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.    

The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.'

He saw a Men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new Suit.' 

He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new Suit.'

Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?'

I went to the monastery, knocked on the door, and asked the monk who answered ""My car broke down, do you think I can spend the night?"" The monks graciously accepted me, fed me dinner, and even helped me fix my car. As I tried to fall asleep that night, I heard a very strange sound. The next morning, I asked the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""

I was disappointed to say the least, but thanked them and went about my merry way. Some years later, my car breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept me, feed me, and again fix my car. That night, I heard the same strange noise that I have heard years earlier. The next morning, I asked what it is, but the monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""

I said, ""All right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk.""

So I set about this task. Some 43 years later, I returned and knocked on the door of the monastery.
I told the Monks, ""I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.""

The monks lead me to a wooden door where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. I reached for the knob, but the door is locked.

I said, ""Real funny. May I have the key?"" The monks give me the key, and I opened the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. I demanded the key to the stone door. The monks give me the key, and once again I opened the door, only to find a door made of ruby. I demanded another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until I had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

I was so relieved to know that I have finally reached to the end .

I unlocked the door, turned the knob, and behind that door I was amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

And what's the sound you ask? I can't tell you, you're not a Monk.",The first time I encountered Monks,2

---

It all started during my first year of college; both my parents wanted me to take an engineering course but I wanted to take BS Criminology, so I can become a detective and fulfill my childhood dream. Since they were my parents and they had the final say, I took an engineering course, Mechanical Engineering to be exact.

The first day of class was pretty okay. I didn’t have a lot of major classes yet since I was still in my first year, but I did have the usual English class, Science class, and of course, Math class.

I hate Math, ever since I took it in high school. All that algebra, trigonometry stuff was just too complicated for me. After graduating from high school, I took a big sigh of relief knowing that I wouldn’t have to take all those again…but nope! I’m in an engineering course!

I stepped inside my Math class five minutes late since I lost track of the time while buying chicken nuggets from McDonald’s across the street.

“Are you Mr. Sanchez?” The professor said as he removed his reading glasses, “Zack Sanchez?”

“Yes, sir” I replied.

“Please take a seat beside Mr. Burton over there so we can get started.”

I sat on the vacant seat beside the Burton guy when he suddenly patted my back.

“Hi there!” He said with a big smile, “I’m Mr. Burton, but you can call me Nick!”

It didn’t seem like it on the first day but Nick was actually a Math GOD. He was one of the few bright spots of my first year Math class. You can ask him pretty much any math-related question, and he’ll quickly answer in less than 5 seconds. Once in a while, I even randomly ask him a math question to see if he still has it, but every time I ask, he still manages to answer. I’m not sure if his answers are correct since even I don’t know the answers, but hey, we became close friends because of this.

Fast-forward a year and my parents finally agreed to me shifting to BS Criminology. I told the news to Nick during one of our breaks.

“So, does that mean we won’t be classmates anymore?” Nick said with a frown on his face.

“Not really” I replied, “We might still have common classes like Philosophy or Psychology when we reach our third year. Besides, I’m not transferring schools, so we’ll see each other around.”

Nick’s frown disappeared and started smiling. I was his only close friend since he was a little ‘weird’ according to other people.

“Well, see you around Zack.” He said as he stood up.

“See you around, man.” I said, “Oh hey, by the way, what’s the derivative of x2+4x+4?”

“2x+4”

“You still got it Nick!” I said with a laugh as he left, “Still got it.”

Fast-forward three more years and I finally graduated. Apparently, after I told him I was shifting, I never saw him again, and I don’t think I’ll ever see him in the future either.

After graduating, I traveled to the United States to find a job. I stayed in Los Angeles for a while but I was unsuccessful in finding a job. I went to different cities, looking for job openings. Sacramento, Houston, Orlando, Boston, all unsuccessful. I ended up staying at New York where my aunt was living since I was running out of money and needed a place to stay.

“Six months trying to find a job?” My aunt asked while we were eating dinner, “That’s harsh.”

“Yeah well, I guess the world doesn’t need detectives right now.” I said.

“Detective?” My aunt said with a puzzled look on her face, “I recall the news saying that the NYPD is trying to find a new detective right now.”

“Really? What happened to their old detective?”

“Apparently he was shot while on an investigation.”

“Oh…that’s pretty sad.”

“Nah, I’m sure it’ll work out better for you.” My aunt said, “Go to NYPD tomorrow morning, I’m sure they’ll hire you.”

The following day, I woke up, got dressed and went to the NYPD headquarters. I entered the building and talked to the woman in the reception.

“Hi there, I heard you guys needed a detective, so I’m here to apply.” I said to the receptionist.

“Sure, sir, just walk into that room right there and Mr. Kay would interview you.” She replied.

I walked inside the room where an old man with white hair wearing a black suit was sitting behind his desk.

“I’m here for the job application.” I said politely.

“The detective?” He said, “Oh yeah sure, you’re hired.”

“What, really?” I asked.

“Yeah, our old detective was shot, and we’re in desperate need for a new one.” He said, “As for your first assignment, you are to investigate three Frenchmen who are said to be cannibals. They kidnap people every night to be eaten as dinner, not only that but they’re also armed with high-powered rifles, hence how our old detective died.”

“Isn’t that a little too extreme for my first assignment?”

“Don’t worry, you’ll be accompanied by two of our best men. One’s an engineer and the other’s our senior police officer.”

“Engineer?”

“Yep, he was supposed to graduate next year but he was basically a prodigy and finished engineering a year early, his name is Nick Burton. Oh, speak of the devil, here they come now.”

Nick and a random Asian dude walked into the room. To my surprise, it was the same Nick I was classmates with three years ago.

“Zack?” Nick said, “Is that you?”

“Nick!” I shouted as I gave him a hug, “Long time, no see! What’s the square root of 3481?”

“59” He answered, “Nice to see you too, Zack.”

“Since you guys seem to know each other, I’ll just introduce you to our senior police officer, Wang Si Qi.” Mr. Kay said. “He’ll protect you guys in case things get out of hand.”

“When do we start?” I asked Mr. Kay.

“Oh, right now!”

The three of us left HQ in a black Ford van. The generic black van used for kidnapping, even though we aren’t kidnappers but instead, the police. We entered a warehouse where the Frenchmen were hiding for a week. We found traces of human blood, burnt wood, and pieces of cloth; other than that, nothing.

“I’ll go inspect the back of the warehouse.” Wang Si Qi said.

“Sure, Mr. Wang” I replied.

“Call me Si.” He said, “Hearing ‘Mr. Wang’ makes me feel old.”

Si went to the back of the warehouse while Nick and I stayed to investigate.

“What happened?” Nick asked.

“Seems like they dragged the body here.” I said, “They might’ve eaten the body here as well.”

“No, I meant during college. We never saw each other ever since that day.”

“Bad luck maybe. It might be that our schedules didn’t match so we never had a common break time. But it’s okay, at least we’re together again.”

We suddenly heard gunshots from the back of the warehouse. I quickly ran to the source of the sound and told Nick to stay near the van, just in case we needed to escape.

I ran outside but Si was nowhere to be found. I walked around for a couple of minutes and saw a trail of blood leading to another warehouse. I took a peek inside the warehouse through a small window and saw three people sitting around a bonfire, eating dismembered body parts of a person I assume was Si.

I quickly ran back to the van and told Nick to start it.

I got inside and immediately shouted, “Floor it, Nick. We have to get out of here and call for backup.”

“Why what happened out there?” Nick asked, “What’s wrong?”

“The French ate Si!” I said.

“It’s not time for that! Tell me what happened!”

“I told you, the French ate Si!” I said again.

“Zero!!!”

I had to work the night of his party, so the next day I headed over to his place to drop off his gift. He had a good haul - around 15 six packs (some missing a few of course) and the same number of glasses.

I wished him a happy birthday and gave him the beer, but I hesitated in handing over the pint glass. I was very fond of it and reluctant to part with it. He must have noticed my hesitation, and being the good friend that he is, pushed it gently back toward me.

The crowd murmurs their approval. The man stands up on the bar, drops his trousers, and places his privates in the alligator's open mouth. The gator closes his mouth as the crowd gasps. After a minute, the man grabs a beer bottle and raps the alligator hard on the top its head. The gator opens his mouth, and the man removes his genitals, unscathed, as promised. The crowd cheers, and he receives the first of his free drinks.

The man stands up again and makes another offer: ""I'll pay anyone $100 who's willing to give it a try.""

A hush falls over the crowd. A moment later, a hand goes up in the back of the bar.

""I'll try,"" says a small woman, ""but you have to promise not to hit me on the head with the beer bottle.""",A guy walks into a bar with a pet alligator by his side.,5

Of course, it would get very cold out, so he would get very cold too.

One day he had an idea about how to keep warm.  He sawed his kayak down the middle lengthwise and strapped the two pieces to the bottom of a kerosene-powered space heater like pontoons on a catamaran.  Then he sat on the space heater and paddled out onto the lake.

At first it worked, and he was toasty warm as he floated along.  But then, suddenly, some of the kerosene caught fire.  In only a few seconds, the whole contraption went up in flames and sank into the icy waters, where the man died of hypothermia.

Which just goes to show, you can't halve your kayak and heat it, too.",The story of the freezing kayaker,3
