The wife got a terrible headache and told her husband to go to the party alone, and to make sure to say hello to her family. He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed and there was no need for his good time to be spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went.

The wife, after sleeping soundly for about an hour, woke without pain and as it was still early, decided to go to the party. As her husband didn't know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him.

So she joined the party and soon spotted her husband in his costume, cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice ""chick"" he could and copping a little feel here and a little kiss there. His wife went up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he left his new partner high and dry and devoted his time to her. She let him go as far as he wished, naturally, since he was her husband. After more drinks he finally whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had passionate intercourse in the back seat.

Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away and went home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make up for his outrageous behaviour. She was sitting up reading when he came in, so she asked what kind of time he had.

""Oh, the same old thing. You know I never have a good time when you're not there.""

Then she asked, ""Did you dance much?"" He replied, ""I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance. When I got there, I met Pete, Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went into the spare room and played poker all evening.""

""You must have looked really silly wearing that costume playing poker all night!"" she said with unashamed sarcasm.

""Actually, I gave my costume to your brother, apparently he had the time of his life."" ",The Halloween Party,215

Whereas, on or about the night prior to a certain Approved PTO Holiday, there did occur at a certain improved piece of real property (hereinafter ""the House"") a general lack of stirring by all creatures therein, including, but not limited to, a mouse. A variety of foot apparel, e.g. stockings, socks, etc., had been affixed by and around the chimney in said House in the hope and/or belief that St. Nick a/k/a/ St. Nicholas a/k/a/ Santa Claus (hereinafter ""Claus"") would arrive at some time thereafter.

The minor residents, i.e. the children, of the aforementioned House were located in their individual beds and were engaged in nocturnal hallucinations, i.e. dreams, wherein visions of confectionery treats, including, but not limited to, candies, nuts and/or sugar plums, did dance, cavort and otherwise appear in said dreams. Whereupon the party of the first part (sometimes hereinafter referred to as ""I""), being the joint-owner in fee simple of the House with the parts of the second part (hereinafter ""Mama""), and said Mama had retired for a sustained period of sleep. (At such time, the parties were clad in various forms of headgear, e.g., kerchief and cap.)

Suddenly, and without prior notice or warning, there did occur upon the unimproved real property adjacent and appurtenant to said House, i.e. the lawn, a certain disruption of unknown nature, cause and/or circumstance. The party of the first part did immediately rush to a window in the House to investigate the cause of such disturbance. At that time, the party of the first part did observe, with some degree of wonder and/or disbelief, a miniature sleigh (hereinafter ""the Vehicle"") being pulled and/or drawn very rapidly through the air by approximately eight (8) reindeer. The driver of the Vehicle appeared to be, and in fact was, the previously referenced Claus.

Said Claus was providing specific direction, instruction and guidance to the approximately eight (8) reindeer and specifically identified the animal co-conspirators by name Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner and Blitzen (hereinafter ""the Deer""). (Upon information and belief, it is further asserted that an additional co-conspirator named ""Rudolph"" may have been involved.)

The party of the first part witnessed Claus, the Vehicle and the Deer intentionally and willfully trespass upon the roofs of several residences located adjacent to and in the vicinity of the House, and noted that the Vehicle was heavily laden with packages, toys and other items of unknown origin or nature. Suddenly, without prior invitation or permission, either express or implied, the Vehicle arrived at the House, and Claus entered said House via the chimney.

Said Claus was clad in a red fur suit, which was partially covered with residue from the chimney, and he carried a large sack containing a portion of the aforementioned packages, toys, and other unknown items. He was smoking what appeared to be tobacco in a small pipe in blatant violation of local ordinances and health regulations.

Claus did not speak, but immediately began to fill the stockings of the minor children, which hung adjacent to the chimney, with toys and other small gifts. (Said items did not, however, constitute ""gifts"" to said minors pursuant to the applicable provisions of the U.S. Tax Code.) Upon completion of such task, Claus touched the side of his nose and, through no evident means, flew, rose and/or ascended up the chimney of the House to the roof where the Vehicle and Deer waited and/or served as ""lookouts."" Claus immediately departed for an unknown destination.

However, prior to the departure of the Vehicle, Deer and Claus from said House, the party of the first part did hear Claus state and/or exclaim ""Merry Approved PTO Holiday to all and to all a good night!"" Or words to that effect.",Legal Dept. was Asked to Clean Up a Holiday Classic,0

A few minutes later he feels the pain, the belly is grumbling, so he goes back to the bathroom. Again he sits for a few minutes, no joy, so he goes back to bed. This happens a couple more times in the next hour.

Once again he has the grumble gut and pain, but he figures it is yet another false alarm so he stays in bed. BRAPPPPpppp he shits the bed. Now he is embarrassed a grown man shitting the bed. So to hide it from his wife he cleans up the mess, and puts clean sheets on the bed. He wads the dirty sheets up and throws them out the apartment window.

The sheets fall down into the alley and land on a drunk sleeping in the alley. The drunk wakes up screaming and thrashing about in the sheets. Ripping, tearing, and shredding his way out of the bundle of sheets. A policeman hears the commotion and runs to the alley. He shines his flashlight down the alley and sees this drunk standing there with pieces of bed sheet scattered all around him.

While waiting at the bar, he noticed Bill Gates walk into the restaurant with his wife, and after talking to the hostess, Bill walked toward the bathroom before being seated.  The man then chose to follow Bill in to ask him a question.  

""Excuse me, Mr. Gates?""

""Yes?"" replied Bill.  

""My name is Jack Vandalay.  I know this is inappropriate, especially coming up to you in a bathroom and all, but I'm about to meet this beautiful, intelligent woman for our first date and I think it would go a really long way if you could come up and say 'Hi' while we ate and pretend like we are old friends.""

""You know,"" replied Bill ""Even though this isn't something I would normally approve of, it's my anniversary tonight so I'm feeling a bit romantic.  After you two are seated, I'll come over and pretend like we are old friends.""


""Thanks so much Mr. Gates!""


After parting ways, Bill sat down to a table with his wife and soon Jack's date arrived.  They were seated at their table and ordered a bottle of wine.  Bill waited a moment before feigning surprise and approached Jack and the woman at the table.  

""Jack? Jack Vandalay! It's been a while! How have you been old buddy?"" Bill said as he approached the table.

He decided to get a job. He was nearing his sell by date and figured it was time. There are three social classes in Cheerio City: the Regulars, the Wheats, and the Frosteds. The young Cheerio was simply a Regular and had little to no social power. The Wheat Cheerios around him all have average paying jobs and average families. The Frosteds Cheerios represent the 1% of the 1% of Cheerio City. The young Cheerio rarely caught glimpse of a Frosted Cheerio. On his search for a job, he finds a baby Frosted Cheerio rolling uncontrollably into the busy intetsection of Cheerio Street and Cheerio Avenue. He heroically saves the baby Cheerio from being flattened by a Cheeriomobile because he has a good personality and strong morals. The father of the baby was the Frosted CEO of Cheerio City Inc. He rolls over as fast as he could and sees that this young Regular Cheerio saved his baby even though he risked his own life doing it. The Frosted Cheerio promotes him to Wheat status and gives him a job as a secretary for his strong morals and good personality. Years later, the now middle aged Wheat Cheerio had worked hard for little pay but always kept a smile on his face because he has a good personality and strong morals. His withering boss decided that because of the Wheat Cheerio's dedication to Cheerio City Inc. that he would appoint him as the new CEO. The old Frosted Cheerio retired and elevated the Wheat Cheerio's status to Frosted and made him the new head of the Incorporation. Years later towards the end of the now elderly Frosted Cheerio's life, he took one last vacation to Cheerio Island to relax. Cheerio Island was very popular this time of year and there were many other Cheerios visiting. It was a very toasty day and everyone was parched. The Frosted Cheerio wanted some milk, but the milk lime was too long. Being a Frosted Cheerio, he could have cut to the front but he didn't because of his strong morals and good personality. So he moved on to the orange juice line, but it was also too long. Lastly, there was fruit punch. The Frosted Cheerio searched endlessly for the line, but there was no punch line.",A Day in the Life of a Cheerio,5

No one else is in the bar yet, except for the bartender reading the paper and a barfly down at the end of the bar, surrounded by empty glasses.

The man asks the bartender for a glass of his finest 20 year old scotch, neat. The bartender reaches under the bar and pours the man a glass of scotch. The man throws it back, swishes it around, and then spits it out. ""This is 5 year old scotch, I asked for 20 year old!""

The bartender nods, grabs a bottle off the shelf behind the bar and pours the glass. The man throws it back, swishes it around, and then spits it out. ""This is 10 year old scotch! I asked for 20 year old! Stop dicking around!""

The first night he was in town he went to the local diner to get some authentic Mexican cuisine. As he is sitting down, he notices a man sitting by himself in the corner. Suddenly all of the waiters and waitresses come out of the kitchen, clapping and singing. One of them is holding an enormous silver platter. He sets it down, takes the lid off, and reveals two giant meatballs surrounded by grilled vegetables and covered in sauce. Eventually the commotion dies down and the waiters and waitresses drift away. The man calls one of them over to ask what the meatballs were all about. 
""Well,"" said the waiter, ""every week we have a bullfight, and it is an honor to eat the testicles of the bull."" Feeling adventurous, the man decides to come in next week to eat the bull testicles, as he really wants to experience authentic Mexican culture. 

As his trip is coming to a close, the man goes back to the restaurant, and orders the bull testicles. All of the waiters and waitresses come out of the kitchen, clapping and singing. One of them sets down an enormous silver platter, takes the lid off, and reveals two tiny meatballs surrounded in vegetables and covered in sauce. The man asks why they are so small this week, and the waiter says with a devilish grin on his face:

The train suffered a terrible crash and only those in the front of the train survived. Frederick was put on trial for the negligent homicide of nearly a hundred people. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by the electric chair.
When asked what he'd like for his last meal, he replied simply with ""A banana, if you will."" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. Frederick ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen.
However, after the electricity was activated, nothing happened. The guard was astonished. Not knowing what to do, he simply let Frederick go.
                                  

&amp;nbsp;



A few days later, Frederick was back to work conducting trains. Shortly after his return, he managed to derail yet another train, this time by ~~unfortunately~~ browsing 4chan. He killed nearly a hundred people again but survived the crash. As before, he was charged and found guilty of multiple negligent homicides. Again, he was sentenced to death by electric chair.
It was the same prison guard as before. He was surprised to see Frederick again but held his tongue, for the man was about to die and it would be rude to question him. ""What would you like for your last meal, sir?"" Frederick respond as he did last time: ""A banana, if you will."" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. Frederick ate the banana in regular fashion and again braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen.
The electricity was activated and Frederick was prepared. But, as before, he was unhurt. The prison guard checked for any malfunctions but found nothing, not believing the entire situation was possible. Now even more incredulous than before, and not knowing what to do, the guard let him go.  



&amp;nbsp;


Frederick was, against all odds, alive and was incredibly still allowed to continue his job as a train conductor even though he was responsible for the deaths of almost two hundred people.
He was thankful to be allowed to continue his job but also scared. He would try to drive more carefully from now on. However, this effort didn't help much, as the very next train he was conducting, he managed to somehow crash. He was the only survivor of the train, which now killed four hundred people. He was again charged, and again found responsible for the deaths of over a hundred people. He was sentenced to death by electric chair.
The prison guard was the same, the meal was the same, the procedure was the same. After giving  the banana, the guard was silent. He couldn't bring himself to say anything, all he could do was prepare the chair.

&amp;nbsp; 

Frederick sat in the chair, expecting death. The guard activated it and, again, Fredrick was unscathed. The prison guard couldn't contain himself. He simply had to ask, ""Sir, how did you manage to crash a train 3 times? And how did you survive the chair 3 times? Did the banana have something to do with it?""
Joe paused for a moment. Then he replied: ""No, I'm just a terrible conductor.""

All of her friends made fun of her for her fear, so Emily wanted to get over it as soon as possible. After class one day she met Dat, a Chinese foreign exchange student who happened to be a bee keeper, and Emily got to thinking. I mean, what could be a better way to get over a fear of bees than to date someone who's job it is to be around them all day?

After their first date, Emily soon learned that Dat didn't speak English that well. It was beyond just him not being able to pronounce certain words, but not understanding slang either. Dat constantly referred to his penis as ""his feeling"". To me it was hilarious. 

Fast forward 6 months; Emily and Dat are hitting it off pretty well. Emily invited Dat over to her dorm room for a little ""adult time"" one summer evening and left the window wide open. As luck would have it a bee made its way in to the room as Emily had her hand down Dat's Pants. Seeing the bee and reverting to her older ways, Emily immediately started freaking out. 

Dat then spoke up and said ""Don't stop! Bee Leavin! Hold on to Dat feeling!""

&gt; The gates of Heaven are getting worn out, God put an archangel in charge of hiring contractors to build new ones. 

&gt;The Indian contractor gave a quote for $3000: $1000 for materials, $1000 for labor, and $1000 for profit.

&gt;The German contractor gave a quote for $6000: $2000 for materials, $2000 for labor, and $2000 for profit.

&gt;The Chinese contractor gave a quote for $9000, and explains to the archangel, ""$3000 for me, $3000 for you, and $3000 to hire the Indians to do it.""

Part II:

&gt;Some time later, Hell's gates needed to be redone too. The Devil put one of his archdemons in charge of hiring contractors for the job. Knowing that God got ripped off by the Chinese last time, he capped the budget at $3000.

&gt;The German contractor saw the budget and left without bidding. The Indian contractor bid $3000. The Chinese contractor slipped the archdemon $500 in an envelope, and also bid $3000. So the Chinese contractor got the job again.

&gt;So the Chinese guy spends $500 on materials, $500 on labor, got the project to about halfway done, then stopped working on it, telling the Devil that the current budget isn't enough. So this project dragged on for another 6 months. The Devil was tired of not having a functional gate, so he caved in and paid the Chinese $3000 more to get the job done.

Part III:

&gt;Some time later, the elevator between Heaven and Hell broke down and a new one was needed. Having learned their lessons from before, God and The Devil decided to cap the budget at $3000, and added the condition that the job must be completed on that $3000 alone.

&gt;The German saw the budget and walked away again. The Indian bid $3000. The Chinese bid $3000 also, then promised to throw a celebration party with liquor and strippers after the project is finished. So the Chinese got the job again.

&gt;The Chinese contractor took the $3000, then paid $500 for materials, $500 for labor, and finished the job.

&gt;God hired an inspector to approve the work. The Chinese gave the inspector $500 in an envelope and passed inspections. But then after a couple of weeks, the elevator broke down again. The safety inspector pointed out that the elevator was built with proprietary parts produced by the Chinese contractor's uncle's factory, so they paid the Chinese contractor another $3000 to get it fixed.

Part IV:

&gt;Finally, the gate to the mortal realm broke down too, so that dead spirits can't go where they need to go, and the souls waiting for reincarnation can't enter the mortal realm (in this story, Hell is basically a waiting room for reincarnation, don't argue with it, it makes sense somehow).

&gt;After all the problems they had before, they wrote strict terms into the contract: $3000 budget, must provide free repairs for 1 billion years.

&gt;The German didn't even bother showing up for bidding. The Indian bid $3000. The Chinese guy shows up and proposes this: ""I will take the job for free and be responsible for free repairs for TWO billion years, but I want management rights for this gate for 1 billion years.""

&gt;Having been duped by this contractor so many times before, both God and The Devil are skeptical. However, the terms were just too good to pass up. So they hired the Chinese guy again.

&gt;So the Chinese contractor goes to work on this gate. And after it got built, he set up a toll booth at the gate. Dead souls that are going to Heaven have to pay $500, the souls getting reincarnated have to pay every time passing through, $500 for respawning in a middle-class family, $1000 for respawning in a wealthy family. And if they can't afford to pay the toll, they respawn in a Chinese slum.",Chinese Manipulation,0

The priest smiles and nods, saying, ""Yes, this is a rather large son of a b***.""

The priest takes the fish back to the monastery, and a young nun sees it. ""Where did you get that fish, father?""

priest: ""I caught this son of a b***!""

nun: ""Father! Your language!""

priest: ""No, my child. That's the name of the fish.""

""I'm a professional gambler,"" replied the man.

The bartender said, ""There's no such thing! I mean, your odds are fifty-fifty at best, right?""

""Well, I only bet on sure things,"" said the guy.

""Like what?"" asked the bartender.

""Well, for example, I'll bet you fifty dollars that I can bite my right eye,"" he said.

The bartender thought about it. ""Okay,"" he said.

So, the guy pulled out his false right eye and bit it. ""Aw, you screwed me,"" said the bartender, and paid the guy his $50.

""I'll give you another chance. I'll bet you another fifty dollars that I can bite my left eye,"" said the stranger.

The bartender thought again and said, ""Well, I know you're not blind, I mean, I watched you walk in here. I'll take that bet."" So, the guy pulled out his false teeth and bit his left eye.

""Aw, you screwed me again!"" protested the bartender.

""That's how I win so much money, bartender. I'll just take a bottle of your best scotch in lieu of the fifty dollars,"" said the man.

With that, the guy went to the back room and spent the better part of the night playing cards with some of the locals. After many hours of drinking and card playing, he stumbled up to the bar. Drunk as a skunk, he said, ""Bartender, I'll give you one last chance. I'll bet you five hundred dollars that I can stand on this bar on one foot and piss into that whiskey bottle on that shelf behind you without spilling a drop.""

The bartender once again pondered the bet. The guy couldn't even stand up straight on two feet, much less one. ""Okay, you're on,"" he said.

The guy climbed up on the bar, stood on one leg, and began pissing all over the place. He hit the bar, the bartender, himself, but not a drop made it into the whiskey bottle.

The bartender was ecstatic. Laughing, the bartender said, ""Hey pal, you owe me five hundred dollars!""

The teacher said, ""Let's begin by reviewing some American History. Who said 'Give me Liberty , or give me Death'?""

She saw a sea of blank faces, except for Chandrasekhar, who had his hand up:?'Patrick Henry, 1775'he said.

'Very good! Who said 'Government of the People, by the People, for the People, shall not perish from the Earth?''

Again, no response except from Chandrasekhar. 'Abraham Lincoln, 1863' said Chandrasekhar.

The teacher snapped at the class, 'Class, you should be ashamed. Chandrasekhar, who is new to our country, knows more about our history than you do.'

She heard a loud whisper: 'Fuck the Indians,'

'Who said that?' she demanded. Chandrasekhar put his hand up. 'General Custer, 1862.'

At that point, a student in the back said, 'I'm gonna puke.'

The teacher glares around and asks 'All right! Now, who said that?' Again, Chandrasekhar says, 'George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.'

Now furious, another student yells, 'Oh yeah? Suck this!'

Chandrasekhar jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, 'Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky,1997'

Now with almost mob hysteria someone said 'You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll kill you.' Chandrasekhar frantically yells at the top of his voice, ' Michael Jackson to the child witnesses testifying against him, 2004.'

The teacher fainted. And as the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said, 'Oh shit, we're screwed!' And Chandrasekhar said quietly, 'I think it was Lehmann Brothers, September 15th, 2008'.

A mother, father, son and grandfather washed up on a deserted island. They had seen enough episodes of The Swiss Family Robinson to know they had to prepare for a new life without being rescued. They made do with what they had and lived relatively comfortably. After a few years the grandfather would leave each night after dinner and go for a walk on the beach. As the grandson grew older he got very curious about where his grandfather would go every night. One night he decided to follow his grandfather. As the grandfather walked down the beach the boy was trailing behind and saw his grandfather turn into the jungle. The boy followed into the jungle. In the middle of the jungle was a river that the grandfather began to cross. The boy stayed behind and began to cross the river after his grandfather was out of the water. On the other side of the river was a mountain that the grandfather was hiking up. In the side of the mountain was a steel door. The boy exited the river and hiked up the mountain behind his grandfather. As he got to the steel door it shut behind his grandfather. He tried to open the door but it was locked. The boy went back down the mountain, across the river, through the jungle, and down the beach to the hut. Lying in bed the boy thought to himself, “Tomorrow I will stay a little closer and catch the steel door before it closes.” The next day the boy finished supper and followed his grandfather down the beach, through the jungle, across the river, up the mountain, and just as the steel door was closing the boy caught it and went through. As he stepped through the door the boy couldn’t believe what he saw, a cement door being slammed shut. The boy walked over to the cement door and tried to open it, but it was locked. The boy went back through the steel door, down the mountain, across the river, through the jungle, and back down the beach to the hut. Lying in bed the boy thought to himself, “Tomorrow I will stay a little closer and catch the cement door before it closes.” The next day the boy finished supper and followed his grandfather down the beach, through the jungle, across the river, up the mountain, and just as the steel door was closing the boy caught it and went through. He rushed and caught the cement door before it closed. Just as he walked through he saw a wooden door closing behind his grandfather. Sure enough, the wooden door was locked. The boy went back through the cement door, through the steel door, down the mountain, across the river, through the jungle, and back down the beach to the hut. Lying in bed the boy thought to himself, “Tomorrow I will stay a little closer and catch the wooden door before it closes.” The next day the boy finished supper and followed his grandfather down the beach, through the jungle, across the river, up the mountain, and just as the steel door was closing the boy caught it and went through. He rushed and caught the cement door before it closed. He rushed and caught the wooden door before it close. As he walked through he was his grandfather with a pitch fork. He was feeding pieces of meat to giant caged gorilla. The boy gasped and his grandfather heard him and turned. The grandfather said, “It looks like you have found my secret. I found this gorilla after a few years on the island and made a commitment to keep him caged and feed him.” The boy just nodded his head and listened. The grandfather went on to say, “One day I will be gone and you will have to keep up this responsibility. All you need to do is come once a day and feed him. The only rule is that you must NEVER touch him.” The boy said, “Why grandpa?” “It is just the rule, never touch the gorilla. Promise me you will never touch the gorilla” said the grandfather. The boy promised. The boy then accompanied his grandfather every day to feed the gorilla. After a few years the grandfather died and the boy took over the feeding. One day while the gorilla is eating, he had his back to the boy. The boy put his hand through the cage and just as he is about to touch the gorilla he pulls his hand back. He says to himself “I can’t do it, I made a promise.” That night as the boy is lying in bed he says to himself, “Grandpa is dead now, if I want to touch the gorilla, I can touch the gorilla.” The next day as the gorilla is eating the boy puts his hand through the cage. He reaches in and slowly get closer to the giant animal. Finally he touches it. The gorilla stops eating and turns around. The gorilla starts jumping up and down and banging on the cage. The boy runs to the wooden door and just as he opens it he can see the gorilla bursting out of the cage. He slams the door and runs to the cement door. As he is going through he sees the gorilla turn the wooden door into splinters. He slams the door shut and runs to the steel door. As he is going through he sees the gorilla turn the cement door into ruble. He slams the door shut and runs down the mountain. From the base of the mountain he can see the gorilla burst through the steel door leaving nothing but shrapnel. The boy wades across the river and as he is getting out he sees the gorilla rumbling down the mountain and into the water. He then runs through the jungle and can hear the gorilla getting out of the water and begin to barrel through the jungle. The boy runs down the beach and as he reaches the hut he can see the gorilla emerging from the jungle. The boy has nowhere else to run and wades into the ocean. As he is about knee deep in the water he sees the gorilla in front of the hut jumping up and down. The gorilla starts to run into the water. The boy wades further out until he is neck deep. He looks back only to see the gorilla in the knee deep water. The boy goes further out until he cannot touch and is just floating. In the distance he can see the gorilla neck deep in the water. He swims out further and looks back. As he looks back he can no longer see the gorilla. He begins swimming frantically looking for the gorilla and sees nothing. All of a sudden the gorilla pops up in front of the boy. The gorilla reaches out, touches the boy and says “You’re it.”",The Caged Gorilla,2

This assessment must also consider whether it is appropriate to use only one horse for such a venture, particularly where there are multiple passengers.

Please note that permission must also be obtained in writing from landowners before their fields may be entered.

To avoid offending those not participating in celebrations, we request that laughter is moderate only and not loud enough to be considered a noise nuisance.

Benches, stools and orthopaedic chairs are now available for collection by any shepherds planning or required to watch their flocks by night.

While provision has also been made for remote monitoring of flocks by CCTV cameras from a centrally heated shepherd observation hut, all facility users are reminded that an emergency response plan must be submitted to account for known risks to the flocks.

The angel of the Lord is additionally reminded that prior to shining his/her glory all around he/she must confirm that all shepherds are wearing appropriate personal protective equipment to account for harmful effects of UVA, UVB and the over-whelming effects of glory.

Following last year's well publicised case, everyone is advised that EC legislation prohibits any comment with regard to the redness of any part of Mr R Reindeer. Further to this, exclusion on Mr R Reindeer from reindeer games will be considered discriminatory and disciplinary action will be taken against those found guilty of this offense.

While it is acknowledged that gift-bearing is commonly practised in various parts of the world, everyone is subject to hospitality guidelines and all gifts must be registered. This applies regardless of the individual, even royal personages. It is particularly noted that direct gifts of currency or gold are specifically precluded under provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Further caution is advised regarding other common gifts, such as aromatic resins that may initiate allergic reactions.

Finally, in the recent case of the infant found tucked up in a manger without any crib for a bed, Social Services have been advised and will be arriving shortly.

Compliance of these guidelines is advised in order for your to fully participate with the festive spirit.
