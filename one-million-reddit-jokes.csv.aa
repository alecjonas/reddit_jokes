The men are shocked, and immediately get to work. The first man comes back with 10 apples. The cannibal king says to him “now, if you can shove each of those apples up your ass, without making a single facial expression, I will set you free. If you cannot, we will eat you” mr. apples guy gets up to #4, and can’t handle the pain any longer and starts crying, so the king kills him and the tribe prepares him. 

The second man comes back with 10 strawberries. The king gives him the same instructions, and the man gets up to the 8th strawberry and then suddenly bursts out laughing, hysterically. The king kills him as well, and the tribe adds him to the fire. 

Up in heaven, the first guy meets up with the second guy. He says “Mate! You could have gotten away, why, of all things, did you start laughing like that?” 

The second guy replies “well mate I saw the third guy running, and he was carrying pineapples!”

When he got to  the barn he was shocked to find that the cows eyes were crossed! He  thought, ""This is a valuable cow, I can't have it walking around  cross-eyed."" So he called the Vet.

The  vet came out and said he knew exactly what to do. He proceeded to take  out a hose and stick it in the cow's butt. He then told the farmer to go  around and watch the cow's eyes.

As  the farmer was watching the vet took a deep breath and blew into the  hose. To the farmer's amazement the cow's eyes went back to normal. The  vet said that'll be $200. The farmer was a bit taken aback by the steep  charge, but he was thankful that his cow was back to normal, so he paid  the vet without complaint.

The  next day, he went out to milk the cow as usual. To his great dismay he  found that the cow's eyes were crossed again! He didn't feel like paying  the vet again though, so he decided to treat the cow himself.

He  began to do the same procedure to the cow exactly as he saw the vet do  it the day before. However he could not see if it was having the same  effect. So he called Billy-Bob the farm hand over and said, ""I want you  to watch the cow's eyes while I blow in this hose."" Billy-Bob agreed and  watched as farmer Brown did the deed. However, nothing happened. He  reported to the farmer who tried it again. Still, no result.

Farmer  Brown was stumped, so he told Billy-Bob to blow while he watched the  eyes. As farmer Brown moved to the front, he saw Billy-Bob take out the  hose and turned it around! Just before he put it to his lips, the farmer  yelled, ""What the hell are you doing?!""

Billy-Bob  looked at him incredulously and said, ""You don't think I am gonna put  my mouth on the same end of the pipe that you had your on.""",Cross-eyed Cow,20

“So glad you could come! Are you having a good time?”

“Not really. I don’t know anyone here except for you. I think I’m just gonna get some punch.” He says.

“Ooh, grab me a glass, would you?” She says.

So he goes up to the table with all the drinks and snacks and such, but there isn’t anyone there. He grabs two glasses and promptly gets back to the  frosted cheerio.

I knew a bloke who was a massive fan of tractors his whole life.

When he was a kid, he didn't have toy cars or posters of lambos on his bedroom wall, he had toy tractors and trailers and posters of the latest John Deeres.

He didn't go on holiday to Spain, France or even the Lake District. No, his family holidays were centred around the agricultural shows, especially the Great Yorkshire Show and the Appleby Show.

Sometimes, the tractor salesmen would even let him go for a ride on a tractor while they moved them about the ground!

As he grew up, his love for tractors never waned or faded, and was just as strong on his wedding day as when he was a child, to the point, he didn't have wedding cars, but tractors!

On his honeymoon, he and his new wife travelled north to stay at Appleby Manor Hotel and go to the show, telling everyone that they were honeymooning.

One of the salesmen, who'd known him for years, asked if he'd like to drive his new wife around the showground in the newest machine.

Obviously, he leapt at the chance! To take control of a tractor? This was a dream come true!

So, he and his wife climbed aboard and he drove a full circuit of the ground, loving every single second.

Of course, it couldn't last forever and all too soon, they got back to the salesman. They jumped down and thanked the salesman gratefully. The salesman asked if they'd like a photo with the tractor. Of course, they said yes and they stood next to the tractor, he with his hand on the step in front of the big wheel and his wife to the outside.

Unknown to anyone, he had forgotten to put the handbrake on and a sudden gust of wind, combined with the slight incline the tractor was on caused it to roll forward.

Before anyone realised what was happening, he'd slipped on the grass and the big wheel had run straight over him.

The Great North Air Ambulance service was in attendance and flew him straight to the Cumberland Infirmary at Carlisle. Nearly every bone in his body was broken, several of organs were damaged and he had huge internal bleeding.

It took hours of surgery to stabilise his condition, followed by a medically induced coma lasting several weeks and repeated surgical treatments to realign bones and repair what damage they could.

He then was put into an intense physiotherapy regime to teach him to walk and rebuild the strength he had lost over the past six months.

Obviously, all this time in the hospital gave him a lot of time to think about his life and he came to the realisation that being such a huge fan of tractors had been a massive waste of time and had, in the end, cost him a lot more than it had ever been worth. He vowed, silently, to leave his obsession behind and move on with a more normal life.

As he laid in his hospital bed, day after day, week after week, month after month, subsisting on the hospital food and whatever his beloved and devoted wife bought to him, he realised that when he got out of there, what he really fancied was a proper pie and a pint in a proper pub.

So when the day came, and he was finally discharged from the loving care of the infirmary, he hurpled on his stick across the road to the pub he'd seen. He got his pint from the bar, ordered a steak and ale pie with creamy mash, peas and gravy and took a seat at a table next to the window.

He was sipping away, soaking up the ambiance and listening to the old man at the end of the bar put the world to rights, when the door to the kitchen flew open and a huge billow of smoke plumed into the bar and filled the room.

Everyone was panicking, trying to get out of the pub, but not my mate.

He just calmly stood up, using the table for support and opened the window. He turned his head into the smoke and inhaled deeply, turned back to the window and blew out. He did this twice more and the smoke was gone.

Everyone just stopped and looked at him. After a moment the bartender spoke, “How the fuck did you do that???”

“Easy,” replied my friend, as he took his seat and picked up his pint, “I'm an ex tractor fan.”","what a set up, for a dad joke. it's worth it tho",55

post,fsyefs,2qh72,jokes,false,1585742268,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fsyefs/surprise/,self.jokes,,"Once there lived a woman who had a maddening passion for baked 
beans. She loved them but unfortunately, they had always had a very 
embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her. 

Then one day she met a man and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry she thought to herself, ""He is such a sweet and gentle man, he would never go for this carrying on."" 
She made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. 

Some months ater her car broke down on the way home from work. 
Since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way, she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home. 
So, she stopped at the diner and before she knew it, she had consumed three large orders of baked beans. 

All the way home she putt-putted, and upon arriving home she 
felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly, ""Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight."" He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table. 

She seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from his wife, the telephone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned. He then went to answer the telephone. 

The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the 
pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband 
was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted her weight to one leg and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of pulpwood mill. 

She took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then, she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cooked cabbage. 

Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the telephone farewells signaled the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with her napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself. 

She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned, apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked, and she assured him that she had not. 

At this point, he removed the blindfold, and she was surprised!!! 
There were twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish 
her a ""Happy Birthday""!!!",Surprise,5

The carpenter figured sawing the slats of their bed would give them a chuckle or two.

The electrician decided to wire the bed - with alternating current, of course.

The dentist wouldn't commit himself, but wore a sly grin and promised it would be memorable.

The nuptials went as planned and a few days later, each of the grooms buddies received the following note:

""Dear Friends, we didn't mind the bed slats being sawed. The electric shock was only a minor setback. But I swear by God Almighty, I'm going to kill whoever put novocaine in the condom!""",Wedding,15

He takes a corn on the cob from the pantry and inserts it into the lady, using it as a dildo.  The lady screams and moans while the man is trying not to gag from the smell.

Lady: “Wow that was absolutely amazing.  Here is some meatloaf and a thermos of iced tea.  My phone is on the countertop right over there”

After making some phone calls to his family and checking the gps to figure out how to get home, he walks outside with the meatloaf and some cold tea and walks around the corner of the house to find his friends.

When they reach the Pearly Gates, St. Peter greets them and tells them that due to the fact that Heaven is now overcrowded, God asked him to limit the number of people entering Heaven.

The three friends were sad realizing that all three will not be together anymore, so they ask him how are you going to choose who among us will go through the gates? To which St Peter replied, "" If anyone of you can ask me a question which I don’t know or cannot answer, then you’re worthy enough to go to Heaven; if not, then you’ll go straight to Hell.”  The three friends agreed.

Thomas stepped in first. He was a philosopher so he said, “OK, give me the most comprehensive report on Socrates’ Socrates’ teachings.”   With a snap of his finger, a stack of paper appeared next to St Peter. The philosopher read it and concluded it was correct. “Then, you are going to Hell!”

Arthur was next.  He was a mathematician so he asked, ""Give me the most complicated formula ever theorized!”    With a snap of his finger, another stack of paper appeared next to St Peter. The mathematician read it and reluctantly agreed it was correct.  “Then, you are going to Hell!”

Finally, Frank stepped in. He asked St peter to bring him a chair and he brought forward a chair. Frank asked him to drill 20 holes on the chair, he did just that. 

Frank then sat on the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, he asked, “Which hole did my fart come out from?” 

St. Peter inspected the seat and said, ""The third hole from the top-right.”

“Wrong,” said Frank, “It’s wrong.”

 “It came out from my asshole.” 

And Frank went to Heaven.",The Gates of Heaven,157

He would buy a map at any cost.

One day on a trip,

he heard his map rip,

so into a trashcan, he tossed.

He wandered and wandered with no aim.

He started to think it was a game.

But with no end in sight

and quickly losing light,

he started back the way he came.

He cried and threw his hands in the air;

he screamed and shouted with despair.

""Could anyone help?""

Then he started with a yelp.

There was another man, but trust him, he dare?

&amp;#x200B;

""I gotchu,"" the man said with a grin.

""Come on, I'll help you, hop in.""

He got in his car,

they drove pretty far:

for the traveler, it seemed a big win.

&amp;#x200B;

The driver took the man to a club:

he assumed there'd be a phone at a pub.

So, in the men went,

and a message to his wife, the traveler sent.

Then at a deli next door, they ordered a sub.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly thirsty, the traveler got,

so back to the club for drinks, he sought.

He was bad at navigating,

the driver was hating,

but he pressed on, getting lost quite a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

At last, he found the club just fine,

but he didn't want a beer or wine.

He pushed through the crowd,

 and yelled out quite loud,

Santa thought about it and said “Here’s what we’ll do to teach him a lesson, every place that Johnny asked for a present, we’ll put a pile of dog poop.” The parents agreed to try Santa’s plan.

On Christmas morning, Little Johnny woke up and immediately looked under his bed. Seeing the pile of poop, he ran downstairs to the Christmas tree and checked underneath.

Finding another pile of poop under the tree, he ran out the door and threw open the shed door.

Johnny walked out of the shed and started looking all around the yard. After a while his parents asked him sarcastically “So Little Johnny, what did you get for Christmas?”

On one visit, Hy told me that because of his large donations to charities through the years, the queen wanted to knight him, but he was going to turn it down.

""That's a great honor,"" I said. ""Why would you turn it down?""

""Because during the ceremony you have to say something in Latin,"" he said. ""And I don't wish to bother studying Latin just for that.""

""So say something in Hebrew. The queen wouldn't know the difference.""

""Brilliant,"" Hy complimented me, ""but what should I say?""

Remember that question the son asks the father on the first night of Passover? ... Can you say that in Hebrew?""

""Of course,"" he said. ""Ma nishtana ha laila hazeh.

Thank you, old sport, I shall become a knight.""

At the ceremony Hy waited his turn while several of the other honorees went before the queen. Finally they called his name. He knelt before Her Majesty, she placed her sword on one shoulder and then on the other, and motioned for Hy to speak. Out came ""Ma nishtana ha laila hazeh.""

Before the meal, John, Sarah, the vicar and his wife were sitting around the kitchen table talking, when the door suddenly flew open and in rushed Jimmy shouting ""mum, dad, the bull is f**cking the cow!""

They both apologised profusely to the vicar and his wife and asked if lunch could be postponed to the following Sunday. 

Meanwhile, John and Sarah took Jimmy to one side and said, ""Jimmy, it would have been so much better if you had told us that the bull was 'surprising' the cow instead of using the word you did"".

Next Sunday, just as before, the couple, as well as the vicar and his wife were sitting chatting before lunch, when again the door burst suddenly open and in rushed Jimmy breathlessly announcing ""mum, dad, the bull is surprising all the cows"", ""He can't be surprising all the cows"" said his mother, ""He is mum"" said Jimmy,"" He's f**cking the horse!"".

About a week later, Sunita came to Kumar saying, ""Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?"" Kumar said, ""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure.""

So he sat down and wrote :

*I'm not saying that you 'did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you 'did not' take the silver plate. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.*

Several days later, Kumar received an email from his Mother which reads :

\----------------------

*Dear Son:*

*I'm not saying that you 'do' sleep with Sunita, and I'm not saying that you 'do not' sleep with Sunita. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver plate by now under the pillow.*

At 4:57 the bartender looks at the clock and says, ""Damn.  I lost track of the time, I gotta get busy.""  The bartender quickly makes a drink and sets it on the bar.  

Precisely at 5:00 pm, a well-dressed man walks into the bar, grabs the drink and gulps it down.  He leaves a $10 bill on the bar and exits without saying a word.

The guy who came in at 4:30 looks at the bartender and asks, ""What the hell was that all about?""

The bartender explained, ""He's a surgeon, and he comes in every day at 5:00 pm, after his work is through.  He always orders an almond daiquiri, and leaves me a nice tip.  He's done this for so long, I know what to expect.  And he's a buys man, so I don't want to keep him waiting.  I make sure his drink is ready before he comes in.""

The guy seemed impressed by the bartender's efficiency.  He came back the next few days at 4:30, and watched as the bartender made an almond daiquiri for the surgeon.  And every day, the surgeon came in precisely at 5:00 pm, drank the daiquiri, and left without saying a word.

One afternoon, the bartender started to make the drink, but realized he was out of almonds.  ""What am I going to do?"" he asked himself as he searched throughout the bar for almonds.  He found some hickory nuts, and figured that the surgeon wouldn't notice the difference.  So, he mixed up the drink with the hickory nuts, and placed in at the end of the bar.

Sure enough, at 5:00 pm, the surgeon walked into the bar and picked up his drink.  With one sip, he knew something was amiss and he said, ""What's going on?  This isn't my usual drink.""

The bartender said, ""Well, that's a hickory daiquiri, doc.""",A guy walks into a bar at 4:30 one afternoon.,5

I’ll smell it and order from there.” A little confused, the owner walks over to the dirty dish pile and picks up a greasy fork. He returns to the blind man’s table and hands it to him. The blind man puts the fork to his nose and takes in a deep breath. “Ah, yes, that’s what I’ll have — meatloaf and mashed potatoes.” Unbelievable, the owner thinks as he walks towards the kitchen. The cook happens to be the owner’s wife. He tells her what had just happened. The blind man eats his meal and leaves. Several days later, the blind man returns and the owner mistakenly brings him a menu again. “Sir, remember me? I’m the blind man.” “I’m sorry, I didn’t recognize you. I’ll go get you a dirty fork.” The owner retrieves a dirty fork and brings it to the blind man. After another deep breath, the blind man says, “That smells great. I’ll take the macaroni and cheese with broccoli.” Walking away in disbelief, the owner thinks the blind man is screwing around with him and tells his wife that the next time the blind man comes in he’s going to test him. The blind man eats and leaves. He returns the following week, but this time the owner sees him coming and runs to the kitchen. He tells his wife, “Mary, rub this fork on your panties before I take it to the blind man.” Mary complies and hands her husband the fork. As the blind man walks in and sits down, the owner is ready and waiting. “Good afternoon, sir, this time I remembered you and I already have the fork ready for you.” The blind man puts the fork to his nose, takes a deep whiff, and says, “Hey I didn’t know that Mary worked here…”",a blind man walks into a restaurant,17

Suddenly, from the rear of the plane, an elderly  man in the uniform of an Air Force General is seen slowly walking  forward up the aisle. Stopping the flustered mother with an upraised  hand, the white-haired, courtly, soft-spoken General leans down and,  motioning toward his chest, whispers something into the boy's ear.  
 

Instantly, the boy calms down, gently takes his mother's hand, and  quietly fastens his seat belt. All the other passengers burst into  spontaneous applause.  
 

As the General slowly makes his way back to his seat, one of the cabin  attendants touches his sleeve. ""Excuse me, General,"" she asks quietly,  ""but could I ask you what magic words you used on that little boy?""

Patty explains that he will need to secure the loan with some collateral.

The husband leans over and asks his wife, ""Do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? We went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and I made love to you.""
Yes, she says, ""I remember it well.""

OK, he says, ""How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having
sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

""Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.""",Senior Sex,48

The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse.
""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""
""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""
""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""
Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.
""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""
Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.
""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""
""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""
""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""
Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.
Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.
""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""
""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""
""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""
Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.
One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""
The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.
Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.
Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.
So the horse walks into a bar.
The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""","A horse is watching the music channel,",5

She goes to a lot of stores, but she can't find one. Disappointed, she decides to go home. Finally, she sees a pet store where she hasn't been yet so she goes to see if she can find a parrot there. She goes to see the salesman and asks him if he has a parrot. 

""No, sorry, I don't.""

""But I see one at the back of your shop, it's got a bit of a strange face but well...""

""It's not for sale, it'll get you in trouble.""

""I don't care, it's my birthday, I absolutely want one!""

""Well, OK, but he grew up in a brothel, so he's a bit vulgar.""

So she buys the parrot and goes home. Then she gets ready to go out to celebrate her birthday with some friends and when she gets to the front door, the parrot starts talking.

""Hey bitch! You're gonna get fucked tonight, aren't you? Bitch...""

She doesn't pay attention to him and leaves. She comes home at 4am and the parrot says to her.

""So bitch? Did you get fucked good?""

She's tired, so she's going to bed. She wakes up the next day and goes to breakfast. There the parrot talks to her again.

""Hey bitch! You're walking funny today, you got fucked really good last night, didn't you? Fucking slut...""

She finally gets mad and goes back to the store where she bought the parrot. She asks the clerk if he has a solution to calm the parrot down.

""I might have something that could work. It's a special black paint, it'll shut him up.""

So she goes home and as usual the parrot greets her.

""Hey bitch!""

She takes the paint and paints it black. Then he says nothing more. After a week without him saying anything she goes to him and says.

""Well, asshole? You don't talk now, do you?""

The test-pilots who only barely survived by ejecting in time were terrified. No amount of re-design seem to solve the problem, so the aircraft company in desperation offered its employees a huge reward to come up with diagnoses. To the surprise of the top engineers, old Jenkins the janitor meekly said he had an idea. Well, desperation breeds opportunities, so they asked him to explain. In reply he merely requested a power drill, and when supplied one he climbed onto the wings of the latest prototype and proceeded to make holes a few inches apart where the wings joined the fuselage. ""Now, get your test pilot to fly the fighter"", Jenkins advised. Sceptical, but curious, the engineers did. Lo! The jet fighter passed with flying (pun intended) colors. No more wing snapping. Amazed, the engineers surrounded Jenkins amidst all the celebration and asked him how he had hit upon such a clever solution that evaded all the engineering brains. Here is Jenkins' response.

""Ladies and gentlemen, even though I did not not have the benefit of university training like you, I am an observant chappie. You see, as janitor one of my duties is to change the toilet rolls in the loos when they run low. 
Now, you know how toliet paper has rows of holes separating sheets?

The next day, at early morning, sirens were roaring outside the house. The boy and his mother immediately woke up. Loud knocks were sent through the door. 'Police! This family has 10 seconds to leave the premises right now, or the door will be opened by brute force.' As the policeman started counting down, the young boy reluctantly told his mother of what happened yesterday. 'I shot a man, like you told me to.' His mother feeling both proud and panicked, told him--'Quick! Hide under my skirt, I will talk to the police.' 'I'm coming out!' Said the mother, moving slowly so that her son can move along with her. As she was opening the door, the boy looked up and said -'Mommy! There is a big, bushy, mustache under here too?'.

A few days later there's a knock at the door and the priest answers only to discover a  man standing there with no arms. ""Can I help you?"" the priest asks, to which the man replies that he is there to apply for the job. ""I don't want to be insensitive"", the priest exclaims, ""but I don't see how you can fulfil the requirements of the job?"". The man pleads with the priest to give him a chance and the priest decides to acquiesce only to convince him that it's a waste of time. When they get to the top of the tower the priest points to the large bell and says ""Well there it is!"", but before he can finish the sentence the man starts running straight at it and strikes it face first. The shocked priest shouts ""No!! What are you doing?"", but again the man runs the length of the bell tower headfirst into the bell, which is starting to sway back and forth. the priest yells ""Stop, please, no more"" but the guy is already running full speed at the bell and again strikes it headfirst. By now the bell is really rocking back and forth and starting to ring. The priest pleads with the man who is now bruised and bloodied, ""For the Love of God, no more"", but his pleas fall on deaf ears as the guy sprints across the tower at the swinging bell. Unfortunately, he mistimes it misses the bell entirely and flies off the edge of the bell tower. The priest screams and rushes down the stairs to help the guy. When he gets to the bottom he sees a crowd of people gathered around and pushes his way thru to the bruised and battered body. Someone says ""Father do you know this man?"", and the priest answers""No, but his face rings a bell!""",My favorite Clean Joke,7

As she erases one of the birds on the blackboard, little Susie in the front row raises her hand and answers, ""There are two birds left.""

""Very good Susie, that's right, there are two birds left."" Susie smiles.

Little Johnny is watching this from the back of the class, clearly bothered. ""No, no, no..."" he says as he raises his hand.

With sigh of resignation, the teacher asks, ""Ok, Johnny, what is it?""

Johnny begins, ""Well, for starters, birds don't fall off of wires...""

""Ok..."" the teacher starts when Johnny forges ahead.

""If it fell off, then it was probably shot, and if it was shot then the other birds would have flown away.""

""So the correct answer is zero birds."" he finishes.

The teacher replies, ""Well Johnny, that makes a lot of sense, I like the way you think!""

Johnny continues, ""Ok, now I've got one for you: there are three women in an ice cream parlor. One is licking the ice cream, one is biting the ice cream, and one has the whole cone shoved in her mouth!""

With a sly look, Johnny asks, ""How can you tell which one is married?""
