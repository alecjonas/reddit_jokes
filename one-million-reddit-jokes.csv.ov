An Irish went to a dentist for tooth extraction and first enquired about cost. Dentist said 1200 , the Irish thought it was too much.
After some thought, he asked about cheaper methods.
The dentist said, Yes, it can be done without anesthesia and will cost only 300, but it would be very very painful.
Irish said OK Dr, do it without anesthesia.
The dentist removed the tooth without anesthesia and during the entire procedure the Irish sat quietly, even smiling a little.
The dentist was not only surprised, but was quite impressed and said 
I have never seen such a brave patient like you. I don't even want my fees, instead, take this 500 as a reward, you've taught me such a powerful lesson today about mastering one's pain and feelings !!!
In the evening he met his fellow dentists and told everyone about his amazing Irish patient.
Out of all doctors, one doctor jumped up and shouted that Irish first came to me, I gave him anesthesia and asked him to wait outside for half an hour ! After half an hour when I called him he had left ! That dr was a Brit.",Dentists and an Irish.,7

Sweet! Thinks the man I'm gonna make the best of this! And he whispers something in the genie's ear.

""IT SHALL BE DONE!"" Bellows the genie as he claps his hands, and a mansion appears nearby. And this is no ordinary mansion. It's got a pool, a garden with trees, flowers and the lot, climate control (which is very important in the desert), fast cars out front and everything you could ever need.

The man is understandibly excited and whispers his next wish to the genie. 

""IT SHALL BE DONE"" once again reverberates out across the sands accompanied by the clap of the genie's hands.

Suddenly the doors of the mansion burst open and out pours a horde of beautiful women of all ethnicities all of whom rush over to the man, eager to bestow their affection upon him.

""This is awesome!"" Says the man, ""come here genie I have one more wish right?""

Obediently the genie glides over and the man whispers his last wish in the genie's ear.

The genie gives the man a funny look and says:

""...okay...?"" And claps his hands.

Once again a horde of people pour out from every opening but this time they're fully dressed in white with huge pointy hoods! They charge to the man, pushing all the women out of the way in the meantime grab him, get out a rope and lynch him from one of his own very trees, till he dies!

The genie, perplexed, watches from a far and says to himself:

""Look I understand he wanted to be a rich man with a mansion, I get that he wanted women, but why did he want to be hung like a black man?""

In an single go, the first guy downs the entire beer. After opening his eyes again, however, he sees that the glass has already been refilled! 

""No way!"" the first guys says in excitement, and after downing another Moosehead is pleased to watch it refill itself again.

The first guy then thanks the wizard, pays the $100, then puts a $10 tip in the tip jar before heading out.

The second guy, still in disbelief, says,

""This has got to be fake! I bet you can't get me an endless Mojito!""

Once again, with the flick of the wizard's hand, a Mojito magically appears before the second guy!

He then downs three Mojitos which magically refills itself, then pays and puts a $50 tip in the jar before heading off.

The wizard then looks to the third guy and says, ""And what will you have tonight, sir?""  

The third guy immediately points to the tip jar and says,

""I'll have an endless glass of that!""",Three guys walk into a wizard's bar,59

Alas, one day he couldn't find a bungee cord at hand, so he tied his ship off with a looped dockline. That night, the wind and the waves pulled at the ship, and the soft wood was no match for the loop of dockline, which sawed through his ship and sank it.

""Bob, explain to me what Jerry meant in this note."" Bob walks to Jim and takes a look.

So, he says, ""Mrs. Whack, I'd like to get a loan to buy a boat and go on a long vacation."" Patti looks at the frog in disbelief and asks how much he wants to borrow.

The frog says ""$30,000."" The teller asks his name and the frog says that his name is Kermit Jagger, his dad is Mick Jagger, and that it is OK, he knows the bank manager.

Patti explains that $30,000 is a substantial amount of money and that he will need to secure some collateral against the loan. She asks if he has anything he can use as collateral.

The frog says, ""Sure. I have this,"" and produces a tiny pink porcelain pig, about half an inch tall. Bright pink and perfectly formed.

Very confused, Patti explains that she'll have to consult with the manager and disappears into a back office.

She finds the manager and says: ""There is a frog called Kermit Jagger out there who claims to know you and wants to borrow $30,000. And he wants to use this as collateral.""

She holds up the tiny pink pig. 
""I mean, what the heck is this?""

The bank manager looks back at her and says,

I said, ""Sure you are.""

He said, ""No, really! Just turn on your TV tonight to the Inaugural Ball. You'll see me.""

Sure enough, I turned on the TV that night, and there was Earl Pitts, talking to President Clinton with his arm around the guy.

Not long after, I was talking to Earl Pitts about how much I admired Johnny Depp as an actor. Earl Pitts said, ""Oh, he's a good friend.""

I said, ""Noooo!""

Earl Pitts said, ""Let's hop in my car"". He drove me to the bar Johnny Depp owns, and as we sipped drinks, Johnny happened to walk by, immediately exclaimed ""Earl Pitts!"" and fell into Earl Pitts's arms.

This was getting spooky. Earl Pitts seemed to know everyone! I tested Earl Pitts with a few more people. We were back in the Bay Area. Earl Pitts was telling me he was buddy-buddy with Jerry Brown. We went to a Press Conference at Oakland City Hall, and just before Brown started answering questions, he said ""I see my friend Earl Pitts out there.""

Same kind of thing happened when we went to Bob Dylan's house and rang the bell. Bob answered the door, said ""Earl Pitts!"" gave my friend a big hug, and invited us in for drinks.

I was becoming a believer, but then one day we were having another conversation and Earl Pitts said something about ""my friend the Pope.""

I said, ""You can't know him, too!""

Earl Pitts said, ""Wanna bet?"" 

Earl Pitts happens to be very well off, so he flew the both of us to Rome. We took a cab to St. Peters Square. We were standing in the big crowd below the balcony of the Pope's apartment. Earl Pitts said, ""Excuse me for a little while"" and disappeared into the crowd.

A little while after that, John Paul appeared on the balcony and started blessing people. And who should be up there beside him but...you guessed it!

I was utterly amazed! I nudged a fellow standing next to me, pointed to the balcony, and said, ""Look!""

The guy shaded his eyes with his palm, peered up at the balcony, turned back to me, and said, ""Who's that guy up there with Earl Pitts?""",Everybody knows Earl Pitts!,0

""Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.""

""Don't I know it,"" said Mrs. Smith quietly.

""And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider her mother was so difficult to work with.""

""She was difficult?"" asked Mrs. Smith.

""Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look.""

""Four and five deep?"" said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.

""Yes"", the photographer replied. ""And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.""

Mrs. Smith leaned forward. ""Do you mean they actually chewed on your, um... equipment?""

""It's true, Ma'am, yes. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.""

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""
 

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.
 

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.

The plane moves faster and faster down the runway, and the people sitting in the window seats realize they're headed straight for the water at the edge of the airport property. Just as it begins to look as though the plane will plow straight into the water, panicked screams fill the cabin.

Authors and actors there, a large panel, nearly 20 people. Most of the cast of the Sherlock Holmes movies and a few Agatha Christie adaptation were there. One of the audience members asked a question of the authors, wondering what each of them thought about movie adaptations of mystery books in general and if they had any favourites. As it so happened, Stephen King was at the centre of the panel, and quite vocal about the subject, arguing that any books written before 1900 - Dracula, Frankenstein, and so on - shouldn't be adapted to film, as they couldn't possibly have been written with the medium in mind. Robert Downey Jr., who was immediately to his left, asked him if he thought that applied to the Sherlock Holmes series. King immediately replied that his statement applied to all movies in the category and that he had particularly disliked the recent adaptation. Jude Law, sitting next to RDJ, and having a famously hot temper, began arguing with King about the subject. The author was steadfast in his argument, and noted that Law would have no idea what Arthur Conan Doyle would have wanted for a film portrayal of his characters. Insulted, Law immediately stood, reached over RDJ's seat, and smacked Stephen King's water straight into his lap. The audience suddenly gasped and went quiet. Nobody had expected such an outburst at what was meant to be a civil panel. But it just goes to show that not even a King can escape the long arm of the Law.",Comic-Con Mysteries Panel,4

The nun replied, ""He went that way.""

After the Military Police officers ran off, the soldier crawled out from under her skirt and said, 'I can't thank you enough Sister. You see, I don't want to go to war to Iraq.""

The nun said, ""I understand completely.""

The soldier added, ""I hope I'm not rude, but you have a great pair of legs!""

I sit here aimlessly looking at the floor,

As I wait for this turd to come down,
Bent in a hunch with elbows on knees,
Sweat building up as I begin to squeeze,
Don't give up now I can make the cut,
Looking for that tapered end so my ass don't slam shut,
Finally it's over and oh the pain,
Wave it goodbye as she helicopters down the drain.

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'","Dave was bragging to his boss one day,",43

It just so happens that Stalin's secretary, Poskrebyshev hears this. So being a loyal servant of the Communist cause, he reports it to his boss. To which Stalin replies, ""get him back here.""

Two minutes later, Zhukov is back in the room facing Stalin.

""I said 'fucking mustachioed piece of shit' Comrade Stalin.""

A very sexually active woman tells her plastic surgeon that she wants her vaginal lips reduced in size because they were flapping in the breeze.
Out of embarrassment she insisted that the surgery be kept a secret and the surgeon agreed.

Awakening from the anesthesia after the surgery she found three roses carefully placed beside her on the bed.

Outraged, she immediately calls in the doctor. ""I thought I asked you not to tell anyone about my operation!""

The surgeon told her he had carried out her wish for confidentiality and that the first rose was from him: ""I felt sad because you went through this all by yourself.""

""The second rose is from my nurse. She assisted me in the surgery and empathized because she had had the same procedure done some time ago.""

""And what about the third rose?"" she asked.

""Oh, that rose is from a man upstairs in the burn unit. He wanted to thank you for his new ears.""",Labiaplasty,29

The mere possession of alcohol is a severe offence in Saudi Arabia, so for the terrible crime of actually being caught consuming the booze, they are all sentenced to death!

However, after many months and with the help of very good lawyers, they were able to successfully appeal their sentences down to life imprisonment. By a stroke of luck, it was a Saudi national holiday the day their trial finished, and the extremely benevolent Sheikh decided they could be released after receiving just 20 lashes each of the whip.

As they were preparing for their punishment, the Sheikh announced: ""It's my first wife's birthday today, and she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping.

The German was first in line, he thought for a while and then said: ""Please tie a pillow to my back. This was done, but the pillow only lasted 10 lashes before the whip went through. When the punishment was done the German had to be carried away bleeding and crying with pain.

The Frenchman was next up. After watching the German in horror he said smugly: ""Please fix two pillows to my back."" But even two pillows could only take 15 lashes before the whip went through again and the Frenchman was soon led away whimpering loudly.

The Englishman was the last one up, but before he could say anything, the Sheikh turned to him and said: ""You are from a most beautiful part of the world and your culture is one of the finest in the world. For this, you may have two wishes!""

""Thank you, your Most Royal and Merciful highness,"" the Englishman replied. ""In recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes.""

""Not only are you an honorable, handsome and powerful man, you are also very brave,"" the Sheikh said with an admiring look on his face. ""If 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it. And your second wish, what is it to be?"" the Sheikh asked.

The Englishman smiled and said, ""Tie the Frenchman to my back.""","An Englishman, a German and a Frenchman...",673

The plane takes off and after some minutes a stewardess approaches.

""Can I get you anything, sir?"" she asks the man"".

""Yes, I'll have a coffee, please, when you have a minute. Thank you.""

""And for you, sir?"" she asks the parrot.

""A double whisky and coke, bitch, and make it quick, I'm thirsty!"" demands the parrot.

The stewardess returns a few minutes later with the parrot's drink, which he snatches without a word.

""Excuse me,"" says the man, ""but I ordered a coffee"".

""Did you, sir? I'm sorry, I'll get you one straight away"".

By which time the parrot has finished his drink.

""Anything else for you, sir?"" the stewardess asks the parrot.

""Yeah, I want another double whisky and coke, tart. Quick, bitch, I can't wait all night!""

Again the stewardess returns with the parrot's drink and without the coffee. Naturally the man thinks the only way he is going to get any service is to adopt the attitude of his fellow passenger.

""Listen here you stupid slapper,"" he says to the stewardess, ""I want my bloody coffee and I want it now, you cow!""

Two minutes later the stewardess returns but this time with two enormous security guards, who proceed to manhandle the man and the parrot to the back of the plane, open the door and eject them from the plane.

As they hurtle uncontrollably towards earth from 6 miles up the parrot turns to the man and says ..............

So they go. At some point, the Lambo+Beetle combination is overtaken by a Porsche 911. The Lamborghini driver does not want to be beaten, and, soon enough, it ends up being a street race. At this point, the Beetle driver sees it as too fast and starts flashing his high beams.

A police helicopter pilot sees this scene, and calls the dispatch, saying:
- I've just seen something impossible.

The dispatch asks:
- What?

The cop says:
- A Lambo street racing with a Porsche 911.

The dispatch tells him:
- Well, tell them through the PA to pull over.

The cop says to the dispatch:
- I have not finished. There is a Beetle right behind the Lambo, and the Beetle driver is *signalling with his high beams that he wants to pass!*",Motorist help. (Long),7

'Excuse me, Your Holiness,' says the driver, 'Would you please take your seat so we can leave?'

'Well, to tell you the truth,' says the Pope, 'they never let me drive at the Vatican , and I'd really like to drive today.'

""I'm sorry, Your Holiness, but I cannot let you do that. I'd lose my job! What if something should happen?"" protests the driver, wishing he'd never gone to work that morning.

'Who's going to tell?' asks the Pope with a smile.

Reluctantly, the driver gets in the back as the Pope climbs in behind the wheel. The driver quickly regrets his decision when, after exiting the airport, the Pontiff floors it, accelerating the limo to 205 kms. (Remember, the Pope is Argentinian,)(and Fangio the famous racer was Argentinian.)

""Please slow down, Your Holiness,"" pleads the worried driver, but the Pope keeps the pedal to the metal until they hear sirens.

""Oh, dear God, I'm going to lose my licence -- and my job!', moans the driver.

The Pope pulls over and rolls down the window as the cop approaches; but the cop takes one look at him, goes back to his motorcycle, and gets on the radio.

'I need to talk to the Chief,' he says to the dispatcher.

The Chief gets on the radio and the cop tells him that he's stopped a limo going 205 kph.

'So bust him,' says the Chief.

'I don't think we want to do that. He's really important,' said the cop.

The Chief exclaimed, 'All the more reason!'

'No, I mean really important,' said the cop with a bit of persistence.

The Chief then asked, 'Who do you have there, the mayor?'

Cop: 'Bigger.'

Chief: ' A senator?'

Cop: 'Bigger.'

Chief: 'The President?'

Cop: 'Bigger.

""Unfortunately, we're going to have to put him down tomorrow. Otherwise, the virus might spread and infect the other horses.""

After they left, the goat approached the horse and said: ""Listen pal, it's now or never! Get up, come on! Have courage! Come on! Get up! Get up! That's it, slowly! Great! Come on, one, two, three... Good, good. Now faster, come on...... Fantastic! Run, run more!

Yes! Yay! Yes! You did it, you're a champion!!!""

All of a sudden, the owner came back to the farm, saw the horse running on the field ... he was not aware of goats role in this. He began shouting: ""It's a miracle! My horse is cured. We must have a Grand celebration...

Let's cook the goat!!!!""

When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup’s bottom edge.

The African is annoyed at the intrusion and tired of the steteotype so he decides to play a practical joke on the Aussie. He turns to him and says ""you are still young,  perhaps you still could. Let me tell you my tribes great secret. In my tribe when we reach puberty we take a piece of string and tie one end to the penis and a small rock to the other end. After a few months we tie on a slightly bigger rock. After a year or so we can have a house brick tied on.  You will appreciate that this treatment, over time, bestows on my tribe the longest penises in the southern hemisphere.  Perhaps you could try this method.""

Of course the Australian is delighted but worried that he is starting later in life than the tribesmen. He is also impatient so he decides to start the treatment immediately using a housebrick from the start.

Some weeks pass and the African and the Australian meet once again at the local bar.  After the usual small talk the African asks ""how the method is working?"". The Australian replies ""well its sort of half working"". ""What do you mean half working?"" the African enquires. ""This tribal custom has worked unfailingly for my people for centuries:. The Australian replies ""well it hasn't really got any longer but it has turned black"".

Unable to get the thought out of his head, he hires a private detective to follow her around and see if he's correct.

""Follow he, and if you catch her cheating you meet me immediately."" The private detective agrees.

Two days goes by, and the husband begins to feel as if he was just being crazy about his wife's infidelity, when he hears a knock on his door. 

He approaches the door, and as he feared, the detective stands before him. 

""Your wife is cheating, I'm sorry."" he pauses, ""But you know, I 'take care of problems' like this, and I'm an excellent shot.""

The husband demands he takes him to the vantage point from where he will take his shot, so the now-hitman agrees and takes him to a hill looking toward a large house. 

The hitman hands the husband a pair of binoculars, and he can see that the wife is kissing a man in the house. The husband tosses the binoculars back the fixer. 

""How are you going to do it"" he asks.

""However you'd like."" he replies.

""Well, in that case, I want you to put one in her head, and make his dick disappear.""

The hitman pauses, looking through the window,

""Yeah, you know, they kinda got that one covered already chief""

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.
Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""
Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:
""Guys, I think I fucked up.""",3 guys are hiking through the woods when they find a lamp,2564

So, the British soldiers discussed how to take out the sniper: ""How do we make that darn sniper come out of his nest?"" Said one. ""I have an idea! Maybe we could call out a very common German name and get him to stick his head out!""



Since Hans is a very common German name, they decide to call it out.

""Hans? Haaaaaannsss?""

""Ya?""

Bang! The sniper was shot dead.



The British soldiers advance rapidly, using their technique to effectively take over the previously sniper infested area.

The Germans quickly figured out their trick and attempted to copy it with a British name.



""Hmmm Wat is a common British name?""

""How about Paddy? Like Paddington""

""Oh Ja Ja! Good name!""



So, the Germans started calling out the name:

""Padyy! Paddyyyy!!!!""

**Dead silence**

""Paddyyyy!""



Suddenly, someone answered​:

""Ummmm... Paddy isn't here... But is that you Hans?""

""Ja!""
