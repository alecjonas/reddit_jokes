The men get very excited about the lamp and as they dust the sand away it hums and buzzes before a genie emerges in a puff of blue smoke.

""You have freed me from my prison,"" says the Genie, ""For this, I will give you EACH three wishes""

The men are over the moon and after a moment's deliberation the first man steps forward. He tells the genie he wants to have a billion dollars. The genie snaps his fingers and produces a phone, on which he shows the man his bank account. 1 billion dollars is sitting there. The man is very happy.

The second man pushes the first out of the way and yells to the genie that he wants to be the richest person in the world. The genie snaps his fingers again and shows the second man his bank account. One billion and one dollars. The man is very happy.

The third man, the quiet one, takes longer to decide. Finally, with resolve in his eyes, he steps forward. ""Genie, I have decided on my first wish. I wish that my right arm would spin around in a clockwise direction forever and I never get tired and it never stops."" The genie, who knows the deep secrets of the world, nods with satisfaction. The man's right arm starts spinning clockwise. The genie bids the men to come back tomorrow for their next wishes. They return to camp and think about how their lives are going to change.

On the second day, the first man rubs the lamp and summons the genie. He stands tall, feeling confident, and asks the genie for his second wish: to be loved by the most beautiful woman in the world. A snap of the genies fingers later the trio see Mila Kunis running down the beach towards them. She leaps into the first man's arms and they fall into the sand and make love.

After a few minutes, the second man steps forward. He tells the genie that he wants the ability to make any woman fall desperately in love with him with a glance. The genie obliges, the man looks over, and Mila Kunis leaps off the first man and onto the second man.

The third man hasn't been watching any of this, instead staring serenely out to sea, his right arm spinning in endless circles. The genie floats over and asks him for his second wish, and after a moment, in a quiet voice, the man says: ""Genie, I want my left arm to spin around in a counter-clockwise direction forever and I never get tired and it never stops."" The genie nods, snaps his fingers, and the man's left arm starts spinning. Again the genie sends the men back to their camp and asks them to return the next day.

Now, the final day. The first man, glaring angrily at Mila and the other castaway, storms up to the genie and barks his wish. He wants to be immortal. The genie snaps his fingers and tells the man that he will live forever and cannot be hurt ever again. The man is pleased.

The second man untangles himself from Mila and asks to be 25 years old forever. He snaps his fingers and now the second man is also immortal, but younger and fitter. He is happy. Mila is overjoyed.

The third man approaches, both his arms spinning, and in a voice thick with emotion, he makes his third wish."" Genie, I want my head to rock back and forth forever and I never get tired and it never stops."" The genie sees something wonderful in this man and a single tear rolls down his glowing blue cheek as he snaps his fingers. The man's head starts rocking back and forth as the genie dissolves into the air, finally free of his debt of servitude.

So, as luck would have it, a cruise ship passed by the island the very next day and rescued the men. They returned to the world as superstars, after all two of them were some of the richest people on the planet and both were romantically involved with Mila Kunis. They very much enjoyed their lives for a long, beautiful decade.

Now, 10 years later, they're having a reunion party of sorts. Important people from all over the world are coming to hear their story and celebrate their lives. The three men have never spoken in their 10 years apart but finally, after a long night of socialising, the trio find themselves alone in a back corner.

""So,"" the second man asks excitedly, ""How are those wishes going fellas?""

""Incredible,"" says the first man, ""I can't believe an actual genie granted us wishes. I sleep in a mansion with gold toilets, Mila makes me breakfast every morning, and I don't age. Amazing!""

""I know,"" replies the second man, ""I'm so rich my family won't have to work for at least 5 generations, I look and feel the best I ever have, and every night I sleep with your wife!"" The first man grumbles at that but turns to the third man with his spinning arms and rocking head. ""And you? How are your wishes going?""

""Guys,"" says the third man, ""....I think I fucked up""","Three men crash land on a desert island, 3 days later they find a magic lamp in the sand on the beach",48

With his rifle, he sneaks and then shoots the goose from a distance. With a sharp shot, the goose immediately fell from the sky.

Happily, the hunter walked in the direction where the goose fell to get it. Everything was going fine until when he was about to touch the goose, suddenly a man shouted.

""DO NOT TOUCH THE GOOSE!""

The hunter pulled his hand, watching the arrival of a farmer from the bush. The hunter stood up and protested angrily: ""What are you doing? This is my goose. I shot him earlier.""

""What is your proof?"", The farmer replied calmly.

The hunter is getting angry. ""Are you blind? This is my rifle and you can see that my bullet has dropped.""

Still calmly, the farmer replied, ""It could have been reduced because you missed the bullet and you also do not have a witness.""

The hunter began to get confused but could no longer contain his anger. ""WHAT!!"" ""For God's sake, I swear on behalf of all my descendants, I ..."".

Before the hunter finished his sentence, the farmer quickly replied, ""Take it easy, mate. One more thing. This is my field. As long as it's in my field, it means it's mine.""

The hunter paused and began to realize his defeat in debate. 

Seeing the hunter who was still confused, the farmer slowly approached the dying goose and tried to took it.

""Wait"" The hunter suddenly has an idea. ""I have a little money. What if I buy this goose? Is 5 dollars enough for you?"" The farmer stop his action.

""No. I think this goose costs 25 dollars."", said the farmer.

""I know. But help me. I promised my family to cook geese today. And I swear, I'm the only one who shot this goose. If I had to pay 25 dollars, I'd better buy a goose at the market. Right?"" The hunter starts to negotiate.

""Ok. 15 dollars."" Farmer open the price.

""6 dollars?"" The hunter raises the price.

""No. 15 dollars."" Farmer maintain prices.

""7 dollars?"" The hunter raises the price again but the farmer still shakes his head, ""No.""

""8 dollars?"" Farmer still reject the price.

""9 dollars?"" ""10 dollars?"" ""11 dollars?"" The hunter is getting impatient. But he is not a person who gives up easily. He was determined to defeat the farmer. Actually, even with 15 dollars he could accept it but he felt compelled to defeat this damn farmer.

""Never mind. Tell you what."" Farmer try to offer another way out. ""I took your 10 dollars but on condition you have to win the duel with me. But if you lose, you have to add 5 dollars.""

Knowing the body is bigger than the farmer, the hunter is excited. ""Oh! Ok. I accept your challenge. What are our duel rules?""

""Good. I made this duel simple. Let's compete with the power of our kick. I will kick your cock and vice versa, you will kick my cock. Who falls, he loses. And I start first."" said the farmer.

""Ok. Deal."" Stupid farmer, hunters thought. I will definitely smash your cock, old man. 

Then the hunter also come to pay 10 dollars to farmer. Then he adjusted his position and began to strengthen his way of standing so that it would not easily fall if later he would be kicked.

The farmer retreats away from the Hunter so that he can run before kicking and by running, he hopes to increase his kick strength. ""Ready?"" He asked the hunter.

""Yeah."" The hunter starts to panic.

Farmer now come running and attacking hunter.

While jumping, the farmer kicks the hunter's genitals as hard as possible. The kicking sound was so loud.

The hunter immediately staggered but had not yet fallen. His head was dizzy and felt extreme pain in his cock. Both legs are almost paralyzed. He continued to refrain from collapsing.

""Damn. You didn't fall. But are you all right, man?"" asked the farmer.

The hunter is unable to answer it. He was only able to show his thumb to signal that he was fine but needed time to recover. Hunter need more than 5 minutes to stand up straight and be able to move their legs again.

Feeling sorry, farmer offered to stop this duel. ""Are you really recovering? If you want to stop this duel, I'm fine.""

The hunter did not answer. He really hates this farmer. While enduring the pain, he turned around and prepared to attack the farmer.

Farmer also understand the attitude of these hunter. He also prepared to stay upright.

From a distance, the hunter raised his hand. Give a sign that he will start running and attack the farmer. The farmer replied, ""OK. I'm ready.""

The hunter nodded and began to run. However, when he was running, the farmer suddenly dropped himself.

&amp;#x200B;

The farmer shouted, ""Oh God, I fell. I lost.""

“Honey,” he asks, “how’d all this get fixed?” 

 

She replies, “Well, when you left, I sat outside and cried.  Just then a nice young man asked me what was wrong.  I told him.  He offered to do all the repairs, and all I had to do was either go to bed with him or bake a cake.”

The audience was different each week so the magician did the same tricks over and over again.  There was only one problem: the captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the magician did every trick.  Once he understood, he started shouting in the middle of the show, ""Look, it's not the same hat!"" or, ""Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table!"" or ""Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?""  The magician was furious but couldn't do anything.  It was, after all, the captain's parrot.  Then one stormy night on the Pacific, the ship unfortunately sank, drowning almost all who were on board.  The magician luckily found himself on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea, as fate would have it... with the parrot. They stared at each other with hatred, but did not utter a word.  This went on for a day... and then 2 days and then 3 days.  Finally on the 4th day, the parrot could not hold back any longer and said... ""OK, I give up.

For the wedding, my whole family and friends flew over to her home town of Moscow.

It was a beautiful ceremony, however I did find some things strange. For instance, the priest never said, ""You may now kiss the bride"", but I just assumed it was purely an American thing and didn't mind.

Later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.

As we passed, they all said in unison, ""You may now kiss the bride!"" My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.

As we walked away I asked, ""Why did *they* tell us to kiss and not the priest?""

My wife answered,

""In Soviet Russia, the punchline tells you!""",I proposed my russian girlfriend and she said yes,32236

One day, on the other side of the island, he discovers a giant jungle filled with wild animals—lions, panthers, and more. He tries to kill them with his bare hands but gets severely injured. Luckily, he makes it back to his shelter on time.

After using his hatchet for a long time, Phil wants to make it even more useful. He tries to add some new things, like a sharp handle for extra mileage from the weapon.

Finally, he’s exhausted from the several hours he spent on improvement until he ran out of ideas to improve his hatchet.

3 men get shipwrecked on a desert island. 
Their boat ruined they head in-land to find salvation, when out of the trees lunges a huge 7 foot tall, spear-wielding tribesman with his cannibal clan behind him. 
He threatens to cook the men alive and eat them unless they can pass one test. ‘Pass the test and you shall have a canoe and be set free’ says the leader.
Having no choice the men agree.

‘If your 3 penises equal or exceed the length of mine you will be free’ says the tribesman. 
3 to 1 the men think this easy and agree. 
So the tribesman removes his grass skirt and unleashes a massive dong swinging past his knee. 20 inches long! 
Terrified but still in with a shout the first man, knowing he has a whopper, drops his trousers and proudly shows his 10 inch penis. ‘Half way there boys’ he shouts. 
The second lad also proudly drops his shorts and out comes his 9 inch penis. ‘Yes lads, 19 inches already’
The third man finally drops his trousers. 1 inch is all he has! But they’ve made it! 20 inches between them. 

True to his word the tribesman gives the men a canoe and sets them on their way. 
On the boat and loving their freedom the first man says ‘good job I’ve got a 10 inch cock isn’t it lads!’ 
The second man says ‘Yes and good job I’ve got a 9 inch cock too!’ 
And the third man says ‘Yes but bloody good job I had a stiffy ay boys!’ 

Like I said, works better when told in person to your mates. ‘Me, Tom and James were shipwrecked’ etc

Finally, after 3 months of this routine, the doctor says, “I’m sorry, but I have to ask.  Just what are you trying to find out?”

A boy, about 9, opened the door.

“Is your mom or dad home?” The farmer asked the boy

“No, they went in to town.” The boy replied

“Well, how about your brother Howard?” The farmer asked

“No, he went with mom and dad.” The boy said

The farmer stood there for a minute shifting from one foot to another and mumbling when the boy says

“I know where the tools are if you need to borrow one or I could give my dad a message for you.”

“Well,” The farmer said uncomfortably “I wanted to talk to your dad about your brother Howard getting my daughter pregnant.”

The boy thought for a moment then said

“You’ll have to talk to my dad about that. I know he charges $500 for the bulls and $150 for the pigs, but I have no idea how much he charges for Howard.”",A farmer drove over to his neighbor’s house and knocked on the door,412

Raising her hand again, the girl asked, ""Then why doesn't it taste sweet?""

After a stunned silence, the whole class burst out laughing, the poor girls face turned bright red, and as she realized exactly what she had inadvertently said (or rather implied), she picked up her books without a word and walked out of class ... and never returned. However, as she was going out the door, the Profs reply was classic ...

""This is so embarrassing!"" She says. ""Let me at least buy you dinner to make up for it!""

So they have dinner together. The lady is warm, charming and very pleasant. She is a great conversationalist and they end up having a lot in common.

The man gets her number and they set up a date. ""You are an exceptionally charming woman!"" He says. ""Are you normally this nice to everyone you meet?""

""No,"" she replies.

Roy spends the next three years of his life struggling to survive, but, by collecting debris and materials that wash up on the shore, he manages to thrive.

Then one day, as he's combing the beaches looking for driftwood, he sees what looks like a human shape in the surf. 

He runs down the beach and sure enough it's a woman, alive, but unconscious.  He turns her over to check she's OK and to his astonishment, sees it's Scarlet Johansson.

He carries her back to his hut and nurses her wounds. She wakes up after a short time and he explains the situation. He asks if there's likely to be other survivors or a chance of rescue. 

Scarlett tells him that the boat she was on was owned by a reclusive billionaire who hadn't filed any travel plans and that she's pretty sure it went down with all hands lost and that no one will come looking. 

Roy is understandably shattered, but at least having another person to talk to is compensation. Plus, I mean hey! it's Scarlett Johansson, so there's that.

At first it's very sort of impersonal and polite between them, but as time passes they get closer and friendlier and after 6 months they are in love. Every night is like heaven, a tropical south seas island and making love to Scarlett Johansson. What could be better?

One day Scarlett comes back from gathering coconuts and finds Roy sitting on a log and looking a bit sad.

""What's wrong sweetie"", she asks.

""Aww, you wouldn't understand."", Roy answers.

""Honey, I love you, we make love almost every night, I've never been so happy in all my life. You name it baby, anything I can do to cheer you up, it's yours.""

""Really"", says Roy, ""anything?""

""Sure""

Roy's demeanour is bit more cheerful now so he says to Scarlett, ""You know that suitcase full of clothes that washed up last week?""

""Yeah""

""Would you put on that man's three piece suit and then go down to the big pointy rock near the water?""

""Of course baby"", she says, looking a bit puzzled. 

But she's as good as her word and puts on the clothes. She starts out for the rock and Roy calls out, ""Once you get there, turn around, and start walking back this way. And pretend we don't know each other at all""

""Fine, yup"", she says, slightly regretting her use of the word ""anything"". But she does as he's asked, gets to the rock, turns around and starts walking back. 

By this time Roy is walking towards her. She's staring straight ahead, and as they are just about to pass each other Roy reaches out and grabs her by the arm, spins her towards him and says, ...

A man attempts to cross a desert by camel-back, but finds himself lost after some days. Having food, water, and supplies, he starts to lack only one thing upon his journey: companionship. After a couple of weeks alone, he figures 'what the heck...' and drops his trousers behind his camel and proceeds to start mounting the camel. As he does so, the camel whips its head all the way around and bites him in the face.

A few more days go by, and the man starts to really need a lay. He tries a similar tactic of going behind the camel, but tries doing it much faster. Once again the camel whips its head around and bites him in the face, which ends with him laying in the sand frustrated and without having satisfied his urges.

A few days later, a sandstorm picks up and the man hears cries coming from nearby. Through the biting sand, he recognises that the calls are from a woman. As he nears, he realises that she is covered in sand up to her neck. She shouts to him, ""Please! Please dig me out, I'll do anything you wish!""

The man dismounts and starts digging her out. As he is going along, he notices that, not only is she extremely fit and beautiful, but her clothing has been damaged in the sandstorm as well exposing her bare breasts. Advancing to her waistline, she begins to help him, and he sees that her dress has been ripped away, and she's nearly naked. After a couple of hours she is free, and she motions seductively to the man, ""For saving my life, I'll do anything for you. What would you have me do?""

The man wastes no time dropping his trousers, and says, &gt;!""Hold that camel's head for me, will you?""!&lt;",A man is lost in the desert...,314

Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increases as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor or may choose to go up to the next floor but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband.
On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs
She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.
'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.'

So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.

'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'

Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please and are all just want, want, fucking want.

No wonder you are on you own, you deserve being left on the shelf.  Now fuck off!

Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

PLEASE NOTE:

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.

The first floor has wives that love sex.

The second floor has wives that love sex, have some money and like a beer and a shag whenever you fancy!

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.",Shopping for a Husband...,20

She directs him to her room, and closes the door behind them

“Take off my shirt” she says to James. James can hardly believe his ears. His hands shake as he slowly removes her shirt.

“Take of my bra and skirt too” she tells him again. James’s hands are shaking so much he can barely unclip her bra.

“Lastly, remove my panties James” she says. He pulls her panties off, and as he does, she says

In order to do this the zebra decides to hold a competition in which animals will have to compete in front of a judge. Whoever the first one to makemake the judge laugh wins and will perform for the lion.

So the first thing the zebra does is look for the most serious animal. He walks up to a tortoise and asks, “Hey tortoise, I’m holding a competition and all you have to do is sit there and laugh if you find an animal to be funny. Will you do it?”  The tortoise responds, “...Yes.”

The day of the competition arrives and all The animals have gathered to compete. Since this is for the lion, the zebra decides to raise the stakes to ensure every animal delivers their full potential. He says, “Animals, your goal is to make the tortoise laugh. If you are able to do so, you win and get to perform for the lion. If you fail to make the tortoise laugh, then you will be killed and become the lion’s meal.”

The competition begins and up first is the monkey. He jumps from tree to tree, does flips, and makes funny noises. The zebra becomes pleased and looks at the tortoise and asks what he thinks, to which the tortoise says, “...” Since there is no reaction from the judge, the monkey is killed.

Up next is the ostrich. He runs around in circles and is moving his long neck. He jumps and does funny moves. The zebra is once again pleased and turns to see the reaction of the tortoise, which once again is, “...” So there’s nothing the zebra can do and they have the ostrich killed.

This pattern goes on with many of the funniest animals and the zebra becomes worried that they won’t have someone for the lion’s party. All of a sudden the next animal approaches, the hippopotamus. The zebra knows that he won’t be able to perform any fun tricks and just as he’s about to have him killed, he hears a chuckle from the tortoise. That chuckle turns into full blown roars of laughter. The zebra is bewildered and asks the tortoise, “Hey what’s so funny? He hasn’t done anything! He is literally just standing there!”

The Doctor says, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches.

The bad news is that it will require removing your testicles.

You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.    

The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.' 

Joe is shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. 

He had no choice but to go under the knife. The surgery cost him £15,000.

When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.   

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. 

He saw a Men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new Suit.' 

He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new Suit.' 

The elderly Tailor eyed him briefly and said, 'Let's see... size 44 would fit fine.

Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?' 

'Been in the business 60 years sir!' the tailor said. 

Joe tried on the suit it fitted perfectly. 

As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, 'How about a new shirt?' 

Joe thought for a moment and then said, 'Sure.' 

The salesman eyed Joe and said, 'Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.' 

Joe was surprised, 'That's right, how did you know?' 

'Been in the business 60 years sir.' 

Joe tried  the shirt and it fitted perfectly. 

Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new Underwear?' 

Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure..' 

The salesman said, 'Let's see..... size 36. 

Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! You got it wrong this time! I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old..' 

The salesman shook his head, 'You can't wear a size 34 sir. A size 34 would press your Testicles up against the base of your spine and give you hell of a Headache.'

A few hours later a witch doctor comes across him and decides to drag his lifeless body to his hut to try to help him. The witch Dr. examines Tarzan and sees that during his fall he was severely injured. His left eye was gouged out of his head, his right arm was dismembered and his cock was torn off completely. 

The witch Dt. was very resourceful and a great shot with his blow dart and decided the he would search through the jungle for remedies. 

First he saw an eagle soaring through the sky. He pulled out his blow dart gun, took aim and shot down the eagle. The Dr. Then removed it's eye and put it into Tarzan 

He knew Tarzan needed an arm so went back out in the jungle and saw an ape swinging through the trees. He once again pulled out his trusty dart gun and took out the ape in one shot. He was then able to replace Tarzans arm. 

Now he knew tarzan couldn't go through life without a dick. This proved to be difficult. He had to find something perfect. After a long search he finally came across an elephant grazing in a field. Like before using his blow gun he downed the creature, removed its trunk and attached it to Tarzan. 

After a lengthy recovery Tarzan was finally well enough to return to the jungle. 

After a few years the witch Dr. saw Tarzan swinging by and called out to him. ""Tarzan, how are you doing? ' Tarzan replied thankfully ;"" Amazing thank you Dr. With my eye i can see for miles and can protect the jungle from pochers. With my arm i can swing from vine to vine faster then ever and it has the strength of ten men.
