Daniel threw himself into the arrangement with gusto, working even on his day off, but as the weeks stretched into months, he found himself looking forward to that day of rest more and more eagerly.


One afternoon he was sitting on the beach and wishing for some more men to share his duties when he caught sight of a man waving from a life raft that was bobbing on the waves. Daniel swam out, pulled the raft to shore, and did a little jig of happiness.


“You can’t believe how happy I am to see you,” he cried.


The new fellow eyed him up and down and cooed, “You’re a sight for sore eyes, too, you gorgeous thing!”


“Crap,” sighed Daniel, “there go my Sundays.”","Daniel fancied himself quite a ladies man, so when his cruise ship went down in a storm and he found himself stranded on a desert island with six women.",140

The big night had arrived. Bob made his way on stage in front of the studio and TV audience. He had become the talk of the week. He was the best guest this show had ever seen. The M.C. stepped up to the mic.

""Bob, you have chosen American History as your final question. You know that if you correctly answer this question, you will walk away $64,000 dollars richer. Are you ready?""

Bob nodded with a cocky confidence-the crowd went nuts. He hadn't missed a question all week.

""Bob, your question on American History is a two-part question. As you know, you may answer either part first. As a rule, the second half of the question is always easier. Which part would you like to take a stab at first?""

Bob was now becoming more noticeably nervous. He couldn't believe it, but he was drawing a blank. American History was his easiest subject, but he played it safe.

""I'll try the easier part first.""

The M.C. nodded approvingly. ""Here we go Bob. I will ask you the second half first, then the first half.""

The audience silenced with gross anticipation...

When suddenly, the motor broke down. He cursed, and thought to himself ""Maybe someone will soon stop and come help."" Some time later, a BMW stopped by. The driver asked, if the Lada-man needed help. After some discussion, they decided to tow the Lada to the nearest gas station, so maybe they could fix the car there. 
 
 Halfway through the trip, a brand-new Wolkswagen drove next to them, motor roaring. Surely, the driver wanted to have a race. At this point, the BMW-driver had forgotten about the Lada, that was hanging from a rope from the back of the BMW. Foot on the pedal, BMW started to accelerate too. The speed of the cars was rising, hitting really scary numbers.
 
 The Lada-driver, sitting in his car, was getting really scared, ""Maybe the rope won't hold?"" He didn't have any idea, how to tell the BMW-driver to slow down. ""Maybe I could flicker my turn signals, so he would notice me?"" So he put his turn signals on. At this point, the BMW was notably on the lead. 

 Sadly, there was a police car, parked on the side of the highway, checking the speeds of cars driving by.

post,6vocea,2qh72,jokes,false,1503546639,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6vocea/family_first_original_joke/,self.jokes,,"Mr. Scott Lood was a poor little farmer from Illinois who paid the bills by churning butter all day and all night. He came from a family of dairy farmers: his father was a cream maker, and his father before him a cheese maker. There was little money to be made in this line of work- so little in fact that he had to sell his own child, Baxter, just to pay the bills. Life on the Lood family farm was tough.

Scott was also very lonely. The only friend he had was William Ater, who was the son of a beef farmer across the street. William was Scott’s friend when everyone ignored him, a helping hand when everyone put him down and a shoulder to cry on when his mother died from a bad case of mad-cow disease. William always took care of Scott because even though they weren’t related, Scott was family and Will believed that blood was thicker than water.

One day President Eisenhower passed by Scott’s farm on his way to a campaign in Chicago, where he sampled the butter. Eisenhower thought this was the best butter in the world, and told everybody about it. With all the publicity, Scott was able to sell his butter at a much higher price, where he became wealthy very easily.
Things were looking up for Scott. He bought a factory so that he could mass produce dairy products. He started the company Lood Corp where he invested stocks in the ever changing dairy market. He bought a mansion, a luxury super car and even a smoking hot wife from Russia.

Things were looking up for Scott. But things were still looking down for every other dairy farmer in America. Everyone else was still thinking about how they were going to pay the bills while Scott was worried about where he was going to rain the bills.
 
So Scott came up with a plan. He created the World Butter Churning Tournament where 16 contestants face off to see who could make the best butter. The winner would get a billion ducks. The rules were simple: The butter had to be made from Non-Gmo cows, there were to be made in a 4 by 4 inch block, and the name of the butter had to be the maker’s first initial and last name. People all around the world came to enter the contest with their exotic butters.  The Chinese entered N.Icktang, which was very creamy, while the Brazilians entered N.Icholasteng, which had chives mixed in. Even William entered the competition, which he claimed that he had the thickest butter ever.

There was a surprising contestant too: Scott’s long lost son, Baxter. His adopted parents had died, so he searched the world to find his father. Hearing about the competition, he wanted to join. Baxter decided to compete with the butter recipe he learned from his father. 

The competition was tough. The numbers were whittling down from 16 to 8 to 4. Finally, there were only two people left in the competition: Baxter and William. The competition was close, and the victor had only won by 0.02%.

“Ladies and gentlemen” Scott says on the reveal stage “I have the results in my hand, which is the tabulation of text votes combined with the judges total score. And the winner of this year’s World Butter Churning Tournament is……………… Baxter!”

“What!” William exclaims “How come I didn’t win! I had the thickest butter ever! I thought we were friends!”

“Sorry William, my dear friend” Scott says “But I think you were the person who taught me that B.Lood is thicker than W.Ater”

The dog and the kids get on great, and they run and play in the back yard, but as the day ticks on the dog gets more and more tired while the kids just want to keep going. They go to bed and the next day it's the same story.

So the kids go to their father and they ask him ""What do you do when something won't run?""

The dad stops for a second before saying *""Well, that depends, sometimes it just needs a little oil to get things going.""*

And so when the dad leaves the room, the kids decide to listen to their dad's advice, and get out a little bowl and put a little oil in it, and take it out to the dog. The dog looks at it, sniffs it a bit, then drinks up the whole bowl. A second goes by, then the dog gets up and runs in a big circle on the lawn for a good fifteen minutes, before finally it lays still on the grass.

The children, very worried, run to get their dad, and once he's out there they ask him ""Is he dead?""

The dad, again, stops for a moment, and scratching his chin replies *""Nah,""*

*""Looks like he just ran outta gas.""*

That's why there are so many named Rover and Spot.

But, have you heard the plight of the fellow who thought he'd be cute and named his dog Sex?

*It goes like this:*

""One day Sex and I took a walk and he ran away from me. I spent hours looking for that dog. A policeman came by and asked what I was doing in this alley at midnight? I told him I was looking for Sex.

My case comes up next Tuesday.""

""But, that ain't the worst part. One day, I went to the town hall to get a dog license for Sex. 
The clerk asked me what I wanted. I told him I wanted a license for Sex.
He said,   'I'd like to have one, too.'
Then, I said, 'You don't understand. She's a dog.'
He said he didn't care how she looked.
When I told him I'd had Sex since I was 5, he said, “You must have been an early bloomer.""

""When I decided to get married, I told the minister I wanted to have Sex at the wedding. He told me I'd have to wait until after the wedding.  When I protested that Sex had played a big part in my life and that my whole life revolved around Sex, he said he didn't want to hear about my personal life.""

""After my wife and I were married, I took the dog with us on the honeymoon. When I checked into the hotel, I told the clerk I wanted a room for my wife and wanted one for Sex.  
She said. 'Every room in the hotel was for sex.' 
I said, 'You don't understand. Sex keeps me awake at night.' 
The clerk said, 'Me, too.' ""

""When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. When I told the Judge I had Sex before I was married, he grinned and said, “ Me. too.""

""Now that I've been thrown in jail, married, divorced and had more trouble with that dog than I ever imagined, I'm in counseling. My psychiatrist asked me what my problem was.  I said 'Sex has died and left my life. It's like losing a best friend and I'm so lonely,' I told him.

He said, “Look, you and I both know that sex isn't man's best friend. Get yourself a dog.""😆

Just as he's reaching the point that he's starting to go crazy, he spots a ship in the distance and, all excited, lights a fire on the beach that he'd prepared for just such an eventuality.

He's overjoyed when he sees the ship change course and start heading for his island but his joy turns to shock as he sees the ship suddenly come to a jarring halt as it runs aground on a hidden reef. Within minutes, the ship is sinking and with it, his hopes. Dejected, he goes back to his makeshift shelter and cries himself to sleep.

The next day, he's going for his customary morning walk along the beach and spots a figure lying face down in the sand. He rushes over and sees that it's a woman wearing only her underwear.

He turns her over and can't believe what he sees... it's Jennifer Lawrence! In shock, he drags her out of the surf and begins to administer mouth to mouth. Soon enough, she splutters out a lungful of seawater and opens her eyes.

He tells her that he has rescued her and that there seem to be no other survivors. She is of course, extremely grateful to have been rescued and shows her thanks in the most appropriate way by reaching up to pull him down to her and kisses him long and deeply...

The kisses continue and before he knows it, she's stripped off his clothes and is straddling him on the beach as they happily bang away.

Her gratitude shows no signs of abating over the days and weeks that follow and his solitary island existence is forgotten in a carnal extravaganza of day long poundings and late night strokings.

They do it on the beach, in the water, in his shelter, up a tree, with him on top, with her on top, side to side and back to front. They do it with their clothes on, they do it naked, they do it whenever and wherever they want and they want it a lot.

One evening, they're sitting by the fire, well sated by the day's ardent bonking, when she notices that he seems a bit glum.

""What's the matter?"" She asks.

""Oh... nothing."" he says in return.

""Come on,"" she replies, ""I can see something's wrong.. what is it??""

""You'll just laugh at me,"" he says nervously.

""No I won't! You can tell me... whatever it is, I promise I won't laugh""

He considers for a moment and then says ""Well... you know.. we've been making love for a long time now. We've done it with you on top, with me on top, from behind, missionary, reverse cowgirl, up a tree.. you know.. every possible way I can think of but... something's missing... I mean... I...."" his voice trails off....

""What is it?"" She encourages him, ""I'll do anything for you, anything at all, you know that! You saved my life!""

""Well.."" he says nervously, picking up an old ember of burnt wood, ""Would you... would you mind if I drew a moustache on you?""

""What??"" she begins to say and he quickly says ""See! I knew you'd laugh!""

""No no.."" She replies, ""It's fine.. if that's what you want to do, go for it!""

So he reaches over and with the burnt wood, carefully draws a thick black moustache on her upper lip, then sits back and looks at her.

She looks back at him expectantly.

""Um.."" He says... ""Would you mind if er.. if I called you Frank?""

She smiles at him and says ""Baby, you can call me anything you like.""

He sits there for a moment then says ""Frank...?""

She smiles and answers ""Yes baby?""

""Frank!"" He says.. ""Frank! You'll never guess who I've been fucking!""",A man is shipwrecked on a deserted island...,56

Poll was in a bind for money one month, and decided to join a clinical cloning trial he found online. He went to a facility, got his physical, and was told he was the perfect specimen. He was fit, lean, attractive, and had no hereditary health issues.

They took several samples of his hair, saliva, fingernails, skin scrapings, even his tears. They then paid him and showed him the door.

He got regular e-mail updates about the trial's progress. Scientists had made two clones of him. Then two clones of each of those clones. They began to sell the clones. For what purpose? Well, anything you can think of wanting a fit, lean, attractive man with no hereditary health issues for.

Eventually, the cloning got so out of hand that Samuel's clones quality decreased, and they got cheaper and cheaper. The Samuel market crashed, and people started doing whatever it took to get rid of him.

People would bargain with their neighbors, leave Samuels on orphanage doorsteps, set them free in the wilderness. Stores were overstocked with Samuels. On almost every busy street corner in every major city, vendors would cry their goods to passer-by, and it wasn't uncommon to hear:

When he was very young he would play with little toy tractors in the house and attempt to dig up the garden with the little bucket, when he was 5 his parents bought him a miniature sit on tractor and he would whiz himself around the farm house. Jacob would go to sleep in his tractor bed surrounded by tractor wallpaper and posters, he even had a tractor carpet.

As Jacob grew older he was allowed to drive the tractor around the farm and the local village, he would wave to all the locals and they would wave back, he loved his tractor and he enjoyed driving it even more. 

Then came the time to go to university, he packed up his tractor bedding, rolled up his rug and took down his posters and packed them all. Upon leaving his dad handed him the keys to the tractor and said ""Son, It's yours now"". On his way to uni he passed through the village and waved them good bye and was excited for this new chapter in his life. 

Upon arrival to the campus Jacob checked into his dorm and unpacked all his belongings, including the bedding, the posters and the rug. 

Jacob was a friendly guy so it didn't take him long to make friends and he was out drinking by the evening, he and a friend were getting along well with these two girls, things got late and they decided to head back to their rooms, Jacob inviting his new female friend to join him, she agreed. 

They entered his room and she was taken back, burst out laughing, laughed so hard and turned right around and left. Jacob was embarrassed and annoyed. When he woke the next day he decided he was going to grow up, he sold his tractor and ditched all his tractor belongings and replaced them with something more fitting this change in his life.

The next week Jacob is out with his friend and they are getting along well with another couple of ladies, he decides to head to a pub for further drinks, aiming to increase his chances of getting lucky later. 

They arrive at the pub and Jacob opens the door to find the room is filled full of smoke up to ceiling. Jacob takes in a really deep breath, half of the smoke empties from the bar, he blows the smoke behind him. He takes in another deep breath and empties the bar of any smoke, and blows it outside.

It seemed like everyone was turned away at the door for not meeting dress code. Eventually, one guy shows up and fights the bouncer after being rejected. When he won, the bouncer stripped naked, handed the guy his clothes, and told him he could head inside.

""What the fuck is this! What is your name? I want to speak to the owner."" 

""The call me Monsters. The boss is inside. You gotta put on the clothes first though."" 


The man heads inside and the club is pitch black, except for candles under mirrors on the wall. There are some people dancing, but no music. Eventually, feeling around in the dark, he finds a railing and some stairs. He follows them down to a basement office, with a dimly lit sign overhead that reads ""The Abyss"" in which sits Friedrich Nietzsche.

""What the hell is going on? I fought your bouncer to get in, the club is all dark except for candles under mirrors and there are people dancing without music up there.""

Nietzsche sat up in his chair and smiled, only really paying attention at the end of the man's rant.

""Monsters, is that you? It's a bit dark in here.""

""No, I'm Jeff. I'm here for a night out.""


""Ah yes, well then you should be more careful when you fight Monsters, lest you become one. I couldn't tell in the dim with you wearing his clothes.""

""What about the dancing upstairs? Those people seem like nuts.""

""Those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.""

""Your club sucks. I'm out of here, and I'm going to leave you a shitty review.""

""Fine. You took the stairs into The Abyss, just take The Abyss stairs back.""

It was at that moment that Jeff remembered he had read Nietzsche in high school, and got incredibly angry.

""WAS THIS ALL A SET UP FOR A BUNCH OF CONVOLUTED PUNS BASED AROUND NIETZSCHE QUOTES?!""

""Maybe, but not that it, or anything else matters.""

Enraged, Jeff beat him to death, went to jail, and the club, God, closed.

God is dead.

post,6vcznu,2qh72,jokes,false,1503426369,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6vcznu/a_struggling_indie_band/,self.jokes,,"A struggling indies band from Brooklyn, The Spoonerists, was in the process of recording their debut album. The artistic sentiment of the group led them to use ambient sounds from nature in their arrangements. One of the members of the band took it upon himself to go out in to the field and make recordings, including one recording of a herd of cattle at a farm in upstate New York, with permission from the farmer, Lance R. Boo. 

The resulting album was a huge success, and the critics were especially enamored of the sound that the cattle provided, saying that the sound was groundbreaking, and some calling it the best collaboration of the century. In the wake of this success, the band began to book their first national tour. 

The success of the album drove throngs of fans to their concerts, but after the first few shows, fans and critics were uniformally expressing deep disappointment that the sounds of the herd of cattle was notable absent. The band's manager suggested that the play a recording of the herd as a backing track. This seemed to work at first, but after a few more shows, the fans and critics still complained that they had come to see the band with the groundbreaking sound, and were again disappointed with the rote, prerecorded sound of cattle, and ticket sales dropped significantly. 

The band's manager then had another idea. He went back to upstate New York and asked farmer Boo if they could rent his cows to use on stage for the rest of the tour. Farmer Boo said no. After several more critically panned concerts, the manager went back to Boo, and pleaded with him to let them use the cattle, even offering twice the money he had initially offered. 

Farmer Boo thought for a minute, then said, ""You know, it's been a lonely life here since my wife died, and she was never much company to me anyway. I think I'd be inclined to let you use my cows in exchange for something other than money.""

The manager looked at him nervously, and reluctantly asked, ""What else can I offer you, Farmer Boo?""

Boo replied, ""I like the look of you, son. I think If you'd spend a night of passion with me, I suppose Id be obligated to give you the cattle in return.""

The manager was shocked, said ""no"" immediately, and left the farmhouse as quickly as he could. 

When the manager told the band the terms of Boo's deal, they became incensed, and told him he wasn't being a team player. The band was hemorrhaging money, their ticket sales were dismal, and the critics continued to revile their live sound. They pleaded with the manager to go back to Farmer Boo, and give him whatever he wanted in exchange for the herd of cattle. 

So, the manager went back to Farmer Boo, and reticently agreed to spend one night of passion with him in exchange for use of the cattle for the rest of the tour. 

The next morning, the manager, a bit sore and ashamed, loaded the cows into trucks, and delivered them to the venue of that night's show. They herded the cattle through back doors of the theater, and onto the stage. The band played the best show they had ever played before. The cows mooed and brayed and stomped and shook their cowbells in a manner that complimented the band's performance perfectly. One prominent critic wrote that it was the best concert he'd seen in his 35 years as a music critic. 

From that point on, the Spoonerists ticket sales were though the roof, playing to sold-out crowds nearly every night, with performances on all of the late night shows, and ended up with 4 Grammy nominations, all thanks to the cows. 

At the Grammy's after party, the manager stood in the shadows, enjoying his success, but not wanting to co-opt the band's big night. A music industry reporter approached him and said, ""You're the manager of the biggest band in the world right now, in spite of going through some extreme ups and downs. Tell me, what's the secret to your success?""

The manager thought for a moment, and replied, ""A herd in the band is worth Boo in the tush."" ",A struggling indie band,4
