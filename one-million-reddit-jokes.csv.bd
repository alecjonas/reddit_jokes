The following day, the same thing occurred with the same outcome; the woman rushing away at the sight of him.

This continued for many weeks until, on one of the days, she approached the homeless man and said “don’t you get it, I don’t want to talk with you or give you money”. The man replied “I’m so sorry, I don’t want money, I’m just looking for someone who can give me an egg”.

The woman stood there bemused, “out of all the things, why would you want an egg?” She asked. “I just want to prove something I’ve discovered recently, I feel like it can change the world!” He replied.

The woman thought for a while and finally said “okay, if I bring you an egg, and you show me this discovery, would you leave me alone forever?”. “Yes of course” he responded, “it’s all I’ve ever wanted”.

The man wasn’t situated far from the shop so the woman obliged and came back 5 minutes later, holding 1 egg. ”Here you go” she said, handing it to him, “now show me your discovery”.

The man took the egg, and instantly threw it on the ground. “What did you do that for!?” The woman shouted. “Be patient” he replied.

He bent down into his old bag and pulled out a yellow tub of lip balm and a toy egg. He lowered to the floor with the lip balm, opened the tub, and put the yellow part of the egg into the tub. The woman was still confused to this point and said “Go on then! What’s your big discovery?” The man looked up at her and said “it’s simple, don’t you see?” He pointed to the plastic egg from his bag and said “This is a toy egg, representing its parts. The fake parts of the egg are over here but...”

After careful consideration by a team of government experts, it recently announced that it has settled on the generic name of Mycoxafloppin.

Also considered were Mycoxafailin, Mydixadrupin, Mydixarizin, Dixafix, and of course, Ibepokin.

Pfizer Corp. announced today that Viagra will soon be available in liquid form, and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage suitable for use as a mixer..

It will now be possible for a man to literally pour himself a stiff one.

Obviously we can no longer call this a soft drink, and it gives new meaning to the names of ‘cocktails’, ‘highballs’ and just a good old-fashioned ‘stiff drink’.

Pepsi will market the new concoction by the name of: MOUNT &amp; DO.

Thought for the day: There is more money being spent on breast implants and Viagra today than on Alzheimer’s research.

This means that by 2020, there should be a large elderly population with perky boobs and huge erections and absolutely no recollection of what to do with them.",Viagra,19

On the evening of the talk, the auditorium was packed with friends, acquaintances, and people who were proud of their native son. He walked onto the stage in the big auditorium and placed his papers on the lectern, but they slid off and hit the floor. As he bent over to retrieve them, he inadvertently farted. Because his rear end was so close to the microphone, the amplified sound reverberated throughout the entire building. The doctor was mortified, but somehow kept his composure long enough to deliver his speech. When he was done, he raced out the stage door, vowing never to set foot in his hometown again. Decades later, he returned to visit his elderly mother, who was very ill. He arrived under cover of darkness and checked into his hotel under the name Levy.   
“Is this your first visit to our town, Mr. Levy?” Asked the hotel clerk.   
“No, young man” replied Dr. Epstein. “I grew up here. I moved away a long time ago, though”  
“And you never visit?” The clerk inquired.   
“Well, actually I did visit once, but I had a very embarrassing experience and I didn’t feel I could come back and face the people here”.   
“Mr. Levy” offered the clerk, “far be it for me to give advice to such a distinguished gentleman as yourself, but one thing I’ve learned in my young life is that often what seems embarrassing to me isn’t even noticed by others. And that’s probably the case with your incident too”.   
“Thank you, but I doubt that’s true of my incident” replied Dr. Epstein.   
“Why? Was it a long time ago?”  
“yes, it was a long time ago”.

Once a week someone gets voted out, untill 2 are left, or the straight man is out. If gays manage to outvote him, they win $1M.  If straight man is among the last 2 people in the house in the end, he wins $1M.

Longingly, he looked out the porthole window, hoping to catch one last glimpse of his wife and 4 year old child standing on the dock.

Mass hysteria ensued, as the sailors all scrambled to find their life vests, lest they all sink down to the bottom of the ocean.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man in Bulgaria that drove trains for a living.,180

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

As yet, I haven't done anything about it; I can't think of anything to do. I wrote to the Government, and they sent back a pamphlet on the repair and maintenance of frame houses. Anyhow, the whole thing is known; I'm not the first to discover it. Maybe it's even under control.

I was sitting in my easy-chair, idly turning the pages of a paperbacked book someone had left on the bus, when I came across the reference that first put me on the trail. For a moment I didn't respond. It took some time for the full import to sink in. After I'd comprehended, it seemed odd I hadn't noticed it right away.

The reference was clearly to a nonhuman species of incredible properties, not indigenous to Earth. A species, I hasten to point out, customarily masquerading as ordinary human beings. Their disguise, however, became transparent in the face of the following observations by the author. It was at once obvious the author knew everything. Knew everything--and was taking it in his stride. The line (and I tremble remembering it even now) read:

*...his eyes slowly roved about the room.*

Vague chills assailed me. I tried to picture the eyes. Did they roll like dimes? The passage indicated not; they seemed to move through the air, not over the surface. Rather rapidly, apparently. No one in the story was surprised. That's what tipped me off. No sign of amazement at such an outrageous thing. Later the matter was amplified.

*...his eyes moved from person to person.*

There it was in a nutshell. The eyes had clearly come apart from the rest of him and were on their own. My heart pounded and my breath choked in my windpipe. I had stumbled on an accidental mention of a totally unfamiliar race. Obviously non-Terrestrial. Yet, to the characters in the book, it was perfectly natural--which suggested they belonged to the same species.

And the author? A slow suspicion burned in my mind. The author was taking it rather *too easily* in his stride. Evidently, he felt this was quite a usual thing. He made absolutely no attempt to conceal this knowledge. The story continued:

*...presently his eyes fastened on Julia.*

Julia, being a lady, had at least the breeding to feel indignant. She is described as blushing and knitting her brows angrily. At this, I sighed with relief. They weren't *all* non-Terrestrials. The narrative continues:

*...slowly, calmly, his eyes examined every inch of her.*

Great Scott! But here the girl turned and stomped off and the matter ended. I lay back in my chair gasping with horror. My wife and family regarded me in wonder.

""What's wrong, dear?"" my wife asked.

I couldn't tell her. Knowledge like this was too much for the ordinary run-of-the-mill person. I had to keep it to myself. ""Nothing,"" I gasped. I leaped up, snatched the book, and hurried out of the room.

\*⁠\*⁠\*⁠\*⁠\*

In the garage, I continued reading. There was more. Trembling, I read the next revealing passage:

*...he put his arm around Julia. Presently she asked him if he would remove his arm. He immediately did so, with a smile.*

It's not said what was done with the arm after the fellow had removed it. Maybe it was left standing upright in the corner. Maybe it was thrown away. I don't care. In any case, the full meaning was there, staring me right in the face.

Here was a race of creatures capable of removing portions of their anatomy at will. Eyes, arms--and maybe more. Without batting an eyelash. My knowledge of biology came in handy, at this point. Obviously they were simple beings, uni-cellular, some sort of primitive single-celled things. Beings no more developed than starfish. Starfish can do the same thing, you know.

I read on. And came to this incredible revelation, tossed off coolly by the author without the faintest tremor:

*...outside the movie theater we split up. Part of us went inside, part over to the cafe for dinner.*

Binary fission, obviously. Splitting in half and forming two entities. Probably each lower half went to the cafe, it being farther, and the upper halves to the movies. I read on, hands shaking. I had really stumbled onto something here. My mind reeled as I made out this passage:

*...I'm afraid there's no doubt about it. Poor Bibney has lost his head again.*

Which was followed by:

*...and Bob says he has utterly no guts.*

Yet Bibney got around as well as the next person. The next person, however, was just as strange. He was soon described as:

*...totally lacking in brains.*\*⁠\*⁠\*⁠\*⁠\*

There was no doubt of the thing in the next passage. Julia, whom I had thought to be the one normal person, reveals herself as also being an alien life form, similar to the rest:

*...quite deliberately, Julia had given her heart to the young man.*

It didn't relate what the final disposition of the organ was, but I didn't really care. It was evident Julia had gone right on living in her usual manner, like all the others in the book. Without heart, arms, eyes, brains, viscera, dividing up in two when the occasion demanded. Without a qualm.

*...thereupon she gave him her hand.*

I sickened. The rascal now had her hand, as well as her heart. I shudder to think what he's done with them, by this time.

*...he took her arm.*

Not content to wait, he had to start dismantling her on his own. Flushing crimson, I slammed the book shut and leaped to my feet. But not in time to escape one last reference to those carefree bits of anatomy whose travels had originally thrown me on the track:

*...her eyes followed him all the way down the road and across the meadow.*

I rushed from the garage and back inside the warm house, as if the accursed things were following me. My wife and children were playing Monopoly in the kitchen. I joined them and played with frantic fervor, brow feverish, teeth chattering.

I had had enough of the thing. I want to hear no more about it. Let them come on. Let them invade Earth. I don't want to get mixed up in it.

She looks over to say ""bless you"", but before she can get the words out she is startled to see the man unzipping his trousers. He pulls out his penis, wipes it off, tucks it back in, and zips up his trousers.

The woman is in absolute disbelief. She starts to wonder if her mind is playing tricks on her, because there is no way that is what hap... The man sneezes again. The woman looks over, and again, the man unzips his trousers, pulls out his penis, wipes it off, tucks in back in, and zips up like nothing happened.

Now the woman knows her mind is not playing tricks on her and she is furious. She looks over at the man and says ""excuse me!"" Just as he sneezes again, and again he unzips, pulls out, wipes off, tucks, zips, and turns to the woman and says ""sorry, can I help you?""

The woman starts letting him have it. ""That is unacceptable! If you think for one second I am going to out up with that disgusting display this entire flight you have a..."" ""Sorry ma'am,"" the man interrupts, ""but I have a medical condition, that causes me to have an orgasm everytime I sneeze.""

post,eme6ag,2qh72,jokes,false,1578596436,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/eme6ag/there_was_once_a_man/,self.jokes,,"Let's call him Jim. Jim had a remarkably ordinary life. He went to school, got his degree, got himself a secure office job, set up his pension fund, met a nice girl, got married, and had 2 wonderful sons. Jim was set for life. But he was bored.

It was that sneaky boredom that you don't quite know when it set in, but it absorbs your whole life. His job, home, kids, it lacked the excitement he craved, and while he was happy with his wife, and proud of his sons, he always had the nagging feeling of wanting more from his life. He wanted excitement.

On one particularly unremarkable Sunday, Jim was on his daily walk. His town was big on agriculture, and Jim enjoyed walking the dirt track by the many fields of crops and livestock. On this particular day, he heard a voice singing in the distance. The voice was a woman's, and had a beautiful tone to it that Jim couldn't resist. He immediately headed in the direction of the voice, trying to find the woman to whom it belonged. 

After 10 minutes of the voice growing louder and louder, Jim wound up by a field of beautiful brown horses. This was where the voice was coming from, but Jim saw no sign of any woman. He scanned around him, but he was the only person in sight. He started to wonder if maybe the boredom had finally driven him insane, when one of the nearby horses through her head up, and clear as day sang out

""Jolene, Jolene, Jolene Joleeeeeeeene.""

Jim was completely blown away by this. It was happening, clear as day, in front of his very eyes, the horse was singing in perfect English, with perfect pitch, and a tone that could rival Dolly Parton herself. When she finished her song and returned to her grazing, Jim approached her. A brilliant idea on his mind.

""Excuse me,"" Jim spoke. ""I heard you sing just now, and my God it was absolutely beautiful. How did you learn that?"" 

The horse stared back at him, a little shy, but eventually answered. ""The farmers play the songs, I sing the ones I like.""

Jim asked ""Do the farmers know you can speak?""

The horse shook her head. ""You're the first who's ever heard my singing sir.""

John scratched his chin, his idea growing more and more. Without speaking, he vaulted over the fence and made his way up the hill to the farmer's cottage. He knocked on the door and was greeted by a 60 something year old man who reeked of tobacco and booze.

""Excuse me,"" John spoke, ""I know this sounds insane but I'd like to buy one of your horses. I'm willing to pay $5000 for her."" Jim had quite a lot of money saved, and his plan was guaranteed to make him rich beyond measure. 

The farmer didn't take much convincing, as 5000 was quite a generous amount, and he had 14 other horses in his field. The two men shook hands, and Jim made his way back to the singing horse. 

""Hi again. Listen, the world needs to hear your singing. I've spoken to your farmer and he's agreed for you to be released into my care. I'd like to be your manager, and together we can make you the most famous singer in the world."" 

The horse was awestruck. She had never assumed she was good enough to be a star. She immediately agreed, and followed John home.

2 weeks later, the first gig was announced for Millie the singing Horse. Many thought it was a cheap scam, but morbid curiosity brought enough people to the venue. Overnight, Millie became a global superstar. People from all over the world wanted to come and see Millie perform live. She appeared as a guest on just about every talk show you could imagine, and every venue she played sold out completely.

After 3 years, Millie's career was still growing strong. She had released 2 studio albums, and was booked to play Madison Square garden the following night. Jim was also doing incredibly well for himself, and he, his wife, and two sons were all living high in the lap of luxury, all of them set up to never need to work a day for the rest of their lives. 

In preparation for the Madison Square gig, Millie had flown up to New York ahead of Jim and the others, who were set to join her the following night. Their plane was scheduled to land in an hour when she got the call.

""Hello Millie?"" 

""Yes, speaking.""

""This is Dan Byrne with the TSA, I'm afraid we have some terrible news. The plane that your manager, Jim Norton was on, unfortunately crashed. There weren't any survivors.""

Millie dropped the phone in shock. Jim, her best friend, the one who had believed in her and made her the celebrity she was, was dead. His whole family with him. She called the venue to cancel the performance, apologising to her fans, but she was just not able to perform. The pain was too much.

After several hours of lying on the floor in the hotel room, waiting to wake up from the horrible nightmare she now found herself in, she decided she needed a strong drink. 

She made her way down to the hotel bar, where the bartender approached her and said

""Hey, why the long face?""",There was once a man,52

So anyways, once there was a guy, let’s call him Steve. So Steve has always had trouble with women. His first wife left him, his second wife passed away, and his third ended up having an affair. Feeling very lost and depressed, Steve decided that in order to leave the troubles of the dating world, he would enlist in the US Army. 

So come another 3 months or so after his enlistment, Steve gets deployed to do a tour in Iraq. The first couple of months were relatively easy, getting settled, enjoying the comradery, etc etc. However, after a while, the urges came. Steve desired the touch of a woman. So he went and found his friend in his platoon to ask his opinion. 

“Hey Delgado, sitting around and smoking cigarettes all day sucks.. What do you do when.. you know.. you need the touch of a woman?” Steve asked.

Delgado turned and pointed towards a stable at the end of the driveway. 
“You see that camel over there?”

As soon as he looked, Steve felt uneasy. But after a moment of pondering his next 6 months deployed on a base with no women in sight, he decided that if most other men did it too, how bad could it be?

So Steve immediately takes off running, all the while unbuckling his belt and starting to remove his trousers. The other privates watch in horror as they hear sounds of bellowing and grunting, and after a while, Steve emerges from the stable. He was covered in bruises and scratches, his hair was disheveled, but he was smiling. 

His platoon leader rushes up to him, a look of concern on his face.

“Steve! What in God’s name did you do to the camel?”

Steve’s satisfied expression was replaced with sheepish embarrassment. 
“Well, Delgado said to go to the camel stable when I needed to get my rocks off.” Steve explained, puzzled.

“Private, you were supposed to ride the camel into town...”",Army Joke?,32

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, David, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So David and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""David! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, David's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells David that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" David says.

""President Trump,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" David says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Trump spots David on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting the Governor, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up, you know I don't give a shit about the Governor.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House he expresses his doubts to David, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says David. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

David and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when David says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later David emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time David returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, David asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with David?'",Everyone knows David!,68

One summer day as they lay in a field somewhere, taking in some sun, each with a half drunk bottle of wine in them they began to get bored.

Idiot No #1 says to idiots, #2 and #3, “I wonder which one of us can fart the farthest.”

“Yeah,"" agrees #2.

\#3 says, “I have an idea—let’s stick the corks from the wine bottles up our butts and then fart. We can see whose cork goes farthest and then we'll know!”

“Yeah, yeah,"" idiots #1 and #2 chime in, excited.

They rise up from where they were laying and all three remove their pants and underwear, they each stuff a cork up their butt.

Did I say they were idiots?

Idiot #1 shoots the backdoor breeze first. The cork whizzes through the air and lands about an acre away.

Idiot #2 says, “I can do better,"" and takes position wiggling his butt in the air in preparation. He farts and *swish* ————→ out flies the cork, they searched for it and they found it four acres away,

“Top that,"" says idiot #2 to idiot #3.

“Oh, yeah, watch this I’m going to beat you both,"" says #3.

He takes position, lines his butt up towards the field, red in the face for having the cork up his butt the longest, and finally farts, releasing the cork to a boom that breaks the speed barrier.

He pulls up his pants and the three Idiots begin searching for the cork. They search and search, into the night, but can't find the cork.

Finally, they give up and go home.

The next morning the idiots meet for coffee as they are drinking their coffee idiot #1 pulls out the daily newspaper from his back pocket and reads the headline:

**Flying Cork Kills Elephant in Africa.**

A bird pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely not avian flu.

The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.

However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws.  By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.

 MTA then hired an ornithological behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.

 The ornithological behaviorist very quickly determined the cause:  When crows eat road kill, they always have a lookout crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.  They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""Truck.""",Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead crows near greater Boston recently...,80

“Sure, Tom and I are good friends, and I can prove it.” So Skipper and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise’s door, and sure enough, Tom Cruise shouts, “Skipper! Great to see you! You and your friend should come join me for lunch!”

Although impressed, Skipper’s boss is still skeptical. As soon as they leave Tom Cruise’s house, he tells Skipper that he thinks that it was just lucky that Skipper knew Cruise.

“Go ahead, name anyone else.” says Skipper

“The president of the United States.” His boss quickly replies.

“Yes,” Skipper says, I know him. Let’s fly out to Washington.” And off they go.  As they tour the White House, the president spots Skipper and motions him over, saying, “Skipper! What a surprise! I was just on my way to a meeting but first let me grab a cup of coffee and catch up with you.”

Well, the boss is very shaken by now, but not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds, he expresses his doubts to Skipper, who again tells him to name anyone else.

“The Pope.” His boss suggests.

“Sure!” Says Skipper. “My family is very religious, and I’ve known the Pope for a long time.” So off they fly to Rome. Skipper and his boss are assembled with the masses in Vatican Square when Skipper says, “This will never work. I can’t catch the Pope’s eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards, so just let me just go upstairs and I’ll come out on the balcony with the Pope.” And he disappears into the crowd and headed toward the Vatican. Sure enough, half an hour later Skipper emerges with the Pope on the balcony. But when Skipper returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics. Making his way to his boss’s side, Skipper asks him, “What happened?”

His boss looks up and says, “I was doing fine until you and the Pope came out onto the balcony and the man next to me said, ‘Who’s that on the balcony with Skipper?’”","Skipper was always bragging to his boss, “You know, I know everyone there is to know.

advertising referenced the ""infinite"" amount of space on the inside, and its excellent location downtown. The walls were sleek and black, with purple house lights and an immaculate sound system. Drinks were all priced at whole dollar amounts, and the staff wore minimalist black uniforms with numbers like sports jerseys.

Opening weekend came, and the venue was a smash hit. Lines ran around the block, but the club was always able to let more people in; celebrities raved about the minimalist aesthetic, and the bathroom attendants turned a blind eye to anything with a sufficient tip. It quickly became the most popular nightclub in Europe, drawing crowds from all across the continent to experience the new sensation.

With success, however, came conflict. The club's executives were split on how to move forwards as a brand; one half of the board wanted to expand rapidly, opening new Integer clubs all across the world. The other half wanted to remain in one location, maintaining the club's exclusivity and minimizing operational difficulties. Day after day, tensions inside the company grew. Finally, one fateful day, it was put to a board vote; the minimalists won out by a single vote. Half of the executive board walked out, never seen in the boardroom again.

As part of a deal struck to secure the extra vote, the newly reformed board had agreed to build an expansion to increase the club's capacity on busy nights. They purchased the lot next-door, and immediately began construction on a new area of the nightclub. Integers was going to be better than ever... or so management claimed.
For the first time since the club's opening night, a sign was hung on the door to alert patrons that the club wasn't open.

Zeus is attempting to combat climate change, Poseidon is dealing with rampant pollution and rising sea levels, and Hades needs to update his infrastructure to deal with the massive influx of souls after WW3.

So, they have one final meeting before they part. Afterwards, they say their goodbyes, and each go their separate ways.

In the years to come, the humans destroyed themselves, much to the relief of the gods. Eventually, Zeus’ efforts pay off, and the skies return to normal. Hades, too, manages the crisis of billions of souls entering his realm with relative ease. Only Poseidon, lamenting the loss of so much wildlife and habitation, struggles to get the seas back in line. 

They meet up for another drink, their first in decades. 

Zeus appears first, his arrival announced by a thunderclap and a bolt of lightning. A golden light settling over him, he sits.

Moments later, the earth shakes and the ground tears. From the depths of darkness arrives Hades, and his arrival is announced by fire and brimstone. He also sits.

Yet, Poseidon did not come. The brothers waited 10, 15 minutes, yet he did not arrive. Just as they are about to head back, a stagnant puddle of water seeps from the ground. Out of it steps Poseidon, his face aged and withered. Dead seaweed trails in his wake, and his arrival is announced by the sight of dead fish and the taste of bad seafood.

“Brother!” Hades cries out. “You look terrible.”

“Those humans must have been terrible to your realm,” Zeus says.

“Yes,” Poseidon replies, his voice dry and cracking. “They certainly took atoll on me.”","Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades sit down for a drink.",4

He pulls over at the first driveway he sees to stretch his legs and sees a farmer leaning against a fence post. The farmer is staring off into the field and is watching two children running around and playing with a three legged pig. They wrestle it, ride it, treat it like it's their best friend.

Figuring he could use someone to talk to he approaches the farmer.

The man says to  the farmer. Not to bother you, but what's up with those kids playing with that pig? Why does it only have three legs?

The farmer replies, You know what? That pig is special! One time there was a coyote in the field attacking our sheep and that pig went out into the field and tore that coyote to shreds. It even suckled one of the baby sheep who lost its mother during the attack. Saved the business!

The guy replies, Wow, that's a special pig, but how'd it lose its leg?

The farmer replies, You know what? That pig is special! One time a robber broke into the house and that pig squealed and hollered and held that robber in the corner until the cops showed up! Saved our fortune!

The guy replies,losing his patience. Wow, that really is a special pig, but seriously, how'd it lose its leg?

The farmer replies back, You know what? That pigs special! One time there was a fire in the house and that pig broke down the door, called 911 , woke every single person up and even carried the small ones to safety!  Saved the family!

The guy, who has now lost all self control, asks rudely.. I understand your pig is amazing, I understand it's f***** special, but how'd it lose its leg?

The farmer calmly responds with a question. Sir, if you had a special pig like that, would you eat it all at once?",My late Grandpa's favorite joke..,10

Next, he took them to the Championship golf course just minutes away from their mansion. They would have golfing privileges whenever they wanted, an angel as a caddy on command, and the course even changed daily to represent the most elite courses on Earth. ""This is... stupendous,"" the wife asked. ""What are the green fees?"" Again, St. Peter said ""Nothing. This is Heaven- everything is taken care of.""

Next, he took them to the equivalence of a five-star restaurant next to the course. Wagyu beef, prime rib, lobster, veal, salmon, rare vegetables and spices- all one could eat.

""How much-""

The husband paused. ""Well... this is all nice, but... do you have any low cholesterol, low-fat options...?""

St. Peter chuckled. ""In Heaven, you don't have to worry about Earthly problems. You will never get fat and you will never get sick.""

After about four months, he is lying on the beach one day when the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen rows up to the shore. 

In disbelief, he asks, ""Where did you come from? How did you get here?"" 

She replies, ""I rowed over from the other side of the island where I landed when my fishing boat sank."" ""Amazing,"" he notes. ""You were really lucky to have a row boat wash up with you."" 

""Oh, this ole thing?"" explains the woman. "" I made the boat out of some raw material I found on the island. The oars were whittled from gum tree branches. I wove the bottom from palm tree branches, and the sides and stern came from an Eucalyptus tree."" 

""But, where did you get the tools?"" 

""Oh, that was no problem,"" replied the woman. "" On the south side of the island, a very unusual stratum of alluvial rock is exposed. I found that if I fired it to a certain temperature in a volcanic vent I found just down island, it melted into ductile iron and I used that to make tools and used the tools to make the hardware."" 

The guy is stunned. 

""Let's row over to my place,"" she says ""and I'll give you a tour."" So, after a short time of rowing, she soon docks the boat at a small hand built wharf. As the man looks to shore, he nearly falls off the boat. Before him is a long stone walk leading to a cabin and tree house. 

While the woman ties up the rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope, the man can only stare ahead, dumb struck. As they walk into the house, she says casually, It's not much, but I call it home. 

Please sit down."" ""Would you like a drink?"" 

""No! No thank you,"" the man blurts out, still dazed. ""I can't take another drop of coconut juice."" 

""Oh, it's not coconut juice,"" winks the woman. ""I have a still. How would you like a Jack Daniels neat?"" Trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepts, and they sit down on her couch to talk. After they exchange their individual survival stories, the woman announces, ""I'm going to slip into something more comfortable. Would you like to take a shower and shave? There's a razor in the bathroom cabinet upstairs."" 

No longer questioning anything, the man goes upstairs into the bathroom. There, in the cabinet is a razor made from a piece of tortoise bone. Two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened on to its end inside a swivel mechanism. 

""This woman is amazing,"" he muses. ""What's next?"" 

When he returns, she greets him wearing nothing but a bandana around her blonde locks and some small flowers on tiny vines, each strategically positioned. She smelled faintly of coconut oil. She then beckons for him to sit down next to her. 

""Tell me,"" she begins suggestively, slithering closer to him, ""We've both been out here for many months. You must have been lonely. When was the last time you had a really good ride?"" 

She stares into his eyes. 
 He can't believe what he's hearing.

""You mean..."" he swallows excitedly as tears start to form in his eyes, 
 ""You've built a Motorcycle?”......","One day a man decided to retire... He booked himself on a Caribbean cruise and proceeded to have the time of his life, that is, until the ship sank.",76

Meanwhile, there's a fisherman a few feet downstream. He sitting on a little stool, eating a cheese sandwich, and wishing that the fly would drop down about 4 inches so the fish would catch and eat him, and then the fish would swim downstream and the fisherman can catch and eat the fish.

Close to the fisherman is a little mouse. The little mouse is staring at the fisherman's cheese sandwich, and hoping that the fly drops down about 4 inches so the fish will catch him and eat him, and then the fisherman would have to out down his cheese sandwich in order to reel in the fish, and the little mouse would get a nice cheese dinner out of it.

Hiding in the trees nearby is a cat. The cat is watching the mouse, and hoping that the fly drops down about 4 inches so the fish will cat h him and eat him, and then the fisherman will have to put down his cheese sandwich to catch the fish and reel him in, and while the mouse is distracted by the cheese, the cat can run over and pounce on him, and have a nice little mouse dinner.

Well, just then the fly did drop 4 inches. The fish was able to leap up and eat the fly. Feeling pretty satisfied with himself, he started to swim off downriver. The fisherman quickly dropped his cheese sandwich, and got ready to reel in the fish the moment he bit down on the lure. The hungry little mouse immediately started stuffing his chubby little cheeks full of cheese, and the cat got so excited by the idea of a mouse for dinner that he pounced down, overshot his landing, and landed in the river.

Very worried, the mother goes to the chemist  and buys a pregnancy kit. The test result shows that the girl is pregnant. Shouting, cursing, crying, the mother says, “Who was the pig that did this to you? I want to know!” The girl picks up the phone and makes a call.

Half an hour later, a Ferrari stops in front of their house. A mature and distinguished man with gray hair and impeccably dressed in an Armani suit steps out of the of the Ferrari and enters the house.

He sits in the living room with the father, mother, and the girl and tells them: “Good morning, your daughter has informed me of the problem. That I can’t marry her because of my personal family situation but I’ll take charge. I will pay all costs and provide for your daughter for the rest of her life.” “Additionally, if a girl is born, I will bequeath a Ferrari, a beach house, two retail stores, a townhouse, a beachfront villa, and a €2,000,000 bank account. If a boy is born, my legacy will be a couple of factories and a €4,000,000 bank account. If twins, they will receive a factory and €2,000,000 each. However, if there is a miscarriage, what do you suggest I do?”

At this point, the father, who had remained silent, places a hand firmly on the man’s shoulder and tells him, “You ride her again.”",An 18 year old Mayo girl.,44

Obviously curious, the man asks: 

Hey buddy, what’s with the tiny musician?

“Hmph.”  The surly man grunts. There’s a genie out back that will grant you any one wish. I got him from there. 

The man scoffs at the fellow and turns to his drink. Some time, and some drinks later, the man can’t handle his curiosity and walks out back. Sure enough, there is an old genie lamp on a table in front of him. The man grabs it and rubs the side. Suddenly in a puff of smoke, a genie pops out!  

“What is your one desire?”

The man excitedly shouts “I want it to rain a million bucks!”

“It is done”

Suddenly out of nowhere, a million ducks fall out of the sky, quacking and flapping and making a mess of the whole area. The man runs inside to avoid the fowl, and angrily storms up to the fellow.

But the older and uglier he grew the less women wanted to be with him. At present he hadn't had sex in over 30 years. No prostitute would sleep with him. Not even a blowjob or a handjob. Such was his level of ugliness. He had given up on jerking off years ago. He needed to have sex. He was desperate.

So one day he goes to a doctor. He doesn't know why. Sheer desperation drives him. Maybe some miracle drug that will relieve his sexual tension. Maybe the doc knows of some woman equally as desperate. He doesn't know. But he goes anyway. 

He explains to the doc the situation and how he misses sex so much. Predictably the doctor says there's no drug to simulate sex. There's no one as ugly as him that would want to sleep with him. There just nothing the doc can do. So the man gets up. Sad. Dejected. Horny. He's about to leave when the doc says wait a minute. "" Son,you're not the first man I've had this issue with. The worst case yes,but not the first. So I might have an idea. You won't like it. But it works"". The man is desperate. ""anything doc. Please. Tell me. Help me."". The doc says "" ok.  Down at the harbour  on Friday nights there's an old fishing vessel that docks there called the Santa Marie. On the port side of the ship there is a barrel. This barrel has a hole in it. I'm sure you can figure out what to do with that hole son."" The man is a little disappointed but you know what, he has nothing to lose. Fucking a barrel with a hole is better than nothing.

So that Friday he goes to the harbour and finds the Santa Marie. He finds the barrel and lo and behold there is actually a line of ugly men waiting to fuck the hole on this barrel. This makes the man feel a little more comfortable. He's not alone in this world. He smiles to himself. Soon enough it's his turn to have a go. He's a little nervous but with some encouragement and much horniness he has a go. And my god does it feel good. The man was amazed at how tight and smooth this hole in a barrel was. He starts thrusting harder and he is loving it. Soon enough he cums inside the barrel and satisfied for the night,he nods his new friends goodnight and leaves. 

He does this routine every week. He loves his new friends. He loves fucking a barrel. 

A few months later he gets there. High fives his buddies. Everyone is on a good mood. He's even allowed to go first. He gets to the barrel. Puts his dick in and..........weird. That feels horrible. He thrusts a little more. What the fuck. Who broke the barrel? As he's about to turn around and start complaining he looks at his friends and they all seem equally confused. Mike speaks up and says.


""What you doing bud? It's your turn to get in the barrel""",There was a man. An especially unattractive man.,71

post,elq2ff,2qh72,jokes,false,1578472366,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/elq2ff/the_longest_joke_ever/,self.jokes,,"There is a woman, who, for the purpose of anonymity, will be known as Sue. Sue grew up in a quiet home, a curious and rather motivated child. Her teachers praised her, her parents doted on her, her friends looked up to her. She was usually optimistic, and would say things like ""Last but not least!"" or ""Better late than never!"" Sue was not always successful in her endeavors, but through persistence and hard work, did eventually graduate from high school and received a full ride to a university that, for the purpose of anonymity, will be referred to as College. 

At College, Sue was not sure what degree she wished to pursue, and began with a University Studies degree. She went through two semesters without discovering what interested her, and began to grow worried for her own future. Then, during Sue's third semester, she took a zoology class and found that she had a hidden passion for reptiles. From this point on, she dedicated herself to becoming a herpetologist. After several years, she achieved a master's degree in herpetology, and left College to pursue a career. 

Sue's first job was curating exhibits at a natural history museum in a place that, for the sake of anonymity, will be known as City. In City, Sue found a mostly satisfying career working at the museum and spent many years there. But her time in City did not produce many friendships, and this left a bit of a hole in Sue, who was used to having friends to turn to. A satisfying career was not so satisfying without friends to spend time with. It was for this reason that Sue left City to take a job at a university in a place that, for reasons of anonymity, shall be called Urban Area. 

In Urban Area, working at the university, Sue found a highly satisfying career, and began to develop a wonderful social life as well. Sue even entered into a relationship for a time, and all seemed to be swell. She relished this time of her life, and enjoyed every second of it. Sadly, though, things don't always stay swell, and Sue found many of her friends drifting away, her relationship ended, and her research at the university ceased abruptly when funding cuts occured. 

Sue was no stranger to facing adversity, but entering middle age having spent most of her life working, she decided that it was time to have some fun. So Sue went on a journey around the world to see what there was to see, and in time, that journey found her riding a dune buggy in the middle of a vast desert. This was a high point of her trip, right up until she crashed her dune buggy into a rock and stalled the engine. 

Having lived in large urban areas for most of her life, Sue had never needed to know much in the way of automechanics beyond how to change a flat tire or when to change the oil on a vehicle. This situation was beyond Sue. Furthermore, in her joyous reverie, she had forgotten to keep track of which way she had come, and had erased a number of the tracks her dune buggy had made, thus making it nearly impossible to discern which way she had come from. But Sue was not the sort of woman to simply give herself over to despair, so she stoically shouldered her bag with the essentials and set off in a direction she hoped was north. 

Sue walked for a day and a half without finding anything, anywhere, or anyone. She had run out of water and food, and was losing hope when a snake slithered up to her and said, ""You need some help?"" Shocked, Sue blinked and shook her head, convinced that she was now seeing mirages. Unperturbed, the snake slid across her legs, and said (somewhat annoyed) ""Do you need some help?""

""Snakes don't talk!"" replied Sue, still not sure if she believed this. ""Well, no, most snakes don't talk,"" the snake retorted, ""I'm one of the last of a species of talking snake that is nearly extinct. But I talk, and I can help. Was that your dune buggy back there?""
""I mean,"" began Sue, ""it's not mine, I'm renting it, but yes I was driving it."" The snake chuckled and said, ""Semantics aside, I can help you fix it. I'm very knowledgeable, you know. But first, let's get you some water."" Sue was still suspicious of this snake, but decided to give the situation the benefit of the doubt and trust this snake, so she began following this snake. 

""I'm Nate by the way. And you are?"" the snake asked coyly. ""I'm... Sue,"" Sue replied sheepishly, now feeling somewhat silly that she had assumed the snake would not have a name. ""Well, actually, I already know your name,"" said Nate as he slithered through the sand, leaving tiny dunes in his wake, ""I am cursed to know everything."" ""That seems unlikely,"" snapped Sue, right before Nate began to list off some facts about her that no one should be able to know. Stunned, Sue paused for a moment before remembering how thirsty she was, then she continued following Nate.

It wasn't long before they reached a water pump sitting in the middle of sand dunes, and Sue dashed towards it. Nate wrapped his tail around the handle and began to pump out water for Sue, who drank thoroughly. After satisfying herself, she stood up and wiped her mouth, then noticed an odd lever potruding from the sand about thirty feet away. ""What's that?"" said Sue, pointingb towards it. ""That is the source of my knowledge,"" said Nate, ""Should you pull it, you will know everything there is to know, but every member of your species will die off over a period of thirty days, except for you and your offspring. ""Well, I have no offspring, so I would be alone,"" Sue said. ""Wise of you,"" replied Nate, ""I pulled it and that is what happened to all of the other talking snakes."" 

Nate then proceeded to lead Sue back towards her Dune Buggy, and as they walked, Sue asked him, ""Why are you helping me?"" Nate gave a long sideways stare before saying, ""Well, when you know everything, you realize that there is no point in being a dick to others. Life is a little better when we take the time to think about others besides ourselves."" ""Hmph, I have known many people who could stand to learn that lesson,"" stated Sue. ""I'm sure you do,"" replied Nate. 

Presently, they arrived at the dune buggy, and Nate began to instruct Sue in how to repair it. As they did, a little snake slithered up to greet them. ""This is my son, Henry,"" Nate said. ""Pleased to meet you Henry,"" said Sue as she finished up the repairs on the dune buggy. ""Wow, that's cool,"" said Henry, ""can you take me for a ride?"" Sue smiled at the little guy and said, ""Sure, if it's ok with your father."" Nate nodded his approval, and they both got in.

The engine started with a satisfying rumble, and Sue began to ride around, skipping across sand dunes while Henry shouted out joyously. As they came over one dune, though, Sue realized that they were back at the spot with the lever and they were on a collision course with it. Nate had returned to this spot, and was right beside it. Panicking, Sue swerved and ran over Nate, killing him but just barely missing the lever. Henry cried out, ""Why!?! Why did you kill my dad?""

Sue, holding back tears, shook her head and said, ""Better Nate than lever.""",The longest joke ever,3

When the chicken sees that it has the librarian’s attention, it squawks, “Book, book, book, BOOK!”

The librarian complies, putting a couple of books down in front of the chicken. The chicken quickly grabs them and leaves.

The next day, the librarian is again disturbed by the same chicken, who puts the previous day’s pile of books down on the desk and again squawks, “Book, book, book, BOOK!”

The librarian shakes her head, wondering what the chicken is doing with these books, but eventually finds some more books for the chicken.  The chicken leaves.

The next day, the librarian is once again disturbed by the chicken, who squawks (in a rather irritated fashion, it seems), “Book, book, book, BOOK!” By now, the librarian’s curiosity has gotten the better of her, so she gets a pile of books for the chicken, and follows the bird when it leaves the library. 

She follows it through the parking lot, down the street for several blocks, and finally into a large park. The chicken disappears into a small grove of trees, and the librarian follows. On the other side of the trees is a small pond. The chicken drops the books by the pond. The librarian, now really curious, hurries over and sees that there is a small frog next to the chicken, examining each book, one at a time. The librarian comes within earshot just in time to hear the frog saying, “Reddit, reddit, reddit…”",Book,4

Only problem is, he has a 25 inch penis. This might might sound great if you're a 12 year old, but it soon becomes the bane of his existence. Every time he meets a nice lady, eventually things lead to the bedroom and without fail, they all run screaming. He can't seem catch a break.

Fed up, the man goes to the doctor and tells him of his woes, shows him his giant problem, asking if anything can be done for him.

""I'm sorry,"" the doctor replies. ""the only thing that we can do to reduce the size of your penis is surgery. It's not covered by your insurance, unfortunately, and as an elective procedure, its exorbitantly expensive.""

The man slumps his shoulders, crestfallen and dismayed. Seeing his reaction, the doctor grows sympathetic. 

""You know"", he begins. ""It's a long shot but there's something you could try"" 

The man perks up, filled with hope. 

""Please, please tell me, doctor. I'll do anything"" he says. 

The doctor takes a deep breath. 

""OK. You know the woods over on the south side of town?"" 

The man nods, curious as the Doctor continues. 

""Well, if you go into the woods you'll come across a trail. And if you take that trail for about 5 miles, you'll come to a small pond."" 

The man listens intently, unsure of what this doctor could be getting at. 

""Now, near the deep end of the pond you'll find a lily pad, and on top of the lily pad, you'll find a frog."" 

The man gives the doctor his undivided attention, his mind racing at how any of this information could possibly help him. The doctor continues. 

""You walk up to the frog. Make your wish silently to yourself and then you ask the frog to marry you. When the frog says no, your wish will be granted."" 

The man is angry. This doctor got his hopes up only to play the cruelest of pranks on him. He gets up and storms out in a huff. 

A month goes by, and another lovely woman he just knows could be the one flees in terror from him after the 3rd date. The man is beside himself with despair. 

On one particularly low afternoon, the man decides to go for a long walk. By chance, he finds himself on the south side of town and stops before a line of trees leading to a stretch of woods beyond. 

Wandering through the woods, the man comes to a path leading deeper in. Almost without thinking, the man begins to follow it. After walking just long enough to forget why he's walking, the man sees the trail end off in the distance. As he gets closer, he sees that beyond the trail is a small pond. 

It can't be, he tells himself. There's no way the doctor's story could be true. 

Sure enough, at the deep end of the pond, he sees a lily pad, and a large, cartoonishly green frog sitting on top. 

The man is bewildered. The frog looks at him, staring straight into his eyes. Am I really going to do this? He slowly walks up to the frog, repeating to himself, ""I wish I had a smaller penis"", over and over. 

He reaches the frog and asks, ""Hey frog. Will you marry me?"" 

The frog blinks, eyes still locked to the man, and calmly says, ""No."" Immediately, his penis shrinks 5 inches.

The man is shocked and elated. He can't believe it worked. He's just about to turn back home when he thinks to himself, 20 inches is still way too long. He steels himself to try again, and walks up to the frog a second time. 

""Hey frog,"" he says, a bit louder""Will you marry me!?"" 

The frog says again, matching the man's tone ""No!"" His penis shrinks another 5 inches.

The man can barely contain himself. He's overcome with joy and he thinks to himself, just one more time and it'll be perfect! 

He proudly walks up to the frog and shouts, ""HEY FROG, WILL YOU MARRY ME!?!?"" 

The frog immediately replies, ""FOR THE LAST TIME, NO, NO, NOOOO!!!""","For the last time, NO! NO! NOOOO!",83
