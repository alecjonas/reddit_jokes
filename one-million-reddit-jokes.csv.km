A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods when one of them falls to the ground. He doesn't seem to be breathing, his eyes are rolled back in his head. The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps to the operator: “My friend is dead! What can I do?” 

The operator, in a calm soothing voice says: “Just take it easy. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead.” There is a silence, then a shot is heard. 

The guy's voice comes back on the line. He says: “OK, now what?“ 

**UK:** 
Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson go on a camping trip.  After a good dinner and a bottle of wine, they retire for the night, and go to sleep.

Some hours later, Holmes wakes up and nudges his faithful friend. “Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see.”

“I see millions and millions of stars, Holmes” replies Watson.

“And what do you deduce from that?”

Watson ponders for a minute.  “Well, 

* Astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. 
* Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo. 
* Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three. 
* Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. 
* Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful, and that we are a small and insignificant part of the universe. 
But what does it tell you, Holmes?”

Holmes is silent for a moment.  

“Watson, you idiot!” he says.  “Someone has stolen our tent!”

The man then replies: “Yeah, well we were married 35 years.”  

**Canada:**

This woman rushed to see her doctor, looking very much worried and all strung out. She rattles off: “Doctor, take a look at me.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. 

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. 

He made it out, but a single person died. 

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. 

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. 

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. 

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. 

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. 

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. 

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. 

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. 

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. 

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. 

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. 

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. 

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. 

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" 

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. 

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. 

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.,44

""Oh, that sounds like a Master Card,"" he said.

She bends down to pick it up and accidentally farts. At first she is
really embarrassed, but then realizes there is no way the blind clerk could tell it was she who tooted. Being blind, he wouldn't know that she was the only person around.

His room was filled with tractor posters, he often completed puzzles of tractors, built and painted small model tractors. He even dreamed of working at the tractor factory, so he could build the tractors. The only think Barry loved more than tractors was his dog Harold. 

One day, Barry was reversing his tractor out of the shed, when Harold darted out of the farm house chasing a pig. Barry slammed the brakes, but it was too late, he'd flattened Harold.

Barry was distraught, he ran through the farm house tearing down all his posters, smashing his models, upending the puzzles he had spent hours working on. He vowed never to look at a tractor again. 

Barry sold the farm and moved to the city, he found a job at a small diner, and forgot all about his past. 

Barry had worked at the diner for over a year, and been promoted to head chef. A regular customer always complained the fries were too dry, so Barry had the great idea to install a new fryer. The day of the delivery came, and Barry was so excited, he filled the fryer with oil and switched it on. No sooner had he done so, than the whole thing set alight, filling the entire diner with thick black smoke. Customers were screaming, children were running around terrified trying to find an exit. 

Just then, Barry stood on the counter and sucked up all the black smoke. He turned to the window and blew all the smoke outside, the customers were then able to find the exit and everyone made a safe escape.

""Alright,"" said the man, ""Girl #2, how many men have you slept with?""

The second girl, much more confidently answered ""I've slept with twenty five.""

&amp;nbsp;

""Cool."" The man, turned to the last girl and asked ""Girl #3, how many men have you slept with?"" 

&amp;nbsp;

The girl held up her hand and began counting on her fingers. ""Well there's Brad... Jimmy... Brian...""

&amp;nbsp;

""Stop right there,"" the man interrupted her. ""You're the thot of the group."" All three women, mouths open with astonishment asked how on earth he came to this conclusion.

He said with a smile, ""It's the thot that counts.""

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when the troublesome ""ph"" will be replaced with ""f"". This will make words like fotograf 20% shorter.

post,7zzwxs,2qh72,jokes,false,1519509756,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7zzwxs/cockatoo_sitter_wanted/,self.jokes,,"An old lady lives in a likewise old ranch style home next to a pasture with some chickens, a rooster, a goat and a couple cats. Her favorite however is her talking cockatoo the stays in the house with her. She decides she'd like to take a vacation, and so she puts out an ad for a house sitter. She gets a sitter lined out who comes to the house to get familiarized with the daily routine. 
    The sitter is greeted by the old lady, and a loud squawk of a 'hello' by the cockatoo. The old lady tells the sitter, ""all in all its pretty easy, the chickens and the goat will graze all day by themselves but put down some feed in the morning and afternoon for them. Don't worry about the cats, they'll do plenty of hunting on their own to keep fed, but if they come whining there is some kibble in the pantry you can feed them. Not too much though I don't want them getting lazy! 
    ""Now my cockatoo is a little more particular about his food, and as you've heard he talks too!
The sitter didn't really think the squawked mimicry really counted as talkingbut who was she to judge.
     ""He only eats once a day, but you've got to be sure to remember to get this right or else my baby gets very upset. He needs three eggs at room temperature, in their shells, in his cage at exactly 6am sharp! With that and making sure he has fresh water and a clean cage he'll take care of the rest himself! Oh and I'll leave tomorrow's eggs out on the counter for you so you don't have to worry about getting them.""
    The sitter took the rest of the old lady's instructions and saw her out the door, silently pondering the ridiculous feeding plan for the cockatoo but hey, money is money. 
    The next morning the sitter wakes up in a cozy spare bedroom to the sounds of an old flip number alarm beeping, realizing she has missed the 6 am mark by roughly 2 and a half minutes. As she wakes up further she realizes there's a caucophany of banging and unintelligible screaming coming from the front room. Thinking the house is being robbed she ripped the alarm from the wall as a weapon and runs out to the living room to find it filled with feathers. The source of the noise and the feathers is the cockatoo who is throwing an unbelievable fit, and upon seeing her screams in clear unbroken English the most vile, insulting, and shocking string of explitives and curses the sitter had ever heard.
    Mortified, the sitter rushes to provide the three room temp eggs to the bird, who promptly grabs each one in turn with a single claw, picks them up, cracks them in half with its beak and swallows the contents whole. When he is finished he throws a glare at the sitter that says more than words.
    That night the sitter went to the coop and stockpiled some eggs in the refrigerator, and then went to bed extra early to make sure she was up in time to provide the devil bird it's breakfast punctually. 
    At 5 30am the sitter woke up, rubbed the sleep from her eyes and went out to the kitchen only to realize with a shock that she had forgot to pull three eggs out before going to sleep to let them warm to room temp. Quickly she grabs three eggs and cradles them close to her until 6am trying to warm them before she places them carefully in the cage. 
    The bird, surprisingly pleasant this morning thanks her for her punctuality. 
    The sitter watches nervously as the bird cracks the first egg, and gently tests the yolk with his tongue before promotly flinging it across the cage, smashing the other two eggs, cursing the sitters stupidity for the cold eggs, and throwing a cursing fit even worse than the day before.
     That evening, rightly peeved about the pottymouthed cockatoo, the sitter hatches a plan to give that bird what he deserves and show him she's not going to be bullied. She takes three eggs and with a small needle, she drains the contents, and places them on the counter to let them 'warm'.
    The next morning the eggs are provided right at 6am on the dot, and after testing the shells with his tongue and finding them warm, the cockatoo again surprisingly polite, thanks the sitter for his breakfast.
    He picks up the first shell, cracks it, and finds it empty. He silently repeats the process with the other two eggs while the sitter stifles a giggle. Without so much ad a squawk, the bird opens his cage door, hops out and flies out a cracked window towards the coop. Absolutely curious the sitter follows him, to find him in the coop with the rooster's neck in one claw pinning him to the wall, just in time to hear the cockatoo tell the rooster ""-and you listen hear you mother fucker, then next time you even THINK about using protection I'll come back out here and rip your dick out!""",Cockatoo sitter wanted.,9

Father John says he has soap in his room and goes to get it, not bothering to dress. He grabs two bars of soap, one in each hand, and heads back to the showers.

He is halfway down the hall when he sees three nuns heading his way. Having no place to hide, he stands against the wall and freezes like he's a statue. The nuns stop and comment on how life-like he looks.

The first nun suddenly reaches out and pulls on his manhood. Startled, he drops a bar of soap. ""Oh look"" says the first nun, ""it's a soap dispenser"". To test her theory the second nun also pulls on his manhood. Sure enough, he drops the second bar of soap.

Now the third nun decides to have a go. She pulls once, then twice and three times but nothing happens. So she gives several more tugs, then yells ""Holy Mary, Mother of God, HAND LOTION TOO!""",Soap,77

A farmer ordered a high-tech milking machine. Since he bought it when his wife was out of town, he decided to test it on himself first.


So, he inserted his manhood into the equipment, turned the switch on and everything else was automatic.


Soon, he realized that the equipment provided him with much more pleasure than his wife did.


There after he quickly realized that he couldn't seperate himself from the instrument. He read the manual but didn't find a way out. He tried every button on the instrument, but still nothing seem to work.


Finally, the farmer decided to call the supplier's Customer Service Hot Line.
""Hello, I just bought a milking machine from your company. It works fantastic, but how do I remove it from the cow's udder?""


""Don't worry"", replied the customer service ""The machine will release automatically once it's collected two gallons!""",A farmer ordered a high-tech milking machine,85

Frank is confused, so he asks his friend:

The moment he turned towards the blackboard, one of the students whistled. He turned, looked at the class and asked the Whistler's name. No one answered.

The Professor peacefully kept the Pen in his pocket saying: ""Lecture ends here. I'll tell you a story to utilise the remaining time"".

 Everyone became interested.

""Yesterday night I tried hard to sleep, but it was miles away from my eyes, so I thought I'd better get petrol in my car, which will save my time next morning and might induce sleep. After having my tank full, I started roaming in that area, enjoying the peace of a traffic free ride. 

Suddenly, on the corner I saw a girl who was as young and beautiful as the clothes she was wearing. Must have been returning from a party. Out of courtesy, I turned my car towards her and asked if I may be of any help. She asked me if I could drop her to her home, she'll be very obliged, to which I agreed.

She sat in the front seat with me. We started talking, and to my amazement she was very intelligent, had control on many topics which many youngsters don't. 

When we reached her address, she admitted my courteous nature and behavior and accepted that she had fallen in love with me. 

I also admitted her intelligence and beauty and that I've also started liking her. I told her about my job as a professor in the university.

The girl asked my number, which I gave her willingly. Then she asked me a favor, to which i couldn't have denied naturally.

She said that her brother is a student in the same university, and asked me to take care of him, since we'll be in a long relationship now.

I asked the name of the student. She said that I'll recognise him with one of his very prominent quality, *He whistles a lot!*

All eyes in the classroom turned towards the boy who had whistled.

The professor said:  *""I didn't get my Ph.D in Psychology just by sitting on my ass!!!",The Whistler,300

When he came upon her recipe box, he sat on the floor and went through them slowly. Many had been handed down to her from her mother, my great-grandmother. One by one, he closed his eyes and remembered the simple joy of good hand-prepared dishes from his childhood. He could almost smell everything.

Then he saw the One. In a flash, he realized he could do this. Pickles! Sweet and juicy, those were always his favourite, and even the best ones from the supermarket never quite came close. And now he finally knew the secret ingredient!

He hurried home, found everything he needed, and whipped up a big batch. And perfection!

He turned that into a business. He started small, selling at the local Farmer’s Market. Soon he was supplying local delis. From there it grew into what it is today, a specialty Pickles label with a dozen varieties, now sold across the country. Pickles were what paid for business college! We lived quite comfortably.

One day my father took me aside, for the “One day all this will be yours” talk. He took me into his office, opened his safe, and tenderly pulled out that old recipe card. My grandmother’s handwriting was still nice and clear, even in its fading pencil. You could almost feel her presence.

“As times come and go, people’s tastes change. Sometimes they want something spicy, sometimes they want something bold. So to stay in business we have to keep trying new things. But not this one. This recipe is special. NEVER mess with this one, it’s our Bread and Butter.”",Quite the Pickle,5

The delegates are taken around Moscow until they arrive at a nightclub where they see some people holding a gun against their temple. 

Then they ask: - What is this?

The Russians reply: - This is our national sport: Russian roulette! You take one gun, you load it with only one bullet, you spin, place the muzzle against your head, and pull the trigger. 

The African delegates remain fascinated by the cruelty of the game and, once the visit is over, they return back home.
Sometime later, the Russian delegation goes to Africa.  They are taken around to a village where they are received by the local chief, and eventually led into a hut.

The chief says: - In this hut we play our national sport: The African roulette. 

The Russian delegates enter and remain amazed: the hut is full of beautiful naked black women.

The enthusiastic Russians ask: - Nice, but how do you play?

And the chief replies: - These women will give you a blowjob, but only one is a cannibal

He ate, drank and slept tractors. 

On his 17th birthday he was thrilled to get an invitation to go to a tractor factory nearby and test-drive a brand new tractor.
His excitement was incredible as he told his family and friends. The great day came and he went to the factory for the test-drive. 

Unfortunately something went terribly wrong with the tractor when Joe was driving it and it flipped over, trapping and breaking Joe's leg and fracturing his skull.
He was so upset and tried to sue the tractor company for negligence. But the company would have none of it and told him there was no liability and he could get lost!

You can imagine he was very annoyed with tractors after this and vowed to shed them from his life completely and forever. 

All the posters came down, the toys were given away - tractors were GONE.
Many years later, Joe went into a bar for a drink. Inside, the cigarette and cigar smoke was terrible but through it he saw a beautiful girl seated at the bar on her own. Tears were streaming down her face.
Joe asked her what was wrong and she said that the smoke was making her eyes sting and stream with tears.

With that, Joe looked around and then took a huge breath, sucking in all the smoke. He then walked outside into the car park and blew all the smoke out again. 

He goes back into the bar where the air is now clear and sweet and sits down next to the girl.
""That was amazing!"" she said, ""How did you do that?""
""No problem"", said Joe...
""I'm an ex-tractor fan""","As a young boy, Joe was completely obsessed with tractors.",49

dignified, well-dressed, good-looking man in his late forties or early fifties.

""May I help you sir?"" she asked.

The man replied,

""I want to see Valerie.""

""Sir, Valerie is one of our most expensive ladies.

Perhaps you would prefer someone else"" said the madam.

He replied,

""No, I must see Valerie.""

Just then, Valerie appeared and announced to the man she charged $5000 
a visit.

Without hesitation, the man pulled out five thousand dollars and gave it to 
Valerie, and they went upstairs.

After an hour, the man calmly left.

The next night, the man appeared again, once more demanding to see 
Valerie.

Valerie explained that no one had ever come back

two nights in a row as she was too expensive.

""There are no discounts. The price is still $5000.""

Again, the man pulled out the money, gave it to Valerie, and they went 
upstairs.

After an hour, he left.

The following night the man was there yet again.

Everyone was astounded that he had come for a third consecutive night, but 
he paid Valerie and they went upstairs.

After their session, Valerie said to the man,

""No one has ever been with me three nights in a row.""

""Where are you from?""

The man replied,

"" New Brunswick .""

""Really,"" she said. ""I have family in New Brunswick .""

""I know."" the man said.

""Your sister died, and I am her attorney.""

""She asked me to give you your $15,000 inheritance.""

getting randy, so he goes to the saloon to ask around. After a couple of

sort of nervous, whispered conversations, it comes out that you use the

sheep. Well, our hero isn't real happy about this, but he's really

desperate. He buys a bottle to nerve himself up. He goes and finds the

nearest flock, and decides that if he's going to do this at all, he's going

to do it right. He spends most of the afternoon picking out the prettiest

sheep in the flock. He shampoos her wool and ties ribbons around her neck.

Puts a little bell on her collar. He's also getting pretty drunk. By

evening, he's done cleaning up the sheep, and not thinking real clearly.

He's so proud of the way the sheep looks, he decides to take her in to town

and show her off at the saloon. He walks in with the sheep, and the room

goes quiet. Everybody's staring at the guy. And not just staring, but kinda

recoiling in shock and horror. He's ashamed, but he's drunk enough; he

slurs out, ""Whassamada, I thought ever'body went out to the sheep?""

sheriff's girl.""",So the cowboy goes out to seek his fortune on the frontier of the old West,4

The elder referred him to a shaman living in the center of a village, so he went to see the shaman. When he got there, he told the shaman about his small penis.

The shaman nodded his head, and pulled out a box. In the box was a small bottle with a green liquid inside. ""Will that increase my penis size?"" the villager asked.

""All you must do is take drop of medicine before sex, and say 1, 2, 3. Then your penis triple in size, and you can have sex as long as you like.""

The villager is awed, and is about to pay the shaman when he asked, ""How do I get the medicine to stop working?""

The shaman says, ""Ah, your partner need to say 1, 2, 3, 4, but when she does, medicine will not work until next full moon."" The villager agreed, paid the shaman, and trotted off to his home.

That night, the villager took a drop of medicine as instructed by the shaman, and led his wife to their bed. He threw her on the bed, took off his clothes, and shouted ""1, 2, 3,!""

His penis tripled in size, and his wife got very excited. She took off her clothes, and prepared for him to put it in when she asked, ""What was the 1, 2, 3 for?""

When Little Johnny got home that day, he went up to his dad and ask what the government was.
His dad thought for a while and answered, ''Look at it this way: I'm the president, your mom is Congress, your maid is the work force, you are the people and your baby brother is the future.''
''I still don't get it'' responded the Little Johnny.
''Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,'' said the dad.
''Okay then...good night'' said Little Jonny went off to bed. In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying. He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper. So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help. When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep. Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, but his dad wasn't there. So he went to the maid's room. When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid. Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud, ''OH!! Now I understand the government! The President is screwing the work force, Congress is fast asleep, nobody cares about the people, and the future is full of s**t!''",Government class,74

He and his father were the only vultures around, and dined on the various animals that were hit by trucks on the highway. As most teenagers do, Red eventually got tired of his diet of dead things.

""Dad"" he whined. ""We've had nothing but dead rabbits for the last month. I want to try something new. I want to find some new food. Will you let me?""

""Sure thing, Red. Nothing's stopping you. If you find something new, come back and tell me."" Red's dad finished up the rabbit kidney in his mouth and continued. ""If you don't, come back anyway. You're my son, and I love you no matter what.""

Having been given his father's blessing, Red left the flat land and went in search of new food. His adventure didn't last long. After a run-in with an angry flock of geese, getting chased off a farmer's land with a shotgun, and almost getting hit by a Mack truck, Red gave up. There just was no other way to get food. Sighing, he took wing and went back to see his old bird dad. ""Dad, I'm back. It was a total disaster. I couldn't find anything.""

""I knew it would happen."" Red's dad answered. ""The same thing happened to me when I asked my dad if I could do it. Well, come on over. Dinner's on.""

""Dinner? I'm starving, dad. What are we having?"" Red waddled over, drooling.

Red's dad shrugged his wings. ""Carrion, my wayward son.""",A vulture and his son,33

 “I see, my son. And is *that* when you took our Lord’s name in vain?”

 No, father. As it happened, the hawk dropped the ball into the water trap.”

 “Ah! So *that’s* when you did it!”

 “No, Father. As luck would have it, there was a turtle sunning itself on a log. The ball hits the turtle, bounces onto the green and rolls 2’ from the cup!”

Naturally he sees her noticing and explains, ""When I was a young boy, I had a horrible case of Toeriasis."" 

""Don't you mean 'psoriasis?'"" she asks. ""No, it only affected my feet,"" he responds. 

Well, I didn't marry him for his feet, she thinks to herself, and takes off her skirt. Off come his pants, revealing a pair of grotesquely deformed legs. Seeing her facial expression, he quickly explains ""As a teenager, I suffered an extended bout of Kneesles.""

""Don't you mean 'measles?,'"" she retorts. ""No, it only affected my legs.""

I love this man, she reminds herself, remembering all the qualities that make him her soul mate. But as he removes his briefs, she stops him before he can say anything. ...

""Let me guess, smallcox?""

Tomorrow, I think I'll go to the community college and sign up for some classes.""

The next day, Jim goes down to the college and meets the Dean of Admissions, who signs him up for the four basic classes: Math, English, History, and Logic.

""Logic?"" Jim says. ""What's that?"" 

The dean says, ""I'll give you an example. Do you own a weed eater?"" 

""Yeah."" 

""Then logically speaking, because you own a weed eater, I presume you have a yard."" 

""That's true, I do have a yard."" 

""I'm not done,"" the dean says. ""Because you have a yard, I think that logically speaking, you have a house."" 

""Yes, I do have a house."" 

""And because you have a house, I think that you might logically have a family."" 

""Yes, I have a family."" 

""So, because you have a family, then logically you must have a wife. And because you have a wife, then logic tells me you must be a straight man."" 

""I am straight. That's amazing! You were able to find out all of that just because I have a weed eater."" 

Excited to take the class, Jim shakes the dean's hand and leaves to go meet Joe at the bar. He tells Joe about his classes, and how he is signed up for Math, English, History, and Logic.

The bully scoffed and said, ""Ha! Meet me by the oak tree outside the gym after school."" After school, it was raining but the pair of friends and the bully still decided the fight was going to happen. Will and Q never had a chance really because the bully was massive and had been in plenty of prior fights. They lunged at him but fell in a puddle. They got mud on their face. It was a big disgrace.

post,7zh3cn,2qh72,jokes,false,1519324067,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7zh3cn/vaseline/,self.jokes,,"Joe wanted to buy a motorcycle.
He doesn't have much luck, until one day, he comes across a Harley with a FOR SALE sign on it.
The bike seems even better than a new one, although it is 10 years old.
It's shiny and in absolute mint condition.
He immediately buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.
""Well, it's quite simple really,"" says the seller, ""whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome. It protects it from the rain."" (true story)
And he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.
That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. Naturally, they take the bike there. But just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, ""I have to tell you something about my family before we go in.""
""When we eat dinner, we don't talk.
In fact, the first person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.""
""No problem,"" he says.. And in they go.
Joe is shocked. Right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.
In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes.
They sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.
As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.
So he leans over and kisses Sandra. No one says a word.
So he reaches over and fondles her breasts. Still, nobody says a word.
So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table and screws her, right there in front of her parents.
His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.
He looks at her mom. ""She's got a great body,"" he thinks.
So he grabs the mom, bends her over the dinner table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way but loose right there on the dinner table.
After she has a big orgasm, he sits down again. Now his girlfriend is furious and her dad is boiling, the Mom is pleasantly beaming.
But still.... Total silence.
All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.
Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.
Suddenly the father shouted, ""I'll do the fuckin dishes!!""",Vaseline,432
