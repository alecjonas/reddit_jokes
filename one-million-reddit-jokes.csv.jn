The woman gave birth to two daughters and a son, and everything was fine with the children.

Finally when the son passed his bullet, he went to his mother and said, “mom something weird just happened.” At this point his mother stopped him and explained the story.

From there, a survey was sent to everyone in town to vote on a winner. Voters weren’t allowed to vote for their own recipe to prevent everyone from just voting for themselves. 

After a week, the poll was closed off and the votes were tallied. A clear champion was crowned the best recipe in town: a police officer that electronically posted his homemade pasta recipe. 

His recipe was posted on the local newspaper’s front page as well as on the town’s website for everyone to copy and share.

the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.

""Good morning madam. You don't know me but I've come to...""

""Oh, no need to explain. I've been expecting you,"" Mrs. Smith cut in.

""Really ?"" the photographer asked. ""Well, good! I've made a specialty of babies.""

""That's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat"".

""Just where do we start?"" asked Mrs. Smith, blushing.

""Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch
and perhaps a couple on the bed. Sometimes the living room floor is fun
too; you can really spread out.""

""Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for Harry and me.""

""Well, madam, none of us can guarantee a good one everytime. But if we try
several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure
you'll be pleased with the results.""

""I hope we can get this over with quickly,"" gasped Mrs. Smith.

""Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time. I'd love to be in and
out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure.""

""Don't I know!"", Mrs. Smith exclaimed.

The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his
baby pictures. ""This was done on the top of a bus in downtown London.""

""Oh my god!!"", Mrs. Smith exclaimed, tugging at her handkerchief.

""And these twins turned out exceptionally well when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with."" The photographer handed Mrs. Smith the picture.

""She was difficult ?"" asked Mrs. Smith.

""Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the job
done right. People were crowding around four and five deep, pushing to get
a good look.""

""Four and five deep?"" asked Mrs. Smith, eyes widened in amazement.

""Yes"", the photographer said. ""And for more than three hours too. The mother
was constantly squealing and yelling. I could hardly concentrate. Then darkness approached and I began to rush my shots.
Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just packed
it all in.""

Mrs. Smith leaned forward. ""You mean they actually chewed on your, eh ...equipment ?"".

""That's right. Well madam, if you're ready, I'll set up my tripod so that
we can get to work.""

The king was always under the suspicion that the queen might be cheating on him with some of the knights of his court. 

One day, he needed to go to the neighbouring kingdom to meet with the king who ruled over there. Before setting off on his journey, he took a razor and stuck it up the queen's vagina. 

After a few days, the king came back and immediately asked all his knights to assemble in the court. He said, ""I know some of you have been sleeping with my queen behind my back and I intend to punish the culprits who have done so. Remove all your clothes right now."" The knights of the court removed everything and stood completely naked.

Except one knight, the rest of them had had their dicks cut off. ""Aha!"", said the king, ""you have all slept with her. You shall be hanged."" The king then went up to the one knight whose dick hadn't been cut off and asked him, ""my good man, you are the only one who has been loyal to me, what is your name?"". The knight opened his mouth but his tongue had been cut off. ","""A razor up the queen's vagina""",36

Every morning, when he awoke, the noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.

Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn’t stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor ; she was concerned that one day, he would blow his guts out.

The years went by, and he continued to rip them out.

Then one Christmas Day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard,liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Sometime later, she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood-curling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom.

The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes. After years of torture, she reckoned she had got him back pretty good!

About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood-stained underpants, with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said :

“Honey, you were right all these years. You had warned me and I didn’t listen to you.”

“What do you mean?” asked his wife.

“Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out,and today it finally happened.”

Every day he brings the sheep out to the field to graze, and every evening he rounds them up and brings them back to their pen. His sheep are healthy, and he takes good care of them. Over time, lambs are born and his flock grows larger and larger, and it becomes more work for him to round them up in the evening. He decides he needs a sheep dog to help.

He goes to town one day to visit the tent of the dog merchant. He tells the dog merchant, ""My flock has gotten too large for me to take care of myself, especially as I am getting older. When I was a young man, I had only 10 sheep, but now I am an elderly man with 33 sheep to tend! It is too much for me. I need a sheep dog to help me round them up at night.""

The merchant points to an adult border collie and says, ""This dog is a fully trained sheep herder. It has passed all the hardest tests and will round up your sheep entirely on his own. It costs 1,000 tasas.""

""1,000 tasas!"" says the shepherd. ""I don't make that much in a whole season! Sadly, I can't afford that.""

""Well,"" says the merchant, picking up a newborn puppy, ""I can sell you one of these young sheep dogs. They are cheaper, but you would have to train it yourself, and it would be a few months before it would really be helpful to you. This one costs 100 tasas.""

""That I can afford,"" says the shepherd, ""but I don't think I can wait that long, plus I'd have the work of training the dog in addition to my regular work. Are there any other alternatives?""

The merchant thinks, and then leads the shepherd to the back corner of the tent. There a poodle sits alone in a small crate. ""I know it is difficult to believe,"" says the merchant, ""but this dog is excellent at rounding up sheep. He can do it in an instant, with no guidance. I have been unable to sell him though, because no one believes a poodle can be good at rounding up sheep. It has been such a frustration to me. Just to be rid of him, I will sell him to you for 250 tasas.""

The shepherd thinks. This could be a cruel joke, and he could lose 250 tasas for nothing, but he really has no other options. He decides to take a chance. ""Okay, I will trust you. I will purchase this dog.""

The shepherd takes the poodle home. In the morning, the shepherd lets his 33 sheep out into the field, showing the poodle where they are grazing and where they have to return in the evening. The poodle looks on attentively.

In the evening, the shepherd leads the poodle out to the field. Nervously, and somewhat skeptically, he says to the poodle, ""Okay, now I beg you, please do what was promised! Please round up these sheep!""

The poodle stands up, looks out at the field, his eyes darting from sheep to sheep, his lips silently moving as he speaks softly under his breath.

""35,"" he says.",The Shepherd and the Poodle [Long],25

So as they delivered the orange peel, needle and the thread, they left the door ever so slightly open so they could look in.  
They peeked inside, but couldn't see quite well. They got a bit too close so the priest spotted them. Scared, the priest jumped out of the window. One of the staff members decided to follow, and he jumped out too, but he broke his leg on the landing. For the next year, he practiced jumping out of that window.  
The priest came again, and asked for an orange peel, needle and a thread. Once again, the staff members were curious, and decided to try and see what he's doing with the items. They left the door ever so slightly open, and took a peek. The priest spotted them, and jumped out of the window, scared. The staff member followed.  
The priest ran across the field, and the staff member followed, but got tired and passed out. For the next year, he trained so he gets his stamina up.  
Next year, the priest came and asked for an orange peel, needle and a thread. The staff members were VERY curious at this point about what he's doing with an orange peel, needle and a thread. As they delivered the items, they left the door ever so slightly open, and took a peek. The priest spotted them, and he jumped out. The staff member followed. The priest ran across the field, and the staff member followed. The priest swum across the river, and the staff member tried but almost drowned, so decided to leave it until next year. He practiced swimming until the priest came.  
Once again, the priest came and asked for an orange peel, needle and a thread. The staff members were mad with curiosity, so as they delivered the items, they left the door open. Took a peek, but the priest spotted them, and again jumped out of the window. The staff member followed. The priest ran across the field, and the staff member followed. The priest swum across the river, and the staff member followed. Then, the priest climbed on top of a tree, but the staff member couldn't. So for the next year, he practiced climbing on trees.  
When the priest inevitably came back, and asked for an orange peel, needle and a thread, they delivered, and left the door open. They peeked inside, but the priest saw them and jumped out the window. The staff member followed. He ran across the field, and the staff member followed. He swum across the river, and the staff member followed. He climbed on top of the tree, and the staff member followed.  
Angry, the priest finally decides to ask: ""FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?"". The staff member replies, with the same, angry tone: ""Every year. Every single god damn year you ask for an orange peel, needle and a thread. WHY. Just tell me WHY do you ask for those items?"".  
The priest pondered the question for a while, thinking whether he should answer it. The priest says: ""Okay, I'll tell you, but you mustn't tell anyone else."".

post,8heyld,2qh72,jokes,false,1525610677,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8heyld/youre_not_a_monk/,self.jokes,,"A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.

The wife comes out to investigate the gunshot, finds her husband and the dead cow, and hangs herself to death because she doesn't know what to do.

About an hour later, the younger sister comes home, sees the disturbing sights in the barn, and not being able to handle it, drowns herself in the river. It's at this time that the oldest son wakes up, he's about 32. He comes out to the barn to see where everyone is, and sees the sight on the ground. ""Ah no, MA!! PA!! The cow! How could this happen, I'll do anything to bring them back, anything!"" **POOF** A female leprechaun shows up, and tells the son ""I'll bring your family back if you can fuck me five times, if you can't, I'll kill you."" The son gets to it, he fucks the leprechaun twice and the leprechaun kills him.

Two hours later the middle son, about 25 years old returns, sees the sight in the barn and the leprechaun still hanging around. ""Ahh, leprechaun what have you done!"" to which the leprechaun replies ""I'll bring your family back to life if you can fuck me five times, if you can't, I'll kill you."" The son gets to it, he fucks the leprechaun three times and the leprechaun kills him.

Now, the youngest son comes home, he's about fifteen, he sees the sight in the barn, notices the leprechaun who again, says ""I'll bring your family back to life if you can fuck me five times, if you can't, I'll kill you."". The son says ""What if I fuck you fifteen times?"" - ""I'll give you riches beyond belief and bring your family back.."" ""And if I fuck you twenty times?"" the leprechaun replies - ""I'll make you King of Ireland, give you unlimited wealth and power in addition to bringing your family back."" ""And if I fuck you fifty times?"" - the leprechaun, extremely excited, replies ""I'll make you ruler of the world, bring your family back, unlimited wealth and power, anything you can dream of!"" The son says ""Alright"" and takes his pants off. Before anything can happen he says ""Wait, how do I know you'll survive"" to which the leprechaun replies ""What do you mean?""

post,8hdvel,2qh72,jokes,false,1525594305,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8hdvel/a_journalist_visits_a_boxing_gym/,self.jokes,,"A reporter for a well known New York newspaper was visiting a boxing gym, to investigate the importance of boxing to New York's culture. This gym had a reputation for producing some of the toughest boxers in today's game, but no one knew how. To get the most authentic story possible, he signed himself up as a trainee and went along to the first session.

It turned out he was far from the only applicant. He and thirty other young, healthy men and women waited eagerly in the reception until told to go through to the main gym. They were then greeted by the most gigantic and chiseled man they had ever seen. He said:
'Right, all of you line up. Today we are going to see who has the stomach for real boxing.'

And so they did. The Reporter found himself a spot near the further end of the gym and waited nervously to begin. After all, he didn't really want to box, he just wanted the story. Much to his surprise, the giant walked up to the first in the line and threw out a jab, right at his jaw. The man crumpled.
'He will not do.'
Then he moved to the next who, after seeing the first man fall, was expecting the jab. But the boxer threw a hook instead and caught him across the nose. It shattered, and he wobbled back, but stayed on his feet.
'He will do.'

This process continued on for another fifteen minutes or so. The gym floor was slick with blood in many places and the pained grunts of a dozen different voices could be heard, while the boxer worked his way down the line, practising every strike he knew. Seeing the herd being thinned quicker and quicker as people started leaving made the reporter more nervous the closer it came to his turn. Even more worrying was the glowing grin that was growing on the boxers face after each felled applicant. 

It was too much. When it came to his turn, the reporter yelled:
'Stop! I don't want to box, I'm a journalist! Tell me why you are doing this and let me go.'

With a smile that almost did not fit on his face, the boxer replied:

'You see, the most important part of this sport, this culture, this gym, is absolutely and always, without a doubt, the Punch-Line.'

This boorish woman stopped yelling long enough to say, “Hell no, they ain’t twins. The oldest one is 9, and the other one is 7. Why the hell would you think they’re twins? Are you blind or just stupid?”

So I replied, “I’m neither blind nor stupid, ma’am. I just couldn’t believe someone slept with you twice. Have a good day and thank you for shopping at Walmart.”

He buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for ten years.

“Well it’s quite simple,” says the seller.”Whenever the bike is outside,and it’s gonna rain,rub Vaseline on the chrome.It protects it from the rain”,he says,and hands over a jar of Vaseline to Joe.

That night,his girlfriend Sandra invited him over to meet her parents.Naturally,they take the bike there.

Just before they enter the house,Sandra stops him and says, “I have to tell you something about my family.When we eat dinner,we don’t talk.In fact,the FIRST person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.”

“No problem”,he says...and in they go.

Joe is shocked.Right in the middle of the room,is a huge stack of dirty dishes.In the kitchen,is another huge stack of dishes.Piled on the stairs,in the corridor,everywhere he looks.Dirty dishes.

They sit down to dinner,and sure enough,no one says anything.As dinner progresses,Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.He leans over and kisses Sandra.No one says a word.He reaches over and fondles her breasts.Nobody says a word.So he stands up,grabs her,rips her clothes off,throws her on the table and does her,right then and there in front of her parents.His girlfriend is a little flustered,her dad is obviously livid and her mum horrified,but when he sits back down,no one says a word.

He looks at his gf’s mom.She’s got a great body too.Joe grabs mom,has his way with her too and sits back down.His girlfriend is furious,her dad is boiling,and Mom is beaming from ear to ear.But still...Total silence.

All of a sudden,there’s a loud clap of thunder and it starts to rain.

His fellow employees always met for a round of golf every Saturday. They asked George to meet them at 10:00 Saturday morning. George replied that he would love to meet them, but he may be 10 minutes late.
On Saturday morning George was there at exactly 10:00. He golfed right handed and won the round.
Next Saturday rolls around, and George says that he will be there, but he may be 10 minutes late again. He shows up right on time, golfs left handed, and wins the round. This continues for the next few weeks, with Geoge always saying that he may be 10 minutes late, and then always winning the round golfing, either left or right handed.
The other employees are getting tired of this, and decided to ask him what the deal was. They said, ''George, every Saturday you say you may be ten minutes late. You never are. Then you show up and golf with either right handed or left handed, and always win. What is up with that?''
George replies, ''Well, I am a very superstitious kind of guy. Every Saturday when I wake up, I look over at my wife. If she is sleeping on her left side, I golf left handed. If she is sleeping on her right side, I golf right handed.''
''Well,'' one of the employees questioned, ''What happens if she is laying on her back?'' George replies, ''Then I am 10 minutes late.

Kid goes on his way into town, first place he goes is the whorehouse. The prostitute won't let him in because he doesn't have any money, so he gives her the duck. They go off and have sex, as the kids walking away, the whore comes running back and give the kid his duck back, and asks him to fuck her again as he's got a big dick and he was the best fuck she's ever had.

The kid gleefully takes the duck back and gives the whore a good dicking down again. An hour passes and the kids on his way back home, duck gets away from him and gets hit by a truck. The trucker stops, gets out and apologizes to the kid, kid says ""It was my birthday present, the only one I've ever had."" so the trucker forks over $50, feeling like an asshole and drives off. 

Another hour passes and the kid gets home, Dad asks him how his day went, kid replies ""Not bad, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and fifty bucks for a fucked up duck.""",Fucked up duck,124

First, New Year's Day.  New Year's Day occurs in Ja-new-ary.  This may be different to when you observe New Year's.

Since it's May, we'll move on to a couple of May holidays.  Mother's Day and Memorial Day.  These both start with the letter 'M' and so does the month of May.

As a close complement, we also have Father's Day and the Fourth of July.  These both start with the letter 'F' as does the fine month of February.

Next we have Labor Day.  This starts with the letter 'L'.  What else starts with the letter 'L'?  That's right, the lovely month of Leptember.

There is also Veterans Day.  This one is a little trickier.  It starts with the letter 'V'.  None of the months appear to start with the letter 'V'.  But the month of November contains a 'v' and since Veteran's Day does not come at the beginning of November but somewhere in the middle, this is pretty darn close to right.  Observant readers may also have noticed that Valentine's Day also starts with a 'V'.

She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand... 

Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. 

He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. 

Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, ""You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels."" The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. 

One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. 

Two o'clock and no hired hand. 

Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. 

She quietly called him over to her.. ""Unbutton my blouse and take it off,"" she said. 

Trembling, he did as she directed. ""Now take off my boots."" 

He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. ""Now take off my socks."" 

He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. 

""Now take off my skirt."" He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. 

""Now take off my bra.."" Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.

So the minister said, 
""I served you 10 years and you do this..?

Please give me 10 days before you throw me in with those dogs!
So the king agreed 

In those 10 days the minister went to the guard that was guarding the dogs and told him he wants to serve the dogs for the next 10 day. 

The guard was baffled but he agreed.
So the minister started feeding the dogs, cleaning for them, washing them, providing all sorts of comfort for them.

So when the 10 days were up.

The king ordered that the minister be thrown in to the dogs for his punishment. 

But when he was thrown in, everyone was amazed at what they saw. They saw the dogs licking the feet of the minister!

So the king baffled at what he saw… Said:” what happened to the dogs? !!!” 

The minister then said;” 
I served the dogs for 10 days and they remembered my service…
Yet I served you for 10 years and you forgot all at the first mistake!

“Hey barkeep,” the man said, “are you a betting man?”
“What barman isn’t?”
“I’ll bet you five bucks that I can bite my own elbow,” the customer posed. 
“Well if you can, I’d pay five to see it.” The bartender accepted. 

The customer then removed his dentures and clamped them onto his elbow. The bartender was expectedly irritated, but he was not one to Welch on a bet and he reached for his tip jar to pay up. 

“Now wait just a minute,” the customer said, interrupting the barman. “I feel like I cheated you. I’ll make another wager. Double or nothing, I bet you I can lick my own eyeball.” 

Bartenders are indeed all betting men, so he, of course, agreed to the terms. 

The customer popped out his glass eye and gave it a healthy lick. 

Now the bartender was pissed, he had lost a ten bucks!

“Alright, alright, that was kind of fucked. I’ll give you a chance to make it all back, and then some,” the customer mused. “Fifty bucks says you can slide a pint glass down the length of the bar, and I’ll piss into it as it slides, not spilling a drop.”

The barman wanted to see this happen, (what a story!) not to mention turn his initial five into a cool fifty burger, so he eagerly agrees. 

The customer ambles onto the bar top, the pint glass slides down the bar, and the customer whips it out and takes aim. He misses horribly, pissing on the bar, splashing all over the floor, the bartender, and even a customer or three. 

The bartender is elated, all smiles and cheers. “I knew it you son of a bitch I won the bet! Haha!”

Just then, the guy occupying the back corner booth, curses, flips his table, throws a pile of money on the floor and storms out. 

“What the fuck is up with that guy?!” The giddy, piss-soaked bartender questioned. 

“Well I bet that fool $1,000 I could piss on your bar and on you and you’d jump for joy,” the customer replied slyly as he collected his winnings and slunk out of the bar. ","Long walk, short piss",18

This made Larry very happy and he got up bright and early the next morning and grabbed his wings, his harp, and his halo and got in the elevator to hell. When the doors opened he was met by Sam. The hugged each other and they were off. You see in Hell Sam owned a disco. The spent the day there together and had a great time. At the end of the day Larry and Sam went back to the elevator together said their goodbyes and Larry got back in the elevator and went up to heaven.

It was beautiful, with marvelous plants of all kinds and irrigation canals filled with crystal clear water spanning the region. I was also getting the best sleep I had ever gotten. Everything was going good in my life.

One day, while I was visiting the sandman's garden, I noticed there was a large empty section in a corner. I decided I was going to plant some flowers there. 

While I was working, the sandman showed up and snapped at me, ""You, fool! I do not need the you planting these plants! You are already messing them up!""

Just then, the sandman's boss appeared, ""Mathul, we sandmen have a strict no rage policy between us. You must not be mad, even when its the man does not plant the plants right.""

The boss looked to me, ""Although, I must say, they are somewhat asymmetrical. Who planted them?""

Not wanting to look worse than my wife, I responded, ""Do not worry, it's the Beth laid plants of my sandman""

&gt;This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico. But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost.

&gt;The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day.

The guy, on the verge of panic, finally regains his composure.

""So what's the good news?"" he asks.

The doctor says, ""There is an experimental treatment available, but there are no guarantees. It involves transplanting the muscles from a baby elephant's trunk into your penis. Would you like to try it?""

The guy thinks about it and finally says, ""Well, the thought of going through life without being able to have sex is just too much for me. What have I got to lose? Let's do it.""

So the doctor performs the operation.

A few weeks later, the guy takes his girlfriend have to a nice restaurant to celebrate his new equipment. While sitting at the table, he feels a stirring between his legs; it gets progressively worse until it reaches the point of being painful.

Seeking relief, he reaches down and unzips his fly to relieve some of the pressure.

Suddenly, his penis leaps free from his pants, slides over the table top and grabs a dinner roll, then returns to his pants again.

""Wow!"" says his stunned girlfriend, ""That was impressive! Can you do that again?""

To keep it discreet, he advised her to simply mail him a post card, and write 'Spaghetti' on the back. He would then arrange for the child support payments to begin.

As the officer approaches the car, the woman rolls down her window and asks ""Is there a problem, officer?"" 

&amp;nbsp;

The officer replies ""Ma'am, you were speeding"" to which woman simply replies ""Oh, I see."" The officer then asks if he can see her license.

&amp;nbsp;

""I'd give it to you but I don't have one.""  
""Don't have one?""  
""Lost it, 4 years ago for drunk driving.""

&amp;nbsp;

The officer seems troubled by this, then asks for her vehicle registration papers.

&amp;nbsp;

""I can't do that.""  
""Why not?""  
""I stole this car.""

&amp;nbsp;

The officer begins to wonder if this is a joke.

&amp;nbsp;

""Stole it?"" he asks.  
""Yes, and I killed the owner.""  
""You...what?""  
""His body parts are in plastic bags in the trunk if you want to see.""

&amp;nbsp;

The woman says this so calmly that he begins to doubt that it's a joke and slowly backs away to his car, calling for back up. 

&amp;nbsp;

Within minutes five police cars circle the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half drawn gun.

&amp;nbsp;

""Ma'am, I'm going to need you to please step out of the vehicle!"" 

&amp;nbsp;

The woman steps out of her vehicle looking confused.  
""Is there a problem sir?""

&amp;nbsp;

""One of my officers told me that you stole this car and murdered the owner.""  
""What?! Murdered the owner?"" she asks looking frightened.

&amp;nbsp;

The senior officer is momentarily shaken by her seemingly genuine reactions, but stays on guard.

&amp;nbsp;

""Yes, could you please open the trunk of your car?""

&amp;nbsp;

The woman opens it, revealing nothing but an empty trunk.

&amp;nbsp;

The officer isn't sure of what to make of this, then asks ""Is this your car, ma'am?""  
""Yes, here are the registration papers.""

&amp;nbsp;

After looking over her registration, the officer then says ""One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving license.""

&amp;nbsp;

The woman digs into her handbag, pulls out a license and hands it to the officer. As he examines the license, he looks quite puzzled.

&amp;nbsp;

""Thank you ma'am, one of my officers told me you didn't have a license, that you stole this car, and that you murdered and hacked up the owner.""

&amp;nbsp;

The old woman looks deeply offended by this.

&amp;nbsp;

""I bet the son of a bitch told you I was speeding, too!""",An older woman gets pulled over for speeding.,137

It was built on an Indian burial ground by a lake where a bunch of teens had drowned across from an abandoned insane asylum. Strange sounds could be heard at night, and campers would constantly go missing. Years later, after seeing strange flashes of light and floating objects in the sky, the campers would return un-aged and not aware any time had passed. 

Weirder still were the camp classes: 

You could take mind reading and future telling with the oldest counselor (who no one remembers hiring, and seems to have always been impossibly old). 

There was communing with spirits - which was particularly popular - always filled up.

Instead of basket weaving, campers would make stick figures to hang in trees as parts of spells. You could combine this with wood working where instructors taught you to make realistic and very effective voodoo dolls.

Hiking was done late at night, to eerily dark caves where glowing eyes looked out at you.

Fortunately, they did have two regular classes to sign up for: Swimming and archery. 

So: You could say the mysterious camp had those pair of normal activities. ",[Long] The Mysterious camp,9

-The client: is room 39 empty?
-The boss: yes, sir.
-The client: can I book it?
-The boss: of course you can.
-The client: thank you.
Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.
The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.
The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.
Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.
After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.
The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.
In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.
He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.
The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.
The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.
After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.
The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.
This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.
Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.
The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.
The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up.
To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.
The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.
In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.
-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''
-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.
-''Swear''
-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''
So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss.
Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.
When he does, I will let you know... thank you for reading.",The Man Who Stayed In Room 39,0

post,8gvemk,2qh72,jokes,false,1525395788,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8gvemk/the_mystery_of_the_blue_marble/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Thomas. Thomas was watching his favorite show one night and a commercial came on for something called the blue marble. Needless to say, due to the exciting nature of the commercial and the amount of fancy effects utilized Thomas got very excited. He did, however, realize after a little bit of thought that he had absolutely no idea what it was or how it was used.

Thomas decided that since his father was the wisest man he knew, he should ask him about the blue marble. Well, Thomas's father worked a late shift at the factory on this particular day so Thomas had to wait an excruciatingly long time before his father would be home.  

When his father finally made it home, Thomas quickly rushed up to him and asked:

""Father, I saw a commercial today and I was hoping you would know; what is the blue marble?""

Thomas's father got visibly upset and his face turned a bright crimson. Vein in his forehead puksing, he screamed:

""How dare you ask me that you ungrateful little bastard! You get out of this house. I never want to see you again!""

Thomas, shocked at this reaction, burst into tears and ran out of the house. 

As he was aimlessly wandering the streets of his hometown trying to figure out what had just happened; Thomas realized it must be a misunderstanding. If he could find the truth about the blue marble, maybe his father would forgive him. Wracking his brain, he remembered his father (the wisest man he knew) used to speak highly of the mayor of his town.  Thomas decided maybe the mayor could answer his question. 

Thomas remembered where the city hall was because a year ago his class had taken a field trip there for their social studies class. So Thomas made his way there. When he arrived, he was stopped by the mayor's secretary who wanted to know why he wanted to see the mayor.

When Thomas explained how important it was that he see the mayor, for reasons lost to the past she actually buzzed him in. The mayor was sitting behind his large oaken desk wearing a business suit and smoking a big cigar. He looked up from his paperwork and his eyes locked on Thomas.

""Why, hello there son. What is it I can do for you today?""

Thomas, feeling quite uncomfortable under the mayor's intense, piercing gaze, started to fidget. 

""Well, come on son, I'm a very busy man""

Finally Thomas managed to pick up the courage and stammered:

""S..s..sir, I saw a commercial today that confused me. I asked my father about it and he got very very angry and threw me out. So I'm here hoping that you can answer my question. Sir, what is the blue marble?""

At the mention of the marble, the mayor's gaze finally wavered. He became visibly angry just like Thomas's father before him.

""How dare you ask that?"" He bellowed. ""Do you not have a shred of decency?""

And, with that, he called for the sheriff and had Thomas escorted out of town. As the sheriff dropped Thomas outside the city limits he told Thomas not to ever show his face in town again.

Thomas, now alone and bereft of everything he'd ever known, once again wracked his brain. He remembered watching the news with his father and hearing them praise the new president for his wisdom and kindness. Thomas decided that the president would be his best chance at finally getting the answer he needed.

At first the going was slow. Thomas had never been in his own before. But pretty soon he figured out that through a combination of strangers kindness and his own ingenuity it was possible to get by. Months passed. But, ever so slowly, he made his way towards Washington DC. 

The one strange thing in his travels, that he quickly noticed, was; no matter where he went or who he asked about the blue marble, the reaction was always the same. 

Finally, right around his birthday as it so happens, Thomas made it to Washington and to the Whitehouse. He was once again stopped at the reception desk.

""Why hello there young man"" the person behind the counter said while eyeing Thomas's admittedly rough appearance. ""What is it we can do for you?""

Now, Thomas had been in his own for quite awhile at this point, and he had learned how to be pretty crafty. It was actually surprisingly easy to convince them to let him in to see the president.

Thomas walked in to the oval office, and sitting before him in the nicest suit he had ever seen was a middle aged man with close cropped grey hair and piercing blue eyes; the president of the United States of America. Who slowly looked up from the paperwork on the desk to take in the disheveled boy before him.

""And who might you be?"" He asked in a surprisingly gentle voice.

""My name is Thomas, and I've traveled a very long way to ask you a question."" Said Thomas 

The president, obviously intrigued cocked an eyebrow.

""And what, pray tell, is so important that you would come all the way here and interrupt my duties?""

""I have traveled across plains and mountains I have slept under the stars, I have scrounged for food; all so I can ask you, the wisest man in the country, what is the blue marble?""

Thomas braced himself, and rightfully so, because at the mention of the blue marble the pesident got very still and quiet. A scarlet hue crept it's way up from the collar of his suit.

""Have you no tact or decency whatsoever?"" He snarled between gritted teeth. ""No citizen of this country can speak to me that way! Get out. Out of my office and out of this country!""

And so it was. Armed men came and slapped Thomas into handcuffs. They threw a bag over his head and put him on a ship bound for Europe.

Thomas travelled for many years always in search of his answer. Over Hill and Dale his journey took him. No matter where he went or who he asked the answer was always the same. Get out. 

Finally after many many years and many many miles Thomas heard a take about a Yogi in India. A holy man who, twas said, had discovered the answers to every single riddle in the cosmos. It took a few more years and many adventures but Thomas finally found the ascetic in a remote village in India. 

Upon entering the village Thomas quickly found out that the Yogi lived in a small shack at the edge of town. Upon finding the shack Thomas noticed how small and run down it was. He had slept in nicer places while he was homeless. It was exactly where he figured such an enlightened person would call home. He entered the shack.

The inside of the building was dark and smoky. There were rags strewn about the floor. One of the bundles of rags sat up and addressed Thomas in surprisingly good English.

""It's been a long time since I had a visitor.""

Thomas realized this was the man he had sought all this time. The diminutive elderly man smiled a toothless smile at Thomas.

""So what is it that brings you to my humble home?"" He asked softly.

""I have traveled many years and over much of our world seeking the answer to a question. I was told you know the answer to every riddle in the cosmos."" Said Thomas.

""I cannot proclaim to know everything, but I do indeed know many things. What is your question?"" 

""What is the blue marble?"" Thomas asked bracing himself for the anger he had gotten from everyone he had ever asked.

The anger never came. The old man started laughing softly to himself.

""Oh such a simple thing. And fortuitous that you would come here for the answer."" Said the tiny man as gingerly he stood up and moved to the door.

""The answer you seek"" said the man pulling open the flap across the entrance, ""lies in that building.""

He pointed at a rather large structure directly across the road. Excited to finally be so close to the answer he had spent a lifetime searching for; Thomas thanked the Yogi and immediately jogged toward the building.

He never saw the tour bus that ran him down.

post,8gv8lu,2qh72,jokes,false,1525394225,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8gv8lu/oscar_and_harold/,self.jokes,,"One day Harold the rabbit and Oscar the duck (whom had been best friends as long as either could remember) were talking about the wonderful pond in the next valley over.

""I just love spending my evenings floating around in that pond,"" proclaimed Oscar, ""plus there's always humans there who feed me delicious bread.""

""Oh how I wish I could see that,"" replied Harold, ""I haven't been there since I was a Kit.""

""Well why don't we go today?"" Was Oscar's reply, ""if we left now, I'm sure we could be there by lunch time!""

But suddenly Harold looked sad, and began to clean his paws nervously. Oscar was confused, for he couldn't understand what might have upset his dear friend so.

""What's wrong Harold? If you don't want to go, I'm sure we could find something fun to do here.."" Oscar suggested, attempting to cheer up his friend.

""Oh Oscar,"" cried Harold  glumly ""of course I want to go  to the pond, but you always forget that I can't fly! It would take me all night to get there.""

Oscar smiled sheepishly, for he knew his friend was right: Oscar, being a duck, always took flying for granted, and often did forget the limitations of his four legged friend.

""I'm sorry Harold , you know how feather brained I can be.."" began Oscar, ""But if you want to go to the pond, let's meet tomorrow at dawn! That way we can make the journey together on foot.""

Harold's face lit up, and he excitedly ran around the clearing they were sitting in, jumping this way and that, just happy to have great friend like Oscar.

""It's a deal then."" Proclaimed Oscar, smiling brightly.

And for the rest of the day they played and planned out their trip. And the next day when Harold woke up and left his burrow, there was Oscar, preening his feathers while he waited.

""Good morning Oscar!"" Beamed Harold, ""I'm so very excited to get going.""

""Then let's be on our way."" Oscar said, also grinning.

And so they set off, the early morning sunlight casting odd shadows between the towering trees they walked amongst. But the day was beautiful, and as the sun rose higher in the sky, their moods only got better. And soon they were talking about all manner of things, from the best place to look at the stars, to how many toys they had lost to 'that nasty old badger' who lived close to where the two had grown up.

Soon however Harold began to notice that Oscar seemed to be having trouble keeping up. Harold, who loved his friend more than anything; had no problem slowing down for Oscar, but also couldn't resist poking fun at his friend.

""Boy Oscar, you may be fast when you fly, but boy are you slow on the ground.."" laughed Harold.

""Laugh all you want Harold, but the only reason I have to walk at all is because you couldn't keep up if I flew."" Replied Oscar grumpily,  for he was getting tired from this unusual amount of walking.

""You know, I don't know about, considering how slow you walk, I doubt you could keep up with me even if you flew."" Quipped Harold childishly.

This began a very long and somewhat heated argument about who would win in a race. And it went on like that for over an hour, until finally Oscar; even more tired than before; had had enough.

""Harold, good friend, I'm tired of trying to convince you that you are wrong. So why don't you put yo
