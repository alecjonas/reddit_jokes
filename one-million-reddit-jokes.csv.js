I hope you can help me here. The other day, I set off for work leaving my husband in the house watching the TV as usual. 

I hadn't driven more than a mile down the road, when the engine conked out and the car shuddered to a halt. I walked back home to get my husband's help. 

When I got home, I couldn't believe my eyes. He was in our bedroom with the neighbor's daughter. I am 32, my husband is 34, and the neighbor's daughter is 19. We have been married for ten years. 

When I confronted him, he broke down and admitted that they had been having an affair for the past six months. I told him to stop or I would leave him. He was let go from his job six months ago, and he says he has been feeling increasingly depressed and worthless. 

I love him very much, but ever since I gave him the ultimatum, he has become increasingly distant. He won't go to counseling, and I'm afraid I can't get through to him anymore. 

Can you please help? 

Sincerely, Sheila 

——————

Dear Sheila: 

A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults with the engine. Start by checking to see that there is no debris in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold, and also check all grounding wires. 

If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors. 

I hope this helps.

The grass grew and grew, covering the houses and making it quite an ordeal for the Israelites to go to work in the morning, which put a bit of a strain on the old pyramid building that was all the rage at the time. But Pharaoh didn't care and the edict still stood. No Israelite could cut the grass outside their home.

Eventually the elders had had enough and called upon Moses, who had a bit of a rapport with Pharaoh, being brought up together and all that jazz.

""Moses, you must convince Pharaoh to see sense and let us remove the grass from outside our homes!"" they implored.

Moses nodded, picked up his staff and sought an audience with Pharaoh.

In the royal chambers, Moses approached Pharaoh.
""Yes, Moses? How can I help?"" asked Pharaoh.

Moses stood tall, stared deep into Pharaoh's eyes, raised his staff aloft, cleared his throat and with a booming voice said, ""Pharaoh! Let my people mow!""",Moses and the Pharaoh.,3

The wife immediately got back saying, ""Don't lie to me. I'm sure you would"".   

The husband sensed this might be a trick question and told her things like how much he truly loved her and couldn't possibly love another woman ever again. The wife seemed impressed and told him she loved him equally and if she died she'd hate to see him being alone and would want him find someone good and get married again.   

The man finally admitted whilst sounding ever so reluctant, ""If that's what you want dear, I promise you, I would"". The wife seemed pleased and he thought he had done well.  

After a few moments of pause, the wife asked, ""Would you let her sleep in our bed?"" And the husband replied, ""Hmm well I couldn't, I'd buy a new one"". Wife said, ""It's okay, honey - i know how much you love me and the emotional attachment you'll have, but you should be cautious about money too, you couldn't possibly be buying everything newly"". ""Okay"" said the husband getting somewhat relaxed now.  

Then the wife asked, ""I hope you wouldn't waste my golf clubs and let her use my golf clubs as well."" The husband spontaneously replied, ""Oh that I couldn't, she's left handed.""

This is disconcerting; he begins walking faster. But within a couple of blocks, the herd of rats behind him grows to hundreds, and they begin squealing.  He begins to trot toward the Bay, looking around to see that the rats now numbered in the MILLIONS, and are still squealing and coming towards him faster and faster. 
 Concerned, even scared, he runs to the edge of the Bay and throws the bronze rat as far out into the Bay as he can.  Amazingly, the millions of rats all jump into the Bay after it, and are all drowned.

The man was walking through the zoo back in his home town and went to see the elephants. To his surprise as he walked up to the exhibit he made eye contact with one. Upon looking him in the eyes the elephant lifted up its front right leg and slowly bowed its head. He couldn’t believe it. Could this really be the same elephant from all those years ago? The man slipped through the fencing and approached the elephant. As he approached it, he saw the seemingly familiar gaze of the animal he once helped. As he approached it; the elephant reached out its trunk almost as if he was hugging the man. It then used its trunk to pick up the man squeezing him extremely tight and slammed him into the ground repeatedly eventually killing him.

The next day the vizier returns to the palace and goes to the Shah's living quarters.

""O, dear Shah"" begins the vizier, ""I brought you your dish."" With that, he produces a big platter on which there is a kebab with five roasted ants sprinkled on it.

""How will I know those are male ants?"" the Shah inquires.

Robert was a weird ass kid. None of us were friends with him, and we didn’t pay any attention to him, so it was a surprise to see his greasy self sitting at our table. His unwashed bangs covered his forehead, but a large patch of acne was still visible. His small, half moon glasses made his eyes look like they’re bulging out of his head.

“Can you not sit here” one of the guys said, and another one chuckled at the blunt remark. Robert smelled like straight shit. Was even worse he was sitting right across from me. He got up and laughed, as if he was one of us. He was not one of us.

We thought that was the end of Robert, and no one really put the thought of him back in our minds, till he sat back down the next day. “Did you know it takes 1-3 minutes to die from a stab wound?” He then pointed at the girl at the end of the table “You’d die quicker” he chuckled awkwardly and everyone stared in confusion. “Fuck off” one of the guys said. “You’re so weird, go the the fuck away” Robert just stared, then began to speak again “Scared?” he then got up, and walked away.

I told one of the security guards on what Robert kept saying, and they said he won’t be eating lunch here anymore. But surprise, surprise, Robert returned the next day. “Did you kno-“ he was knocked out of his seat by one of the kids. His chubby self hit the ground and his glasses broke on impact. Nobody stood up for Robert, not even the kids behind us. Everyone knew he was a total freak.

Robert stood back up again, his nose was bleeding like a faucet. “Youuu can’t hurrrtt me!” he choked out. The guy swung again and pushed him away from the seat. He backed up into another table and crashed into a group of guys. He got up, his clothes soaked in food, and hurried off.

I didn’t feel bad for a second. He was a total creep, and everyone assumed he was going to come back looking for a fight. We moved tables towards the back of the lunch room, and waited. Robert walked in, and immediately started walking towards our new table. Fuck. It was a stupid plan but we thought maybe it would’ve worked.

“Did you know brain activity can last 10 minutes after you die” he said, then pointed again at one of the girls. “I’d smile at you in those 10 minutes” “Did you know if you say some shit like that again I’ll beat the shit out of you?” one of the guys said, and stood up. Robert backed up, and chuckled. “I’ll fucking kill you!” he screamed, and the guy jumped over the table. Roberts face met the ground in 10 seconds.

We all hoped and prayed this was the end of Robert, and luckily it was. A week after this, a 14 year old girl named Samantha was pulled out of a river. All evidence pointed towards Robert murdering her.

Life went on without the creep at our table. But at the end of the day, we have to give credit where credit is due.

It really did only take us 1-3 minutes to kill Samantha.",Robert,3

 “Except for that” the wife says. “A man could never respect a woman who did something like that. Eeechh!”  The husband argues against her point of view for a while, but shortly just lets the whole thing drop. 
Forward to their 15th year and things go much the same, a party with friends and family, and of course the wife wants to prove her devotion to him except for the one sticking point; everyone knows a man could never respect a woman who did that. The husband tries to convince her of his profound respect and love, but again, after a while, the subject is forgotten.
On their Silver Anniversary the wife wants to make it a special evening, and it almost seems to husband that she might come through. Then she whispers in his ear,”Don’t get that blowjob nonsense in your head.”  And it’s too much. He walks her out to a private place next to the pool for a talk.”Now look, honey, we've been married these 25 years, we’ve raised kids, gone through all the good and bad together, and I never once looked at or thought about anyone else. But I’m not getting any younger, and I just want to know what it’s like and how it feels. I don’t want to go to my grave wondering.”  The wife melts and confesses that she’s been selfish all these years. If he promises to respect her, she’ll do what he wants tonight.
That night the husband gets his wish, and treats her lilke a Queen afterwards, and assures her of his respect. After a little cuddling she goes into the bathroom to brush her teeth and gargle. The phone rings in the bedroom, and the husband answers it. “Hello? Yes. Uh huh, OK, wait a minute.”  And facing the bathroom door he yells, “Hey Cocksucker, it’s for you!!!”

“Whatcha got in the bag there, son?”, asks the old man.

The little boy replies, “This here? Well this here’s duct tape! I’m going to catch me some ducks!”

Again the old man laughs, sure this time the boy is having a lark. But lo and behold, the boy comes wandering by that evening with what must have been a 100 ducks all wrapped up in duct tape. Old man Speller’s mouth hangs agape in disbelief.

Well the next morning, the boy wanders by yet again, carrying a giant bundle of sticks.

“Well what in God’s name are you doin’ with all them sticks?”, asks the old man.

post,8dxt6f,2qh72,jokes,false,1524337258,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8dxt6f/the_tale_of_old_joe/,self.jokes,,"There once was a man named Paul who, after some trouble with the law, found himself homeless behind a fast food joint just outside of Wichita, Kansas. He stayed there for a few days, drinking from the bathroom sinks and eating scraps from the trash, when an old rancher named Joe found him and took pity. 

""Look,"" the old man said, ""if you don't mind some hard work, I'll take you back to my ranch. I'm in need of a ranch-hand, and I think I could offer you a bed and rustle up some warm grub."" Paul graciously agreed, and headed off to the ranch with old Joe.

The first few weeks were hard. He had to shovel manure, coral the horses, and learn to rope cattle. His muscles ached and his hands were covered in blisters. But he had a warm bed in the loft of the barn and three hot meals a day, and old Joe was kind, so he kept at it.

Well, the weeks turned into months and Paul turned out to be a fine ranch-hand. He could do barn chores faster than anybody and roped cattle with the best of them. He still stayed in the straw bed in the barn loft and ate hot chow with old Joe and Joe's wife.

Seasons changed. The grass went brown and the winds turned cold, but Paul still worked as hard as ever, rising as early as 3 am to get started on the barn chores. The months turned into years and he grew close to kind old Joe.

One day Joe took him aside and said, ""Paul, you've really grown on me. I can't help but remember the poor state in which I found you and how much you've changed. You're the best ranch hand I ever had. I want you to start sleeping in the farmhouse, in my son's room. He died a couple years before I found you, in a car crash, and I've left his room empty since... but I want you to have it. You're like a son to me now.""

In tears of gratitude, Paul agreed, and started sleeping in the farmhouse.

Well, the stages of life pass like seasons-- the spring of birth, the summer of youth, the fall of aging, and the winter of death-- and old Joe fell ill with pneumonia. They called the doctor out to take a look and the news wasn't good-- old Joe had grown weak and the medicine couldn't get on top of the infection. Joe was on his deathbed.

After the doctor left, Joe asked a distraught Paul to come closer. He whispered, ""Paul, my second son. I need you to do something for me. When I was in the war, I took a gold watch off a Jap who tried to bayonet me. It's been a treasure of mine because it reminded me of the fragility of life and the horrors of war. Wanting to keep it safe, I sealed it in a fence post on the far side of the pasture. I painted the top white so I could remember where it is. Paul, I'd like to have that watch with me now, while I wait to pass on to the Lord.""

Paul agreed. Filled with determination and aware that time was running out, Paul saddled up the fastest horse on the ranch and galloped at full speed to the end of the pasture. He dismounted at the far end and started looking for the white-topped post.

He checked one, then another, then another. No white tops, no hidden watches. Frustration growing, Paul broke out into a run, first running one way, then the other.

Finally, he found a post that looked promising. The paint on top was faded gray, but still there. Paul ran his fingers over the top, feeling the rough, weathered surface, and found a small crack. He pulled the post open in expectation and found... nothing. There was no watch. 

""You lookin' for a watch?"" a voice from behind called out.

Paul turned and saw an old man, maybe even older than Paul, standing behind him. ""Who are you?"" Paul asked.

The old man smiled. ""They call me Billy, but that's not my real name. I'm Joe's brother. I stay out here in the shed by the far corner of the pasture, and watch over the cattle when they come this way. In return, my brother gives me three square meals a day and a roof over my head.

""I can't work anywhere else, after I took some shrapnel in my back on Okinawa. I was there, with Joe, when he took the watch. I knew how much it meant to him, so I was a little surprised when he stuck in an old fence post. After some months had gone by and Joe stopped checking on it, I took the post with the watch and locked them up in my shed here for safety. 

""I rustled up and old scrap post, painted the top white, and stuck it where you are now. It ain't the post you want. What you're lookin' at, right there, is just a repost."" ",The tale of Old Joe,53

""Excellent, we have these grass seeds of the highest quality for $3.50. Perhaps I can interest you in a lawnmower as well?""  replies the manager.

""A lawnmower? Why on earth would I need a lawnmower?"" asks the customer.

To which the manager responds, ""Well, we have a lawnmower on discount currently, for $400 instead of $500, and in two months time when your grass has grown and you'll want to tend to your lovely new lawn, you'll need a lawnmower, but by then the lawnmower won't be on discount... So you might as well save some money and buy it now."".

The customer is convinced, and buys the lawnmower and the grass seeds for a total of $403.50.

The manager turns to his apprentice and says, ""See? He came in to spend $3.50 but with some convincing ended up spending an extra $400 dollars. Now it's your turn to try"".

So when the next customer comes in, the apprentice goes up to him and says politely, ""Good evening, sir! How may I help you?"".

The customer, clearly a bit embarrassed, says softly ""I need a box of tampons, please.""

The apprentice gives him a box of tampons for $7.50, and says to the customer, ""While you're here, perhaps I can interest you in our discounted lawnmower?"".

The customer, clearly baffled, says to him ""A lawnmower? Why the hell would I need a lawnmower?"".

To which the apprentice replies, ""Well, your weekend is clearly fucked, you might as well get some gardening done..."".",Just heard this joke from my dad: A newly hired salesman in a department store is being taught by his manager how to handle sales...,19

This is a portion of an ABC radio interview between a female broadcaster and General Cosgrove who was about to sponsor a Boy Scout Troop visiting his military Headquarters.

FEMALE INTERVIEWER:
So, General Cosgrove, what things are you going to teach these young boys when they visit your base?
GENERAL COSGROVE:
We're going to teach them climbing, canoeing, archery, and shooting.
FEMALE INTERVIEWER:
Shooting! That's a bit irresponsible, isn't it?

I don't see why, they'll be properly supervised on the rifle range.
FEMALE INTERVIEWER:
Don't you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be teaching children?

I don't see how. We will be teaching them proper rifle discipline before they even touch a firearm.

But you're equipping them to become violent killers.

""How much do you charge?"" 
  
'$200 per visit,' replied

This caused a system to form in order to ensure the survival of the human species. Once every new year, all children who would be turning 16 were expected to present a crop that they had grown. It had become both a coming of age event and a ceremony that determined the rest of their career. They were divided into different levels depending on their yield. The highest quality being a premium and if you cannot present one you became a no-name. No-names lived in landfills and were left to die, if they could not contribute to the food bank then they were removed.
""I just don't get it, even with the best fertilizer I could afford it just won't grow""

Paul (15) was worried that he would be unable to present his families fruit at the ceremony. His parents were well known and owned one of the largest farms, he simply had to carry on the legacy. 

""Oh don't worry sweetie you still have two weeks, I'm sure you'll do just fine. You're a premium like us, you don't belong with the no-names."" Helen's (38) voice rang from the other room.

Paul knew his mother was just trying to make him feel better but he was worried. If he couldn't prove he was a premium he wouldn't be able to be with his family anymore. But most of all he would have disappointed his father, one of the few children who was designated as prodigies within the industry and was immediately placed in the highest bracket of premiums.

Although his mom was also considered a high tier, it ultimately meant nothing for him as the system judges on an individual basis. Many other children his age had spent a good portion of their lives trying to perfect their crop in order to reach a higher level. Paul had spent his life leeching off of his families benefits he never considered that he would become a no-name.
""I'll try one last time"" Paul thought to himself. If he couldn't create it then perhaps it was his fate to become a no-name, afterall his inability to grow means that he is worthless. Paul's mind started to drift. He grew increasingly delirious as the weeks went by and the seed showed no signs of improvement. He had resigned to his fate and concluded that he'd simply die in the dumps and would never experience manhood. 

A week before the ceremony, Paul laid on his bed, defeated by a stupid plant. A plant that refused to grow for him no matter how hard he tried. He was crying to himself snot and tears mixing with each other flowing like salty nectar.

Just then, Paul's father walked by and noticed his son in such dismay, bawling over a plant. He grabbed his son and said, ""Grow a pear, you little bitch""",Coming of Age,0

 The next day the donkey found himself panicking trying to make the shack that he lived  in look anything near as good as the race horses house the night before, and in a fit of desperation he headed down to the zoo and took some pictures of a zebra. That whole afternoon he spent printing them out into large posters which covered the whole wall, to prepare for the arrival of the horse.

Lo and behold, that horse - a long shot - won the race.

Next race, as the horses lined up, the Priest stepped onto the track. 

Sure enough, he blessed one of the horses. 

The bookie made a beeline for a betting window and placed a small bet on the horse.

Again, even though it was another long shot, the horse won the race. He collected his winnings, and anxiously waited to see which horse the Priest would bless next.

He bet big on it, and it won.

As the races continued the Priest kept blessing horses, and each one ended up winning.

The bookie was elated.

He made a quick dash to the ATM, withdrew all his savings, and awaited for the Priest's next blessing that would tell him which horse to bet on.

True to his pattern, the Priest stepped onto the track for the last race and blessed the forehead of an old nag that was 100/1. This time the priest blessed the eyes, ears, and hooves of the old nag. The bookie knew he had a winner and bet every cent he had on the old nag.

He watched dumbfounded as the old nag pulled up lame and couldn't even finish the race.

In a state of shock, he went to the track area where the Priest was standing. Confronting him, he exclaimed, ""Father! What happened? All day long you blessed horses and they all won. Then in the last race, the horse you blessed never even had a chance. Now, thanks to you I've lost all my money!""

The Priest nodded wisely and with sympathy. ""You aren't Catholic are you my son?""

""No, I'm Jewish.""

""That's the problem"", said the Priest, ""you couldn't tell the difference between a blessing and last rites.""

The soldier had been granted rest and relaxation and was on a train that was bound for London.

The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train in hopes of finding an empty seat.

The only empty seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged English lady and was being used by her little dog.

The weary soldier asked, ""Please ma'am, may I sit in that seat?""

The English woman looked down her nose at the solider and sniffed then said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see that my little pooch is using that seat?""

The soldier walked away, looking if there were any other unoccupied seats to use, but after another trip down to the end of the train, he found himself facing the woman with the dog again.

Again, the soldier asked, ""Please lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired.""

The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted out loud, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also extremely arrogant!""

The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog and tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.

The Woman, at a loss for words; shrieked, railed and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

An English gentlemen sitting across the aisle spoke up and said, ""You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand, you drive your autos on the wrong side of the road and now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window!.""

The explorer from Poland set out, and he met the explorer from the Czech Republic at the airport in Vancouver, and they set off for Whistler, where they would start their journey.  They headed out in the direction of Lake Louise, and their journey was a good one, with each explorer making daily video call to his country's news station every night.  

This went on for a week, until one day there were no calls from either explorer.  The Polish government contacted the Czech Republic's government, and they decided to contact some locals to see if they could find their missing explorers.

The local Canadians searched high and low where the two men would have been, until they came across a grizzly bear den.  Being as it was mating season, they went on a little more cautiously, until they ran across a female grizzly.  They tried to avoid her, but she was agitated and tried to charge the search party, who were forced to shoot her dead.  

Upon examining the body, they made the unfortunate discovery that the Polish explorer had been killed and eaten by that same grizzly.  They found parts of his gear and his official jacket in her stomach. While examining her further, they discovered that she was also recently pregnant, around the same time that the explorers went missing.

A few days later, the head of the search party made his official televised statement:

""After an extensive search, considering the unfortunate discovery of the body of the explorer from Poland, and with the discovery that the female bear was pregnant, we have determined that there was more than one bear responsible for the attack on these two brave men, one female and we can only assume one male.  We don't know how far the other bear may have ranged, but we are confident is telling you that the Czech is in the male.""",2 famous explorers set out to trek across Canada,2

""Yeah, dude. Come on up here.""

So the lizard climbed the tree and smoked weed with the monkey. They smoked and smoked until the lizard's mouth got dry and he became very thirsty. ""Yo, Monkey."" Said the lizard. ""This weed is fire, but my mouth is so dry. Do you have any water?""

""Not on me."" Said the monkey. ""But there's a stream right over that hill and you can drink all the water you want there.""

""Cool."" Said the lizard, and he headed over to the stream. While he was drinking an alligator walked by.""

""Yo, lizard."" Said the alligator. You stoned as fuck.""

""Haha, yeah,"" giggled the lizard.

""You got any more weed?"" Asked the alligator.

""Not on me."" Said the lizard, ""but there's a monkey in the tree over there and he might have more.""

The alligator walks over to the tree and yells up to the monkey. ""Yo, monkey!"" He yells. ""Have you got any more of that weed?""

The monkey stared down at the alligator rubbing his eyes in disbelief. ""Holy shit, lizard."" He says. ""How much water did you drink?!!""

After walking around in dismay, he sees what appears to be a cultural medicine shop.. At the end of his rope, and still unwilling to accept what the previous doctors said, he goes inside..

An older gentleman approaches him and the man tells him about the situation. The man asks him to expose his genitals so he can can examine him... ""oh... That's not looking so good, what did the doctors tell you?"". ""They said they would have to remove it"" he said... Shaking his head the old man says ""no, no, no... We not need take it off"" The man, so excited to hear starts jumping around screaming with joy... Once he stops and settles down, he sees the old man sitting there quietly..

""I know exactly what was happening in there! I cant delete these photos, if you want the photos you will have to buy the camera!""

""How much is the camera?""

""Oh, $5,000.00""

The priest pauses and considers. The camera is a cheap model worth at most $100. But given the serious nature of the photos on the camera he decides to buy the camera and delete the photos. Hey, at least he got a new camera out of the deal! Not having any money left he reschedules and flies back the next day and is met by the Archbishop waiting at his home church.

""Oh the weather, it was really terrible I just could not take it""

""Oh I see that is indeed terrible news. I see you bought yourself a nice camera though! Also where is the $5000.00 i gave you before the mission?""

With his new found wealth he was pondering what to do so he hatched a plan. He headed off down to his nearest Porsche dealership and when he arrived 2 weeks later he crawled up to the salesman.

""excuse me"" the snail said ""I would like to purchase your fastest Porsche please""
After getting over the shock of seeing a talking snail, the salesman said ""and how would you, a snail, pay for one of our cars""
The snail, being smart, had thought of this and had dragged a suitcase of cash behind him, presenting this to the salesman made things go much faster and pretty soon the snail found himself in the process of ordering one of the fastest cars the dealership could offer. 

""there is one thing"" the snail said, ""I would like a custom paint job on my car please"".
""well"" said the dealer ""we can do that, it just takes an extra few thousand dollars and 4-6 weeks, what would you like?""
""the money and time is no issue"", said the snail, ""what I would like is for the car to be bright red in color, but can you please paint a great big 'S' on the roof in yellow paint, and then can you paint a great big 'S' on the drivers side, and passenger side doors please"". 

well this was an unusual request, but hell, this was a car for a snail so it wasn't the most unusual part of the deal so it was agreed. The snail headed off home and then when he got there he turned around and came back to pick up his car. 

Arriving to pick up his car he was pleased to see that it was bright red in color, with a big yellow S on the doors, and a big yellow S on the roof. 

""well here you go"" said the salesman, ""we were wondering though.. why do you want the big yellow S on the door and roof, is it for snail?"".

""no"" said the snail.. "" you see.. I asked for the fastest car you have, and I plan on driving it down the freeway and going past all the other drivers.. and when they see me going past them at a breakneck speed, I want them to look to their friends and say 'wow!!! look at that S car go....'""

It was very hot the few days I was there. Sweated buckets as soon as I stepped out of the air-conditioned respite of the hotel and shopping malls.


&amp;nbsp;


Every morning while leaving the hotel, I would see a skinny guy standing on the pavement by the road, selling coconut juice. Just a simple roadside stall, with a mat, a few styrofoam boxes and a piece of cardboard with ""RM$2"" hastily scrawled on. No chair, no shelter from the dust of the road or the merciless heat.


&amp;nbsp;


The weather didn't seem to slow the guy down though. Every time I saw him, he would be standing, waving one of those ice cream bells (the one with a stick as a handle at one end) in his hand, screaming ""DUA RINGGIT!! DUA RINGGIT! !"" at the top of his lungs.


&amp;nbsp;


He was there every morning when I left the hotel. He was there every afternoon while I was hurrying past the hotel to reach the safety of the next air-conditioned shopping mall. He was still there every evening when I finally had enough of the heat for the day and retreated back to the hotel. Guy was like a machine, didn't seem to get tired. Didn't care about the heat or the noise or the dust. Just standing there, selling his $2 coconut juice, waving his ice cream bell about, screaming ""DUA RINGGIT!! DUA RINGGIT!!!"" at the top of his lungs.


&amp;nbsp;


I saw the man one last time at the end of my vacation. Had just checked out of the hotel at about 2pm. While waiting for a Grab to the airport, I saw him at his usual spot still there, screaming ""DUA RINGGIT!! DUA RINGGIT!!!"", selling his coconut juice, doing his thing. I had ignored him every time I saw him but somehow he seemed to recognise me. Between shouting and waving his bell, he noticed me and smiled. 


&amp;nbsp;


It was at this time when I decided this could not go on. I had to make a difference in this poor man's life. Stepping out onto the hot, dusty pavement, I went up to him and bought a coconut juice. He smiled in gratitude and was about to to go back to ringing the bell when I put my hand on his shoulder and motioned for him to stop. No more. 


&amp;nbsp;


Looking the poor fellow in the eyes, I told him:


&amp;nbsp;


”Yes, brother, yes you do ring it. Now please, just put down that bell and go take a break.""

&amp;nbsp;

The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says.

Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. 

Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""Hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""",A horse is sitting at home watching MTV...,295
