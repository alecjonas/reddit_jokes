The guy had it all; charisma, smarts, an herculean physique, and of course, a python for cock. One hour with him could easily cost six figures.

One day he receives a message about a client asking for his services. The client was a very rich, very old and very delicate lady who was about to kick the bucket. She was barely skin and bones, all her vitality and strength had left her in the passing of years and she looked like even a small breeze might end her.

She offered way, WAY more than what he usually received, but asked for the most extreme raunchiest sex that the man offered, full on BDSM that would even make porn actors blush. 

The Gigolo was obviously flabbergasted and worried. What if he killed her during the act? He could have been trialled for involuntary manslaught after all. So he rejected the offer, but then the old lady doubled down, offering him what he usually would have made in ten years of work. 

Incapable of saying no to such offer the man accepted with the condition of payment in advance and legal counsel in case anything happened to her.

So he goes to her place, in full latex gear and ready to give her the pounding of her life. At first he starts slowly, everybody needs time to get ready after all but not matter how much foreplay he did or how much lube he added she always felt painfully dry and tight, and ultimately and with his cock about to bleed the Gigolo rethinks her offer and decides to stop, returning to her the cash she paid.

The old lady gets all teary eyes and speaks about how she feels alone, how she doesn't has any family and how her riches never brought her any real happiness and ultimately doubles her initial offer, so the Gigolo ends thinking about it and decides to meet her the next day, to give his cock at least some time to recover.

The following day the same happens, even more painfully than before. Regardless of how much lube or foreplay he added it was never enough and she was tighter than gordian knot and drier than the devil's asshole so the Gigolo once more ended backing down, this time with his cock incredibly sore and filled with blisters.

The Gigolo was in the verge of tears from the pain but it was her the one who ended crying her heart out, saying how every day she was afraid it would be her last and how she wanted to be happy one more time before she died. And to further convince the Gigolo she triplicated the offer, giving him enough cash to lavishly retire...so with the idea of living away from clients like her the Gigolo ended giving her one final opportunity.

The next day started as usual, lube, foreplay and then penetration, but this time the sex was incredible, hell they fucked for hours and he didn't even needed to add more lube the following times, she was incredibly wet and continued being so for the duration of the entire day. 

At the end they both fell on the bed exhausted, the old lady had a great smile on her face and so did the Gigolo for he was now a multi-billionaire. Happy with his performance the Gigolo started dressing up but before heading out he asked the old lady something that he was wondering and he wanted to do it now for she might be dead tomorrow.

""I was wondering, how's that the other times I couldn't fuck you and today it has been so easy and awesome?""

And she answers.

""Ho, ho, ho! The other days I was all crust, now its all pus!""

 ","So, there was the best Gigolo in all of Hollywood.",0

She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

She fainted.”",My first time with a condom,85

The bike looks better than a new one, although it is 10 years old. It's shiny and in mint condition.

He buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.

'Well, it's quite simple,' says the seller, 'whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome.It protects it from the rain, and he 
hands Joe a jar of Vaseline. 

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. 
Naturally, they take the bike there.

Just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, 'I have to 
tell you something about my family.

'When we eat dinner, we don't talk.

In fact, the FIRST person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.'

'No problem,' he says.. And in they go.

Joe is shocked.Right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.

In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks dirty dishes.

They sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.

As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.

He leans over and kisses Sandra.

No one says a word.

He reaches over and fondles her breasts. Nobody says a word.

So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table 
and screws her, right there in front of her parents.

His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.

He looks at her mom. She's got a great body too.

Joe grabs mom, bends her over the table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way but loose 
right there on the dinner table.

She has a big orgasm, &amp; Joe sits down.

His girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, &amp; Mom is beaming from ear to ear. But still ... . Total silence.

All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.

Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.

Suddenly the father shouts.

Now, the Centurions were paid one gold coin per month. That would mean their new pay was a gold coin and 4 silver ones. The total fee spent would be 1000 gold coins and 4000 silver coins.

At the end of the month, the Emperor let the Centurions in the Imperial Treasury. He expected each Centurion to take exactly what he deserved.

However, the silver coins were not touched at all. Instead, 4000 aditional golden coins were taken.

Infuriated, the Emperor ordered all the Centurions to come to him. In an angry tone, he asked why they took more than they deserved.

One Centurion opened his mouth.

""Did you know, if you jump out of this window that the air pressure gets so great by the 10th floor you'll get sucked straight back into the window at the 9th.""

The 2nd guy replies:

""No way, that's bullshit.""

First guy says 

""I'm telling you it's true...""

2nd guy replies:

""OK, Prove it. Jump out, if you make it back up here I'll buy you a drink.""

First guy:

""OK, you got a deal.""

He opens the window and without hesitation, jumps out. 

The 2nd guy panics and runs over, but it's to late... The first guy is already plummeting down to the ground. 

He passes the 50th, 40th, 30th, 20th, floors and would you know it... Just as he predicted, he is sucked into the window on the 9th.

He catches the elevator back up to the 57th floor, goes to the bar with a big smug smile on his face and says to the 2nd guy:

"" Double Whiskey, straight on the rocks.""

The 2nd guy can't believe his eyes... He buys the drink but is convinced that he has been swindled. He says:

""That was a set up... Or a fluke... Do it again... And I'll buy you 2 drinks.""

The first guy laughs, and replies:

""OK, No problem. I'm telling you it's physics, no luck or trickery involved here. Just watch.""

He walks confidently over to the window (wobbling slightly from alcohol) and jumps out. 

The 2nd guy is looking with intent, sure he will find out what's going on and how the trick works. 

The first guy plummets towards the ground again, He passes the 50th, 40th, 30th, 20th, floors and would you know it...  he is sucked into the window on the 9th yet again.

He catches the elevator back to the 57th floor and walks in, smugger than before. Yells over to the bartender:

""2 double whiskeys, on the rocks."" 

The bartender shakes his head in dismissal, but poor the drinks. 

The guy then stumbles over to the 2nd and says. 

""Now do you believe me... Go on, give it a go, it's exciting... Tell you what, I'll get you 3 drinks if you do it."" 

The 2nd guy is hesitant... But having watched it been done twice with a very watchful eye.. Figures, he can't argue with science and decides to give it a shot. 

He tentitevely walks over to the window, sits upon the ledge... 

The first guys is stood by his side and cheers:

""Go on! You can do it!"" 

With that, the 2nd guy jumps. Screaming and terrified as he falls towards the ground at terminal velocity...  

He is hurling towards the street, He passes the 50th, 40th, 30th, 20th, 10th, 9th, 8th, 7th, 6th, 5th, 4th, floor... 

The man is screaming, petrified for his life. 

""OH GOD I'M. GOING TO DIE!! HEEEEELP!!!!!!."" 

He zooms past the 3rd... 2nd... Floor... He is headed face first for the curb... 

Suddenly the first guy appears from nowhere and catches him... 

The guy, still terrified but now puzzled and in disbelief. Overjoyed that he was saved... 

"" How.... How did you do that!?"" 

The first guy replies (still tipsy and slurring) ... 

""I owe you 3 drinks."" 

They catch the elevator to the 57th floor and walk into the bar.. 

The first guy says:

""I'll have a double whiskey and this guy will have 3.""

The 2nd guy is traumatised from the experience he just went through... Shaking in the corner of the bar.

However, just to be sure, the men formulated a plan to investigate what the country was like personally before making their final decision.

The plan went like this. Ron would take a vacation to the Soviet Union to see what life there was really like. Once he tested the waters, he would send a letter to John describing his experience there and whether they should emigrate or not. If the USSR was a communist paradise, Ron would write his letter using black ink to indicate he was telling the truth. If not, and the American reports turned out to be true, Ron would write the same letter in red ink, indicating that whatever he wrote was not to be trusted.

A few months later, John checked his mailbox and was ecstatic to find that his friend had sent his first report! Eagerly, John tore open the envelope and held the yellowed paper, his hands trembling. He took a deep breath and read the black ink:

&amp;#x200B;

*""Dear John,*

*I am so happy here! The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is truly a beautiful country, with a high standard of living and complete economic and political freedom! Comrade Stalin himself greeted me here when I arrived, and I was so honored to meet such a glorious and wonderful leader!*

*The capitalist American press lied about everything! The communism is so much better than what we have back home! All products are readily available! There is only one small thing of which there is a shortage: Red ink.*

The whole block was scattered with two-story brick houses and perfectly manicured lawns. Each house had their own garage, and a car parked in the driveway. I was living the dream. 

One early morning, I was showering when I heard the doorbell ring. I put a towel on and answered the door. It was my neighbor, a very beautiful asian woman, asking for a cup of sugar. I told her to wait, as I ran to the kitchen to fulfill her request. When I delivered the goods, she thanked me, gave me a wink, and walked back home.

The next day, I was going through my normal routine, when the doorbell rang again. I was greeted by none other than my neighbor Mrs. Wong. This time she was wearing high heels, tight pants, and showing off a lot of cleavage. She said that her husband was at work, and she needed someone to help her move some furniture. Now, I’m a six foot tall, pale-skinned dude, that’s never been described as muscular. Nonetheless, I agreed to help. 

When I walked in her house, I noticed family pictures of her and her husband. She told me that he was a doctor and worked all the time. When he got home, he was too tired to help her do anything. So, we go upstairs and she tells me that according to proper *feng shui* the bedroom set needed to face the other wall. I started with the bed, and then a dresser, and finally the side tables. Mrs. Wong was a short and petite woman, and as a result, not very helpful. So after I moved the last piece, I passed out from exhaustion on the bed. A few moments later, she was on top of me, kissing me passionately. It was the best sex I ever had, but when I left, I knew it could never happen again.

Come to find out a short time later, she was pregnant. I suspected the child was mine, but the couple was so happy, I could not say a word. They had a boy, and I watched him grow up from across the street. From time to time, I would kick the soccer ball around with him, or even help him learn to ride a bike.

One day, I was outside and Dr. Wong pulled into the driveway. As he got out of the car, he walked up to me and started a conversation. He told me that he appreciated the time I spent with his son and then he said, “I have a confession.”

“I know that you slept with my wife,” he said, “After our boy started to grow up, I became suspicious of his light complexion. A few months ago, I worked up the courage to ask my wife and she confessed everything. She told me that she slept with you, but there never was an affair. Regardless, I was so mad, I bought a gun, and to be honest, almost shot you dead one day that you were out here mowing the lawn.

“Oh my God,” I shouted, “What changed your mind?”

“Well,” he said, “my grandfather always told me that ‘two Wongs don't make a white’.”",About a year ago I moved into a really nice neighborhood.,1

Some of his advisors give great ideas like raising the taxes, establishing trade routes or etc. But the queen has a better idea. She says:

""You know the only bridge across the river? You should put a guard there, and he can collect money from the citizens passing, a small fee for using the bridge.""

The king doesn't like the idea at first, because that is the only bridge connecting the both sides of a huge river, and that river cuts his kingdom in two from the middle. His subject use the bridge fairly often, and he is afraid it might cause an uprising.

Yet, the kingdom is in dire need and he has no other option than accepting.

Days pass, and everyday first thing in the morning king asks his court if anyone spoke up about the bridge fee, yet no one did.

However, bad news come as even though queens idea helped, they needed just as more if they wanted the kingdom to sustain itself. Needless to say, queen had another idea:

""Why don't you put 2 guards at each side of the bridge, so they can collect money once they enter the bridge and once they exit it.""

""This is unacceptable!"" King yells at first, but none of his advisors can come up with a better plan. This time, king is sure and terrified that an uprising is on the way, but he has no other option than accepting.

Again, days pass, and everyday first thing in the morning, king asks his court if there is any news from the bridge.

To kings suprise, still no one complained. As time passed, the king was no longer terrified, but was furious. How could his subjects be such cowards that couldn't even speak up about this? With a momentary anger, he issues a new order:

""Put a third guard at the bridge, this time in the middle, and he will bend whoever passes by and fuck them""

It is not up to the court to question their king's will, so they comply.

Days pass, with each day king asking for news from the bridge. They still had the same income, but no one complained. King was furious that his subject were okay with being fucked for passing a bridge, so he gathers some of his men and his court and marches on to a nearby village.

He gathers every man and woman to the villages center, and with a scolding voice he starts yelling:

""Does no one have anything to say about this months events? Is anyone going to complain?""

He looks at the crowd, they are shivering in fear, and are obviously not going to say anything. This time, with a softer and calmer voice he calls out:

""Whoever speaks up, do not worry, you will not be harmed, you have my word.""

A weak voice can be heard from the crowd: ""Y...your majesty?""

King is finally relieved that someone is going to speak up to him. ""Go on?"" he says.

""Y...you know about the guard thats in the middle of the bridge?""

King is excited. ""Finally"" he thinks, and says: ""Yes? What about him?""

The man continues, still visibly shivering:

""Can you put a second guard in the middle, your majesty? It gets very crowded and has a very long queue in the afternoons.""",A small kingdom's treasure is running low and the king asks his court for advice.,3

post,9hw043,2qh72,jokes,false,1537580478,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9hw043/naval_history_lesson/,self.jokes,,"Long ago, when ships sailed the oceans, a captain would fill a box with maps and navigation charts, and other tools necessary for warfare on the high seas. In preparation for battle, he would call to his first mate to bring him his ""War Chest"". 

Once, a merchant ship was captured by surprise at night, at the hands of a band of hungry pirates. The pirates' fearsome captain had his men line up the chain of command, starting with the merchant ship's captain. 

""What use do I have for ye, save from feedin' ya' to me starvin' crew?"" He boomed at the other captain. 

The captain didn't answer quick enough, and was cut down by the bloodthirsty pirate in front of his own men. 

The pirate captain continued down the line in this fashion, slaying every member of the chain of command, until he came to the ship's cook. 

""I'll fix your men a feast fit for kings!"" The cook blurted out before the tyrant could even pose his deadly query. 

""That so?"" The pirate was intrigued, and after a quick glance at the bodies on deck, made his reply: ""I'd say me boys can busy 'emselves fer about... three days, on this lot. Ye be the captain o' this vessel now, so it'd be beneficial to yer men that ye make good on that feast, lest they suffer the same fate!"" 

Immediately, the new captain set to work, moving into the old captain's quarters and ordering his men around, instructing them on preparation of the finest meals in his repertoire. Being a pacifist, when he came upon the War Chest, he found few of it's contents useful, so he re-stocked it with his best herbs, spices, and sauces. 

Finally, the day of the feast arrived, and his men were scurrying about, bringing him every dish to approve before serving to their captors. 

A hush fell over the crew, when the cabin boy brought up the most important dish to be taste tested: a stew meant for the pirate's captain. 

The cook/captain sipped from his spoon, but something was off about this stew, it needed something. 

Suddenly, he snapped his fingers, directed at the cabin boy, ""Quick! Fetch me my War Chest!"" 

The cabin boy was shocked at this course of action. Had his lack of flavor in a stew suddenly doomed his entire ship to a watery grave? 

He stammered, ""War Chest? Are you sure, sir?"" 

And thus, a new condiment was born. ",Naval History Lesson,4

He pulls the string, carefully takes his aim, calms his breath and shoots... whoooosh, the arrow cuts the air in an instant and goes right into the forehead of the king, splitting the skull and killing the poor ruler.

To him, the nun is one of the best looking women he has ever seen. Being the straightforward guy he is, the hippy walks up and asks, “Hey, wanna have sex?”  The nun, shocked, smacks him in the face, and gets off at the next stop. 

When the hippy goes to get off the driver turns to him and says, “Hey you, you know that nun? She goes up to the cemetery every Sunday at midnight and prays to her dead friend, to honor him. If you go there and pretend to be a ghost, you could get her to have sex with you as the best way to “honor” him.” The hippy, bewildered, thanks the bus driver and gets off thinking, “That seems strange... but awesome!”

Sunday rolls around and the hippy dresses up as a ghost and goes the cemetery. Sure enough, at midnight the nun comes and kneels by a grave. The hippy sneaks over in the dark, and jumps out from behind the grave, and exclaims, “Ooooh I’m the ghost of your best friend, I command you to have sex with me in order to honor my memory!” 

The nun is shocked but says, “Oh.... sure. But I swore an oath to virginity, so it will have to be anal.” 
The hippy thinks, “Sweeeeeet”, and the two go at it over night.

The next morning the hippy jumps up and runs off yelling, “Hahaha it was actually meeeee!!”
The nun shouts back, “Hahahah it was actually me, the bus driver.”

He goes to the roof of the tallest building he knows and prepares himself to jump. As he reaches the peak and is about to take a leap he spots a man on the ground with no arms dancing franticly with joy, I mean this guy just looks crazy happy. The man decides this is a sign, I must go and ask him what's his secret for obtaining so much joy. 

The man makes his way down. He approaches the man with no arms who is still dancing like a maniac. He asks him ""hey buddy, I've got one arm and I am so down that I want to take my own life, you have no arms and are dancing with joy, what's your secret?""

“Wow, if I move down 3 inches I will feel the cool mist of the lake and feel refreshed.”


A freshwater carp was in the lake thinking...

“If that fly moves down three inches, I will jump up and swallow the fly.”


A bear was watching this hidden by bunch of trees and thought...

“If that fly moves down three inches, that fish will jump for the fly! I will then use the opportunity to take the fish for myself.”


A hunter was preparing a cheese sandwich across the lake. He was tentatively watching this whole ordeal from across the lake summarised this and concluded in his head with the thoughts.....

“If that fly moves down three inches, that carp will jump, the bear will go for the fish and expose itself. I will shoot the bear and have a nice meat sandwich.”


If this wasn’t enough a mouse was hiding by the hunters feet and thought...

“If that fly moves down three inches the fish will eat the fly, the bear eat the fish and the hunter will stand to shoot the bear dropping the sandwich.”


Amongst the chaos a cat was watching the mouse from further away and thought....

“If that fly moves down three inches the fish will eat the fly and the bear will eat the fish and the hunter will shoot the bear dropping the sandwich and the mouse will eat the sandwich. I will use this opportunity to pounce upon this little mouse and have a nice lunch.”

And then it happened


The fly went closer to the lake.

The fish jumped and ate the fly.

The bear ran out of its hiding spot and grabbed the fish.

The hunter stood up for a clearer shot and sniped the bear, dropping his cheese sandwich.

The mouse grabbed the sandwich and ran.

The cat stalked the mouse until it stopped nearby the lakeside. 

The cat ***jumped***.

The mouse ducked its head to eat the sandwich.

The cat overshot and fell into the lake drowning itself.


Moral of this story....

***If a fly moves down three inches, a pussy’s in trouble.***",A fly was sitting near a lake on a hot day........ [long],2

IRS Agent: ""Mr. Smith, we have noticed some large discrepancies on your account. We would like for you to come down to our office so that we can clear this issue up.""

Mr Smith: ""Gee, that sounds like a big deal. Should I bring a lawyer?""

IRS Agent: ""That probably wouldn't be a bad idea, Mr. Smith.""

Mr. Smith: ""Okay, I can be there at 9AM on Monday.""

IRS Agent:  ""Perfect, we will see you then.""

Monday comes and Mr. Smith is at the IRS office with his lawyer.

IRS agent: ""Good morning, Mr. Smith. We have noticed some large fluctuations in your account. As little as $5000 and as much as $100,000. Can you explain this? Are you a gambler?""

Mr. Smith: ""No, sir. I'm not a gambler per se, but I will bet on anything.""

The IRS agent is thoroughly confused by this.

Mr. Smith: ""Sir, I can see you are puzzled by what I just said. Allow me to show you what I mean.""

IRS Agent: ""Okay""

Mr. Smith: ""I will bet you $5000 that I can bite my own eyeball.

The IRS agent thinks about it for a minute, and checks Mr. Smiths' bank statements. ""$5000?""

Mr. Smith: ""Yes.""

IRS Agent: ""Deal.""

Mr Smith shakes the agents hand, stands up, and smacks himself on the back of his head and his eyeball pops out. He then puts the fake eye in his mouth and bites it.

The IRS agent is PISSED. 

IRS Agent: ""That's not fair! You set me up!""

Mr. Smith: ""Okay, sir how about double or nothing that I can bite my other eye?""

IRS Agent looks around the room for a second and thinks to himself ""He didn't come in with a dog, he doesn't have a cane, and his layer was not assisting him when he walked in.""

IRS Agent: ""Double or nothing? $10,000?.

Mr. Smith: ""Yes, sir.""

IRS Agent: ""Okay.""

They shake hands again. 

Mr Smith stands up, grabs his false teeth and jams them into his other eye socket.

IRS agent is turning beet red at this point.

Mr. Smith: ""I'm sure by this point, sir, you are very upset. I will pose you one last bet if you wish.""

IRS Agent: ""Well then, lets hear it.""

Mr. Smith: ""I will bet you triple or nothing that I can stand in that corner by your desk, put your trashcan in the opposite corner, and piss into the can without spilling a drop. $30,000. Triple or nothing.""

IRS agent thinks ""No way in hell he will win this one, that's physically impossible!""

IRS Agent: ""You're on!""

They shake hands for the last time.

Mr. Smith stands up, and his lawyer helps him to the corner. The Lawyer takes the trash can and puts it across the room. Mr. Smith drops his pants and start peeing ALL OVER the IRS Agents' desk.

IRS Agent: ""I knew it there was no way in hell you could do that one!"" And he starts dancing around the office. He notices the lawyer is sitting in the chair with his hands over his face, and it looks like he's crying.

IRS Agent: ""What's you damn problem? I just won $30,000!""

Stunned and confused, the owner doesn’t quite know how to respond, but asks the pianist to play more, as he still couldn’t resist the allure of his music. Again, the pianist plays wonderfully, and the owner is yet again wooed and awestruck by the pianist’s mastery of his instrument.

The pianist bluntly retorts, “Ahh, yes, this one is called ‘I Fucked Her Till She Couldn’t Fuck No More’ - it’s one my favorite originals!”

The owner, baffled by the contradicting beauty of the pianist’s playing set against his vulgar titles, gingerly awards the pianist with the gig, but on one condition. “Keep the titles to yourself,” he says. “I’m not sure that the audience will find them as pleasing as your playing...”

A week later, the pianist arrives for his first gig and begins to perform. The customers are so swept up in the beauty of his music-making they can hardly focus on their food. After a while, the pianist takes a quick break and heads to the bathroom amongst the cheering and clapping of his satisfied audience.
