They could barely walk anywhere without some hot blonde in a bikini biting her lip and smiling at Donnie while she looked him up and down. By the end of the day Donnie had five of their numbers.

That night, after a few drinks, Jimmy finally has enough and asks Donnie ""what's the deal, man? I'm as good looking as you, but for some reason all of the girls all day were throwing themselves at you all day and completely ignoring me. Am I really that ugly?""

""No, man,"" Donnie replied. ""This is a little embarrassing, but I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. When I go to the beach, what I do is I put a banana in my swimsuit. Girls can't keep their eyes off of me. That's it.""

""That's it?"" Jimmy says, aghast. ""It's so simple!""

""Try it tomorrow."" Donnie suggests, ""and let's see who can get the most numbers. I bet you'll win.""

So the next day, they split up and go back to the beach. Jimmy slips the banana in his swimsuit and starts to stroll down the beach, smiling at all of the ladies along the way. To his surprise, the chicks all seem more repulsed with him than they did before. He gets looks of disgust, or gets laughed at by just about every girl he sees. A few girls even scream and run away from him as he tries to ask them for his number. 

Completely crestfallen, Jimmy meets up with Donnie later and explains to him what happened. 

""So what do you think happened?"" Jimmy asks.

Donnie looks Jimmy up and down. ""Oh...""

""What?""

I owe my life to him, because he took out so many of them. I remember, one of them was charging my Humvee and was a few feet away when the good private gunned him down. They caught on though, and sent an RPG at his car. He was the only survivor from his Jeep, but his legs never left. We soon got the damn Afghans on the retreat, and hauled ass to the nearest base to get Danny and many others fixed up. He survived with his arms, and was awarded many medals. When given the option to either be honorably discharged, or to serve as an officer. He chose the latter, and was given the rank of Lieutenant. He went on to do many great things as a Lieutenant, but was cut short when his camp came under ambush and he was caught in the neck by a stray round.

She turned to the next one and asked what he did. He explained that as the captain he was responsible for everything on the airplane and the functioning of the crew. She turned to the first officer and asked ""Well young man, what is your job?""

Far away in the tropical waters of the Caribbean, two prawns were swimming around in the sea - one called Justin and the other called Christian.

The prawns were constantly being harassed and threatened by sharks that inhabited the area. Finally one day Justin said to Christian,

""I'm fed up with being a prawn, I wish I was a shark, then I wouldn't have any worries about being eaten.""

A large mysterious cod appeared and said, ""Your wish is granted"" and lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark.

Horrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by his old mate.

Time passed (as it invariably does) and Justin found life as a shark boring and lonely. All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them.

Justin didn't realise that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight.

While swimming alone one day he saw the mysterious cod again and he thought perhaps the mysterious fish could change him back into a prawn.

He approached the cod and begged to be changed back, and, lo and behold, he found himself turned back into a prawn.

With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes Justin swam back to his friends and bought them all a cocktail.

Looking around the gathering at the reef he realised he couldn't see his old pal.

""Where's Christian?"" he asked. ""He's at home, still distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy &amp; became a shark"", came the reply.

Eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture, he set off to Christian's abode. As he opened the coral gate memories came flooding back. He banged on the door and shouted, ""It's me, Justin, your old friend, come out and see me again.""

Christian replied, ""No way man, you'll eat me. You're now a shark, the enemy, and I'll not be tricked into being your dinner.""

Justin cried back ""No, I'm not. That was the old me. I've changed................

On the 50th birthday of the Supreme Dictator the Great Orchestra's performance is being guided by a new and young music director by the name of Saba Saging.

The whole concert is going well until Saging made the mistake of prompting the bassists too early on the second section of the third piece. A mistake of this magnitude only warranted death by means of the Supreme Dictator's favorite mode of execution: the electric chair.

Now despite being a dystopian society, the world still has it's share of principles. An example of this would be the practice of the last meal. On the day of Saba Saging's execution, the Supreme Dictator asks him what he would want for his last meal.

""It is my wish to consume a single ripe plantain."" answers Saging.

The Supreme Dictator grants him his request and as Saging is eating his plantain, he is seated in the electric chair and the lever is pulled. A burst of electricity surges into the chair but for some unknown reason... Saging is unharmed.

Ever the fatalistic person, the Supreme Dictator sees this as a sign that maybe the music director should be given another chance. And so, Saba Saging is a free man once again.

The next year comes and Saging is once again instructed to perform as music director for the Grand Orchestra's concert on the Supreme Dictator's birthday.

Everything is going well until Saging made the mistake of prompting the violinists too early on the third section of the fourth piece. A mistake of this magnitude only warranted death by means of the Supreme Dictator's favorite mode of execution: the electric chair.

On the day of Saba Saging's execution, the Supreme Dictator asks him again what he would like for his last meal.

""If the Supreme Dictator could grant me this final request, that is, I would like to eat a plantain, I know that once my time comes I shall be able to rest in peace.""

And so, just like the year before, the Supreme Dictator grants Saging his request. As the young music director was eating his plantain, he is seated in the electric chair and the lever is pulled. A burst of electricity surges into the chair but for some unknown reason... Saging remains unharmed.

Confounded and frustrated, the Supreme Dictator curses fate and lets Saging go once again.

Six months pass and the Supreme Dictator becomes mortally ill. On his deathbed he commands the Grand Orchestra to perform for one last time. Saba Saging, still the one leading the ensemble, proceeds to guide the band into its final and most spectacular performance.

Enraptured by the exquisite music, the Supreme Dictator is about to peacefully pass away when a jarring note comes from the misguided instruments of the trombone's group. Fury engulfs the Supreme Dictator and he orders that the whole orchestra be executed. However, Saba Saging screams with remorse and implores the Supreme Dictator to spare his band mates and only punish him.

Revitalized by a profound sense of purpose fueled by anger, the Supreme Dictator personally drags Saging into the electric chair and shoves him a whole bushel of plantains.

""EAT IT! EAT ALL OF IT!"" screams the Supreme Dictator.

And as Saging reluctantly accepts his fate he eats each plantain slowly one by one.

When Saging finally finishes the last piece of fruit, the Supreme Dictator, with a manic glint in his eyes, pulls the lever of the electric chair and lets out an exultant roar. He lets the electricity surge forth, never letting up until several hours pass.

Exhausted and feeling the creeping call of death, the Supreme Dictator crouches over Saging and checks to see if the music director was still. His eyes go wide with incredulity and shock.

""What sorcery is this?!"" the Supreme Dictator shouts. ""Does the plantain somehow provide you with invulnerability or immortality? Tell me! For my soul cannot rest with the fact that I have had the knowledge of how to defy death under my nose after all these years!""

Saba Saging, tired but unscathed, sits upright on the metal chair and sighs.

""Plantains have nothing to do with it."" he says, while looking sadly at the dying ruler.

""Then how?"" asks the Supreme Dictator, ever so closely treading the edge of death's threshold.

""I guess..."" Saba Saging sighs, ""After all these years, I'm still a bad conductor.""",In a parallel universe the world is ruled by a fascist government.,4

She immediately says, 'You better go tell Johnny everything is OK, the shit he just saw could scar him for life"". Dad rolls his eyes and begrudgingly agrees.

Just a little background/explanation behind this joke, it took me about two weeks to write. I was just interested in the idea that we may send a man there to look around for aliens or something. So I decided I wanted to write a joke about it hahaha! So what I did was, I took Europa and combinded it with Europeans. The words are very similar so it works. You'd think we come up with a new unique name but we used an already used name. OK if there are any more questions feel free to ask me, thanks!

The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story.

Little Suzy raises her hand. ""My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.""

When the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, ""Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.""

Little Lucy went next. ""My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.""

Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.

Lucy replied, ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch.""

Next up was little Johnny. ""My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""

The teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.

""Well,"" Johnny replied, ""Don't f**k with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.""",A LESSON IN MORALS,65

There is, however, a catch. As you open the door to any floor you may choose a man from that floor, but if you go up a floor, you cannot go back down except to exit the building. 

So a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband. 

On the first floor the sign on the door reads: 

Floor 1 - These men have jobs. 

The woman reads the sign and says to herself, ""Well, that's better than my last boyfriend, but I wonder what's further up?"" So up she goes. 

The second floor sign reads: 

Floor 2 - These men have jobs and love kids. 

The woman remarks to herself, ""That's great, but I wonder what's further up?"" And up she goes again. 

The third floor sign reads: 

Floor 3 - These men have jobs, love kids and are extremely good looking. 

""Hmmm, better"" she says. ""But I wonder what's upstairs?"" 

The fourth floor sign reads: 

Floor 4 - These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking and help with the housework. 

""Wow!"" exclaims the woman, ""very tempting. BUT, there must be more further up!"" And again she heads up another flight. 

The fifth floor sign reads: 

Floor 5 - These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak. 

""Oh, mercy me! But just think... what must be awaiting me further on?"" So up to the sixth floor she goes.

There's a cat waiting for the mouse and he sees the fly he says if the fly drops six inches the Frog will get the fly the fish will get the Frog the bird will get the fish the bear will get the bird the hunter will shoot the bear the mouse will grab the cheese and I will grab the mouse.

Sure enough the fly drops six inches frog eats the fly the fish eats the Frog The Bird eats the fish the bear eats the bird the hunter shoots the bear the mouse grabs the cheese and about the time the cat grabs the mouse the mouse moves and the cat runs straight into the water.

Moral of the story is every time a fly drops six inches a pussy gets wet",a frog is sitting on a Lilly pad,1

I am here to request a wide range of jokes about his foot. Clean jokes to dark jokes that I can pair with his mood.  I came up with two: 

My sister can run away and he can't catch her now.

They had a code of conduct which was being passed from one generation to the next verbally. 
All went well until they got into a war with a Samoan tribe (islanders who are 1000s of kms away) who were assisted by European missionaries. 
The Mao tribals defeated their enemies but most of the elders died. With them, most of the codes of  conduct were also lost. This lead to a  period of great strife and lawlessness in the Mao tribe that made the remaining elders sad. During this time, they also faced a lot of trouble from Christian missionaries trying to convert their people. 
These elders decided to form a new code of conduct and realised that it had to be permanently recorded to prevent any such mishaps in the future. 
For this purpose, they sent a bright youngster to the missionaries so that he can understand how they recorded law. This youngster learnt about scripts,  language, linguistics, paper, pen etc for a period of 5 years. He also learnt about weapons, the teachings of Christ, law etc.. He went back to his tribe armed with this knowledge and educated his fellows about what he learnt, especially the concept of book.
The Mao elders were overjoyed and felt that they can now develop a standardized code of conduct, that will maintain the equality and also prevent exploitation by the missionaries. They were also intrigued by the concept of a book. They asked the youngster to teach them and the rest of the villagers how to use one.
The youngster decided he would demonstrate to the villagers the concept and purpose of a script for a language. In this endeavour he chose a flat piece of wall that can act as his paper and moved forward with his pen, a piece of twig dipped in goat blood, to be used as ink.


He was promptly killed by some of the villager elders who happened to be left handed. 

Apparently the lefties couldn't digest the youngster leaning to write.","Long long ago, so long ago..",0

Soon he was invited to give a speech in his hometown.

He was embarrassed but regained his composure to deliver his paper. As he concluded, he raced out the stage door, never to be seen in his hometown again. 

Decades later when his elderly mother was ill, he returned to visit her. He reserved a hotel room under a false name, Solomon Levy, and arrived under cover of darkness. The desk clerk asked him, ""Is this your first visit to our city, Mr. Levy?""

Dr. Epstein replied, ""Well, young man, no, it isn't. I grew up here but then I moved away."" 

""Why haven't you visited?"" asked the desk clerk.

""I did visit once, many years ago, but an embarrassing thing happened and since then I've been too ashamed to return.""

The clerk consoled him. ""Sir, while I don't have your life experience, one thing I have learned is that often what seems embarrassing to me isn't even remembered by others. I bet that's true of your incident too.""

Dr. Epstein replied, ""Son , I doubt that's the case with my incident.""

post,4lb50z,2qh72,jokes,false,1464361465,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4lb50z/psycho_squirrel/,self.jokes,,"An oldie, but a goodie:

I never dreamed slowly cruising through a residential neighborhood could be so incredibly dangerous!

Studies have shown that motorcycling requires more decisions per second, and more sheer data processing than nearly any other common activity or sport. The reactions and accurate decision making abilities needed have been likened to the reactions of fighter pilots! The consequences of bad decisions or poor situational awareness are pretty much the same for both groups too.

Occasionally, as a rider I have caught myself starting to make bad or late decisions while riding. In flight training, my instructors called this being “behind the power curve”. It is a mark of experience that when this begins to happen, the rider recognizes the situation, and more importantly, does something about it. A short break, a meal, or even a gas stop can set things right again as it gives the brain a chance to catch up.

Good, accurate, and timely decisions are essential when riding a motorcycle…at least if you want to remain among the living. In short, the brain needs to keep up with the machine.

I had been banging around the roads of east Texas and as I headed back into Dallas, found myself in very heavy, high-speed traffic on the freeways. Normally, this is not a problem, I commute in these conditions daily, but suddenly I was nearly run down by a cage that decided it needed my lane more than I did. This is not normally a big deal either, as it happens around here often, but usually I can accurately predict which drivers are not paying attention and avoid them before we are even close. This one I missed seeing until it was nearly too late, and as I took evasive action I nearly broadsided another car that I was not even aware was there!

Two bad decisions and insufficient situational awareness…all within seconds. I was behind the power curve. Time to get off the freeway.

I hit the next exit, and as I was in an area I knew pretty well, headed through a few big residential neighborhoods as a new route home. As I turned onto the nearly empty streets I opened the visor on my full-face helmet to help get some air. I figured some slow riding through the quiet surface streets would give me time to relax, think, and regain that “edge” so frequently required when riding.

Little did I suspect…

As I passed an oncoming car, a brown furry missile shot out from under it and tumbled to a stop immediately in front of me. It was a squirrel, and must have been trying to run across the road when it encountered the car. I really was not going very fast, but there was no time to brake or avoid it—it was that close.

I hate to run over animals…and I really hate it on a motorcycle, but a squirrel should pose no danger to me. I barely had time to brace for the impact.

Animal lovers, never fear. Squirrels can take care of themselves!

Inches before impact, the squirrel flipped to his feet. He was standing on his hind legs and facing the oncoming Valkyrie with steadfast resolve in his little beady eyes. His mouth opened, and at the last possible second, he screamed and leapt! I am pretty sure the scream was squirrel for, “Banzai!” or maybe, “Die you gravy-sucking, heathen scum!” as the leap was spectacular and he flew over the windshield and impacted me squarely in the chest.

Instantly he set upon me. If I did not know better I would have sworn he brought twenty of his little buddies along for the attack. Snarling, hissing, and tearing at my clothes, he was a frenzy of activity. As I was dressed only in a light t-shirt, summer riding gloves, and jeans this was a bit of a cause for concern. This furry little tornado was doing some damage!

Picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a t-shirt, and leather gloves puttering maybe 25mph down a quiet residential street…and in the fight of his life with a squirrel. And losing.

I grabbed for him with my left hand and managed to snag his tail. With all my strength I flung the evil rodent off the left of the bike, almost running into the right curb as I recoiled from the throw.

That should have done it. The matter should have ended right there. It really should have. The squirrel could have sailed into one of the pristinely kept yards and gone on about his business, and I could have headed home. No one would have been the wiser.

But this was no ordinary squirrel. This was not even an ordinary pissed-off squirrel.

This was an evil attack squirrel of death!

Somehow he caught my gloved finger with one of his little hands, and with the force of the throw swung around and with a resounding thump and an amazing impact he landed square on my back and resumed his rather anti-social and extremely distracting activities. He also managed to take my left glove with him!

The situation was not improved. Not improved at all. His attacks were continuing, and now I could not reach him.

I was startled to say the least. The combination of the force of the throw, only having one hand (the throttle hand) on the handlebars, and my jerking back unfortunately put a healthy twist through my right hand and into the throttle. A healthy twist on the throttle of a Valkyrie can only have one result. Torque. This is what the Valkyrie is made for, and she is very, very good at it.

The engine roared as the front wheel left the pavement. The squirrel screamed in anger. The Valkyrie screamed in ecstasy. I screamed in…well…I just plain screamed.

Now picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a slightly squirrel torn t-shirt, and only one leather glove roaring at maybe 70mph and rapidly accelerating down a quiet residential street…on one wheel and with a demonic squirrel on his back. The man and the squirrel are both screaming bloody murder.

With the sudden acceleration I was forced to put my other hand back on the handlebars and try to get control of the bike. This was leaving the mutant squirrel to his own devices, but I really did not want to crash into somebody’s tree, house, or parked car. Also, I had not yet figured out how to release the throttle…my brain was just simply overloaded. I did manage to mash the back brake, but it had little affect against the massive power of the big cruiser.

About this time the squirrel decided that I was not paying sufficient attention to this very serious battle (maybe he is a Scottish attack squirrel of death), and he came around my neck and got IN my full-face helmet with me. As the faceplate closed partway and he began hissing in my face I am quite sure my screaming changed tone and intensity. It seemed to have little affect on the squirrel however.

The rpm’s on The Dragon maxed out (I was not concerned about shifting at the moment) and her front end started to drop.

Now picture the large man on the huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a very ragged torn t-shirt, and wearing one leather glove, roaring at probably 80mph, still on one wheel, with a large puffy squirrel’s tail sticking out his mostly closed full-face helmet. By now the screams are probably getting a little hoarse.

Finally I got the upper hand…I managed to grab his tail again, pulled him out of my helmet, and slung him to the left as hard as I could. This time it worked…sort-of. Spectacularly sort-of, so to speak.

Picture the scene. You are a cop. You and your partner have pulled off on a quiet residential street and parked with your windows down to do some paperwork.

Suddenly a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a torn t-shirt flapping in the breeze, and wearing one leather glove, moving at probably 80mph on one wheel, and screaming bloody murder roars by and with all his strength throws a live squirrel grenade directly into your police car.

I heard screams. They weren't mine...

I managed to get the big motorcycle under directional control and dropped the front wheel to the ground. I then used maximum braking and skidded to a stop in a cloud of tire smoke at the stop sign at a busy cross street.

I would have returned to fess up (and to get my glove back). I really would have. Really. But for two things. First, the cops did not seem interested or the slightest bit concerned about me at the moment. One of them was on his back in the front yard of the house they had been parked in front of and was rapidly crabbing backwards away from the patrol car. The other was standing in the street and was training a riot shotgun on the police cruiser.

So the cops were not interested in me. They often insist to “let the professionals handle it” anyway. That was one thing. The other? Well, I swear I could see the squirrel, standing in the back window of the patrol car among shredded and flying pieces of foam and upholstery, and shaking his little fist at me. I think he was shooting me the finger…

That is one dangerous squirrel. And now he has a patrol car…

I took a deep breath, turned on my turn-signal, made an easy right turn, and sedately left the neighborhood.

As for my easy and slow drive home? Screw it. Faced with a choice of 80mph cars and inattentive drivers, or the evil, demonic, attack squirrel of death...I’ll take my chances with the freeway. Every time.

And I’ll buy myself a new pair of gloves.",Psycho Squirrel,0

This goes on for days and then one day the lion king decides to hold a secret meeting to ensure their survival. So he gets the giraffes to round up all the animals they can find in a hidden spot. 

Thousands of animals gather for the meeting. The king lion steps up and says ""As you all know by now, a group of humans have invaded our jungle with guns and are killing us all. We have gathered here to find a way to stay alive.""

The animals think and debate for a long time, trying to find out a way to escape the hunters, but in vain. Finally, an old chameleon who was listening from a tree asks a nearby monkey ""Whats all the commotion?"" 

""Humans are hunting the animals and birds, we are trying to find a way to survive."" says the monkey.

Being a kind creature, the chameleon decides to help. He imparts his wisdom about blending in to the animals and birds. All the animals thank him and decide to go hide in places where they blend in. 
The lions go hide in the tall dry grass, the rhinos hide among the huge gray rocks, the monkeys climb high up in the trees, the polar bear goes back to arctic circle, the hippos blend in with the mud and so on.

This plan works good as the hunters search the trees, grasslands, mountains and the waters but don't find much. Days of silence follows and the animals stay under cover as planned. After few days some shots were heard, but nothing else followed for weeks. The animals hold on tight to their camouflage, not wanting to risk their lives.  
 
Finally a month later, without getting much action, the hunting crew packs up their things and leaves the jungle. The monkeys and birds high up in the tree tops see this and spread the news about the departure. All the animals rejoice and the king decides to have a party to celebrate their survival. 

Soon, the elephants are sounding the trumpets, monkeys are dancing and the birds are singing. All animals party hard. Amidst the celebration, the king lion notices that few of his brothers were missing. So he summons the minister tiger and enquirers about them. 
The tiger, with his head hung down says, ""The cheetahs tried to blend in the sandy mountains...""

He said he and my grandmother were driving down a long and dusty back road, sun beating down on a hot summers day.

When all of a sudden, they  see an elderly lady walking a long the back road. Puzzled, my Grandfather pulls over to see if she's alright.

'Excuse me ma'am, are you ok' my grandfather asks.

'I'm fine sonny, I just got a little lost walking to the shops' she replies.

'Well you're going in the complete wrong direction, the shops are about 10 miles here. It's a long way to walk for yourself and that heavy suitcase, how about we give you a lift?' He queries.

She agrees and gets into their car clutching her suitcase.

She and my Grandmother exchange pleasantries and begin chatting.

They talk about all manner of things, knitting, church, their grandchildren. Anything that comes to mind.

My Grandmother being the curious type that she is, noticed that the elderly woman was holding her suitcase very tightly.

'If you don't mind me asking, what's in the suitcase?' My Grandmother asked.

'I do mind you cunt. It's none of your fucking business' she snaps.

Grandpa said he and Grandma were taken aback by her comment, but she was old and she may have dementia or something similar. They decide to leave it alone and not confront her.

After a few miles of awkward silence my Grandfather decides to chirp up.

'So, you have a favourite football team?' He cautiously asked.

'Why yes I do sonny, I'm a 49ers fan through and through. How about you darling?' She sweetly surprised.

My Grandparents were amazed at her turn around, she was a sweet old lady again.

The elderly lady and my Grandfather talk football for miles.

Her love of Jerry Rice, his love of the Cowboys; they actually had a lot in common.

He being the smart arse that he is decided to try his luck.

'Hey uh, what's in the suitcase?' He queried.

'I already told you dumb dog fuckers, nothing. If you ask me again I'll rip your  eyeballs out and shit down your eye sockets. It's none of your fucking business' she snapped once again.

Realising something was wrong, my grandparents realised they needed to get rid of this woman.

'Excuse me sir, I really need to go to the bathroom. Would you mind pulling over?' The elderly lady asked.

A prime opportunity.

As the elderly woman exits the car my grandfather drives off like a lunatic, speeding and swerving all over the road.

My Grandmother looks over where the old woman was sitting to see  she had left her suitcase in the car.

'Wow' I said to my Grandfather 'That's crazy' I continued.

'I know, craziest day of my life' he replied.

'So what was in the suitcase?' I asked.

'None of your fucking business' he replied.",My Grandfathers story,15

So she decided to contact Dr. Bumbutu to see if he could help her.
 
Dr. Bumbutu advised her, 'Every day after your shower, rub your chest and say, 'Scooby doobie doobies, I want bigger boobies!'  She did this faithfully for several months, and to her utter amazement she grew a terrific D-cup rack!
 
One morning she was running late, got on the bus, and in a panic realized she had forgotten her morning ritual. Frightened she might lose her lovely boobs if she didn't recite the little rhyme, she stood right there in the middle aisle of the bus, closed her eyes, and said, 'Scooby doobie doobies, I want bigger boobies.'
 
A guy sitting nearby looked at her and asked ' Are you a patient of Dr Bumbutu's?'
 
Yes I am.  How did you know?'
 
He winked and whispered, 'Hickory dickory dock...'

his marriage has been in the toilet for the last 3 years due to lack of sex   
his wife... Jill... has been out of shape since the baby   
 
she no longer has interest in her body or Johns 
 
But tonight!... is the night that all changes 
 
 
One week earlier John went to a sex shop called FUXXX and purchased an assortment of items for the night. 
 
whips, lubes, leather ski mask... rubber dick....good quaity rope 
 
 
John needed this night!... his boss was ramming his cock into johns ass at work (Figuratively)   
 
the stress of his job and his four year old spazz son Roger... made john have suicidal thoughts   
 
 
 
John pulls into the driveway with his car, A white 2004 Mazda Miata Convertible 
 
 
so excited to begin his night of sexual release ....he forgets to lock his car door 
 
 
Jill, in her pajamas at 7:30 on a friday, .. awaits John in the living room 
 
“How was your day at the office sweetie “ she says  
 
 
”Fucking horrible” John Replies   
 
John hates small talk 
 
 
“ I was thinking of spicing it up tonight, maybe we could go to the bedroom and perform oral sex” said John  
 
Jill replies “ I dont think so tonight John, my mouth is exhausted from talking on the phone all day with my sister” 
 
  
“I need this!” screamed John 
 
 
Jill... replies “ John! dont yell, you will wake up Roger!” 
 
 
 
“well you better get your ass in the bedroom” john whispered... sexily 
 
 
Jill... filled with doubt agrees to enter the bedroom 
 
 
 
She lays on the bed, on her back... in a un flattering pose.... she makes no attempt to suck in her bloated stomach 
 
 
 
John walks over to the dresser and lights a scented candle, Strawberry ice cream  
 
 
“Mmm” says Jill “ I love that smell” 
 
 
John smiles and thinks to himself “ thats because it reminds you of eating... your favourite thing to do”  
 
 
John takes off his Fruit of the Loom size medium boxers , and tank top 
 
 
“Oh ...is that a new tattoo?” says Jill 
 
 
“No?” says John  
 
 
 
John reaches for the leather whip and rope from the sex bag 
 
 
“im going to tie you up, but not that hard, just enough to leave a small bruise” John says 
 
 
“What!...Have you been drinking those whey protein shakes your brother gave you? Where is all this coming from” says Jill  
 
 John Yells..” Its coming from NOT! cuming”   
Johns brother owns a small mens health food store, mostly bullshit products.   
John hates his brother   
 
He ties Jills hands tightly with the rope. 
 
 
“Finally we can begin” he thinks to himself 
 
 
John slowly removes Jills un flattering pajama pants... only to reveal more unflattering underwear 
 
“ I wear them for comfort” Jill replies 
 
 
Jill has a small tattoo of her first husbands name, Craig ....Below her hip 
 
 
it always bothered John to see another mans name so close to his wifes vagina  
 
thankfully one positive of her weight gain, her gut now covers most of the tattoo. 
 
only the letter G is visible. 
 
 
John so filled with lust and wanting, lunges his mouth on Jills un shaved crotch beard 
 
 
“OOOOHHHH” says Jill.. in excitement  
 
 
a feint taste of urine enters John’s mouth 
 
John immidiately changes his mind and grabs the whip 
 
“ Bend over” says John 
 
Jill turns over to reveal her frumpy cottage cheese like ass 
 
john begins to whip her, alot  
 
swap! swap! swap! 
 
 
with each hit his erection grows harder 
  
John thinks to himself “ I can’t believe this is finally happening” 
 
 
 
it has been a long time since john felt boner blood enter his penis  
 
 
Jill... now spanked to a pulp... her ass now resembling old hamburger meat   
 
John...Nude and at maximum Girth.... adorns his head with the leather ski mask   
 
“wow... you look so much like a killler rapist” says Jill 
 
 
 
‘I ordered it from a Japenese website” John says 
 
 
he squirts lemom flavored lube on his Dick Howard 
 
His genitals now so wet and shiny 
 
 
John begins to Laugh Loudly...and yells “ I Feel Like a GOD!” 
 
 
So drunk with sexual power he goes back to the bag of items he purcahsed earlier... 
 
He reaches into the bag to grab the Dildo... to DF Jill... ( Double Fuck) 
 
He then realizes how much larger the rubber cock is to his own and becomes slightly insecure ... he changes his mind and drops it on the floor 
 
It bounces twice 
 
 
“What was that?” says Jill 
 
 
John doesn’t respond 
 
 
 
John jump’s on the bed, on top of Jill... Missionary position.  
 
 
 “ Mmmm, I want it now ” says Jill   
 
John Replies “ When I’m ready Bitch!” 
 
John’s eyes so wide and asshole puckering with sweat, slowly moves in closer to Jill. 
 
 
John begins to line up his hang down... soo ready for the great plunge... so long since he had felt the pleasure of the moist clam...  
 
“I’m gonna fuck you like a Fat Biker at a whore house!” John yells with such happiness 
 
He hasn’t felt this good in years. 
 
 
out of now where the bedroom door opens! 
 
and he hears a strange voice behind him....   
 
“Mommy I can’t sleep!” says Roger ( The idiot Son) 
 
Jill immediately pushes John off of her and starts to soothe the child.. 
 
they both walk out of the bedroom and head to the kitchen for a warm glass of soy milk 
 
 
John in complete shock, lays on the bed....mouth open....and cock pointing straight to the ceiling  
 
 
“ why do you hate me god? why the fuck do you hate me!!” screams John 
 
 
A few minutes later Jill walks back into the room, She tells John that Roger had a bad nightmare. 
 
She is going to lay down with him until he falls asleep. She tells John to not wait up... it could be awhile 
 
John.. so fucking pissed off and unfulfilled, yells out he’s going for a drive.  
 
he wraps a towel around his now worthless erection and heads for the front door. 
 
“ Don’t be such a baby!” says Jill from the other room 
 
John tries to think of a come back to say to the bitch.... but can’t.  
 
 
He walks out to the driveway, with only the towel covering him.. and gets into the car 
 
he starts up the engine and begins to drive towards the King Henry Bridge 
 
 
John starts to play the song “ Knockin on Heavens Door” from his blue iPod shuffle 2GB   
A tear slowly falls from john’s eye to his cheek... the vibration of the car seat on his swollen blue balls... a reminder of the complete failure of the night  
 
 
He gets onto the bridge.... and slams his foot down on the gas pedal.   
“FUCK THIS WORLD” He screams    
John closes his eyes and lets go of the steering wheel.    
     
the car fly’s off the bridge and explodes at the bottom of the cliff.    
John is killed instantly   
       
after the funeral , Jill would later re connect with Craig, her first husband    
they dated for awhile but eventually that fell through   
     
she and Roger now live in Colorado in a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment   
 
Roger say’s he doesn’t remember much of his dad   
and Jill never did lose the weight. 
 
 
 
 
The end.
