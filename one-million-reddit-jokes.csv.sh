A few weeks after moving in, the two guys asked if they could come over and ride Elvira. I didn't see any reason why not, so they clambered up on her, both at the same time, and my wife and I walked her around the yard with them. 

Because they were so small, it was no problem at all for Elvira to carry the two of them. The only odd side effect was, because of their abnormally small size, Elvira looked even bigger than usual. It was honestly kind of comical.

I was home schooled because we live in the west and my father wanted me in an environment that was free from anything Haram. I couldn't associate with Jews or Christians, anyone who ate unclean animals, or any girl. As a teenage guy going through puberty this was naturally a living nightmare. After years of begging from me and pressure from his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anything Haram. Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Christian friends in a week, and within the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too hipster punk for me, listing to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Christians and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to whip it out for dad. It might be insane, but i actually am ok with dicks out for haram bae.

At the palace, there lived a certain Ahmed who was a low-ranking official. He took a liking to the queen, and his greatest desire was to kiss the queen's gorgeous breasts.

Once, he told Birbal, the emperor's minister about this secret desire. He also told him he'd do anything to touch the queen's breasts with his mouth. Birbal, who was a very cunning man, said the following:

'Look Ahmed, this isn't a small thing you're asking from me, but I'll help you! Obviously, it'll cost you some money. If you give me 500 gold pieces though, I'll arrange the whole thing and you'll be able to kiss the queen's breasts for three whole hours... without any consequences you should worry about!'

Ahmed was extremely happy about this. They agree that after the deed is done, Ahmed will pay Birbal 500 gold pieces. The next day, Birbal secretly put a special susbtance on the queen's bra that caused serious itching. The emperor then gathered his doctors (who had been bribed by Birbal beforehand) so they could establish the cause of the itching. After some time, the doctors gave their diagnosis to the emperor:

'This is a very dangerous disease that spreads at a horrendous speed! There's only one cure: a specific kind of human saliva. Unfortunately, there's only a single man whose saliva is suitable for the treatment in the whole of India: your humble servant and subject, Ahmed.'

The emperor immediatly summoned Ahmed and commanded him to heal the queen's breasts with his saliva. And thus it came to pass that Ahmed could fervently lick and suck and kiss the queen's breasts for three whole hours. After that time passed, he left the royals' presence with an otherwordly smile.

The next morning, Birbal came to his room to ask for his rightful payment. However, Ahmed announced that he wasn't really serious about those 500 gold coins, and that he didn't have that much money anyways.

But that was without counting with Birbal's revenge. The next day, Birbal smuggled that special substance into the emperor's underwear... and soon, Emperor Akbar summoned Ahmed...",Once upon a time...,108

Strong, tall, courageous, he was the ideal viking in every way, except for one.. 
See Benny couldn't grow a beard, for all his 30 winters on Earth, he still had just as smooth a face as the day he was born.
This bothered Benny, because when he was out pillaging, nobody took him serious.. Who is scared of a baby faced warrior that looks like he's 16?
The final straw for Benny just happened at the last raid his opponent laughed at him and asked the Vikings to send him a man instead of a boy.
Well Benny might have slain that warrior for his crass comment, but his confidence was beginning to fade. So that night, during the rioting, looting and pillaging, Benny got very, very drunk on mead and wandered out into a field. 
""ODIN!"" he yelled - ""Why have you forsaken me? I've been a loyal follower, I've fought in many battles in your name.. Why have you cursed me with this face?""
It may have been a trick of the light or the many horns of mead Benny had drunk, but Benny was surprised to hear an answer back..
""Benny! I have not forsaken you, why do you say such things?""
""Odin, how can I be a feared warrior when I cannot grow a beard? My opponents laugh at me and call me a child! I just wish to grow a beard like yours, one such that all will know me to be a man!""

""Very well"" Odin replied ""as you've been a good Viking, I will help you grow your beard... BUT!!!!  If you ever cut or shave, I will turn you into an urn!""

""Odin, I would never do that"" Benny replied ""All I've wanted my life is to serve you and look like a man!""
""So be it"" Odin ""but you have been warned..""
Benny passed out into a drunken sleep to awake the next morning..
When he awoke, he thought it all a dream.. until he rubbed his face and where once was smooth skin like a babies bottom was now.. Stubble?
""Yes Odin! Thank you! I will not forget our deal!""
By the end of the day, Benny had a respectable shadow on his face..
At the end of the week, Benny's beard had come in..
At the end of two weeks, Benny's beard had continued to grow and was now down to his chest.. 
His life was good, he had the respect of his fellow Vikings, his opponents feared him, and Benny had never been happier..
However, his beard continued to grow at an astonishing rate.. 
At the end of the third week, it had grown to his waist. 
His fellow Vikings were muttering about black magic behind his back..
At the end of the month, it was down to his knees, and in order to go into battle, he had to tie it around himself like a belt.
At the end of two months, he could no longer move without the assistance of a wheel barrow to carry his beard in front of him, he could not go into battle, and he his fellow Vikings were sure he was cursed..

Benny was despondent. He began to think to himself about how busy Odin must be.. How Odin couldn't possibly remember the agreement they had.. How Odin must have forgotten him, for how else would his beard have continued to grow so much..
Benny couldn't take it anymore.. He took his belt knife, grabbed his long beard and just as soon as his blade parted the first hair on his face...

**POOF!** Benny was turned into an urn..

'Last week I visited my wife's sister. There was no one around except her, and I took her and raped her right on the spot.'

'Oh son, that is indeed a great sin,' says the priest.

'That's all nothing, Father,' continues the man. 'The other day, my mother-in-law visited me. I was all alone at home, so I took her and raped her right on the spot as well!'

There's no answer from the other half of the confession booth. The man waits for a while, calls the priest, but he gets no reply. Finally, he opens the door of the priest's booth and sees the cleric hiding under the seat, trembling with fear.

'Father, what on earth are you doing?' asks the man.

To which the priest replies:

'I'd like a hamburger, fries and a Coke,' says the man, then turns towards the ostrich. 'And you?'

'The same', says the ostrich.

A few minutes later, the waitress brings the food and the bill.

'$6.40,' she says.

The man takes out the exact amount from his pocket without even counting the money and hands it to the waitress.

The next day, the man and the ostrich come again, ask for the same food and the man pays with the exact amount. And the same routine takes place for the next couple of days. On a Friday night, the man and the ostrich turn up again.

'The usual?' asks the waitress.

'No, today's Friday, I'd like a steak and some crushed potatoes,' says the man, then he turns towards the ostrich. 'And you?'

'The same,' replies the bird.

After a few minutes, the waitress comes back with the order and the bill.

'$32.50'

The man, yet again, takes out the exact amount of money without counting it. The waitress can't help herself at this point and asks:

'Excuse me sir, but please tell me... how come you always have the exact amount?'

'Years ago, I cleaned up my attic and found an old lamp. I rubbed it and a genie appeared. He promised me two wishes. My first wish was to have the exact amount of money in my pockets whenever I had to pay for something.'

'That's brilliant!' says the waitress. 'Others would've asked for a million dollars, but you'll stay rich till the end of your life.'

'Indeed,' nods the man. 'It doesn't matter whether I want to buy a bottle of beer or a Rolls Royce, the money will always be there when I need it.'

'Can I also ask why this ostrich is always with you?'

But this time, I shook it off.
""Sticks and stones can break my bones but words will never hurt me!""
The bullies didn't know how to react, and left me alone for the remainder of the day. I won!
The next I returned and walked past the bullies, cracking the faintest of smiles.

Nightfall was rapidly approaching and he had nowhere to sleep. He went up to a farmhouse and asked the farmer if he could spend the night.
The farmer told him that he could sleep in the barn.
As the story goes, the farmer's daughter asked her father. ""Who is that man going into the barn?""
The daughter said, ""Perhaps he is hungry."" So she prepared a plate of food for him and then took it out to the barn.
About an hour later, the daughter returned. Her clothing dishevelled and straw in her hair. Straight up to bed she went.
The farmer's wife was very observant. She then suggested that perhaps the man was thirsty. So she fetched a bottle of wine, took it out to the barn, and she too did not return for an hour. Her clothing was askew, her blouse buttoned incorrectly. She also headed straight to bed.
The next morning at sunrise the man in the barn got up and continued on his journey, waving to the farmer as he left.
When the daughter awoke and learned that the visitor was gone, she broke into tears. ""How could he leave without even saying goodbye,"" she cried. ""We made such passionate love last night!""
""What!"" shouted the father as he angrily ran out of the house looking for the man, who by now was halfway up the mountain.
The farmer screamed up at him, ""I'm going to get you! You had sex with my daughter!""

First of all, my boss is a vicious tyrant who gets off on the petty torments he puts me through day in and day out, and I'm too spineless to stand up to him, so I just take it and I've gradually come to hate myself for it. Also, every morning I wake up to the same prune-face old crone to whom I pledged my vows so many years ago. I used to love her, but that love has become like some sun-festering beached whale trying to die. We lost our daughter last year to one of the bitterest, coldest winters we've ever had to face in this region. Isn't it funny, doc, how all the prayer circles and charity drives in the world amount to pretty much nothing in the face of that cold, impartial face of winter, that bleak, pounding, harsh fist of a callous environment, carrying on with its machinations without regard to our lives, loves, hopes and dreams? Isn't that hysterical, Doc? Oh and then there's my son. Doc, I don't love him anymore. I don't know what it is but I look in his eyes and I see that same harried look of gutless cowardice that I see when I stare at my own face in the mirror. If I wasn't such a coward, Doc, I know I'd be able to scrape together enough pride to grab that cocked and loaded shotgun I keep by the bedside table, and just run amok and put an end to this grim facade once and for all. I start with the wife, then the boy of course before putting the barrell in my own mouth. Believe you me, Doc, I'd be doing the world a favor. I have nothing to look forward to but a continuation of this spiraling black hole that is my life, this existential cesspool that is the perpetuation of my lingering skid-mark on society. I despise people yet I crave their approval. I'm judgemental yet I care about nothing. I'm bitter, hateful and afraid. I'm alive yet I feel like the walking dead. This is it, Doc: I am a living, breathing, disease.""



The doctor stares at him for a while then finally says ""Jeez, Moth, you definitely have some problems. But I'm a podiatrist. You need a psychiatrist. Why'd you come in here?""

The moth says,""Your light was on.""

One day Johnny was trekking through the woods when he spotted a rusty old lamp. Johnny never believed in magic, but as a joke, he spat on and rubbed the lamp clean. All of the sudden, smoke pours out of the spout and a genie appears. ""Hello! You have summoned me and shall be granted three wishes! 

Johnny jumped for joy. He sat and pondered what his wishes would be. First, he wanted a new place to live. the old wooden shack he called a home was falling apart. ""I want a marble mansion with full furnishings."" said Johnny. The genie waved his hand. ""It is done. There is now a mansion where that old shack once stood.""

Johnny though about all the parties he could throw, but he wasn't the best looking guy in town. He stood up, ""I want a hot wife-wait, no. I want a haram of hot wives."" The genie once gain waved his hand. ""When you go back to your new mansion, there will be numerous brides anticipating your arrival.""

Johnny though hard about his last wish. He had the house and many pretty girls. What could be the frosting on the cake? After a few minutes of thinking, Johnny stepped forward. ""Genie? If it isn't too much to ask, could I be hung like a nigger?"" The Genie scowled but still decided to grant his final wish. ""When you go back to your home, you will find all your wishes have come true. I bid thee farewell!""

The Genie disappeared back into his lamp. Johnny was excited. He skipped almost all the way back home. It was everything he imagined when he got there. The mansion was huge and all of his new wives were greeting him at the front door. He threw the biggest party that night. Only one thing was missing: his penis size. Had the genie forgotten to grant the last wish after all? As the party was winding down, Johnny heard a screech of tires and several men yelling. Suddenly, six men in white robes burst through the mansions front door and seize Johnny. Confused and babbling, Johnny is pulled out of his mansion and hung from a tree in his front yard.

The bartender just shakes his head in disapproval while wiping the bar. 

The 2nd Man says: ""What are you a nut? There is no way in heck that could happen."" 

1st Man: ""No, it's true let me prove it to you."" So he gets up from the bar, jumps over the balcony, and careens to the street below. When he passes the 10th floor, the high wind whips him around the building and back into the 10th floor window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar. 

The 2nd Man tells him: ""You know I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke."" 

1st Man: ""No, I'll prove it again"" and again he jumps and hurtles toward the street where the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window. Once upstairs he urges his fellow drinker to try it. 

2nd Man: ""Well what the heck, it works, I'll try it."" So he jumps over the balcony, plunges downward, passes the 11th, 10th, 9th, 8th floors and hits the sidewalk with a 'splat.'

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

She wears it in lab. She wore it at her graduation ceremonies. Day after day, identical outfits.

Of course, people thought this is ridiculous, but her work speaks for itself; she's made many important patents, won numerous prizes, and has more than enough grant money. Her work eventually won her the Nobel prize in chemistry. Her friends and family beg her to change her attire for the Nobel prize ceremony; just this once, to dress formally as she represents herself, her university, and her country. To everyone's surprise, she agrees.

She arrives in an elegant dress, stiletto high heels, and... her usual yarn necklace with a vial of aldehydes as a pendant.

When her friends see her, they are a little confused. They asked her:

""why did you keep the pendant? I thought you were going to dress formally!""

The superstitious chemist replied:

""It is formyl!""",Superstitious chemist,3

First question: how long did the Hundred Years War last?

a) 99 years

b) 116 years

c) 100 years

d) 150 years

The blonde prefers to use her one free pass joker at this point, so here comes the next question: where does the Panama hat originate from?

a) Ecuador 

b) Venezuela

c) Colombia

d) Panama

The blonde asks the public's help joker and here comes the next question: what was George VI's first name?

a) Albert

b) Jonah

c) George

d) Constantine

The blonde uses the 50:50 joker and here comes the next question: during which month do the Russians celebrate the October Revolution?

a) September

b) October

c) November

d) February

The blonde uses the phone call joker and here comes the next question: which animal gave its name to the Canary Islands?

a) Seal

b) Canary

c) Monkey

d) Cat

The blonde says the wrong answer and loses the game.

Did you laugh at the blonde for using her jokers to answer such *easy* questions? Well, here are the correct answers:

1 - 116 years (from 1337 to 1453)

2 - Ecuador

3 - Albert

4 - November (because the Russians' calendar used to be Julian as opposed to Gregorian (in the latter, the revolution's date is 7 November)

5 - Seal (monk seal = *canis marinus* or sea dog / Canariae Insulae = Islands of the Dogs)",A blonde takes part in a game show,228

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

As they looked around, the old man asked St. Peter how much all this was going to cost.

'It's free,' St. Peter replied, 'this is Heaven.' Next, they went out in the back yard to survey the championship-style golf course that the home was located on. They would have golfing privileges every day and each week, the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. The old man asked, 'What are the green fees?'

St. Peter replied, 'This is heaven, you play for free.' Next, they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisine's of the World laid out. 'How much to eat?' asked the old man.

'Don't you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!' St. Peter replied, with some exasperation. 'Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?' the old man asked timidly. St. Peter lectured, 'That's the best part - you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven.'

With that, the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it, and screaming wildly. St. Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down, asking him what was wrong.

For those of my generation who do not, and cannot, comprehend why Facebook exists: I am trying to make friends outside of Facebook while applying the same principles.  Therefore, every day I walk down the street and tell passersby what I have eaten, how I feel at the moment, what I have done the night before, what I will do later and with whom.

I give them pictures of my family, my dog, and of me gardening, taking things apart in the garage, watering the lawn, standing in front of landmarks, driving around town, having lunch, and doing what anybody and everybody does every day.  I also listen to their conversations, give them the ""thumbs up"" and tell them I like them. And it works just like Facebook.

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk",A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery,3

Surprised, I say ""No, but where are you actually from?"". Looking annoyed, he says ""I'm actually American, you racist."" Feeling a little embarrassed over my unintentional racism, I stop talking for a little while. We then walk into this bar as the bartender is kicking out this duck, WTF?

He had wished for a monster cock. I nod sympathetically. I tell him that ""once I found a mermaid who said she'd grant me one wish. I asked for a little head, and that's how I ended up like this"". The chicken admits ""Oh, I didn't want to ask because I thought it would be too personal. You gotta be careful around those wish granters"". Then, an Irishman, an American, and a Frenchman walk into the bar. Anyway, after having too much to drink, Chicken and I walk out of the bar. He says to me ""Hey, you wanna go to a party?""

He asks the bartender about her and is surprised to discover that she's a prostitute. He watches her the rest of the night, amazed that someone so attractive could be available to him.

The next night he goes back to the bar, and sure enough she shows up again in all her golden-haired glory, only this time alone.

The guy gets up his nerve and approaches her.

""Is it true you're a prostitute?"", he asks.   
""Why, sure, big boy. What can I do for you?""    
""Well, I dunno. What do you charge?""    
""I get $100 just for a handjob. We can negotiate from there.""    
""$100!! For a handjob? Are you nuts?""    
""You see that Ferrari out there?""

The guy looks out the front door, and sure enough there's a shiny new Ferrari parked outside.

""I paid cash for that Ferrari with the money I made on handjobs. ""Trust me, it's worth it.""

The guy mulls it over for a while, and decides what the hell. He leaves with her, and gets the most unbelievable experience he's ever had. This handjob was better than any complete sexual experience in his miserable life. The next night he's back at the bar, waiting eagerly for her to show up.

When she does, he immediately approaches her.

""Last night was incredible!"", he exclaims    
""Of course it was. Just wait till you try one of my blowjobs.""    
""How much is that?""    
""$500""    
""$500!?! C'mon, that's ridiculous!""    
""You see that apartment building across the street?""

The guy looks out front at a 12 story penthouse apartment building.

""I paid cash for that building with the money I made on blowjobs. Trust me, it's worth it.""

Based on the night before, the guy decides to go for it. He leaves with her, and once again is not disappointed. He nearly faints - twice. The next night he can hardly contain himself until she shows up.

""I'm hooked, you're the best! Tell me, what'll it cost me for some pussy?"", he begs the blond.

She motions for him to follow her outside. She points down the street, where between the buildings he can see Manhattan.

""You see that island?""    
""Aw, c'mon! You can't be serious about that!""

She nods her head.

""You bet. If I had a pussy, I'd own Manhattan!""",A man sees a blond bombshell walk into a bar,18

But this day was different than the others. Today a man was on his hands and knees weeping and shouting, ""Why did you die? Why did you die?""

Well John feels sorry for the guy so he heads over and asks the man what's wrong. The weeping man doesn't acknowledge him and just keeps on going, ""Why did you die? Why did you die?""

Well John is still very concerned and so he says to the man, ""At least you could tell me who this is.""

The man ignored him and just keeps on weeping, ""Why did you die? Why did you die?""

John then still worried asks, ""Well it's it your mother?""
The man replies, ""No"", and keeps going, ""Why did you die? Why did you die?""

John then asks, ""Well was it your father?""
The man replies, ""No"", and keeps on going, ""Why did you die? Why did you die?""

John getting upset at this point asks, ""Well was it one of your siblings?""
The man replies, ""No"", and keeps going on, ""Why did you die? Why did you die?""

John is very mad at this point and raises his voice at the man, ""Well who the hell is it then??""
The man sniffles and says, ""Well it's my wife's first husband""

What most of you don’t know is that these two stories are connected by White Rabbit, who visited Beast’s castle on the way to the hole near Alice’s house. In fact, right outside the castle, the rabbit was running and, rather embarrassingly, fell headlong into the mud.

Keep in mind that White Rabbit was a high officer of a rather powerful monarch and a standing Court. He thought nothing of approaching Beast’s large castle and asking for help. If you’ve seen the curiosities and wonders of the Red Queen’s lands, you’ll anticipate that White Rabbit wasn’t fazed when a dancing duster answered the door. 

With haste and flourish, he recounted his trouble and asked that the castle’s distinguished ruler take mercy on him and provide him with a bath and a change of clothing. The duster brought him to Lumière who reminded his master of a standing treaty. Beast, too dejected and detached to allow his anger to rise, didn’t even look at White Rabbit and gave a quiet approval.

The White Rabbit took a great, long bath and had never felt so clean. 

It turned out that none of Lumière’s clothing fit White Rabbit so the walking candlestick brought the rabbit to Cogsworth. Cogworth brought the rabbit to his room and said, hushed, that he was more than willing to lend him clothing but that it would require White Rabbit keep his darkest secret. Being high officer of a rather powerful monarch and a standing Court, White Rabbit was used to secrets and was able to quell the poor clock’s worry. 

Cogsworth’s secret, it turned out, was that he preferred ladies’ undergarments to men’s. This was hardly a secret in White Rabbit’s mind. Cogsworth should only hear some of the card guard’s secrets… the Red Queen would have their heads! But, familiar with bunny trails and not wanting to go down this particular one, White Rabbit donned the clock’s underthings as a gesture of good faith. Cogsworth blushed but his fears were assuaged: his secret remained safe and he was able to aid a fellow agent in need. 

While White Rabbit was changing, Cogsworth (as an additional favour) had the rabbit’s pocket watch cleaned thoroughly, wound properly, and reset to the proper time. But in a moment of brain lapse he set the watch to local time and not to Wonderland time and completely forgot to inform the rabbit!

So they kept each other company to the large banquet room that we know from the film where White Rabbit was treated to a more-than-adequate meal and performance. The cabaret would have given any show in France a run for its money. And White Rabbit, partly out of respect for his hosts and partly out of sheer amusement lost track of time. But then, catching a glimpse of his pocket watch, stood up straight on his back paws, announced that he was late for a very important date, and sprang out the door while still wearing Cogsworth clothing!

He ran and bounced. This is where he caught up with Alice and if you’re interested, I highly recommend L. Carroll’s thorough account of this part of the story. 

White Rabbit didn't have a chance to check a proper clock until long after his return to Wonderland. So it turned out that he had arrived to his destination after all, just in the knickers of time.

The school used to come in the news fairly regularly for nothing but their bullies. More often than not the school bullies used to line up the other students and hit them in the face. The consequences of not being present in the line were worse than getting *punched* in the face, so helplessly once a week on Monday all the students lined up. The children were made to line up on the football pitches far away from the school building so the teachers wouldn't catch them too often. 

The bullies were usually the eldest students in school on that particular day, and the line was particularly *bad* when the bullies were 16 year olds, and was terrible when the bullies were even younger.

A new teacher had joint school and she had heard so much about the bullying and she had zero tolerance for harassment of any sort. She decided that she's going to catch the bullies responsible for this. 

So every Monday she would go to the football pitches and catch the bullies but there always used to be a *bad line*, and so she would never catch the eldest students who were the linchpins in this entire bullying scheme. She had never even seen the *terrible line*, she always used to catch the 16, and so one day she decided to use the genie lamp that she had since she was in her early twenties. She had used 2 wishes from the genie, and decided that she would use her last wish to try and catch the bullies in charge. 

Her two previous wishes were used on becoming the most knowledgeable economics teacher in the UK and to be an extremely fun teacher in the classroom. These two wishes were granted to her by the genie and it helped her land the teaching job at this school. 

She rubbed the lamp and the genie came out, she then went on to explain to the genie about the punching situation in the school and how all the students were made to stand in a line. She then went on to explain how she had only been catching the *bad line* of students and how she wished that she could catch the other bullies. The genie nodded and told her that things would be different tomorrow. 

So the next Monday the teacher went to school like normal, and saw that there were no 16 year olds in school. This intrigued her, but at least she knew she that she wouldn't see the *bad line*, this excited her. She had dreamt of this day where she would finally catch the other bullies who were *punching* all the students.

The teacher began to walk towards the football field not knowing what to anticipate as she had never seen any other line apart from the *bad* one.

Once she reached there she knew that the genie had fulfilled her wish once again because, in front of her she saw it; the punchline, and it was *terrible*. ",There was a school in England which was infamous for having the savage bullies. [Long],9

The next day they did the same but nobody answered and nobody came to help. The next day they did it again and finally someone came to help them. It were some native people who lived there for a looong time. The leader of them said in a perfect English ""Greetings fellow people I am Kunta Kinte. I am the leader of this tribe. We are cannibals and we are going to eat every single one of you."" The Dutch, the German and the French started to panic. But then the leader said ""BUT! When you bring me the prettiest fruit you find, you may live."" The Dutch, the German and the French ran into the Jungle and searched for hours. After 3 hours the German came back with a Cherry and a strawberry and gave it the leader of the tribe. ""Now.. put it up your Butt. If you laugh I will kill you. If you don't you live here in peace and marry my beautiful daughter."" So the German picked up the Cherry and put it inside his Butt. No Problem. Then he picked up the strawberry tried to put it in his Butt but he laughed and got stabbed in the chest. 2 hours later the Dutch came and had an Apple and an Orange. He gave it the leader of the tribe and he said again: ""Now.. put it up your Butt. If you laugh I will kill you. If you don't you live here in peace and marry my beautiful daughter."" So the Dutch did. He did it with the Apple, easy peasy, but laughed at the Orange. The German and the Dutch meet in Heaven and the German said ""Do you had to put some fruit in your Butt? I managed the Cherry but the Strawberry tickled too much and I laughed and got stabbed in the chest!"" The Dutch replies ""Yes I had to. I managed to put the Apple in my Butt but just when I wanted to start with the Orange i saw the French coming out of the Jungle with a watermelon and an Pineapple..""

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.",First Condom,582

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.
