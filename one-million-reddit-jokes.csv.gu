He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

&amp;#x200B;

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you.

When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

&amp;#x200B;

The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

&amp;#x200B;

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

&amp;#x200B;

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.

They chose to trade it with the Western world. When asked what they called this food, they realised they didn't have a name for it yet. It was a great food that always ended with empty bowls, so they decided to take the English words 'naught' and 'food' and put them together, which eventually became the word noodles.

The Western world was impressed, but thought 'empty food' seemed a bit negative. So they took the number one and the word 'food' and combined them to make 'oodles'. Oodles of noodles sounded great, it felt like the number one food.

I thought this etymology was wonderful and decided to have noodles for dinner. I invited my friend over and we went to order two servings from the local takeout shop. However, when I went in to order, they just smiled and waved goodbye. I turned to my friend, utterly confused. ""Why didn't they take my order?"" I asked them.

post,a547bq,2qh72,jokes,false,1544508344,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/a547bq/a_fisherman_walks_into_rjokes/,self.jokes,,"A fisherman walks into /r/jokes where he meets a bartender. The bartender offers him a drink. The fisherman says he does not have money to pay, so instead he offers a trade-- if he can get the bartender to laugh at his joke, then the bartender should provide a drink for free. The bartender, a smug, old pirate of a man accepts. After all, he is a moderator of /r/jokes, so he has become very accustomed to not laughing.

The fisherman begins his tale. ""Years ago, I set out on a whaling expedition, when a fellow sailor told me about the mystical golden fishing rod.""

""Let me stop you right there"" says the bartender. I can see where this is going. Golden rod. This is a sex joke. I've heard it before.""

""No. It's not a sex joke"" says the fisherman.

The bartender, fascinated, realizes that this may actually be OC.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""There once was a mystical golden fishing rod that was said to be so powerful that anyone using it could catch any fish.""

""Wait a minute"" says the bartender. ""I think you're in the wrong place. This sounds like the tale of Darth Plagueis. You want /r/prequelmemes down the street"".

""No. It's not a prequel meme"" says the fisherman.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""One day, a little boy found the rod and used it to catch a lion fish. Neptune, god of the sea appeared. He was furious because the lion fish was his best friend. In retaliation, Neptune broke the rod into pieces, separating the rod and the reel. The little boy said 'Now I am sad'.

""Oh, come on!"" said the bartender. ""Hey, Sad. I'm neptune! You want /r/dadjokes. Don't waste my time"".

""No. It's not a dadjoke"" says the fisherman.

The fisherman continues his tale. ""The boy took the pieces home, but they never worked again. Eventually, the rod was sold at a flea market, and the reel became the subject of many jokes.""

The fisherman then asks ""So, what did you think?""

The bartender, confused, looks up. ""What? That's it?""

The fisherman nods.

The bartender, now, is very confused. It's OC, sure, but it doesn't make any sense.

He scratches his head and asks a question ""What do you mean about the reel becoming the subject of many jokes?""

The fisherman says ""I can't answer that here"".

The bartender asks ""Why not?""

The fisherman replies ""The reel joke is always in the comments""",A fisherman walks into /r/Jokes,92

""Cap'n!!!"" he cried, ""Ship approaching from the starboard side!  An' she's flying pirate colors!!!""




Calmly, the captain turned to his first mate and said, ""Mate, fetch me my red shirt.""  Puzzled, the mate did as he was told and returned to the captain with a long-sleeved, silk, deep crimson shirt, which the captain changed into.




The pirate ship came alongside the merchants and, to everyone's surprise, the merchant captain jumped onto the pirate vessel and in a dazzling display of swordsmanship started subduing the offenders.  The merchant crew, inspired by such heroism, swarmed the pirates and won the fight.  And there was much rejoicing.




A couple of days later, the mate from the crow's nest called down again, with even more panic in his voice.




""Cap'n!!!!!  TWO ships approaching from the port side!  They're flying pirate colors!!!""



Cool as a cucumber, the captain turned to his mate and again said, ""Fetch me my red shirt.""  The red shirt was donned, the captain fought like a master swordsman, the crew was inspired, and both ships of pirates were routed.  The merchant crew was ecstatic.




That night at dinner, the first mate pulled the captain away from the rest of the mess.  ""Cap'n,"" he asked, ""I just have to know.  What is the magic in that red shirt?""




The captain gaily laughed, ""Ha ha ha.  It is no magic.  The shirt merely serves to hide my true condition.""



The first mate looked confused.




""You see,"" the captain continued, drawing his rapier, ""With these light swords, they way you win a fight is by poking your opponent repeatedly.  You get enough nicks on them and eventually they collapse, faint and weak, and victory is yours.  With a shirt that is the same color as my fresh blood, my crew has no idea just how wounded I am at any point in the fight, which (due to my superior acting) makes them think that I am pristine and unscathed even when I am not.  In short, the red shirt hides my body's true response to the situation.""




The mate got it, smiled, and carried about his business.




The next day, a call came down from the crow's nest, more panicked than ever.




""CAPTAIN!!!"" the voice cried, ""TEN ships approaching from the starboard side!!!  And they're all flying pirate colors!!!""



With measured calmness, the captain said to his first mate, ""Fetch me my brown pants.""","""Fetch me my red shirt...""",30

Centuries ago, the last remaining elves on this world retreated to the far north. They remained secluded and only interacted with humans a few times a year to trade hand crafted toys and trinkets. This went on for many years until the reign of Elfking Rolf. He was very suspicious of humans and forbade his only son Lee from going to trade with them. However, after several years of frustration, Lee snuck away one night to see the nearest human village. He just wanted see a human from a distance, but after falling into a ravine and getting stuck he called out for help. Fortunately, a man named Claus was nearby and able to pull him to safety. 

Lee was extremely grateful and asked Claus if there was anything he could to repay him. Claus said he traded regularly with the elves and would love to see their town and castle. Lee knew his father would be upset, but he agreed to take him the next day.

Rolf was very upset, when his son was not in the castle the next morning. He was about to send out a search party, when another elf spotted something in the distance. It looked too big to be an elf and they were worried that centuries of peace might come to an end if they were discovered. As the man came closer, they saw an elf with him and then realized it was Lee. The elfking was furious! He took his best soldiers out and caught up Claus and Lee. They immediately attacked Claus and tied him up, despite Lee‚Äôs protests. Once they were back at the castle, Lee explained to his father what had happened. They released Claus and a few of the traders recognized him. Grateful that Lee now had saved his life, he said:

After he planted the crops, he wouldn't just water them and monitor the weather and their growth (and set up irrigation accordingly).  Once the crops got growing a bit, he'd start to dig up a couple to feel the root system, to see how it was growing, see which direction it was getting water from, see how deep the roots are.  Every day, he'd go and feel around the root system of a plant or two.

This habit got worse and worse.  By feeling the roots of a couple plants a day, eventually it'd take a pretty big dent out of his crop yield.  He wasn't going to go broke over it--his wife had her own career as a doctor--but it ate into the already-slim margins of being a farmer.

At his wife's suggestion, he tried different crops, that would be resistant to having their roots messed with a bit.  But year after year, no plant was able to.  His wife suggested counseling to help rid him of his strange compulsion, but he wouldn't hear of it.

Eventually he tried planting flax, and found that he was able to feel around the root system a bit and not have the plants die.  This allowed his crop yields to be normal, despite his unusual habit.

He happily told his wife that he'd fixed their crop yield problem.  She shrugged, and said ""I guess flax don't care about your feelings"".",The farmer who was too hands-on,1

The patrons start freaking out: screaming, scrambling to escape. Drinks fall off tables. Glasses shatter.

The *horse* starts freaking out: knocking over tables, rearing, neighing, kicking like crazy.

One patron takes a hoof to the face. He blacks out.

He wakes up in the hospital. Groggy from painkillers, he realizes his face is covered in bandages. The doctor informs him that it's been ruined beyond repair; he'll need a full face transplant.

Weeks on a waiting list turn into months, but in time, he can finally get the transplant. The surgery is successful, but he has years of healing ahead of him.

Years pass, and he makes a full recovery. He starts resuming life: returning to work, getting back out doors, socializing.

One day, he's walking around town and happens to come across that same bar where that awful accident happened years ago, nearly killing him, derailing his life. The damage from the horse had been fixed years ago, but he can see through the window that the same bartender still works there.

He walks into the bar.

A man, was happily snacking on a bright, red apple when, too lazy to walk to a trash can, he threw it out the window. A seemingly non-problematic apple would have been ignored under any other circumstances, but the man lived on the 50th story of a building and so as the apple fell, it became all but lethal. Luckily, the apple softened its fall by hitting the head of a pedestrian who in turn fell into the street. A nearby car swerved in a panic, hitting a pole. 

Emergency services was quickly called to respond to the scene and an ambulance was sent. A nearby bird spotted the remains of the apple, and it swooped in just as the ambulance arrived getting hit by the windshield of the vehicle. The driver, vision obscured by the bird, drove blindly down the road going over a railing. The resulting impact with the ground knocked a tire from the vehicle up into the air and onto a nearby slope. 

The tire picked up velocity and started going down a sloped road. 

Police, on response to a criminal threat, attempted to fire at a criminal just as the tire hit, sending the bullet wildly off-course hitting the pilot of a plane just taking off. 

The man who started all this, oblivious as he was then, had arrived at a medical check-up that he was due for later that day. Just as he was about to meet his doctor, the plane crashed into the doctor, killing him instantly. 

The moral of the story? 

An apple a day keeps the doctor away.","A man was eating a bright, red apple.",18

He leaves, and comes back with tiny little black berries. The chief tells him the same thing : *""up your ass, no expression, and you live, otherwise you die""*

Missionary number two gets 1,2,3,4,5,6 berries up there. On the 7th berry, he bursts out laughing, and they kill him.

He is feeling a little beat-up by the stresses of city life, and he concludes that a leisurely drive in the country would do him a world of good. So, he rents a car, and he sets off on his quest to find some peace of mind.

As he drives along a beautiful country road, he sees something odd in the distance. As he gets closer, he can see that it is a farmer standing under a tree near the road holding a pig. Curious, he pulls to the side of the road. He watches intently as the farmer picks up one pig after another to let them eat an apple from the tree. This curious behavior fascinates the businessman as he watches this go on for several minutes. Finally, he can no longer contain himself. He calls out to the farmer, ‚ÄúExcuse me sir, but what exactly are you doing?‚Äù The farmer calmly replies, ‚ÄúWhy, feeding the pigs, of course.‚Äù The businessman is a little surprised. He calls out to the farmer again, ‚ÄúBut, wouldn‚Äôt it save a lot of time if you just shook the tree to cause the apples to fall to the ground so that the pigs could eat them there?‚Äù The farmer looks at the businessman, confused, and he replies, ‚ÄúTime? Pigs got no concept of time!‚Äù

So the couple go to that corner House, since the front door was open they step inside the living room. while looking for the people to apologise, they can see a lot of broken glass all over the place and there was a man in white cloths standing there with a smile on his face.

The wife tries to say something, but the mysterious man interrupts saying "" thank you , thank you very much"".

the couple give a puzzled expression not knowing why is this person thanking them.

Since you are couple, ill give one wish to each , and I'll keep the third wish to myself. so who wants to go first""

exited The wife immediately says "" i want to own every house in this world""

with a happy face the husband says "" i want to have 100 billions in my bank""

the genie snaps his fingers and says it's done. Now for the third wish "" i have been in that bottle for so many years, so i wish to have sex with your wife"".

""Oh Marvin, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggles to their feet and put their clothes back on.

The policeman is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

It was a success! All the villagers nearby loved to buy flowers from the men of God. All except one, that is. The local florist. He was getting run out of business by the monks. He went to the Friar and asked him to close their shop, but they refused.

A week later, he went back again, and begged the Friar to close down the shop - he was going bankrupt, and his family was hungry! Again, they refused.

Another week still, the florists's mother went to the monastery and nagged them to close down to save her poor old son. And yet again, they refused.

The local florist was fed up with the monks, and spent the last of his money to hire Hugh McTagart, the roughest thug in town, and well known for doing anything for money.
Hugh went to Friar Tuck, and told him that if he didn't close their florist shop, he'd have to 'persuade' them. Initially, Tuck refused-- but when McTagart began to smash up the shop and threaten the pacifist monks, he caved in and closed the shop.

Then they start talking about each others' sexual preferences. When it's the wife's turn, she stutters for a moment. Her husband whispers to her, and she seems to get an idea.

The waitress brings in the food soon after. They finish their food, and head off home.      

The night after, the coworker arrives at the couple's apartment. He'd packed a duffle bag with all the usual BDSM gear; ballgags, handcuffs, ropes and chains, all newly purchased. You see, he'd never actually had sex before, so he thought he'd never needed to own these until now. All he knew was that BDSM hentai was pretty hot and he fantasized about it a lot.      
He unpacked his stuff, and layed spread-eagled on the bed. When the wife and husband finished preparing and walked in to see him lying there, they were very confused.     
The coworker was just as confused. ""I thought you said you were a dom.""       
The husband realized what had happened, and laughed. ""No, no, no, you've got it all wrong. My wife is a furry. She thought you were one too because you said your guilty fetish was being someone's pet.""",A man is planning to have his coworker have sex with his wife while he watches.,0

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was a man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,294

Unfortunately, it took a lot of this compound and he soon ran out.  
He decided the best thing to do was go to the east coast, raid several seagull nests and bring the young birds back to his laboratory in California.  Time was of the essence and since he was illegally transporting endangered animals, he decided to drive.
As he was passing through one of the states he realized that if he took a shortcut through one of the large state game parks he could save a lot of time.  So take it he did!  
Strange as it may seem, as he was speeding through the park, two lions jumped out in front of his truck and he ran them over!

He and his twin sister, Ling, had recently moved here from China and so they had very traditional names. One day, Ving mentioned to me how much he hated his name.

""What kind of a name is Ving? It's so stupid,"" he said, frustrated.

""You know, you can get your name changed at the city hall."" I said.

""Really? It's that easy?""

""Yeah, you just have to fill out some paperwork."" I paused. ""I can drive you if you want.""

""Thanks dude. What would I even change my name to though?"" He asked, looking up.

""How about something common that holds on to your roots? Something like . . . Lee?""

""Lee."" He pondered. After waiting for a bit, he said ""I like it.""

Unfortunately, Ling, his sister, had overheard our talk and launched into a tirade about how his name had been in the family for generations and he couldn't just throw away his heritage like that. Ving was set though. The next day, we drove to the city hall. Ling insisted on coming along, hoping to convince Ving to change his mind. She complained the entire ride. Ving wasn't deterred though. We finally got to the city hall, and got the paperwork. As he was filling it out, Ving's face changed.

""What's wrong?"" I asked. ""You've been excited all day and yesterday for this.""

""I know, I know. It's just-- It's my dad's name too. I don't know."" Ving sighed. ""I don't think I can go through with it.""

Ling looked relieved. The receptionist noted that there was a small cancellation fee. Ling happily took out some money. Suddenly, and Asian man in Ray-Bans, neon shorts, and an American flag T-shirt burst through the doors. 

""Dad!"" Ving cried out, and ran to embrace his father. Ving Sr., after looking at his son, smiled, and said 

""Don't stop. Be Lee, Ving. Hold on to that fee, Ling.""","In High School, I had a Friend Named Ving",65
