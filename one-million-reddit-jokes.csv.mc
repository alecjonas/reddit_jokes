The waiter is naturally taken aback and replies, ""Excuse me, sir, but could you please refrain from using that sort of language in here, I will get the manager as soon as I can.""

The manager comes over and the bloke asks, ""Are you the chicken f****** manager of this b****** joint?"". 

""Yes, sir, I am,"" replies the manager, ""and I would prefer it if you could refrain from speaking such profanities in this, a private restaurant"".

""F*** off!"" replies the bloke. ""And where's the f****** piano?""

""Pardon?"" says the manager.

""F****** deaf as well are we? You little piece of sniveling s***, show us your f****** piano.""

""Ahhhh,"" replies the manager. ""You've come about the pianist's job,"" and shows the bloke to the piano. ""Can you play any blues?""

""Of course I f**** can,"" and the bloke proceeds to play the most inspiring and beautiful sounding honky tonk blues that the manager has ever heard.

""Why, that's superb, what's it called?""

""I want to f*** your missus on the sofa but the springs keep hurting my ****,"" replies the pianist.

The manager is a bit disturbed and asks if the bloke knows any jazz. 

The bloke proceeds to play the most melancholy jazz solo the manager has ever heard.

""Magnificent!"" cries the manager. ""What's it called?""

""I wanted a w*** over the washin' machine but my b**** got caught in the soap drawer"".

The manager is a tad embarrassed and asks if he knows any romantic ballads, the bloke then plays the most heartbreaking melody.

""And what's this called?"" asks the manager.

""As I f*** you under the stars with the moonlight shining off your hairy a** h***,"" replies the bloke.

The manager is highly upset by the bloke's language but offers him the job on condition that he doesn't introduce any of his songs or talk to any of the customers.

This arrangement works well for a couple of months until one night, sitting opposite him, is the most gorgeous blonde he has ever laid his eyes on. 

She's wearing an almost see through dress, her ta-tas almost falling out the top and the skimpy little 'G' string she's wearing is riding up the crack of her behind. 

She is sitting there with her legs slightly open, sucking suggestively on asparagus shoots and the butter is dripping down her chin! 

It's too much for the bloke and he runs off to the bogs to 'wrestle with his urges'. 

He's furiously busy with himself when he hears the manager's voice...

""Where's that bloody pianist?""

He had just reached the point of no return and in a fluster he runs back to the piano, not having bothered to adjust himself properly, sits down and starts playing some more tunes. 

The blonde steps up and walks over to the piano, leans over and whispers in his ear:

""Do you know your 'old johnson' and family jewels are hanging out your trousers?"".

""Know it,"" the pianist replies, ""I f****** wrote it!",The pianist,0

To make matters worse, the only place she could pull over was right in front of the State Mental Hospital.  With no one to phone for help, she summoned up the nerve to change the tire herself.  

She got the car jacked up, got the hub cap off, set the hub cap down like a bowl and placed each of the five lug nuts in it.  Somehow, as she was struggling to get the new tire up and in place, she stepped on the rim of the hubcap and sent all the lug nuts flying into the dark flooded storm drain.  It was at that point that she started to cry.

A moment or two into her cry, she heard a voice from above.  It said, ""Pssssst!  Hey lady!""  She looked up and saw a scruffy man in a hospital gown staring down between the security bars covering a third story window.  Quite afraid she ignored him.  Again he said, ""Psssst! Hey lady!  if you take one lug nut off your other three tires and put them on the one you're changing, the car will be safe enough to drive to a repair shop.""

The lady thought about it and it seemed to make sense.  Feeling quite embarrassed she called back up ""That's a really great idea!  I'm surprised you're in a mental hospital.""

They trained, hours everyday, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm instantly realised, that is was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one the rumoured Magical notes that musicians had theorised must exist... 
yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam’s 20th Birthday, it happened again. This time, the town was so impacted that no one moved, spoke or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they new that Sam had found the second note...

And the next year on Sam’s Birthday, the town had realised there was a pattern involved. This time all the towns people were present in the monastery’s nave, watching in awe as Sam hit the glorious third note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam’s notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the magical notes growing sweater and sweater... until, that is, Sam’s 25th Birthday. All at first seemed as normal... Untill Sam hit the magical note. From the start Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closed monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The towns folk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. “What happened?” He asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. “Isn’t it obvious?” He said. “Sam sung Note 7”

I thought I was a perfect fit; although I was a lawyer working for a drinks company, they had an extensive legal department to handle any potential controversies with any of their sold items.

My first case involved defending the company against a young mentally-disabled man by the name of Rick who had worked on the assembly line and was recently fired for failing to do any work. Rick had loaded the shipment trucks with the company for two years before being promoted to the position of head canner. “However, Your Honor” I said ""he simply wouldn’t do his job in making sure the drinks were put into their metal cans and ready to be sealed. He had no issue with dealing with peach, grape, or mango flavored drinks, but he was at a complete loss when it came to the classics in dealing with Arnold Palmers and our other tea brands. Because he could not manage for well over half of our products, we simply had to fire him. I hope you can see that because he could not perform in the workplace, we had no choice but to fire him to improve our own efficiency.”

It was looking like an open and shut case; it was not a case of our failing to consider his mental deficiencies because it was so simple a task, and he was not able to follow the order, which was by no means complex. The judge saw our point of view. “Now, if you, the prosecution” He said, addressing the young disabled man and his lawyer “have any other reason or evidence why you may think this command be unreasonable, please advise me. But to me, this seems like a rather simple case.” “But sir, they did not understand the complexity of his mental disability in his firing!” His lawyer argued. The judge retorted “But, again, how could he fail to perform and understand an instruction so simple?” “Well sir, that seems to be where we disagree.” his lawyer piped up “To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand “Rick, can more tea!”

A couple of weeks later, the chief checked in again with the Weather Service. “Does it still look like a cold winter?” asked the chief.

“It sure does,” replied the meteorologist. “It looks like a very cold winter.”The chief advised the tribe to gather up every scrap of wood they could find.

A couple of weeks later, the chief called the Weather Service again and asked how the winter was looking at that point. The meteorologist said,“We’re now forecasting that it will be one of the coldest winters on record!”

However, no matter what the husband does sexually, the woman never reaches orgasm. 

Since a Jewish wife is entitled to sexual pleasure, they decide to ask the rabbi. The rabbi listens to their story, strokes his beard, and makes the following suggestion:

“Hire a strapping young man. While the two of you are making love, have the young man wave a towel over you. That will help the wife fantasize and should bring on an orgasm.”

They go home and follow the rabbi’s advice. They hire a handsome young man and he waves a towel over them as they make love. It doesn’t help, and she is still unsatisfied.

Perplexed, they go back to the rabbi. “Okay,” says the rabbi to the husband,“let’s try it reversed. Have the young man make love to your wife and you wave the towel over them.” Once again, they follow the rabbi’s advice.

The young man gets into bed with the wife, and the husband waves the towel.The young man gets to work with great enthusiasm and the wife soon has an enormous, room-shaking, screaming orgasm.
The husband smiles, looks at the young man and says to him triumphantly, “Schmuck, that’s the way you wave a towel!”",An older man could never get his wife to orgasm!,26

What does it mean to give MORE than 100%?      
 
Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%.    
 
How about achieving 103%?    
 
What makes up 100% in life?      
 
Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:     
 
If: 
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 
 
   
 
Is represented as: 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26. 
 
 Then:  
 
H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K 
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 =  98%
 
    
 
And 
 
      
 
K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E  
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 =  96%    
 
But ,    
 
A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E  
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 =  100%    
 
And,      
 
B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T  
2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 =  103%    
 
AND, look how far ass kissing will take you.     
 
A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G  
1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7  = 118%      
 
So, one can conclude with mathematical certainty, that while Hardwork and Knowledge  will get you close, and Attitude will get you there. 
 
It's the Bullshit and Ass Kissing that will put you over the top.      
 
Now you know why Politicians are where they are!            ",Giving more than 100%,115

They often warred and casualties were fierce. So they agreed to hold a tournament of all their champions on an island in the middle of the lake. The first being rich and influential sent twenty Knights and thirty squires with many horses and wagons laden with food and wine. The second being well-off sent ten knights and twenty squires as well as several wagons of food and drink. The last kingdom had only one knight who was very aged and rather decrepit and had but the one squire. They brought with them a single iron pot and a horse with food enough for the journey. The first evening much revelry was had- wine was shared and spilled in equal measure great haunches of meat were roasted and cut and all are well. The old knight counseled that there were rats on the island and food should be moved off the ground to avoid them spreading plague. The Knights and squires of the first and second kingdoms disregarded his advice saying ""Pfah! What does he know? We are so many no rats would dare bother us!"" But the squire of the third kingdom listened attentively to his old knight and hauled their old iron pot on a rope over a branch preventing the rats from finding it. In the morning all the warriors of the first two kingdoms were ill finding rat droppings in their food and sleeping-things and several of them could barely even stand, let alone fight. That night the partying was subdued but still jubilant. Old grudges were settled by the fireside tales of heroism told and retold and many casks of wine were emptied and tossed aside. Again the old knight counseled the gathered warriors. He warned them that bandits had long preyed on dwellers of this island, making off with any valuables they could. ""Pfah! What does the old man know?"" They cried well into their cups. ""Surely no bandit would trouble such an assembled group of warriors!"" But the lone squire from the third kingdom listened intently to his wise old master and hung a noose beside their pot dangling from the tree so that bandits might see the penalty for troubling them and be warned away. The day of the tournament came and the Knights and squires of the first and second kingdoms emerged from their tents to find their fine armour and weapons stolen in the night by bandits. Amazed they hunted around but even their horses were gone. The Knights could not fight at all and only a very few of their squires could craft cudgels with which to do battle. But the crafty squire of the third kingdom had warned bandits away and his battered old pot helm and coat of plates and his dented old sword were safe in his tent. He took to the field under the gaze of his master and although the other squires allied against him, he defeated those who were well and well-armoured enough to fight him. And thus we learned that the squire of the high pot and noose was equal to the sum of squires on the other two sides.

The prawns were constantly being harassed &amp; threatened by sharks that inhabited the area. Finally one day Justin said to Christian, “I’m fed up with being a prawn, I wish I was a shark, then I wouldn’t have any worries about being eaten.”

A large mysterious cod appeared &amp; said, “Your wish is granted” &amp; lo &amp; behold, Justin turned into a shark.

Horrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by his old mate.

Time passed (as it invariably does) &amp; Justin found life as a shark boring &amp; lonely. All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them. Justin didn’t realize that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight.

While swimming alone one day he saw the mysterious cod again &amp; he thought perhaps the mysterious fish could change him back into a prawn. He approached the cod &amp; begged to be changed back, &amp; lo &amp; behold, he found himself turned back into a prawn.

With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes Justin swam back to his friends &amp; bought them all a cocktail.

Looking around the gathering at the reef he realized he couldn’t see his old pal. “Where’s Christian?” he asked.

“He’s at home, still distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy &amp; became a shark”,came the reply.

Eager to put things right again &amp; end the mutual pain &amp; torture, he set off to Christian’s abode.

As he opened the coral gate memories came flooding back. He banged on the door &amp; shouted, “It’s me, Justin, your old friend, come out &amp; see me again.”

Christian replied,”No way man, you’ll eat me. You’re now a shark, the enemy, &amp; I’ll not be tricked into being your dinner.”

Justin cried back “No, I’m not. That was the old me. I’ve changed….
I’ve found Cod. I’m a Prawn again Christian.”",2 prawns were swimming around.,2

Johnny stands up.
""The story's about my Uncle Terry. He never worked at the hatchery, an account of he was in Vietnam, and he got disability. He don't even like people that work at the hatchery. But this story happened faaarrrrrr from these shores... In a little town called Denang. Terry was not well liked. His whole troop left him. Abandoned! He woke up in the weeds, and all they left him with were three bottles of Jack Daniels and some weapons. Terry stood up, and downed one bottle right away. Said if I'm goin' out, I'm goin' out. He took his automatic rifle, a couple of glocks, and his two bottles and away he went. He found a town, and he didn't know if it was enemy territory, or if it was one he was sent to protect, but all he knew was he had hate in his gut. So he started firin', and he fired the rifle with an arcing kind of... Like a farmer would with a scythe for hay. And sure enough, the men fell like hay before him. Then the women... And by god I'm ashamed to say it, but, then the children. And finally all that was left was Uncle Terry standing in the mud and the blood. He touched his pants, and it was wet, and Uncle Terry felt shame for he'd pissed himself. Well he touched it again and it wasn't urine at all but ejaculate, and Uncle Terry felt pride where shame once was.""

So the teacher's like ""Good CHRIST! What kind of a story is THAT!? What the hell is the moral to that!?""

""Oh, well!"" he says, ""When Uncle Terry's been drinking you don't fuck with him.""

Patty explains that he will need to secure the loan with some collateral.

She holds up the tiny pink elephant. _""I mean, what in the world is this?""_

They were continually being chased and threatened by the sharks that inhabited the area.

Eventually Justin had had enough. He said to Kristian, ""I'm fed up with being a prawn. I wish I was a shark, and then I wouldn't have to worry about being eaten all the time.""

As he said this, a large mysterious cod appeared and said, ""Your wish is granted!""

And believe it or not, with that Justin turned into a fearsome shark.

Kristian was horrified and so immediately swam away as he was scared of being eaten by his old friend.

As time went by, Justin found his new life as a shark to be boring and lonely. None of his old friends would let him get near them as they thought he would eat them and so they just swam away whenever he approached.

It took a while, but eventually Justin realized that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight.

Then one day he was swimming all alone as usual when he saw the mysterious cod again. He thought it'd be better if he could go back to his old life so he swam to the cod and begged to be changed back. The cod worked his magic and suddenly Justin was a prawn once more.

With tears of joy streaming down his cheeks Justin swam straight to Kristian's home.

As he opened the coral gate, the happy memories came flooding back. He banged on the door and shouted, ""Kristian, it's me, Justin, your old friend. Come out and see me again.""

Kristian replied, ""No way! You're a shark now and you'll just eat me. I'm not being tricked into being your dinner.""

Justin shouted back ""No, I'm not a shark any more. That was the old me. I've changed...

I've found Cod. I'm a prawn again Kristian.""",Two prawns were swimming around in the sea one day.,2804

“Ah, I do see.” The bartender replies “How about I give you some of mine? I’m sure they’re original.”

“Sure.” The redditor was ready for his second shot.

“A man walked into a pole, kicking it by accident...” the bartender says in his best joke-telling voice.

“...Sadly, he kicked the bucket.” He ends, after the five minutes it took him to say it.

The redditor bursts into laughter, yelling, “Another one! That was incredible!”

“Of course!” Said the redditor.

The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulation requiring that family unity be maintained to the highest degree possible.

The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him.

After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.

After two recesses to check legal references and confer with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Miami Dolphins, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone.",Judge Makes Decision In Child Abuse Case,35

St. Peter said, 'I'm sorry, but there's only one way you can go back, and that is as a chicken'
Bob was devastated, but begged St. Peter to send him to a farm near his home....
The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking and pecking the ground.
A rooster strolled past. 'So, you're the new hen, huh? How's your first day here?'
'Not bad,' replied Bob the hen, 'but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I'm gonna explode!'
'You're ovulating,' explained the rooster.
'Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before?'
'Never,' said Bob.
'Well, just relax and let it happen,' says the rooster.
'It's no big deal.'
He did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg!
He was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood. He soon laid another egg -- his joy was overwhelming.
As he was about to lay his third egg, he felt a smack on the back of his head, and heard.....

They also found that is was possible to make a tasty but strong type of tea from the fur. For a while this was rather popular so they thought that perhaps an export business would bring in some much needed cash. Unfortunately the tea was not at all popular due to the presence of the fur which unlike normal tea leaves didn't fall to the bottom of the cup but remained suspended in the liquid...

Simply going out to get supplies has turned out to be quite traumatic. Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't happen to you.

Here's how the scam works:

Two seriously good-looking 20-21 year-old girls come over to your car as you are packing your shopping into the boot.

They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. It is impossible not to look.

When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say ""No"" and instead ask you for a ride to another Costco - or Walmart.

You agree and they get in the back seat.

On the way, they start getting it on with each other. Then one of them climbs over into the front seat and performs oral sex on you, while the other one steals your wallet.

I had my wallet stolen September 4th, 5th, twice on the 12th, 19th, &amp; 25th. Also October 2nd, 3rd, three times just last Sunday and very likely again this upcoming weekend.

So be careful. ","A ""heads up"" for those of you who may be regular Costco customers",4

It was in a small, semi-pro ring.  We watched amateurs and semi pro matadors fighting, and actually killing, the bulls.  It was brutally fascinating.  The final fight was with an up-and-comer, and everyone was on their feet when he made the fatal thrust in to the bulls heart.  

Afterwards, we went to a mexican restaurant across the street.  We ordered our meals and sat at the table drinking margaritas and listening to the mariachi band.  Suddenly, on a cue from the maitre d, the band walked over to the kitchen door and struck up a very lively song.  

Out of the kitchen came a waiter with a large platter of food centered around a silver dome.  He went to the table next to us, and when he lifted the dome, there were two large 'meatballs.'  

It was quite the presentation and my friend and I were completely impressed.  We asked our waiter what was going on, and he said that meal was served only on bullfighting days, and the 'meatballs' were actually the testicles from the bull in the grand finale fight of the day.  

He then explained it is very popular, and that the waiting list for that meal was over 6 months long.  I was saddened by this, because that was a meal I wanted to experience, if only for the story.  

So my friend and I talked it over, we pooled our money together, and I went to the maitre d with $50.  I gave it to him, and told him that if there was a cancellation, to call me, and that there would be another $50 waiting when we got there.  

A few weeks went by, but the call finally came one Saturday.  The maitre d told us that we had to be there no later than 4pm, or he would be selling the meal to someone else.  We were at work, but left right away, and headed back down in to Mexico. 

We got there at 3:30, and I slipped my man his promised $50, and he took us to our table.  We slurped down margaritas in anticipation, and after what seemed like a brutally long time, the mariachi band went to the kitchen door and the whole presentation was repeated perfectly.

Except for one small detail.   When the waiter lifted the silver dome, there were only 2 small balls...not the gigantic ones we had seen on our previous trip.  

Someone outraged, I asked the waiter why they the bulls testicles were so small.   He asked if we had been to the bullfight that day, and we explained that we had not.  Then he replied:

""Well you see, senor, sometimes the bull wins!"" ",The Mexican Restaurant.,4
