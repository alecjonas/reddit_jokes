He sits down and orders a beer from one hell of a beefy, muscled bartender. He takes a shakey sip from his dark, dark beer, puts it back down, and asks about the lemons as old and shriveled as he is.

""We have a bet at this bar,"" says the muscles with a mouth. ""I take one half of a lemon, squeeze it as hard as I am capable, then hand the lemon to you. If you can squeeze even a single drop of lemon juice from the lemon, free drinks for life.""

The old man considers this while he finishes his beer. Placing his empty glass down, he pipes up, ""I will take your challenge.""

As-wide-as-tall makes a noise like a chuckle through his Jumanji beard ""You're having a laugh. No way. My pinkie weighs as much as you, Skinandbones. We've had lumberjacks, linemen, bodybuilders almost as enormous as myself try. No one, *NO ONE,* has ever squozen a drop from the lemon.""

""That's quite alright. I'll take your challenge nonetheless.""

""Alright, but you buy the lemon, Dachshund.""

So the man puts down 59¬¢  
The tree with legs cuts the lemon in two and squeezes one half as hard as he can, muscles and veins pumping comically, juicing the tart yellow glob entirely, and handing the remains over to the old man, each as dry as the Sahara.

The human stick figure carefully wraps his soft digits around the rind, and slowly closes them into a fist.

He does not squeeze a single drop, but two. Then three and four and five and six and seven and eight and nine and ten drops.

The bar has gone completely silent, a multitude of flabbergast.

The executor told him if anything should happen to the bird, or if he ever chose not to take care of it, he would have to forfeit the inheritance and estate.

At first, this seemed simple enough, but the animal turned out to be insufferable. It bit whenever he fed it, it crapped on everything, and taunted him constantly. The parrot seemed to have a supernatural sense for which buttons to push to get under his skin.

After one particularly bad day of ceaseless abuse, the man was fed up. He yanked the parrot from its perch, ripped open the freezer, and hurled the creature in, slamming the door behind it.

The parrot's muffled curses continued, followed by a terrible shriek, then silence. The man grew concerned, fearing his temper had cost the beast its life and him his new fortune.

After a moment, the parrot once again spoke, uttering a meek apology. Shocked and relieved, the man opened the freezer. There stood the parrot, shivering in the cold. He extended his hand, onto which it tenderly climbed. Looking him in the eye, the parrot squawked, ""Sir, I apologize for my behavior. Truly, I have not been myself since your aunt died, and I'm afraid I've been taking it out on you. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?""

Stunned at this sudden change in the bird's demeanor, the man nodded. The parrot sighed in relief and gazed back into the freezer. ""If you don't mind my asking, ...what did the turkey do?""","A man inherited a massive sum of money from his great aunt, but it came with a catch...",384

It was piling cup in our materiel yard and so we had a meeting with the supply squadron about returning some of it to the supply system vs. sending it off as scrap (colloquially called reutilization). Supply had sent a Major to the meeting.  During the course of the meeting I had ignorantly used the words ""surplus"" and ""excess"" interchangeably.  The major stopped me and asked, ""lieutenant, which is it? Excess or surplus""?  To which I replied ""what's the difference""?

But searching around he finds that they are all very expensive.  He finally finds one at a discount a a local pet shop but it has a crooked beak. 

He decides to buy it anyway because he's read on the internet that it can be carefully filed straight.  The shop owner says ""you realize this parrot has a crooked beak? ""

""Yes sir"" says the boy ""but I've read that it can be carefully filed straight""

""That's true"" replied the shop owner ""but there is a nerve in that beak.  And if you hit that nerve,  you'll kill that bird""

""I'm going to be super careful"" the boy promises

""Alright"" says the owner ""I'll sell you the parrot but don't bring me back a dead bird wanting a refund because you hit that nerve and killed that bird""

""I promise I won't"" he swore and started home with his new pet. 

On the boy's way home a man comments to the boy ""That's a good looking parrot son.  Oh,  but it looks like it's beak is a little crooked""

""Yes sir,  but I'm going to file it straight. "" he said confidently. 

""I think I've heard about doing that and it working out fine,  but I've also heard that there's a nerve in the beak and if you hit that nerve you'll kill that bird. ""

""I'm going to be very careful"" the boy replies 

At home the boy shows the parrot to his father. 

""That's a fine looking parrot boy"" his father says ""looks like his beak is a little crooked though. I've heard that you can file it straight. ""

""Yes sir,  I intend to""

""Son, there's a nerve in that parrot's beak. If you hit that nerve you'll kill that bird ""

""I KNOW"" he said exasperated ""I'm going to be very careful! ""

The next day a very sad looking boy shuffled into the pet store holding a cardboard box. 

""Boy!  I told you not to bring me a dead bird because you filed into the nerve! ""The owner exclaimed. 

""But sir I didn't hit the nerve! ""The boy cried ""I crushed his head in the vice""

When a group of religious leaders had strolled through and gathered at the bar, he had wondered‚Äîa little more actively‚Äîif he had ever actually seen any such persons in his bar before. If he had, he couldn't remember. He served their drinks and continued to clean and straighten his surroundings, talking to his usual patrons.

When a group of plaid-clad individuals walked in talking about their individual theories on science and math and other things Greg didn't really understand, he started to get a little bit suspicious. A frown settled itself into the lines of his face and tugged downward at his mouth. He cleaned a little more rigidly.

It was when the horse walked in that Greg got pissed.

""So, I guess I'm supposed to ask, 'Why the long face now?' Is that right?"" Greg screamed at the horse. He threw his towel down and put his hands on his hips.

The hum of the bar abruptly stopped.

""Um, son, horses can't talk,"" the Rabbi in the corner told him gently.

The group of blond women murmured in agreement and the scientists all nodded enthusiastically. 

""That said,"" one scientist spoke up, ""it is quite dangerous to be in a bar with a horse. Shall we go?""

The people all gathered their things and left, emptying the bar but for Greg and the horse.

""Well, that sucks,"" Greg said.

""Yeah, I'm pretty sad about it,"" the horse whispered.

‚ÄúWell, by all appearances I‚Äôm viewing this current avian with a binocular magnification power of 7 and lens diameter of 35mm, an exit pupil size of 3 mm with. Relative brightness of 18.5mm.,‚Äù the Radiologist says. ‚ÄúThis affords a view of a  creature of flight that is 58 centimeter in length with an 89 cm wingspan.

The German throws the fish back and says ""I wish for a mug of beer that will never empty"", and immediately a foaming mug of ice-cold German ale appears in his hand. He takes a long swig and when he puts it down, it's still miraculously full! The Frenchman and Englishman are, of course, amazed.

""I wish,"" said the Frenchman, ""For a wall to be built around France, ten miles high and ten miles thick, so that nobody can get in and nobody can get out.""

The fish screws up its eyes in concentration for a moment then says. ""Done! And what do you want?""

""Is there a wall around France?"" asks the Englishman

""Yes."" replies the fish.

""Is it ten miles high and ten miles thick?""

""Yes.""

""And can nobody get in, and nobody get out?""
