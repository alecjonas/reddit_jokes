you found Jesus me brother?'



The drunk again answers, 'No, OI I haven't found Jesus.'

he begins kicking his arms and legs he pulls him up. The preacher again
asks the drunk, 'For the love of God have you found Jesus?'

A mechanic was removing a cylinder-head from the motor
of a Harley motorcycle when he spotted a well-known cardiologist in
his shop.

The cardiologist was there waiting for the service manager to come
and take a look at his bike when the mechanic shouted across the garage..

""Hey, Doc, want to take a look at this?""

The cardiologist, a bit surprised, walked over to where the mechanic 
was working on the motorcycle.

The mechanic straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag
and asked, ""So Doc, look at this engine. I open its' heart, take the valves out,
repair any damage, and then put them back in, and when I finish, it works 
just like new. So how come I make $39,675 a year and you get the
really big bucks ($1,695,759) when you and I are doing basically the
same work?""

The cardiologist paused, smiled and leaned over, then whispered to
the mechanic...........

He went to his local parlor and explained his idea, and the tattoo artist said ""I've done this before, you'll need to become erect."" The artist gave him some mags and twenty minutes later, the man had WENDY up his shaft. Afterwards, he noticed he could only see W-Y while not erect. He shrugged it off, thinking she would only see it while he's aroused.

Excited to have an intimate night, he took his fiance out to a fancy dinner to set the mood. After a drink he excused himself to the restroom, stood in the middle of three urinals and went. A large black man then took the urinal next to him, and followed suit. Difficult to resist, the man took a quick peek at the black man's dong and noticed an identical ""W-Y"".

The man, curious and angry, stood tall and said ""what the fuck man, did you date Wendy too?"" The black man sees him looking at his tattoo, and says ""oh no man, I don't know her.""

""The rabbit is under the hat! The rabbit is under the hat!""

""There are two coins in the cup! There are two coins in the cup!""

The magician stared at the parrot. The parrot stared at the magician. For 20 minutes they just stared hard at each other. Until finally the parrot said,

“Boy, it sure is coming down out there. Would you happen to know if the rain’s supposed to let up anytime soon?” asks the trucker. The store clerk pauses, then proceeds to shove his hand down the back of his jeans and stick his index finger up his ass. He swirls it around for a moment before pulling it out and popping it in his mouth. 

The trucker is frozen in shock as the clerk stands there sucking on his finger with a furrowed brow, as if deep in thought. Finally, he takes his finger out of his mouth and replies loudly in a thick country accent, “Half an hour! Sun’s gon’ come out in bout half an hour.”

The trucker, still shocked, takes a seat in the corner and decides to wait and see if the clerk is correct. Sure enough, 30 minutes later the rain stops and the sun starts shining through the clouds. The trucker approaches the clerk again “That was incredible, how could you tell that the rain would stop?” The clerk smiles and says “I checked the weather this morning”.",A trucker is driving his regular route from St Louis to New Orleans,4

Once he's arrived, the new rooster walks up to the old one and says,""Listen here, Gramps! This whole farm is mine now!""

The old rooster says, ""C'mon buddy? At least let me stick around with the old hens? We'll stay in the back?""

The new rooster is adamant ""No way! All the hens are mine!"".

The old rooster sighs, and offers a proposition: that the two of them race around the farmhouse and if the old rooster wins he can stay on the farm, if he loses then he'll leave and let the new rooster take over.

The only catch is that since the old rooster isn't in very good shape, he needs a head start.

So the roosters line up, the old one has his head start, and the new rooster takes off.

As he comes round the front of the house, the old rooster is just in front of him. He is so close to beating him. He stretches out his neck and leaps forward, desperate to close the gap between them.

That's when the farmer looks up from the front porch and sees the two roosters; he takes out his gun, shoots the new rooster in the head, and says,

""Damn! Third gay rooster this week!""","The stud rooster at a poultry farm is getting old, so the farmer buys a new one.",190

'Talking Dog For Sale'. He rings the bell and the owner appears and tells him the dog is in the backyard.


The guy goes into the backyard and sees a nice looking

Labrador retriever sitting there.


You talk?' he asks. 



'Yep,' the Lab replies. 



After the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog talk, he says 'So, what's your story?' 

The Lab looks up and says, 'Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was

pretty young..I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA.

In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping.' 

I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running.....but the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.'



'I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.' 



The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.  Ten dollars,' the guy says.



Ten dollars? This dog is amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheap?'

Suddenly out of the bottle comes a Genie. The Mexican is stunned and
the Genie says, ""Hello master, I will grant you one wish; anything
you want.""

The Mexican begins thinking, ""Well, I really like drinking tequila.""
Finally the Mexican says, ""I wish to drink tequila whenever I want,
so make me pee tequila.""

The Genie grants him his wish.

When the Mexican gets home, he gets a glass out of the cupboard and
pees in it. He looks at the glass and it's clear. Looks like tequila.
Then he smells the liquid. Smells like tequila. So he takes a taste
and it is the best tequila he has ever tasted.

The Mexican yells to his wife, ""Consuelo, Consuelo, come quickly!""
She comes running down the hall and the Mexican takes another glass
out of the cupboard and fills it. He tells her to drink it. It is
tequila.

Consuelo is reluctant but goes ahead and takes a sip. It is the best
tequila she has ever tasted. The two drank and partied all night.

The next night the Mexican comes home from work and tells his wife to
get two glasses out of the cupboard. He proceeds to fill the two
glasses. The result is the same. The tequila is excellent and the
couple drinks until the sun comes up.

Finally Friday night comes and the Mexican comes home and tells his
wife, ""Consuelo, grab one glass from the cupboard and we will drink
Tequila.""

His wife gets the glass from the cupboard and sets it on the table.

The Mexican begins to fill the glass; and when he fills it, his wife
asks him, ""But Pancho, why do we need only one glass?""

Pancho raises the glass and says, ""Because tonight, Mi Amor, you
drink from the bottle.""",A Mexican is strolling down the street in Mexico City and kicks a bottle lying in the street.,149

""Yeah?"", says the hippie.

""Yeah!"", say the bus driver. ""She goes to the cemetery every Tuesday night at midnight to pray, so all you have to do is dress up in a robe with a hood, put some of that luminous powder stuff in your beard, and pop up in the cemetery claiming to be God.""

The hippie decides to give it a try, and arrives in the cemetery dressed as suggested on the next Tuesday night. ""I am God,"" he declares to the nun, keeping the hood low about his face. Have sex with me.""

The nun agrees without question, but begs him to restrict himself to anal sex as she is desperate not to lose her virginity.

'God' agrees, and promptly has his wicked way with her. As he finishes, he jumps up, throws back his hood with a flourish and cries ""Ha-ha, I'm the hippie!""

The husband would come home from work and yell at his wife for not having dinner ready. The wife would yell at the husband for ignoring all the cleaning she's done when he tracked his muddy shoes in. They never tried to make each other happy anymore; it was just too much effort, and they were both tired. 

They tried counseling and therapy, and they were given many things to try. They set aside one night a week for date night, but they could never agree what to eat or what movie to watch. They made a list of chores, but could never agree who should be responsible for which chores. They tried to spend time with friends, but could never agree who's friends they would visit. 

Eventually the husband starting drinking. He would spend each night after work going to bars just so he wouldn't have to face going home. The wife started spending more time online chatting with strangers and fantasizing about meetups. The times they did spend together were filled with yelling and arguing. 

The husband starting carrying a flask with him wherever he went. He would wake up and immediately start drinking, and he wouldn't stop until he passed out at night. He could hardly remember what it felt like to be sober. 

The wife move from conversations online to coffee dates to motel infidelities. She never felt so alive as she did when driving to have sex with a stranger, and she never felt so worthless and dead inside as she did on the drive home. 

The husband and wife decided enough was enough. They would get divorced before the relationship became violent. They spent months fighting each other and arguing about who would get each little thing they owned. They brought in lawyers to fight for custody over simple things like the tennis rackets and the silverware set. They argued until the last minute before they turned in the paperwork the day before their court date. 

That day was just like all the others. The husband woke up, still a little drunk from the night before, and hit the bottle before speaking a word. The wife dolled herself up in the hopes she may meet a mysterious stranger at the courthouse and feel something other than sorrow. They got in the car and set out. 

The husband had barely pulled the car out of the driveway when the arguments started. He was drunk, but refused to let his wife drive. She hated his driving and wanted to listen to her music. It wasn't long before his anger got the best of him and he started driving erratically. He slammed on the gas and swerved around a corner. Their car smashed into a parked Honda. The airbags deployed as smoke billowed out of the engine. The car caught fire, and the husband and wife struggled to free themselves from the wreckage. The owner of the Honda arrived just in time to pull the couple from the burning car. 

Having been through a near death experience, the couple began to apologize for the first time in years through streaming tears and muffled sobs. The husband would stop drinking and help with the dishes. The wife would spend less time focused on herself and more time supporting her husband and the stress of his job. They were both sorry for the things they had done to each other. They decided they would work together, support each other, and try to make the relationship work. 

Two weeks later, the husband and wife were having lunch with their mutual friends. They were sober, honest, happy, in love, and most of all they were not arguing. Their friends noticed the clear difference in the relationship and said, ""Wow! It seems like you guys are doing so much better!""

The husband smiled at his wife and looked to their friends. He took a deep breath and said, ""Our lives are changed, and we couldn't be happier, and it's all because we finally struck an Accord.""",A difficult marriage.,4

The two guys reply, ""Well, you know, we're from Michigan, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy for a chance to warm up a bit, you know.""

The devil decides that these two aren't miserable enough and turns up the heat. The next morning, he stops by again and there they are, still dressed in their parkas, mittens and hats.
The devil asks them again, ""It's awfully hot down here, can't you guys feel that?""

Again, the guys reply, ""Well, like we told you yesterday, we're from Michigan, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy to warm up a little bit, you know.""

The devil gets a little steamed up and he decides to fix the two guys. He cranks the heat up as high as it will go. The people are wailing and screaming everywhere. He stops by the room with the two guys from Michigan and finds them in light jackets and hats, grilling sausage and drinking beer. The devil is astonished. ""Everyone down here is in abject misery, and you seem to be enjoying yourselves.""

The two Michiganders reply, ""Well, ya know, we don't get too much warm weather up there in Michigan, we've just got to have a cookout when the weather is this nice.""

The devil is absolutely furious, he can hardly see straight. Finally, he comes up with an answer. These two love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. He decides to turn all the heat in hell off.

The next morning, the temperature is below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere, the people are shivering so bad, they are unable to wail, moan or gnash their teeth.
The devil smiles and heads for the room with the 2 Michiganders. He finds them back in their parkas, mittens and hats. They are jumping up and down and cheering.
The devil was dumbfounded. ""I don't understand. When I turn the heat up, you're happy. Now it's freezing cold, and you're happy. What is wrong with you two?""

Once upon a time, there was a fierce battle raging in the jungle between the Imperial Guard, and the local ork warband. Eventually, they were running so low on supplies that everyone only had the ammo on their person left. Gathering his courage, one of the guardsmen floated the idea of a tactical advance towards the home base to their commissar.

""Sir, at this rate, we will have no ammo left in an hour.""

""Don't be ridiculous, soldier! All you need is your faith in the Emperor.""

The commissar looked at him disapprovingly, raised his pistol at a charging ork, and yanked it up while shouting BANG! To everyone's surprise, the ork fell to the ground, unmoving. 

Emboldened, the soldiers started imitating him as they ran out of ammo, and the orks kept falling. Eventually they were really getting into it, even tossing rocks as grenades, and the battle was soon turning in their favour. Suddenly though, the orks broke through the ""fire"" and trampled the guardsmen. Before he lost consciousness, the last thing he heard, was the orks' chanting.

  Well, late one afternoon, the Air Force folks out at Area 51 were  very surprised to see a Cessna landing at their ""secret"" base. They  immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an  interrogation room. 

  The pilot's story was that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and  spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel.  The Air  Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him  overnight during the investigation. 

  By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really  was lost and wasn't a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a  terrifying ""you-did-not-see-a-base"" briefing, complete with threats  of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was  that-a-way on such and such a heading, and sent him on his way. 

  The next day, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same  Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the  plane...only this time there were two people in the plane. 

  The same pilot jumped out and said, ""Do anything you want to me, but  my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last  night!""",Area 51,91

The good news is that you get to choose how you die."" 

 The Frenchman says, ""I take ze poison."" The chief gives him some  poison. The Frenchman cries, ""Vive la France!"", quaffs the poison, and dies.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'","Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy.

He then takes her to a magic show and pays extra to have her involved in the main act as the woman who disappears within the act.  She is beaming with joy.

She's loving every minute of it as they return to their hotel.  They check in and decide to go to the poker floor for some gambling before heading up to their room.  They play a few hands, win a little and the husband excuses himself to go the bathroom.

Unfortunately, a new, fairly naive employee is running the concierge desk and finds the woman by herself.  He mentions to her that the room is now ready and that Dumbo was already delivered.  Since she had no idea what he was talking about as the husband handled booking everything she just assumed it was some exciting surprise.

The husband comes back and she motions it's time to head up to bed with a suggesting wink.

As they get to their room, a massive sprawling suite, the husband tells her he has two more surprises for her.  There is a strange smell in the suite but it's beautiful and overlooks the strip. They head out to the balcony and on ice is their favorite wine from their honeymoon.  They start to loosen their clothing and really relax into the evening... it's getting quite steamy between the two.

The husband says, ok I have one more surprise, wait here.  Five minutes later, he calls out for her to come to the bathroom.  He's set the stage as he has lit candles and a warm bubble bath poured with smooth jazz playing in the background.  They begin to undress but suddenly there is a knock on the door.

The husband winks at his wife.  He goes to answer the door and tells her to get in the tub. 

The night of surprises continue as the husband walks back in with a naked man.  The wife gasps and is very confused.  The husband begins to tell her about some very surprising, erotic fantasies he has had about a threesome.  She continues to have a very confused look on her face.  Shes never had a night like this in all 15 years of her marriage.

Seeing that his wife isn't into this, he asks the man to give them a second.  He leans over to the tub and says, ""Is everything ok?  I thought you would be into this.  Maybe I read this wrong but I thought I might like it too.""

She stares at him and that loving gaze he saw earlier in the night turned into a glare.

Several awkward moments of silence pass and the suspense is upsetting to the husband.  He thinks to himself, ""what was i thinking..."" ""does she think I am homosexual?"" ""Am I?"" ""Did I just screw up 15 perfect years of marriage??""

""Please say something!"" He pleads.

She raises her arms in disbelief.

Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs.

She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.

""That's nice,"" she thinks, ""but I want more."" So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.

""Wow,"" she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

""Oh, mercy me!"" she exclaims, ""I can hardly stand it!"" Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

PLEASE NOTE:

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.

The first floor has wives that love sex.

The second floor has wives that love sex and have money and like beer.

The pilot did all kinds of twists and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word was heard. He did all his tricks over again, but still not a word. They landed and the pilot turned to Joe: “By golly, I did everything I could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn’t.”
