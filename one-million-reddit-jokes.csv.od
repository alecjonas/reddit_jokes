Thirty minutes later a man shows up at his door with a whiffle ball bat, handcuffs, a Chihuahua, and a shot gun.
The home owner is perplexed so the exterminator explains, “Well you see, I’m going to climb up the tree and start hitting the gorilla with the whiffle ball bat.  When the gorilla falls out of the tree this here Chihuahua has been specially trained to go for its private parts.  When a gorilla is attacked in the privates it will instinctively cross its arms to protect itself.  When it crosses its arms I’ll jump down from the tree and put on the handcuffs.
The homeowner says, “Wow, that’s amazing, but what is the shotgun for?”
The exterminator replies, “That’s for you, if I fall out of the tree before the gorilla does, shoot the Chihuahua.

he takes along his personal lawyer because he knows sign language. The Godfather tells the lawyer, “Ask him where the money is!”
The lawyer, using sign language, asks Guido, “Where’s the money?”
Guido signs back, “I don’t know what you are talking about.” The lawyer tells the Godfather, “He says he doesn’t know what you are talking about.”
The Godfather pulls out a pistol, puts it to Guido’s head and says, “Ask him again or I’ll kill him!”
The lawyer signs to Guido, “He’ll kill you if you don’t tell him.”
Guido trembles and signs back, “OK! You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed at my cousin Bruno’s house.”

He has been driving all night, and as the sun starts to rise, he feels the need to stop and commune with nature. He pulls to the side of the road, parks, and walks out into the sage brush.
As he is standing there, looking around at the beauty of the early morning, he notices a lever sticking out of the ground. After a few moments, he walks over, walks all the way around, and then reaches out to grasp the lever. Just as he does, he hears a voice say, ""Don't touch that lever.""
The driver jumps about two feet off the ground, and as he comes down, he looks around. No one is to be seen. Thinking it was just his imagination, he again reaches for the lever. Again the voice yells, ""I said don't touch that lever!"" Being more prepared, the driver senses the location of the voice and looks down under a sage brush. There he sees a small snake.
The driver, in much astonishment, said, ""Was that you that just spoke?""
The snake said, ""Yes. I have to keep people from touching that lever. If the lever is moved, it will be the end of the world.""
The driver, still rather astonished, said, ""What is your name? And will you talk on TV?"" The snake said his name was Nate and that he wasn't interested in going on TV; anyway, he had to stay and watch the lever to see that it wasn't moved. The driver said, ""Look, I will get the networks to send out camera crews. That way, you can inform the entire world about the danger of the lever.""
Nate thought that over and allowed as how there was a great deal of sense to the idea. The driver, true to his word, got the network camera crews out. They put on broadcasts in which Nate warned the entire world of the dangers of moving the lever.
A few weeks later, another truck driver was going through the area. He was following an oil tanker, and the tanker sprang a leak. When the driver's truck hit the slick, it went out of control, and he found himself headed straight for the lever. He remembered seeing Nate on the TV telling about the lever and so he knew that if he hit it, he would cause the world to end. He strove, with all his might to maneuver the truck. Finally, at the last moment, he was able to swerve, but he ran over Nate, the snake, and killed him flat!
The truck driver was heard to say ""Well, better Nate than lever.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Everyone knows Dave.,19

Our man orders a cold one and sits a few seats away from the man in the suit. After they've each had a few sips, the man in the suit looks over, smiles, and says, ""Hey - wanna see something really cool?"" 

Our man replies, ""sure, fella. What's up?"" 

To which the man in the suit replies, ""The tall buildings around here make the wind do crazy things. If you go up to the 11th floor roof on this building, you can jump off the roof at the back alley, and the wind will ease you to the ground, like a little downy feather.""

""Bullshit."" Says our man. ""Gonna have to see it to believe it."", sipping his beer.

The man in the suit asks the barkeep to watch their beers, says, ""Sure thing, mister."" And stands up. Heading for the stairway door, he gestures our man to follow.
Once they reach the roof, the man in the suit calmly walks off the back of the roof, plummets 8 stories down, then slows - drifting aimlessly and slowly to the alley below. He lands on his feet, barely bending his knees, and waves our man to follow.

Stunned, our man shakes his head and yells down, ""Bullshit. Do that again!""

This time when the suited and bespectacled man arrives on the roof, our man checks him for wires or gadgets with a quick pat-down. The man in the suit asks, ""Satisfied?"" To which he receives a perplexed nod. So he walks off the roof as before, and as before he plummets 8 stories, then drifts down the last three stories, landing gently as before. He waves our man down again.

Our man shrugs, thinks to himself that this actually looks like fun, and walks off the roof. He plummets down 8 stories like a rock, wind screaming at his ears. He then continues to plummet the final 3 stories without slowing, windmilling his limbs. A scream forms, then is cut short as he hits pavement, splattering all over the alley in a wet sticky mess.

The bespectacled man walks back into the bar, picking bits of human off of his suit. The bartender shakes his head, frowns, and says to him, ""Clark Kent, you're a real asshole when you drink.""","A man walks into a downtown bar. It's early afternoon,",2

(George and Betty).

They are sitting staring out of the large bay window, looking out on to the beautiful garden.

Betty: Penny for your thoughts George?

George: ach sorry Betty, I was just thinking about my youth and all the things we used to do.

Betty: So, if you could pick one thing from your younger days that you miss the most, what would it be?

George goes very quiet and gives it a lot of thought. 
Finally he turns to Betty and says;

George: Well I don't want to be crude but I'd have to say sex.

Betty: Oh? You know what, id probably agree with you. I miss that the most too. I was a bit of a tearaway in my younger days. (Giggles).

There's a slightly awkward silence between the two then George softly says;

George: Well you know what? Were both adults and although we're getting on a bit there's no reason we couldn't.....you know??

Betty: (Smiles coyly) Ok. Why not...

So they shuffle off to Bettys room and she climbs on to the bed, whilst George quietly shuts the door.

Betty struggles to slip off her massive old woman bloomers and George struggles into position and gets ready to ""go down"" on the old wrinkly woman.

He's down there for just 3 seconds when he suddenly leaps up, gagging and wretching. Eyes watering and saliva dripping from his bristley chin.

George: Oh God. I'm very sorry to be rude Betty BUT the smell down there is absolutely disgusting. 

Betty: (deeply embarrassed) Oh George, I'm so sorry. 
It's my arthritis. 

George: Arthritis?? You don't get arthritis in your pussy......

Betty: Oh no George. I don't have arthritis in my pussy.

It's in my shoulder. I can't wipe my Arse!!!",George and Betty get frisky!!,4
post,6bcvv4,2qh72,jokes,false,1494879973,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6bcvv4/the_pretty_pink_princess/,self.jokes,,"There once was a pretty pink Princess who lives in a pretty pink castle where everything was pretty pink. The walls were pretty pink,. The halls were pretty pink. The bathroom was pretty pink, and had a pretty pink sink which held a pretty pink toothbrush in a pretty pink glass. Everything was pretty pink. 

Now, one day the pretty pink Princess was preparing to go to go to sleep. She got out of her pretty pink pantsuit and put on her pretty pink night gown before climbing into her pretty pink bed. She closed her eyes and prepared to enter her pretty pink dreams where there were pretty pink clouds and pretty pink rivers running through pretty pink valleys. Just as she was about to drift off to her pretty pink dreamland, she heard a knock at her pretty pink castle's pretty pink front door. 

So the pretty pink Princess climbed out of her pretty pink bed and quickly changed back into her pretty pink pantsuit. She opened the door from her pretty pink bedroom, went down the pretty pink hallway to the pretty pink stairs, and began her descent. The knock comes again against the pretty pink front door as she crosses her pretty pink foyer and reaches for the pretty pink door knob. Once the pretty pink door is open, the pretty pink princess is face to face with a homeless man.

""I was hoping I could spend the night here, in your pretty pink castle, Princess. "" The man spoke as he peered into the pretty pink foyer, bewildered. 

""Of course!"" The pretty pink Princess replied, and stepped off to the side, allowing him entrance. ""Just this way, I'll show you to my pretty pink guest room!"" 

So the pretty pink Princess closed the pretty pink front door, led the man across the pretty pink entrance hall to the pretty pink door between the pretty pink staircases that would lead upstairs. The pretty pink Princess opened the door, and gestured inside to a pile of pretty pink sleeping bags. The man stepped inside, slipped into a pretty pink bag and thanked her for her hospitality as the pretty pink Princess shut off the pretty pink light, closed the pretty pink door and began across the pretty pink foyer to the foot of the pretty pink stairs.

The pretty pink Princess stepped off the pretty pink stairs, and made her way down the pretty pink hallway, past many pretty pink doors until she reached her pretty pink bedroom. She closed the pretty pink bedroom door, and changed back into her pretty pink sleeping gown before climbing back into her pretty pink bed. The pretty pink Princess shut her eyes and was getting ready to float away to her pretty pink dreamland when she heard another knock at the pretty pink front door.

 So the pretty pink Princess climbed out of her pretty pink bed again, changed back into her pretty pink pantsuit and headed for the room's pretty pink door. She flung it open and rushed down the pretty pink hallway to the pretty pink stairs where she bounded down them two at a time, sliding across the pretty pink tiled foyer to the pretty pink front door before another knock could be heard. The pretty pink Princess flung it open and offered a warm smile to the homeless man on the other side who also requested to spend the night in her pretty pink castle. 

The pretty pink Princess let out a sigh and let him in, closing the pretty pink door behind him before leading him across the pretty pink foyer to the pretty pink door between the pretty pink stairs and opening it. The pretty pink Princess motioned to the pile of pretty pink sleeping bags, and wished the two men a good night. The pretty pink light was put back out, and the pretty pink door to the pretty pink guest room was closed once more as the pretty pink Princess, tired, returned up the pretty pink stairs.

The pretty pink Princess moved along the pretty pink hallway to her pretty pink bedroom door, and moved into the pretty pink room being sure to close and lock her pretty pink door behind her. She didn't bother to change out of her pretty pink pantsuit, and rather just collapsed on her pretty pink bed, hoping to finally reach her pretty pink dream. But another knock could be heard at the pretty pink front door just as the pretty pink Princess began to count pretty pink sheep in hopes of sleep.

The pretty pink Princess rolled out of her pretty pink bed and stormed over to her pretty pink bedroom door to unlock and open it. Once the pretty pink Princess has opened it, she storms down the pretty pink hallway, shaking the pretty pink paintings on the pretty pink walls. She makes her way down the pretty pink stairs, across the pretty pink foyer to the pretty pink front door and opens it.

It's yet another homeless man seeking shelter in the pretty pink Princess' pretty pink castle. The pretty pink Princess lets out an annoyed sigh and lets him in, shutting and locking the pretty pink front door behind him. The pretty pink Princess points across the pretty pink foyer to the pretty pink guest room and begins to lead him towards it. She opens the pretty pink door, points him to the pretty pink bags, and silently wishes the three men inside to have pretty pink nightmares as she shuts them in. Her footsteps echo off the pretty pink tiles as she makes her way to the pretty pink stairs once more, hoping to finally get to her pretty pink dreamland. 

The pretty pink Princess tiredly makes her way down the pretty pink hallway to her pretty pink bedroom, and collapses on her pretty pink bed with the pretty pink door still open. The pretty pink Princess begins to count her pretty pink sheep, and after a moment, she's standing atop a pretty pink mountain having a pretty pink tea party with her pretty pink friends.

The following morning, the pretty pink Princess wakes up, and stretches as she climbs out of her pretty pink bed. She changes out of her pretty pink pantsuit and a different pretty pink outfit, then makes her way across the pretty pink hallway, down the pretty pink stairs to the pretty pink guest room. The pretty pink Princess knocks on the pretty pink door, and asks the three men inside what they'd like for their pretty pink breakfast. 

The first man answers, ""I'd like corn pops.""

The second man replies, ""I'd like frosted flakes.""

The third man also answers, ""I'd like corn pops.""

The moral of the story is homeless men like corn pops more than frosted flakes. ",The Pretty Pink Princess,0

He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.
He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.
He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right.
He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.
He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.
By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.
As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.
Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.
He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.
He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.
He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.
Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.
Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.
As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.
He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference and keep himself from passing out.
He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.
He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills, dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water. Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.
After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.
After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.
He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.
He walks through the sand.
After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.
But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.
Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.
While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape - shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.
He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.
Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can't tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look.
He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune. After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.
He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.
So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance.
He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just keeps crawling.
Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center, where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area.
His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface.
Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.
He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling.
It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's hearing. He would swear that someone just said, ""Greetings, traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?""
He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again. Better this time.
Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet out of the stone, at an angle.
And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.
He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from this spot.
Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.

She is ecstatic! She runs quickly in her robe out to the driveway, ready to rip the box apart, but to her dismay she finds only a bunch of air. Sadly, she regards the box.

The couple agreed, and off they went. 

Over the next few counseling sessions, the pastor challenged them on their resolve. Each time, they answered in the affirmative: though it was difficult, they were abstaining. 

The final session took place the day before their wedding. From the moment they entered the room, the pastor could tell something was up. The woman was weeping quietly, and the man had a look of chagrin as he said, ""Pastor, we have a confession to make. As much as we want to attend this church, and as much as we wanted you to perform the ceremony, we couldn't control our passions. My bride-to-be dropped a box of light bulbs last night, and as she bent over to pick them up, I was overcome with desire, and we made passionate love.""

Disappointed, the pastor said, ""Well, I must stand by my word. You have broken your vows of chastity, and I cannot perform your ceremony. Furthermore, you are no longer welcome at this church"".

Pacifist, role model of MLK, and arguably the most important man in the movement of Indian independence. Of course, aside from his upstanding character, he did have a multitude of physical flaws. As an Indian peasant, he rarely wore shoes because he was too poor to afford them, so his feet blistered and hardened on the hot ground. His hunger strikes, one of his trademark tools of civil disobedience, left him feeble and weak from hunger. These hunger strikes also made him hallucinate as they grew longer, and people around him claimed he spoke of the future. When he did eat, it was usually stale bread, or dried nuts and fruits. This, combined with never brushing his teeth, lead to breath with the power to knock down an Indian elephant. This is all common knowledge. What you may not have known, however, Gandhi's strict yet kind demeanor was the inspiration for a great many different movie and theatrical figures, including Mary Poppins.

They've all but given up hope to make it out alive when they stumble upon a golden lamp in the sand. One of them picks it up and start rubbing the sand off of it. As the last grain of sand falls off the lamp a magical genie appears and with much power in his voice says: ""Thank you for freeing me from my prison. I will grant each of you 3 wishes"".

The 3 men are excited and start thinking about their first wish.  
The first man quickly says ""I want to have a billion dollars!"" POOF, he's suddenly holding a printout that says he has 1,000,000,000.50 dollars on his account.

The second man thinks for another minute and then confidently says ""I wish to be the richest man alive!"" POOF, he's holding papers that show his net worth is over double that of Bill Gates!

While the first 2 men are getting excited thinking about what to buy with all their money, the third one continues to think for another 10 minutes about his wish.  
Finally he says ""I wish for my left arm to spin clockwise until the day i die."" POOF, his left arm is now constantly spinning clockwise.

The genie says it's time for their second wish.

The first man almost immediately says ""I wish i had the most beautiful wife in the whole world!"" POOF, the most gorgeous and beautiful girl you've ever seen is wrapped around his arm.

The second man thinks for another minute before he exclaims ""I wish to be so handsome and charismatic, that i can get anyone to fall in love with me!"" POOF, he now has a handsome face and nice looking muscles. The first mans wife immediately starts flirting with him.

The third man thinks for another 10 minutes before he confidently says ""I wish for my right arm to spin counter-clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his right arm is now spinning in the opposite direction of his left arm.

""And for your last wish?"" the genie asks.

The first man says ""I wish me and my wife were in a big luxurious villa on a tropical island!"" POOF, the man and his wife disappear to their villa.

The second man thinks for a minute before he says ""I wish to be immortal and stay this age forever."" POOF, the man grabs his pocket knife and tries to stab himself with it, but no wounds appear on his body. Confidently he starts making his way out of the desert.

The third man thinks for another 10 minutes before he says ""I wish for my head to bob up and down forever."" POOF, his head now slowly bobs up and down.

The genie disappears in a big flash and the third man goes on his way.

After a many years the 3 men decide to meet up again and catch up on how they're doing.  
The first man happily says ""I'm doing great! I've invested my money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family are among the richest in the world! And to top it off my wife is a freak in the sheets!""  
The second man smiles and says ""I've funded many charities around the world with only a fraction of my wealth. I've traveled all over the world without a fear of dying and haven't aged a bit. And yes, your wife is pretty good in bed.""  
Finally the third guy walks into the bar, with his arms still spinning in opposite directions and his head slowly bobbing up and down. He sits down with the 2 other men and says

She lacked the creativity to name all of them so she just names them 1-100. 99 of the kids die. The only survivor is the kid named 90. 90 grows up and has kids of her own. One day, the kids find a stray dog. 90 did not want them to keep it. The kids decide to keep the dog secretly. They name the dog “this” so that they can say things like “Let’s take this outside” without 90 finding out. One day, this suddenly dies in a car accident.

Only 90’s kids remember this.

A family is at the dinner table. The son asks the father, “Dad, how many kinds of boobs are there?” The father, surprised, answers, “Well, son, a woman goes through three phases. In her 20s, a woman’s breasts are like melons, round and firm. In her 30s and 40s, they are like pears, still nice, hanging a bit. After 50, they are like onions.” “Onions?” the son asks. “Yes. You see them and they make you cry.” This infuriated his wife and daughter. The daughter asks, “Mom, how many different kinds of willies are there?” The mother smiles and says, “Well, dear, a man goes through three phases also. In his 20s, his willy is like an oak tree, mighty and hard. In his 30s and 40s, it’s like a birch, flexible but reliable. After his 50s, it’s like a Christmas tree.” “A Christmas tree?” the daughter asks. “Yes, dead from the root up and the balls are just for decoration.”",A family is at the dinner table.,43

post,6b6omb,2qh72,jokes,false,1494800886,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6b6omb/an_hr_manager_meets_st_peter/,self.jokes,,"An HR manager was knocked down (tragically) by a bus and was killed. Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her. “Before you get settled in” he said, “We have a little problem…you see, we’ve never had a HR manager make it this far before and we’re not really sure what to do with you.”

“Oh, I see,” said the woman, “can’t you just let me in?”

“Well, I’d like to,” said St Peter, “But I have higher orders. We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.”

“Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven”, said the woman. “Sorry, we have rules…” at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.



As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.

They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.

Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. “Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven,” he said.

So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. “So,” he said, “You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven”. “You must choose between the two.”

The woman thought for a second and replied: “Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.”

Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.

“I don’t understand,” stuttered the HR manager, “The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.”

The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, “Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.”",An HR Manager meets St. Peter,4

The Communist then turns to another friend.

""Petya, remember being sentenced in 1937 to 25 years in the gulag? Well, it was me who went to the NKVD. Please forgive me.""

""No hard feelings, my friend. You are forgiven"" says Petya.

""Misha, I must confess to you that I had you sent to the penal battalion in 1942. I am terribly sorry about that day.""

""Please my friend, we all forgive you. You may go in peace"" says Misha.

""Thank you so much guys for being with me throughout all these years"" says the old communist with a tear streaming down his face. ""I don't know where I'd be if it wasn't for you. I never knew you loved me that much despite me being a stool pigeon.""

His friends are visibly touched by his words. Finally, gathers his last strength and says. 

""And in honor of our deep friendship I want you to fulfill my last wish. See that cactus plant on the windowsill? As soon as I die, I want you to take it and shove it up my ass.""

Just as his friends were about to say something, the old communist took his last breath and died.

So Petya rushes to the window, takes the cactus plant off and together they shove it up their dead friend's butt. Suddenly, the friends hear a loud banging on the door followed by a gruff voice shouting:

""Open up, it's the police. We've received information that an old Bolshevik has been tortured to death.""",An old Russian Communist is on his deathbed.,468

Thinking that it would be too much of a hassle to remove each individual BB, she decides that it shouldn't be too harmful to leave them in.

Later that evening the woman and her children sit down to eat and she serves the cake. All three children eat their portions and thank her before heading off to bed.

An hour later the first daughter runs up to her mom and says ""Mommy, mommy! I'm peeing BB's and it really hurts!"" Unsure how exactly to handle the situation, the woman says, ""It's fine, just go to sleep and you'll feel better in the morning,"" and the daughter heads back to bed.

Another hour later the second daughter runs up and says ""Mommy, mommy! I'm peeing BB's and it really hurts!"" The woman says, ""It's fine, just go to sleep and you'll feel better in the morning,"" and the second daughter heads back to bed.

Another hour later her son comes running and says ""Mommy! Mommy!"" And the mom says ""I know I know, you're peeing BB's and it really hurts. Just go to sleep and you'll feel better in the morning.""

To which the son replies, ""No! I was in the backyard jacking off and I shot the dog!""

The man got frustrated and alerted the flight attendant of the potential problem. The flight attendant checked both the blonde's and the man's tickets and confirmed the blonde was in fact in the wrong seat.

""Ma'am, your ticket is for coach, you're sitting in first class. You'll need to move to your assigned seat.""

Again the blonde is completely undeterred by this and promptly states, ""I'm blonde and I'm beautiful and I'm going to New York.""

Eventually the pilot gets word of what's taking place in the cabin and goes out to see what he can do. He takes one look at the woman and gently whispers something into her ear. She quickly jumps up, grabs her belongings and rushes to coach.

Everyone is standing in shock at how fast he got her to move. When they ask him how he did it he simply replied, ""My wife is a blonde. All I told her is that first class is not going to New York.""",A blonde is boarding an airplane flying to New York City for the first time.,4

The blonde replied, ""Well, I bet he won't.""

After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass.

So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm.

Upon his return to his office after the mass, he found the following note on the door:

1) Sip the vodka, don't gulp.

2) There are 10 commandments, not 12.

3) There are 12 disciples, not 10.

4) Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.

5) Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.

6) We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C.

7) The Father, Son and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the spook.

8) David slew Goliath; he did not kick the shit out of him.

9) When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass.

10) We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T.""

11) When Jesus broke the bread at the last supper he said, ""Take this and eat it for it is my body."" He did not say ""Eat me"".

12) The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry"".

13) The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, Yeah God.

you the People. The nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class. And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that
makes sense."" So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to
check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. The little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting
to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father having sex with the nanny. He gives up and
goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, ""Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now."" The father says, ""Good,
son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about."" The little boy replies, ""Well, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, the

He had never been very good at speaking in front of large audiences, so he'd practiced at home constantly with a set of notecards.

When he was summoned to the podium, his palms were clammy and sweat was trickling behind his eyeglasses. Taking a deep breath, he stood behind the microphone and took out his notecards. Just then a massive bead of sweat went right into his eye, and as he reached up to wipe it away, he knocked the mic clean off the podium, and it fell to the ground.

""Terribly sorry! Sorry, I'll just...."" and as he spun to pick it up, his notecards showered to the floor.

""Haha, erm, I'll just collect these..."" and he bent over to pick them up. Just as he was grabbing his notes, he let loose a tremendous fart, right into the microphone.

The crowd roared, there was no containing them after this, and Drobkin, red-faced, ran off the stage, got in his car, drove home, and told his wife they had to move immediately.

Years passed. 

Drobkin changed his name. Moved to the other side of the country.  Taught in a similar field, and found similar success. Raised a family.

Eventually (under his new name of course) he wrote a pretty popular book, for academic standards, and was doing a circuit across the US. And as fate would have it, he was booked to do a signing in his old hometown. 

He checked into his hotel, and the clerk asked, ""First time visiting our fair city, Professor Smith?"" And old Drobkin says, ""Well...not exactly. People don't know this, but I lived here a long, long time ago. And something happened that made me leave, and I've not been back since.""

The clerk put down his pen and said, ""Sir, you're not asking for my advice, but I'm gonna give it to you. I've found, hearing the stories of so many people come and go, that while we relive our own mistakes, everyone else is too busy reliving their own to care.  So don't take it hard. Especially after, how long?""
