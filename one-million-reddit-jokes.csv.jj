One day while on an adventure he found an elephant in obvious pain, pawing at the ground. On the bottom of his foot, there was a large cut. Reginald took off his shirt and bandaged the elephant. The beast then dropped onto its knees, and lifted him with its trunk for him to climb on for a ride. For the rest of his vacation they were inseparable, and went on long rides daily. 

Eventually Harper returned to his country, with the wonderful memories of that elephant.

 7 years later, he moved to America, San Diego to be exact. One day, while exploring his new city, he went to the famous San Diego zoo. As if by fate, he felt drawn towards the elephants. Lo and behold, as he approached the mighty bars of their enclosure, one tired old elephant started pawing at the ground and then dropped onto its knees. Tears ran down Harper's face as he ran forward and squeezed through the bars, once again reunited. The elephant gracefully scooped him up with its trunk, and proceeded to brutally smash him to death on the bars of the cage.

Turns out it was a different elephant.","A wealthy British gentleman, Reginald Harper, took a trip to India...",218

He unwrapped the plain hamburger and carefully cut it in half, placing one half in front of his wife.

He then carefully counted out the French fries, dividing them into two piles and neatly placed one pile in front of his wife. He took a sip of the drink, his wife took a sip and then set the cup down between them. As he began to eat his few bites of hamburger, the people around them were looking over and whispering.

Obviously they were thinking, 'That poor old couple - all they can afford is one meal for the two of them.'

As the man began to eat his fries a young man came to the table and politely offered to buy another meal for the old couple. The old man said, they were just fine - they were used to sharing everything.

People closer to the table noticed the little old lady hadn't eaten a bite. She sat there watching her husband eat and occasionally taking turns sipping the drink..

Again, the young man came over and begged them to let him buy another meal for them. This time the old woman said 'No, thank you, we are used to sharing everything.'

Finally, as the old man finished and was wiping his face neatly with the napkin, the young man again came over to the little old lady who had yet to eat a single bite of food and asked 'What is it you are waiting for?'

Despite his vehement protests, his wife had arranged lunch with the whole family, including his witch of a mother-in-law. But Jim was a good man and said he'd be on his best behaviour. When the day arrived and the family had settled into the dining room, they began passing out their presents to Jim. His wife got him a lovely razor, and he thanked her for it earnestly. His father bought him two tickets to see Metallica that weekend, and he leapt from his chair with glee. His brother bought him a bottle of whisky, and he smiled and shared it with the family. Then it was his mother-in-laws turn. She handed him a brown paper bag, and in it was a sad looking, floral patterned fedora. Jim tried to feign a smile, thanked her shallowly, and put it on his head, but his dissatisfaction was obvious. His mother-in-law was furious. She whipped out her magic wand and started waving it in front of his face. She mumbled under her breath as the wand began to glow. The room grew dark as she uttered her magic words.

""**Forever on your head, the floral hat shall sit.
Sprout, will all the flowers and the branches and shit.
Cursed from this day until the end of time. Witches have a rule that all spells have to rhyme!**""

Jim screamed as the hat tightened around his head. He tried to pull it off, but it wouldn't budge! The floral patterns burst into life and real plants lifted themselves from the fabric, stretching into the real world. When Jim tried to pull them out, thicker stems replaced them. Amidst the chaos, his mother-in-law disappeared in a plume of black smoke.

With each passing day the hat grew larger and uglier. Spiny thorns protruding from the edges, and thick branches spiralling ever upward. Days turned into weeks, and Jim's life took a turn for the worst. His wife couldn't handle the extra gardening and left him. His boss and coworkers grew tired of the noisy birds residing on his head, and he was eventually let go. He couldn't afford his rent and ended up on the streets. Weeks turned into months, and Jim became a recluse, living in a large cave in the mountains, living off of the fruits of his hat garden. Years go by with Jim living all alone when one day an old woman wonders into his cave. It's his mother-in-law. She has an evil smirk on her face as she sees what's left of Jim. Massive trees reach out to the edges of every wall in the cave. Jim's head can barely be seen under the foliage, and he can no longer lift it off the ground more than an inch.
""Well, well, Jim."" the witch cackled. ""What do you think of your gift **now**?""
Jim hadn't spoken in so long, but he lifted his head as best as he could, licked his parched lips and said, ""It's growing on me.""",Jim's Birthday Hat,14

How? Well, let's just say a patient walks into his office with an illness. The doctor, after doing some checkups, gives his prescription for a medicine, which he even gives for free. It turns out, however, that the medicine actually makes the illness *worse*. Then, when they go back to the doctor, he prescribes a real medication for an absurd price. This strategy has given him tons of cash over the years with no suspicions. That is, until now.

Scientists have run checks over his ""medicine"" and discovered the truth. The doctor is jailed for his crimes and is scheduled to be killed via electric chair at midnight.

But, when the doctor sits on the electric chair, something happens. The officer assigned to flip the electric switch to do away with the criminal is flabbergasted at how the doctor is surviving the shocks at max power. Other officers witnessed this, and finally, on the next afternoon, he is freed from all charges due to this paranormal happening.

Unfortunately, the doctor is at it again, tricking his customers. His patients are more mad than ever, and due to a mob of angry, sick civilians, the doctor is jailed and scheduled to be subjected to the wrath of the electric chair at midnight *again*.

But alas! At the stroke of midnight, although the flashes of electricity emanating from the execution room lighted the correctional facility, the doctor did not perish. They released him again in absolute bafflement.

As you may have guessed by now, the doctor continues to scam and sicken his clients. After a month, the whole world has been in outrage over the reign of this infamous doctor. The police reluctantly capture him and schedule him for the old midnight execution drill. Again.

This time, however, during the time of the execution, a stadium of people have come to watch the doctor get electrocuted like a fly in front of their eyes, including the leader of the country's police force. They flip the switch...

The doctor survives. The crowd goes silent.

The chief policeman struts over to the poor doctor and asks him, ""How the singular crap are you surviving?! That was literally over a thousand damnable volts! And no, don't give me that 'I'm a bad conductor' line because I have heard that repost a million times on r/Jokes.""

“I tells ya what, if you let me fuck you up the ass for five minutes, I’ll give you a dick like mine.”

“Oh my God, no way, that would hurt so bad.”

Again, in the thickest Irish accent imaginable, he replied “come on now man, just imagine how much the girls will love it, a 12 inch dick!”

Reluctantly, the man finally agrees, and experiences the most painful 5 minutes he can imagine. When all is said and done, he looks down and finds he’s no bigger than he was before. 

“What the fuck, it’s the same size!” He yells

The husband cringed, 'I warned you to be careful! Now we'll have to go up there, find the owner, apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us.'

So the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. A warm voice said, 'Come on in.'

When they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the pieces of window glass.

A man reclining on the couch asked, 'Are you the people that broke my window?'

'Uh...yeah! , sir. We're sure sorry about that,' the husband replied.

'Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you.. You see, I'm a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for my self.'

Wow, that's great!' the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, 'I'd like a million dollars a year for the rest of my life.'

'No problem,' said the genie 'You've got it, it's the least I can do.. And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!'

'And now you, young lady, what do you want?' the genie asked.

'I'd like to own a gorgeous home in every country in the world complete with servants,' she said.

'Consider it done,' the genie said. 'And your homes will always be safe from fire, burglary and natural disasters!'

'And now,' the couple asked in unison, 'what's your wish, genie?'

'Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle, and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have sex with your wife.'

The husband looked at his wife and said, 'Gee, honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?'

She mulled it over for a few moments and said, 'You know, you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?'

You know I love you sweetheart,' said the husband. I'd do the same for you!'

So the genie and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying each other.

The genie was insatiable. After about three hours of non-stop sex, the genie rolled over and looked directly into her eyes and asked, How old are you and your husband?'

'Why, we're both 35,' she responded breathlessly.

'No Kidding,' he said.

After chasing him for five minutes, the clown eventually lost the kid after he took a random right turn down a random street. As you would have probably guessed from the ""I'm going to eat you kid"" comment, the clown didn't look like your normal clown. He was dressed in all red - red shirt, red pants, red nose, red shoes and had a big red hat as well. He thought to himself that he could use this as an advantage to trap the kid next time he saw him by standing next to something red.

The very next day, the clown saw the boy walking home from school and decided to stand in front of a big red house to blend in.  The boy walked towards the clown without noticing him because of the big red house surrounding him. As the boy got close, the clown jumps out and grabs the kid, loudly yelling ""I'm going to eat you!"". The kid screams, kicks the clown, and somehow was able to pull away. Once again, the clown started chasing the kid down the street yelling ""i'm going to eat you kid!""

The kid was making good progress getting away when all of a sudden he ran right into the red clown, knocking his big red hat off in the process. He was shocked and had no idea how the clown was able to all of a sudden get passed him. The kid started screaming again and hitting the clown, but this time the clown looked super confused and calmly asked the kid ""why are you hitting me?"" 

The kid was even more confused and said ""are you kidding me? You've been chasing me for days, yelling that you're going to eat me!""

The clown laughed and goes - oh that's just my stupid brother Joe, you have the wrong reddit.

The Russians arrive as well at the meeting with a less impressive dog, really low and long, really ugly looking if it were to stand out through anything appart from its odd shape.

I hope you can help me. The other day, I set off for work, leaving my husband in the house watching TV. My car stalled and broke down about a mile down the road, and I had to walk back home to get my husbands help. When I got home, I couldn't believe my eyes. He was in our bedroom with our neighbors daughter!

I am 32, my husband is 34, and the neighbors daughter is 19. We have been married for 10 years. When I confronted him, he broke down and admitted they had been having an affair for the past six months. H e won't go to counseling, and I'm afraid I am a wreck and need advice urgently. Can you please help?

Sincerely Sheila

Dear Sheila,

A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults with the engine. Start by checking that there is no debris in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold and also check all grounding wires. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it may be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors.

I hope this helps,

John",Why men shouldn't write advice columns.,11

Eventually Justin had had enough. He said to Kristian, ""I'm fed up with being a prawn. I wish I was a shark, and then I wouldn't have to worry about being eaten all the time.""

As he said this, a large mysterious Cod appeared and said, ""Your wish is granted!""

And believe it or not, with that Justin turned into a fearsome shark.

Kristian was horrified and so immediately swam away as he was scared of being eaten by his old friend.

As time went by, Justin found his new life as a shark to be boring and lonely. None of his old friends would let him get near them as they thought he would eat them and so they just swam away whenever he approached.

It took a while, but eventually Justin realized that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight.

Then one day he was swimming all alone as usual when he saw the mysterious cod again. He thought it'd be better if he could go back to his old life so he swam to the cod and begged to be changed back. The cod worked his magic and suddenly Justin was a prawn once more.

With tears of joy streaming down his cheeks Justin swam straight to Kristian's home.

As he opened the coral gate, the happy memories came flooding back. He banged on the door and shouted, ""Kristian, it's me, Justin, your old friend. Come out and see me again.""

Kristian replied, ""No way! You're a shark now and you'll just eat me. I'm not being tricked into being your dinner.""

Justin shouted back ""No, I'm not a shark any more. That was the old me. I've changed...

I've found Cod. I'm a prawn again, Kristian.""","Two prawns, Justin and Kristian, were swimming around in the sea one day.",172

With his heavy cowboy boots, his huge cowboy hat, and a loyal revolver, he was a man to be feared. One day, The Asker enters a local bar, and heads slowly to the tab.

Everyone is already paralized when they recognize him. He walks up to the first table in the place. ""Tchk, tchk, tchk"", the boots loudly sound. A man is smoking a cigar.  
""YOU! Do you smoke?"", asks The Asker.  
The man, trembling, responds. ""Y-yes... Yes, I smoke..."".  
BOOM! The Asker shoots the man. ""You smoked.""

Fear grows in the tab, as the fearful cowboy advances again. ""Tchk, tchk, tchk"". The guy in the table is having a beer, making it spill all over, shivering with fear. He's begging for mercy in his head.  
""YOU! Do you drink beer?""  
""Y-yes... yes, Sir Asker, I do, but please --""  
BOOM! No mercy at all.  
""You drank beer"", says The Asker. 

""Tchk, tchk, tchk"". He finally reaches the tab. The barman, scared shitless, is finding some relief in the panic: he's not smoking, or drinking, or doing anything really. Maybe he's safe.   
""YOU! ... Do you... fuck?"" The question was unexpected.  
""Yes... yes sir, I do fuck"", answers the man, scared, but somehow stupidly proud.  
BOOM! The Asker shoots him. ""You're fucked."" 

Days go by, and The Asker has taken over the bar, stealing the money and the business. This particular afternoon, the phone rings, The Asker answers it, and puts it down, as if he'd heard something to bother him. He begins walking down the bar, table by table. 

""Tchk, tchk, tchk"". He looks at the first man's eyes.  
""YOU! Are you Slimmy Johnny?""  
""N-no, no sir, I'm not.""  
BOOM! The Asker kills once again. 

""Tchk, tchk, tchk"". He reaches the second table, just before the man manages to escape.  
""YOU! Are you Slimmy Johnny?""  
""N-no... I'm Bobb-""  
BOOM! Not even given time to say his full name. 

Finally, there's one table left. It's Slimmy Johnny's.   Knowing The Asker is coming for him, he starts begging, kneeling and praying for his life. He doesn't know how The Asker is going to kill him, tortute him maybe.  
""Tchk, tchk, tchk"". The Asker stares deeply into his eyes.   ""YOU! Are you Slimmy Johnny?""

post,8kce9z,2qh72,jokes,false,1526642365,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8kce9z/room_39/,self.jokes,,"A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss.

-The client: is room 39 empty?
-The boss: yes, sir.
-The client: can I book it?
-The boss: of course you can.
-The client: thank you.

Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.

The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.

The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.

Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.

In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.

He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.

The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.

The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.

The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.

This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.

Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.

The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.

The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up.

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.

The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.

In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.

-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''
-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.
-''Swear?''
-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''

So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss.

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.

Upon further investigation, and only 1 attempt to eat it, they release the genie inside who graciously grants them each 3 wishes.

Bear, who lives in the moment quickly says:

""I wish that every other bear in the forest was a hot lady bear who wanted my sweaty bear balls!""

Rabbit and the Genie are clearly disgusted, but Genie being a slave, begrudgingly grants the wish. While this was happening Rabbit was considering his options, and when it was his turn to make a wish, he didn't wait either.

""I wish for a Harley Davidson, that I could ride, you know, one made for Rabbits!""

Genie smiles, and grants his wish. (Genies don't like you to ask for something easy, or gross, challenge them you know?)

Bear all this time, what little their was, is thinking about all that sweet bear action he is going to get, and he gets hornier and hornier, finally blurting out,

""I wish every other bear in the country, was a hot lady bear who wanted my sweaty bear balls.""

Genie is even more disgusted, this time with himself, knowing in a single generation or two, bears will be nearly gone from this country, but being a servant he grants the wish, and bear sees a lady bear coming into the clearing and goes to her, and starts doing what comes naturally to a horny bear.

Rabbit, opposed to watching this, is checking out his sweet new ride, and notices he is missing something. He turns to the genie and says

""I wish for all the accessories, and leather vests, and helmets, and saddle bags. I need all of them to be rabbit sized, and I need holes in the helmet for my ears, and a sidecar, so I can take my friends on rides too.""

Genie smiles and in a cloud of smoke rabbit and his Harley disappear in a flash, and a cloud of smoke. When they reappear Rabbit is decked out, and his bike has enough chrome to make SAMCRO jealous. Rabbit starts up the bike, and starts riding circles around the clearing. 

Bear, who is on his ""Lady Friend"" nearing completion, screams out over the noise of the Harley and smoke

""I wish every other bear in the world was a hot lady bear, who wanted my sweaty bear balls.""

Genie and Rabbit stare at each other, wondering who will speak first after standing witness to the destruction of a species. All bears in the world are essentially dead, and only they know it. 

Rabbit laughs, and rides across the clearing, screaming as he goes...

She took her faithful pet dachshund along for company. One day, the dachshund starts chasing butterflies and before long the dachshund discovers that he is lost. So, wandering about, he notices a leopard heading rapidly in his direction with the obvious intention of having lunch. The dachshund thinks, ""OK, I'm in deep trouble now! Then he noticed some bones on the ground close by, and immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the
approaching cat. Just as the leopard is about to leap, the dachshund exclaims loudly, ""Boy, that was one delicious leopard.

I wonder if there are any more around here."" Hearing this, the leopard halts his attack in mid-stride, as a look of terror comes over him, and slinks away into the trees. ""Whew,"" says the leopard. ""That was close. That dachshund nearly had me."" Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard. So, off he goes. But the dachshund saw him heading after the leopard with great speed, and figured that something must be up. The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard. The leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says, ""Here monkey, hop on my back and see what's going to happen to that conniving canine.""

Now the dachshund sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back, and thinks, ""What am I going to do now?"" But instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to his attackers, pretending he hasn't seen them yet... and just when they get close enough to hear the dachshund says......................

Edward consulted his sister and decided, after careful consideration, that a pair of good quality gloves would strike the right note: not too romantic and not too personal.

Accordingly, off he went with his sister to Brown Thomas, where they selected a dainty pair of fur-lined, quality leather gloves. While she was there, his sister bought a pair of knickers for herself.

They took advantage of the free gift-wrap offer, but the assistant mixed up the two items, with the result that the sister got the gloves - and Edward, unknowingly, ended up with the knickers.

Good old Edward sent off his gift-wrapped present in a parcel, with the following letter:

Dearest Mary,

I chose these because I've noticed that you don't wear any when we go out together. If it hadn't been for my sister, I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she prefers shorter ones, which are easier to remove.

They are a very delicate shade, but the shop assistant showed me the pair she'd been wearing for the past three weeks, and they were hardly soiled at all.

I got her to try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them, even though they were a little bit tight on her. She also said that they rub against her ring which helps keep it clean - in fact she hasn't needed to wash it since she began wearing them.

I wish I could be there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other hands will touch them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off remember to blow into them a little bit because they'll be naturally a little damp from wearing.

Just imagine how many times my lips will kiss them during the coming year! I do hope you'll wear them for me on our next date.

All my love

Edward

P.S. Mum tells me that the latest fashion is to wear them folded down, with a little bit of fur showing.",Good ol’ Edward,34

Then her sister remembered that she had a pair of white shoes from her wedding so she lent them to Sofia for the day. Unfortunately, they were a bit too small and by the time the festivities were over Sofia's feet were in agony. 

When she and Edward withdrew to their room the only thing she could think of was getting her shoes off. 

The rest of the Royal Family crowded round the door to the bedroom and they heard roughly what they expected, grunts, straining noises and the occasional muffled scream. Eventually they heard Edward say ''God, that was tight.''

''There,'' whispered the Queen. ''I told you she was a virgin.''

Then, to their surprise, they heard Edward say. ''Right. Now for the other one.'' Followed by more grunting and straining and at last Edward said ''My God. That was even tighter.''

The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""

The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. 

The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun. He explains, ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vice versa. "" Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now agitated, says, ""Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00."" This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. The lawyer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill and hands it to the lawyer. ""Okay"" says the lawyer, ""your turn."" 

She asks the lawyer, ""What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?"" The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references, no answer. He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00. The blonde says, ""Thank you,"" and turns back to get some more sleep. 

The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, ""Well, what's the answer?"" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.

Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, ""Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled.

The leader says, ""We are all here today to prove to the world that blondes are not stupid. Can I have a volunteer?""

A blonde gingerly works her way through the crowd and steps up to the stage.

The leader asks her, ""What is 15 plus 15?""

After 15 or 20 seconds she says, ""Eighteen!""

Obviously everyone is a little disappointed. Then 10,000 blondes start cheering, ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""

The leader says, ""Well since we've gone to the trouble of getting 10,000 of you in one place and we have the world- wide press and global broadcast media here, gee, uh, I guess we can give her another chance.""

So he asks, ""What is 5 plus 5?""

After nearly 30 seconds she eventually says, ""Ninety?""

The leader is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh -- everyone is disheartened - the blonde starts crying and the 10,000 blondes begin to yell and wave their hands shouting, ""GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE! GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE!""

The leader, unsure whether or not she is doing more harm than good, eventually says, ""Ok! Ok! Just one more chance -- What is 2 plus 2?""

The girl closes her eyes, and after a whole minute eventually says, ""Four?""

Throughout the stadium pandemonium breaks out as all 10,000 blondes jump to their feet, wave their arms, stomp their feet and scream... ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""

""Help me, Horse!"" said the duck. ""Go get the porsche!""

The horse just thought to himself for a second and with a confident stride, he whipped out his massive horse cock and dropped it into the hole. He grabbed the duck with his dong and pulled him out of the hole.

That was it! Jim was going to train to become a motorcycle mechanic! 
After enrolling on a short course with an examination at the end, Jim would finally be a qualified Mechanic. 

The exam was quite strenuous. Jim was required to dismantle a motorcycle diagnose the problem  and reassemble the vehicle so that it worked.

2 months had passed since the exam and a letter came through his door. 

Upon opening the letter, Jim found that he had passed the test, scoring 150% and was now a qualified mechanic! Yes! 

150%?! Jim was confused...

There was a breakdown of his score included in the letter. 

Dismantle the motorcycle and diagnose the problem = 40%

Reassemble with the problem resolved = 60%

Complete the whole process through the exhaust pipe = bonus 50%",Jim The Gynaecologist decides to change his career.,14
