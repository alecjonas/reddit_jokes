Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train.

We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon."" 

She hears the little boy continue, ""For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat.

The knights and their audience gathered in the great hall, and the contest began. The first knight stepped forward, dropped his pants, and attached a 5 pound weight to his ""weapon"". He struggled... and managed to raise it.

And so the children clapped, the women swooned, and the band played appropriate music.

The next knight stepped forward, dropped his pants, and attached a 10 pound weight to his ""weapon"". He focussed for a moment... and managed to raise it.

And so the children clapped, the women swooned, and the band played appropriate music.

The contest went long into the night, each challenger seeking to prove their valour; some succeeding, some failing. At last the night draws late, and the King steps forward.

""My knights, you are all brave and valiant warriors... but none of you are my equal."" And so he drops his royal trousers, attaches not a 10, not a 20, not a 30, but a massive *50 pound* weight to his ""weapon"", struggles... and manages to raise it.

And so the children clapped, the women swooned, and the band played 'God Save the Queen'.",The King's Contest,164

post,7dp3d4,2qh72,jokes,false,1510963231,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7dp3d4/so_theres_this_news_reporter/,self.jokes,,"So one day, a man’s boss comes to him and tells him “John, I want you to go out and find some stories about fun things people can do in the country side.” So John packs up his gear and heads out of the city to try and find something to report on. 

He drives along all day scouring the country side for stories to write about. After countless hours of no luck, he spies a man sitting in front of his barn smoking a cigarette. He pulls over and yells out the window if the man would be willing to participate in an interview about some of things he does for fun. The man agrees and John hops out of his car and approaches. 

“Hello sir, my name is John Smith, I’m a news reporter and I’m looking for a story to write about. Can you tell me what you do out here for fun?”

“Of course” replies the man, “why just a few months ago my buddies and I had one of the greatest weekends ever!”

Intrigued, John asks him to continue. 

“It started out as regular Saturday morning” drawls the countryman, “when I got a call from my buddy Ray. He told me he lost one of his sheep out in the woods, and he was wondering if I would help find it. I told him sure, so me and couple other guys met up at Ray’s to help look. We got there, put back a couple bottles of moonshine, went into the woods, found the sheep, and fucked it!” 

Horrified, John informs the man he cannot possibly submit the story, and asks him if the man had any other stories about fun things to do.

The man, a little disappointed, the man thinks for a second, and begins again with another story. 

“About a month ago, I got a call from my friend Charley. Now Charley’s wife had gone out into the woods collecting firewood, and hadn’t come home. So me and a couple other guys met up at Charley’s house, put back a couple bottles of moonshine, went out into the woods, found her, and fucked her!”

Absolutely disgusted, Johns again tells the man how there is no possible way on earth he could submit the mans tale. However, it was quite late and John was desperate not to return empty handed, so he asks the man “Sir, these stories you tell me about the fun things you do are just too much for my paper, is it possible you could tell me about a time when you didn’t have quite so much fun?” 

The man stops, and thinks for awhile, pondering. His face slowly goes from a look of amusement, to a look of regret, to a look of intense pain as he remembers. Finally, after minutes of silent, the man looks at his feet, gives a heavy sigh, shifts uncomfortably, pulls his gaze up to meet John’s, and begins. 

“Well just last weekend, I went out for a walk, and I got lost in the woods...",So there’s this news reporter...,125

""Does this excite you?"" She asked.

I nodded. Then she said it was time for me to put on the condom. While I was doing that, she took off her pants and panties and layed down on the table.

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but cannot go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs.

She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.

""That's nice,"" she thinks, ""but I want more.""

So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.

""Wow,"" she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

""Oh, mercy me!"" she exclaims, ""I can hardly stand it!""

Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop- dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

PLEASE NOTE:

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.

The first floor has wives that love sex.

The second floor has wives that love sex and have money and like beer.

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.

Do not buy anything else and bring the change back.""    
    
As he was told, he goes to a shop but he sees a huge teddy bear for £50 and he buys it. He comes back home and his mother is in shock. ""Go back, refund that teddy bear and buy what I asked you to buy!""    
     
However, Johny didn't want to refund that huge teddy bear so instead he goes to his auntie to ask for some money. He walks in, seeing her with another guy cheating on his uncle. As soon as she noticed Johny standing there, she heard her husband coming home so she told both Johny and the guy she cheated with to hide in the wardrobe.    
    
In the wardrobe, the conversation goes:    
Johny: ""Buy the teddy bear""    
Guy: ""No""    
Johny: ""Buy it or I will shout!""    
Guy: ""Alright, how much?""    
Johny: ""£50""    
The guy gives him the £50 but the conversation is not ending.     
Johny: ""Give me that teddy bear back""    
Guy: ""I just bought it from you""    
Johny: ""Give it back or I will shout!""    
Guy: ""Alright, alright""    
He gives him the teddy bear back but after that the conversation starts again.     
     
After it's safe for both of them to get out of the wardrobe, Johny comes home with £1000, huge teddy bear, milk, butter and bread. His mother is in shock once again.        
""You must have stolen all of this! Go to the church and confess right now and give that money back!""     
     
As he was told, he goes to a church and sits down waiting for a priest to come. The priest comes and sits down waiting for Johny to speak up.    
Johny: ""I came here beacause of a teddy bear...""    
Priest: ""Fuck off, I've got no money left!""",Mother asks little Johny to go to a shop...,9

I'll tell you a tale I know nothing about;

The Admission is free, so pay at the door,

Now pull up a chair and sit on the floor

One bright day in the middle of the night,

Two dead boys got up to fight;

Back to back they faced each other,

Drew their swords and shot each other.

A blind man came to watch fair play,

A mute man came to shout ""Hooray!""

A deaf policeman heard the noise and

Came and killed those two dead boys

He lived on the corner in the middle of the block,

In a two-story house on a vacant lot;

A man with no legs came walking by,

and kicked the lawman in his thigh.

He crashed through a wall without making a sound,

into a dry creek bed and suddenly drowned;

The long black hearse came to cart him away,

But he ran for his life and is still gone today.

I watched from the corner of the big round table,

The only eyewitness to facts of my fable;

But if you doubt my lies are true,

Just ask the blind man, he saw it too.",Oxymoronic Poem!,5

What he lacks in size, he makes up for in mouth.  Tyrone has the unfortunate combination of a big mouth, and gullible nature, so when he was thrown in jail for re-victimizing the same young girl, he started asking around for someone who could help him find a hit man to kill his victim and her Mom.

So after going on about this for a while, and annoying his cell mates to no end, they decided to tell the guards, and they in turn contacted the local sheriffs department.  The snitch was given a phone number to give to Tyrone, with the cover story that it was the number of a member of a local biker gang.

Given this number, Tyrone wasted no time calling it.  He ignored the recorded message on every call that reminds both parties that the call is monitored and recorded.  He ignored the large signs that are posted next to the phone that says the same thing.  No, Tyrone plows ahead, and asks what it would cost for them to do the job.

The ""hitman"" then made arrangements for a visit, which was conducted over a ""video visitation"" system, which once again is monitored and recorded (and was eventually used as evidence in his trial), where he openly discussed the murder for hire, with his visitor having pictures of the intended victims, which he showed Tyrone, to confirm their identity.

They agreed on the price of $8,000, which was on credit.  The collateral for this arrangement?  None other than his Mama, something she discovered at his sentencing hearing.

Tyrone was given the code ""Christmas Surprise"" when the deed was done, and so when a few days later, he received a letter with that message, he was in a great mood when he was called down to Intake. Once there, he was met by the detectives who had arrested him, and they told him that due to the death of his victim and her Mother, the only other witness against him, the charges were going to be dropped.

Tyrone was in a great mood, until the detectives left the room, and the hitman walked in, with a badge, and a new set of much more serious charges on top of his original set.

In the end, Tyrone got a 38 year sentence for the murder for hire plot, mainly due to the ""he's a dumbass"" defense (he could have gotten life).

A fleeing criminal, desperate to escape the police, runs into the desert with hardly any water. Very soon, he runs out of drinking water, and hours later, he is already plodding under the merciless desert sun.

He is close to desperation when suddenly, he sees something far off in the distance. Hoping against hope that it is water, he starts running towards what he thinks is an oasis, only to find a little old man with a little stand, full of ties.  

'Hey you, do you have water?' Pants the criminal.

 
The old man replied, 'I have already finished my water, but would you like to buy a tie? They are only $5.'


The criminal, frustrated shouted, 'you moron! Do I look like I need a tie? I should kill you right here, but I have to find some water first!"" 


'There's no call for threats,' said the old tie seller indignantly, 'but even though you don't want to buy one of my ties and you treat me like this, I'll help you. If you continue over that hill for about 3 miles, you'll find a restaurant with great food and all the ice cold water you can drink. Good luck!""


Muttering in disgust, the criminal staggered away over the hill. Several hours later the other man sees him crawling on the dune back towards him. When he finally arrives, he lays on his back, panting. 

""Everything ok?"" Asked the tie salesman as he bends over to hear the raspy whisper of the other man.

""They won't let me in without a tie...""

Eventually one day I'm the one making his drink, so I took the opportunity to call out his name. Should be fine, right?
""I've got a grande latte ready for Lee!"" I called out, and the unknown regular approached the bar.
""That must be for me, but my name is actually pronounced like 'dye'. Thanks for trying though,"" he said as he took his latte and headed out.

So the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”


And the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”


So the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.


So the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”


And the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”


So the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”


And the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”
And the guy’s, like, “World peace.”


So the bartender is understandably ashamed.


And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.


And the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”


And the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”


But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”


And the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”


And the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”


And the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”


And the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”
So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”


And the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.


And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”


And the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”


And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”


And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”


And then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”


And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!


And the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”


And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”


And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”


And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”


And the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.


And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.


And the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”


And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”


And the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”


And the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”


And he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.


And suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.


And the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”


And the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”


And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”


And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.
So the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.
So the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”


And the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.


And the guy’s, like, “Well done.”


And then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.”


And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.


And the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”


And the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.” ",So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can’t believe his eyes.,278

He peered inside... squinted... but couldn't see a thing down there.
He looked around and found a small pebble and tossed it in. He then listened closely for any sign of a splash or the pebble hitting the bottom... but heard absolutely nothing.
He searched again and found himself a large rock. He managed to toss it in without much difficulty. Listened closely... yet again, he heard nothing.
He then decided to go a bit more extreme. He looked around found the most enormous rock in the area. He managed to half drag it, half roll it towards the well... and with all his might heaved it up towards the large opening... and drop it. He strained to hear one more... yet nothing.
Frustrated and disappointed, he tore himself away to find a new source of water but was surprised to see a bleating goat dashing quickly towards him and the well, screaming at the top of its lungs. The man lunged out of the way as the goat jumped in the well and disappeared down it.
Bewildered, the man walked away from the well scratching his head...
After about a 20 minutes' walk, he happened upon an Arab man.
""Do you know where I can find some water?"", the man asked the Arab.
""I have a bit here..."" the Arab man gave him a small flask which the man accepted gratefully.
The Arab then asked the man, ""You know... it's the strangest thing. Did you happen to see a goat around here? I can't seem to find mine.""
The man said ""Actually yes! I saw one running 20 minutes back and jumping inside a well. Could that have been yours?""
The Arab man relieved, said ""No... there's no way that's mine. Mine was tied to an enormous rock.""",(Long) A thirsty man got himself lost in the desert...,115

The three of them were dragged in front of one of the princes, who said:

“You will get 50 lashes for the consumption of alcohol. However, since you are foreigners and did not know about the prohibition, I will be lenient. Each of you will have a wish before getting the punishment. You start, Togolese.”

Togolese: “I wish that you tie a pillow to my back, before you flog me.” His wish was fulfilled, but the flogging was so strong that the pillow tore into pieces after 25 lashes.

The Nigerian, upon seeing what had happened to the Togolese wished for two pillows on his back but still, the pillows got torn early.

Now the prince turns to the Ghanaian , and says:

“Now, since I am a big soccer fan and you play such beautiful soccer, I will be specially lenient with you. You have two wishes, but choose well.”

Ghanaian says: “First of all I want 100 lashes”.

The Nigerian and the Togolese look at themselves flabbergasted.

The Sultan replies: “I do not understand it, but we will grant you the double number of lashes! And your second wish?”

So off they go. Bob returns first with 10 plums. The tribe chief says, ""well done Bob, but that's not all I demand. Now, you must insert all 10 pieces of fruit up your ass without flinching/reacting, otherwise you die.""

Bob tries to argue but proceeds to attempt the task handed down to him. He manages to insert 4 plums inside his anus, but cannot muster anymore and let's out an audible gasp and thus the tribe chief slits Bob's throat and tells one of the villagers to make a canoe with Bob's skin. 

Dave is the second to return. As he arrives at the village he notices the canoe that was once his friend Bob, and asks the chief what happened. The chief replies, ""Bob could not complete the task and so he was killed and made into something useful for the village. You will meet the same fate as him if you too cannot complete the task of inserting 10 pieces of fruit inside your ass hole without flinching or making any noise. So, what fruit did you manage to find?""

Dave then pulls out a bunch of grapes and with a smug smile on his face, begins to insert them one by one into his anus. Now the tribe chief is angry as fuck because he wasn't expecting such a small fruit. Dave is up to his 9th grape and they're sliding up there now like a buttered finger. Just as Dave is about to insert his 10th grape and win his freedom, he bursts out laughing. 

The tribe chief looks at Dave dumbfounded. ""Why did you laugh?! You were surely free as those grapes were sliding in with ease.""

Dave looks up with tears in his eyes from the laughter and says, ""I'm sorry chief, but I just saw Him returning with 10 pineapples!""",Three men are captured by a tribe whilst adventuring,16

""Don't call me Jim, call me Mr. Lucky."" he answered.

""What are you talking about?"" The guy asked.

""Well, I was out for a drive in my new car and I see an 18 wheeler come skidding to a halt in front of me, I hit my brakes and the pedal went right to the floor. Nothing. So I go to pull around him and there's another semi headed in the oncoming lane. I glance in the rear view and see a third semi coming from behind. I figure, this is it. Say goodbye.

""The next thing I know is I'm flying through the air and I land on some soft bushes completely unharmed. Not a scratch. My car was mashed as flat as a pancake. Somehow the impact shot me out of the car. I sued the trucking comapnies, and the auto maker for faulty brakes and won $20 million.

So call me Mr. Lucky.""

""Alright then, you ARE Mr. Lucky.""


A month or two later the guy is walking down the street and bumps into his friend again. 

""Mr. Lucky, how's life treating you?"" He asks.

""Don't call me Mr. Lucky. Call me Mr. Lucky Lucky.""

""What do you mean?""

""I decided to take a vacation with my new wealth. The first vacation of my life, I thought I'd go on one of those Caribbean cruises, you know palm trees and that. Wouldn't you know it, the ship is attacked by pirates and the captain decides he's gonna be a hero and starts a fight with the pirates. The ship is sunk, everyone drowns but me. I miraculously wash ashore on the beach, I find my luggage on the beach not 20 yards away and the coast guard resuces me within the hour. I sue the cruise line for $100 million, so call me Mr. Lucky Lucky.""

""Hell, there's no doubting you are Mr. Lucky Lucky.""


Almost a year later he runs into his friend again, this time, the friend has a limp.

""Hey, Mr. Lucky Lucky, you're limping. What happened?""

""Don't call me Mr. Lucky Lucky.""

""No?""

""Call me Mr. Lucky Lucky Lucky.""

""Go on.""

""Well, remember that beach I washed up on? Well, there was this gorgeous woman who lived in the house overlooking the beach. She was the one who called the coast guard to rescue me. After I got settled after the wreck I flew down there to thank her and she invited me in for a drink and before I knew it we were in bed having mad, passionate sex. All of a sudden her husband bursts in the door and shoots me right in the ass.""

""How is getting shot in the ass lucky?""

""Are you kidding? If he'd come in five minutes earlier it would have been the back of my head.""",Call me Mr. Lucky (A guy is walking down the street),4
