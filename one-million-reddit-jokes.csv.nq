So the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”
And the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”

So the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for unlimited peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.

So the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”
And the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”
So the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”
And the guy’s, like, “World peace.”
So the bartender is understandably ashamed.
And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.

And the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”
And the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”
But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”

And the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”
And the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”

And the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”
And the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”
So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.
And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”
And the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”
And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”

And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”

And then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”
And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!
And the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”

And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”
And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”
And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”
And the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.

And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.
And the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”
And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”
And the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”
And the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”

And he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.
And suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.

And the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”
And the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”
And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life.

If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”
And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.
So the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.

So the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”
And the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.

And the guy’s, like, “Well done.”
And then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.”",A man walks into a bar...,384

""We're in the same bed with your husband!  He'll wake up, and he'll kill me.""  ""Don't worry about it,"" she says, ""he's such a sound sleeper, he'll never notice.

Her husband sleeps right through having a hair yanked out of his ass. So, she and the friend have sex, and then she goes back to her side of the bed. After about twenty minutes, though, she's back on his side of the bed, asking him to do it again. The same argument follows, another hair is yanked from the husband's ass, and again they have sex. This keeps up for about half the night, until after about the sixth time, when the wife goes back to her side.  Then the husband rolls over, and whispers to his friend, ""It's bad enough that you're screwing my wife, but could you at least stop using my ass for a scoreboard?""","A couple has a male friend visiting from out-of-state, when an unexpected blizzard blows in, and keeps him from traveling...",6

However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the ...bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.

They then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike"".",Dead crows on the highway...,127

When I was 16, I got a boyfriend with a big cock, but there was no passion, so I decided I needed a passionate man with zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate man, but he was too emotional. Everything was an emergency; he was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a man with stability. When I was 25, I found a very stable guy but he was boring. He was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I needed a guy with some excitement.

When I was 28, I found an exciting guy, but I couldn’t keep up with him. He rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. He did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. He was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a guy with some real ambition. When I turned 30, I found a smart ambitious guy with his feet planted firmly on the ground, so I married him. He was so ambitious that he divorced me and left me with nothing.

I am older and wiser now, and I am looking for a guy with a big cock.",Men,0

Trumps looks over and sees Obama's enormous schlong and asks Obama how he got his member to be so large.

Trumps thanks Obama for the advice, finishes his business and goes back to his table.

*""Holy shit,""* the guy replies. *""You actually understood and answered me!""*

*""I got every word,""* says the parrot. *”I happen to be a highly intelligent, thoroughly educated bird.""*

*""Oh yeah?""*, the guy asks, *""Then answer this -- how do you hang onto your perch without any feet?""*

*""Well,""* the parrot says, *""this is very embarrassing but since you asked, I wrap my willie around this wooden bar like a little hook. You can't see it because of my feathers.""*

*""Wow""* says the guy, *""you really can understand and speak English, can't you!?""*

*""Actually, I speak both Spanish and English and I can converse with reasonable competence on almost any topic: politics, religion, sports, physics, philosophy. I'm especially good at ornithology. You really ought to buy me. I'd be a great companion.""*

The guy looks at the $200 price tag. *”Sorry, but I just can't afford that.""*

*""Pssssssst""* says the parrot, *""I'm defective, so the truth is, nobody wants me cause I don't have any feet. You can probably get me for $20, just make the guy an offer!""*

The guy offers $20 and walks out with the parrot. Weeks go by. The parrot is sensational. He has a great sense of humour, he's interesting, he's a great pal, he understands everything, he sympathizes, and he's insightful.

The guy is delighted. One day the guy comes home from work and the parrot goes *""Psssssssssssst""* and motions him over with one wing. *""I don't know if I should tell you this or not, but it's about your wife and the postman.""*

*""What are you talking about?""* asks the guy.

*""Then he lifted up the nightie, got down on his knees and began to lick her all over, starting with her breasts and slowly going down...""*

He is ecstatic, and says ""I want a fully furnished house, endless money and to be reunited with my family."" No sooner does he say this, that a new law is passed, guaranteeing all refugees in Germany a fully furnished new home, welfare, and reunification with their families. And in his hands were a deed to his new home, and refugee papers for his family.

The man is stunned. He had gotten everything he wanted, and still had a wish left. So he said ""I want to be a German citizen. In fact, I want to be named Fritz."" And as soon as he said that, his teeth went back to having a gap, and his house and family disappeared.

""What happened?!"" he yelled.

One Sunday Mrs. White decides she wants to go hunting with her husband. Her husband agrees and goes over the basics of hunting and safety. Before leaving, her husband tells her one piece of advice.

""If you manage to take down a deer, make sure to run over to it, mount a foot on the body, gun in the air, and declare loudly 'THIS IS MY DEER. GO GET YOUR OWN.' There are hunters out there that are dickish enough to steal a kill from a lady.""

Mrs. White took in the advice and off they went to the woods to hunt. Mr. White set up his wife in a nice seclusive spot, telling her he will be back in a few hours.

Some time passes and Mrs. White is getting bored when a deer came crashing thru the bush and into view. Mrs. White, remembering what her husband had taught her, raised her gun, aimed, and fired. The deer went down with a loud thud.

Mrs. White felt proud of herself until she saw a man come crashing through the bush. Fearing he was trying to take her kill, she ran to the body, placed a foot on it, raised her gun in the air and shouted ""THIS IS MY DEER. GO GET YOUR OWN!"" At the man.

The man, shocked, put his hands up and backed away. ""Okay, ma'am, you can have it. Can I at least get the saddle back?""

Woman at the desk: “Oh, you're new, let's have you stared on level 1,  please go to room 1.”

He did as he was told and inside was a ok looking woman. She smiles at him and says: “Hi, my name is Nicky, if you catch me you can f... me.”

The guy was amazed an immediately started to run after her, and after a short run he caught her and they had fun together.

He came back the next day and was not disappointed. An even netter looking woman was waiting for him on level 2, and after only 5 minutes he managed to catch her.

Motivated by the experience of the first 2 days, he came back on the 3rd day, and went to the front desk.

Guy: “I want level 15” expecting that there has to be a real goddess waiting for him.

Women at the front desk:“I think you're not ready for that, how abou you just skip 1 level and head to level 4.”

Guy: “No, I'm ready! I want level 15!”

Woman at the desk: “As you wish, but I have warned you. Pleas go down those stairs and enter the first door on the left”

The guy went down the stairs. He was hearing some cries that seemed to come from the end of the floor, thinking, wow that guy likes it hard. Very confident he  enters the room, it's dark and smelly, the door locks behind him. Then he hears a deep voice: “Ha ha ha... Hello my name is Igorrr. So you're my new boy, hehehe.

""What's with the boxes?""  She asked, not taking her eyes off her phone.  

""Oh these?  Just some old stuff from before you were born.""  He said as he opened one.  Inside was a record player, complete with a couple vintage vinyl records.  He chuckled a bit as he pulled it out.

""Oh man, you probably don't even know what this thing is.""  He mused as he showed his daughter.  She gave it a curious glance as he continued.

""See, this thing is a *record player*"" He described in a condescending tone, ""It plays these giant flat discs called *records*.  This was back before all this new technology like the internet and such.  I doubt you'd know how it works.""

The daughter shoots him a look, rolls her eyes and grabs the record.  Flipping it a couple times in her hands she places it on the player and deftly turns it on with no messup or skipping.  Sure enough the record played perfectly.

""Huh.  I'll be damned.""  The father says, ""How'd you know to work it?  It was even before my time.""

The daughter holds up her phone to show a youtube video of someone working a record player.

""Internet.""  She replies.

After he passed, Edith arranged a simple funeral for him. Then she went to the local newspaper to put in an obituary. Her entry read the following:

""Angus died""

The editor was a bit surprised by this. He responded ""Ma'am, that's a bit short. We charge for every five words, so you can add another three for the same price.""

""One Finnish soldier is better than ten Russians!""

The battalion commander hears this, mutters ""we'll see about that"", handpicks ten of his finest soldiers and orders them to kill the man behind the hill. 

The Russians summit the hill and as soon as the last of them disappears behind it, a hail of gun fire erupts. Then a silence, which is only broken by a confident shout: 

""One Finnish soldier is better than hundred Russians!""

Agitated, the commander order his heavily armed top squad of hundred soldiers to go behind the hill and kill the man. The squad marches towards where they heard the shout. As soon as the last one is gone from sight, a barrage of heavy gunfire echoes in the forest, ending with an explosion. Deafening silence falls, but is soon broken by a shout: 

""One Finnish soldier is better than THOUSAND Russians!""

Furious, the battalion commander decides to outsmart the man and orders 1,001 of his bravest soldiers to go beyond the hill and kill the man and bring back his head.

While there, an attractive young lady came out of the apartment next to the mailboxes, wearing a robe.

The boy smiled at the young woman and she started a conversation with him.

As they talked, her robe slipped open, and it was obvious that she had nothing else on.

The poor kid broke into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact.

After a few minutes, she placed her hand on his arm and said, ""Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming.""

He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely.

Now completely nude, she purred at him,

""What would you say is my best feature?"" Flustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, ""It's got to be your ears.""

Astounded, and a little hurt she asked, ""My ears? Look at these breasts; they are full and 100% natural. I work out every day and my butt is firm and solid. Look at my skin - no blemishes anywhere, so how can you think that the best part of my body is my ears?!""

He thought long and hard about it and decided to place a single egg into her vagina. Then whoever would try to go in would break the egg and cause all kinds of trouble.

A day or so passed and then the Mike got a knock on his door. He went to the door and opened it to reveal Jeb standing at the door with a black eye and a busted lip.

Mike asked where he got his battle wounds from and Jeb told him that he confronted Rooster about sleeping with his girlfriend. Which led to Rooster giving him the busted lip. Mike asked how he got the black eye.

""Now see, that's how I knew it was Rooster. I was with my girlfriend and we were kissing and getting hot and heavy. She asked me to take her clothes off and I did. She asked me to take my clothes off and I did. Everything was going great.""

Class starts and the teacher says: ""OK kids, today's subject will be buildings and construction. Who can tell me how buildings are made?""

The class remains quiet, then little Eddy raises his hand and says ""Madam, I know"".

The teacher says, ""OK Eddy, please explain.""

Eddy: ""Well, first before anything you need a permit from the city for the construction project to begin, that could take months. Once you get the permit, then come the bulldozers to basically dig into the earth to create the foundation. Then, cement is poured into the foundation and pylons are inserted. Around the pylons, the outer structure of the building is made, floors, walls, ceilings.Then comes wiring and plumbing. Next drywall can be installed along with flooring and fixtures. When all is said and done, you still have to get an occupancy permit from the city before you can actually use the building.

The class remains quiet.

The teacher says: WOW Eddy! Bravo, that was amazing, how did you learn all that?

Eddy: For the past many months, just a few doors down from our house, they have been building what I think is a huge whore house, I've watched the whole thing from start to finish.

At that moment, all the girls suddenly get up and start to walk out.

Eddy looks around and says:

Woah woah woah, girls sit down, they are not hiring yet, still waiting for final permit.",Little Eddy has really upset the girls at school,3512

A couple in their 80’s were having problems remembering things, so they decided to the go the doctor for a checkup. The doctor tells them that they are physically okay, but they might want to start writing things down to help them remember.

Later that night, while watching TV, the old man gets up from his chair. His wife asks, “Where are you going?” “To the kitchen for a drink,” he replies. She asks, ” Will you get me piece of cake?” The husband says, “Sure.” She gently reminds him, “Don’t you think you should write it down so you don’t forget it?” He says, “No, I can certainly remember that!”

Then the woman says, “Well, I’d like some strawberries on top. You’d better write it down because I know you’ll forget it.” The man replies, “I can remember that! You want some cake with strawberries.”

She adds, “I’d also like whipped cream on top. Now I’m certain you’re gonna forget that, so you’d better write it down ok.” Irritated, he says, “I don’t need to write it down woman! I can remember that! Cake with strawberries! And whipped cream!” He then grumbles into the kitchen. After about 30 minutes the old man returns from the kitchen and hands his wife a plate of bacon and eggs. She stares at the plate for a moment and says, “Where’s my toast?

When I was 16, I got a girlfriend with big tits, but there was no passion, so I decided I needed a passionate girl with zest for life. In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency; she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability. When I was 25, I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I needed a girl with some excitement.

When I was 28, I found an exciting girl, but I couldn’t keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition. When I turned 30, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground, so I married her. She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

I am older and wiser now, and I am looking for a girl with big tits.

The doctor said that going to church is good and all that, but perhaps the guy should find a different way to be helpful.

Next week, the guy shows up again.  His jaw is broken, his eyebrow cut, and both eyes are blackened.  The doctor asks ""What happened?!?!?""

She drives out, somewhat amazed and a little confused. She looked at the radio and said, ""Nelson"".

The radio responded, ""Ricky or Willie?""

Soon she was speeding down the highway to the sounds of ""On the road again"". 

The lady was astounded. If she wanted Beethoven, that's what she got. If she wanted Nat King Cole, she got it.

Stopped at an intersection, her light turned green and she pulled out. Off to her right, out of the corner of her eye, she saw a small sports utility vehicle speeding toward her. She swerved and narrowly missed a collision.

""Asshole..."", she muttered.

So they go and get some cotton candy, and they sit down in their seats, and out comes the lion-tamer, and out comes the acrobats, and out comes the dancing bear and it's all very fun but suddenly the ringmaster comes out and announces the clowns. A little car comes out and 50 of them pile out of it and they're doing their thing, to the delight of Billy. Suddenly, the head clown raises his hands for silence and a spotlight comes down. The entire tent is dark and the clown walks over and sees Billy and points at him:
""You!"" he says to billy
"" Are you a horse's ass? Billy says no!
"" Are you a donkey's ass?"" Billy starts to tremble as he says no! This isn't fun anymore.
"" Then you must be a monkey's ass!""
He sprays Billy in the face with water. The lights come up and 20,000 people all scream in laughter at Billy. Poor Billy is traumatized by this event. For the rest of the day everyone who sees him points and says look, there's the monkey's ass!
After this Billy changes. He becomes depressed, uninterested in friends, toys or anything else. He becomes so angry and disconnected that he flunks out of school and becomes violent. His parents, not knowing what to do with him, give him up for adoption. Billy drifts into his adult years to a life of crime and violence. 
Then one day, he sees an ad in the paper: Bernie Finkelstein's Advanced School of Amazing Comebacks. For some reason, this hits Billy as the answer to all of the problems in his life. So he scrapes together as much money as he can and barely makes the tuition. He disciplines himself and is focused on the goal like never before, as he throws himself into the curriculum. Sarcasm, puns, satire, put-downs, comebacks, Billy soaks it all up with a passion that he has never felt since he was 5 years old. He swears that the next time he sees the clown he will get his revenge. 
Then a couple of years later, his patience pays off. The same circus is coming back to town!

 Billy goes to get a ticket immediately. He sits in the same spot that he sat as a five year old and waits. The lion tamer comes out, the acrobats come out, the dancing bear etc etc it's all well and good until finally the ringleader announces the clowns. The clowns come out and do their thing, spilling out of a tiny car and delighting the crowd.
Billy is almost salivating as he waits for the moment that he has spent four years preparing for. Finally, he will have his revenge.
 The head clown raises his hand for silence and a spotlight shines down on him. The entire tent is dark and silent. The Clown wanders about thoughtfully, searching for his victim when he suddenly sees Billy glaring at him. Incredibly, the clown recognizes Billy and beelines straight for him. Billy's heart races. The moment is now. The clown points at him and says
""YOU. Are you a donkey's ass?""
Billy says hell no!
"" Are you a horse's ass?""
NO
""Well then you must be a monkey's ass!!""
The lights come up and the audience begins the laughter. The clown pulls out the Seltzer and prepares to squirt Billy in the face, but Billy is ready and jumps over the barricade and right up to the Clown.
""HEY CLOWN"" begins Billy,
""FUCK YOU!!""",So Billy goes to the circus for the first time,1

The traveler replies: ""Ah, that's quite unfortunate. But hey, cheer up!""

The farmer sighs: ""Some things simply cannot be explained.""

The traveler asks him to describe what happened next, and the farmer continues: ""So I found a rope and tied her left leg to a pole, then I milked another bucket of milk. But then she kicked over the bucket with her right leg and all the milk spilled out again.""

The traveler then asks: ""So did you tie her right leg to a pole too?"" to which the farmer answers: ""Yeah, and then I milked another bucket of milk. But somehow, she knocked over the bucket with her tail.""

The traveler responds: ""Wow, that's very unlucky. But hey, don't think about it too much.""

The farmer sighs again: ""Some things simply cannot be explained.""

So the traveler kept urging him to tell the rest of the story, and eventually the farmer continued: ""I couldn't find any more ropes around, so I decided to use my belt. As I held my belt in one hand and the cow's tail in another, my pants fell off and my wife came out to see what was taking so long...""","A sad farmer is sitting on a stump by the road, and a traveler greets him.",19

Everyone in the bank laid down quietly. This is called ""Mind Changing Concept” Changing the conventional way of thinking.

When a lady lay on the table provocatively, the robber shouted at her: ""Please be civilized! This is a robbery and not a rape!"" 

This is called ""Being Professional” Focus only on what you are trained to do! 

When the bank robbers returned home, the younger robber (MBA-trained) told the older robber (who has only completed Year 6 in primary school): ""Big brother, let's count how much we got."" 

The older robber rebutted and said: ""You are very stupid. There is so much money it will take us a long time to count. Tonight, the TV news will tell us how much we robbed from the bank!"" 

This is called ""Experience.” Nowadays, experience is more important than paper qualifications! 

After the robbers had left, the bank manager told the bank supervisor to call the police quickly. But the supervisor said to him: ""Wait! Let us take out $10 million from the bank for ourselves and add it to the $70 million that we have previously embezzled from the bank”.

This is called ""Swim with the tide.” Converting an unfavorable situation to your advantage!

The supervisor says: ""It will be good if there is a robbery every month.""  

This is called ""Killing Boredom.” Personal Happiness is more important than your job.

The next day, the TV news reported that $100 million was taken from the bank. The robbers counted and counted and counted, but they could only count $20 million. The robbers were very angry and complained: ""We risked our lives and only took $20 million. The bank manager took $80 million with a snap of his fingers. It looks like it is better to be educated than to be a thief!"" 

This is called ""Knowledge is worth as much as gold!"" 

The bank manager was smiling and happy because his losses in the share market are now covered by this robbery. 

This is called ""Seizing the opportunity.” Daring to take risks! 

So who are the real robbers here?",A Bank Robbery.,3

They are immediately surrounded by a huge crowd, media has set up their booths and world leaders approach them to make contact. 

The aliens then spoke:
""We're from the galactic alliance and we're pleased to say you humans have been chosen as its latest members"" 
""In order for you to seal this deal, its required that a male and female specimen of the human race come aboard the ship and have sex with us. The male species with a female of our species and vice versa.""

The audience who were cheering to the sight of this historic event, suddenly quiet down on hearing this. Then a swinger couple walks forward and accepts their offer, they go aboard the ship. The alien male takes the woman to his chamber and the alien female does the same with the man.

In the alien male's chamber, they start caressing each other then making out and soon it gets really hot. The idea of getting screwed by an alien is the ultimate swinger fantasy, she thinks and starts to unzip the male alien's spacesuit. When she undoes his spacefly, she's very disappointed. All there was is a pimple size alienpenis and she refuses to go any further. 

""What happened?"" The alien male asks

""It's so tiny, what am I going to do with this?"" she says

""Don't worry, just smack me on the back of my head""

She's stunned on hearing this, but on his insistence she smacks him on the back of his head. 
Lo and behold, the penis grows an inch. He then says ""smack me until you get your desired size""
She does that 7 more times and then have passionate interspecies sex.

After a few hours, the humans emerge from the spaceship. The woman has a glowing smile on her face, while the man looks all low and disappointed.

The media surrounds them and asks what was it like?

Before the woman can answer, the man says;

""their sex is weird, after foreplay we undressed each other and then she kept smacking me behind my head for a few hours after that she asked me to leave""",An Alien ship lands in the city center..,84

After a couple of weeks the general was still doing fine and hardly thought about the camel's existence. After a couple more weeks, he started to get some urges built up. After a few more weeks all he could think about was that camel in the tent until finally he commanded the sergeant to take him to the tent at once.

 After he knocks on the door, an old Chinese man with a beard that reached the floor answers.

The traveler asks if he could stay the night, and the Chinese guy agrees - as long as he doesn't screw his granddaughter. Before the traveler can agree, the old man warns him that if he does screw his granddaughter, he will perform the three greatest Chinese tortures on him. The traveler says okay, and the man lets him in.

When it was time for dinner, the man meets the granddaughter, who is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. After he figures that the old man is asleep, he goes into her room and makes love to her.

The next morning, the man awakes with a 100-lb rock on his chest with a sign reading, ""First Chinese torture: wake up with 100-pound rock on chest."" 

Being a strong man, the traveler thinks nothing of it. 

He picks up the rock and throws it out the window.

On the back of the rock, there is another sign reading ""Second Chinese torture: right ball tied to rock."" 

Thinking quickly, the traveler jumps out the window.

On the other side of the window, there is another sign reading, ""Third Chinese torture: left nut tied to bed post.""",Three Chinese Tortures,127

Upon saving all of the villagers, they reward him with a feast fit for kings before he returns on his travels.

Agent 2: Everyone in that village had an incurable sexually transmitted infection, and that fire was our way of helping to stop the spread in that busy trading village.

The doctor examines him, and says to him, ""It looks like you have an infection of some sort. Unfortunately there's only one cure, and it's highly experimental.""
The man, upset, asks ""What if I don't go for that cure?""
The doctor replies, ""You might have to get your entire nutbag cut off permanently."" This scares the man into agreeing, and he tells the doctor to do whatever it takes to cure the infection.

The doctor proceeds with the cure, which is to temporarily extract the testicles from the body and expose them to sunlight for a week. He then puts these up on the clothesline at his own house, waiting for the week to end. On the fifth day, a crow swoops down onto the nuts just as the doctor notices it. He cries out at the crow and throws a fat medical textbook at it, but the crow manages to get away with one nut. The doctor spends a whole night unable to sleep, and the next morning as he's leaving for work, his wife notices his tense expression and asks what's wrong. He tells her what happened, whereupon she gives him an idea. ""Just take some mud from our backyard, roll it into the shape of a nut and put it back in the guy. He'll be under anesthesia anyway, so he won't notice it, will he?""

The doctor reluctantly agrees, and the next day, the patient returns to have his now-healed man parts reattached. The doctor performs this surgery, constantly hoping the man never notices. The surgery is a success, and the man happily pays the doctor for his services, and leaves.

Several months pass by, with the doctor hoping fervently that the patient doesn't barge in complaining of complications. One day, the doctor is attending a party where he bumps into a familiar person - the same dude he had performed this surgery on. He knows that he's running a risk, but asks out of curiosity - ""So, sir, is everything all right? Did the surgery help?""
The man replies, ""Oh, of course it did. Except for one little complication...""
The doctor nearly drops his drink. Maintaining his composure, he asks: ""What is that complication?""

""So what's the good news?"" he asks.

The doctor says, ""There is an experimental treatment available, but there are no guarantees. It involves transplanting the muscles from a baby elephant's trunk into your penis. Would you like to try it?""

The guy thinks about it and says, ""Well, the thought of going through life without being able to have sex is just too much for me. What have I got to lose? Let's do it."" So the doctor performs the operation.

A few weeks later, the guy takes his girlfriend out to a nice restaurant to celebrate his new equipment. While sitting at the table, he feels a stirring between his legs; it gets progressively worse until it reaches the point of being painful.

Seeking relief, he reaches down and unzips his fly to relieve some of the pressure.

Suddenly, his penis leaps free from his pants, slides over the tabletop and grabs a dinner roll, then returns to his pants again.

""Wow!"" says his stunned girlfriend, ""That was impressive! Can you do that again?""

Eyes watering and face flushed, he says, ''I
