""Lecturer,"" she responded. ""I use my experience to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.""
""Really,"" he smiled, ""What myths are those?""
""Well,"" she explained, ""one popular myth is that black men are the most well endowed when, in fact, it's the Red Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is that French men are the best lovers, when actually it is the men of Indian descent. We have found that the best potential lovers in all categories are the Afrikaners.""
Suddenly the woman became uncomfortable and blushed. ""I'm sorry,"" she said, I really shouldn't be discussing this with you; I don't even know your name..
""Running Bear,"" the man said....""Running Bear Naidoo, but my friends call me Frikkie.""",Convention,5

It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50
The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.
The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.
The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.
First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.
Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.
Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.
The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.
First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.
Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.
Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.
The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""
Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

Having never married, she was not a complicated woman. She always brought the same leftovers in the same Tupperware for lunch. She had one fork, one spoon, one knife, and one bowl. Her classroom had little decoration, and her house was the same way. 

Since she taught in a small town, everybody knew her, and some current students were children of her former students. One day in class when she was asking her students what they wanted to be when they grew up, a little boy said he wanted to be a comedian, and that he was learning how to do so from his father. 

""You know, your father used to be the class clown. He was always putting tacks on my chair and forcing me to get up from my seat."" said Mary. 

The boy assuredly responded: ""Oh I know all about that, Miss Under. He said he was a rotten child. He made me promise not to pull the pranks he did when he was a kid."" 

""Glad to hear that"", Mary said as she got up from her desk chair. 

Much to her surprise, the boy started laughing. Confused, she sat back down and the boy ceased laughing and looked at her in anticipation. When she stood again, the boy fell out of his desk and was rolling on the floor clutching his stomach from laughing so hard. 

Angrily, she stormed over to the boy, still giggling on the floor. ""I thought you said you weren't going to be trouble like your father! Did you put a tack on my seat? Answer me!"" 

The boy got beck in his desk and wiped a tear from his eye. ""No!"" He said with a chuckle. ""My dad told me that the best punchlines in jokes are always Simple Miss Under standing!""

Whereas the party of the first part, also known as “Lawyer,” and the party of the second part, also known as “Light Bulb,” do hereby and forthwith agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed-upon duties, i.e., the illumination of the area ranging from the front (north) door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just inside the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the parties.
The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the following steps:
1.) The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or without elevation, at his option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder, or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a counterclockwise direction, said direction being non- negotiable. Said grasping and rotation of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be undertaken by the party of the first part (Lawyer) with every reasonable caution by the party of the first part (Lawyer) to maintain the structural integrity of the party of the second part (Light Bulb), notwithstanding the aforementioned failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) to perform the aforementioned customary and agreed-upon duties. The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform, and in such case the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as this agreement is concerned so long as the non-negotiable directional codicil (counterclockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (Lawyer) throughout.
2.) Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (Light Bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part (“Receptacle”), the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local, and federal statutes.
3.) Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of beginning installation of the party of the fourth part (“New Light Bulb”). This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in Step 1 of this document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable.
NOTE: The above-described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (Lawyer), by said party of the first part (Lawyer), by his heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him to do so, the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (north) door consistent with maximization of commerce and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as “The Firm.”",How many lawyers does it take to change a lightbulb?,846

But also being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked 'Is the coming winter going to be cold?' 


'It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,' the weather man responded. 


So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood. A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. 'Is it going to be a very cold winter?' 


'Yes,' the man at National Weather Service again replied, 'It's definitely going to be a very cold winter.' 


The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find. 


Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. 


'Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?' 'Absolutely,' The man replied. 'It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.' 


'How can you be so sure?' the Chief asked.

We just moved into the city, a relatively small city, near some historical landmarks, really deep downtown jnto almost hipster territory. Anyways, the house we moved into is some old religious art studio long since forgotten, with no more art to be seen of course. But its come with much more than we have bargained for. The city is constantly on our ass about what we can, and cannot renovate. Their main concern is this bible passage that sits printed on the floor.  Some Catholic ""Apostle's Creed"" or something. Basically, we aren't good with contracts and our lawyer failed to mention to us the fact that the contract we signed states we aren't allowed to remove the floor or bible prayer/passage under any circumstances. And, I mean the thing is huge. It can be seen in every single room in the house, and its printed in huge, black font. Every single room in the house, even the bathroom. My wife, unfortunately, had not seen it yet. She was on a business trip in Japan. I was forced to break this terrible news to her over the phone.  The conversation did not go well. 
""Hey, honey. Its me, tittoast.""

""Hey sweetie.""

""I've got some bad news about the house. How close are you?""

And the only thing they had that was worth anything at all was this milk cow. It was a really good milk cow, gave a lot of high grade milk. Then they'd take the milk, and make milk and cheese, and sell the excess to get food. And the only thing keeping them going was this milk cow.



Now one day, the farmer woke up and he looked outside, and he noticed that his milk cow was dead. He didn't know what to do, so he hanged himself in the barn. Then the mother woke up, and the milk cow's dead, and the husband's dead, and she goes down to the river and she throws herself in. And drowns, and washes up on the rocks on the shore. Then the son wakes up and he sees the dead cow and the dead father, and he goes down to the river and there's the dead mother and a leprechaun. A woman leprechaun.



The women leprechaun says ""Hey, you're having a rough day today are ya?""  
He says ""Sure, I am.""  
She says ""I'll tell you what, I'll make a deal with you: if you make love to me ten times, in a row, without stopping, I'll bring everybody back to life, including the milk cow.""  
And he says ""Well, look at you, look at me; I'm young, I'm virile, you're good looking; I think I'll have at it.""  
So he tried and he didn't make it so she killed him.



Then the other brother wakes up, and the milk cow's dead, and the father's hanged himself, and the mother and the brother are washed up on the shore dead, and there's this female leprechaun.  
She says ""Having a rough day?""  
He said ""I should say so.""  
She says ""Well I'll tell you what, I'll make a deal: if you make love to me ten times in a row, I'll bring everybody back to life, even the milk cow.""  
And he says ""I'll give it a go.""  
But he didn't quite make it, she killed him then.



Finally the youngest son, he's 17, he wakes up and he looks: the milk cow's dead, the father's dead, the mother and two brothers are dead, and there's this girl leprechaun standing there.  
She says ""You're having a rough day?""  
He says ""I guess so.""  
She says ""Tell you what, I'll bring everybody back to life, including the milk cow, if you make love to me ten times in a row.""  
And he says ""Okay. But let me ask you this: what if I were to make love to you fifteen times in a row without stopping?""  
And she laughed for a while, and says ""Well if you could do that, I'd bring everybody back to life, even the cow, and I'd give you a nice mansion where your hovel is now.""  
He said ""Okay, but what if I were to make love to you twenty times in a row without stopping?""  
She says ""I'd bring everybody back to life, even the milk cow, I'd give you a nice mansion where your hovel is now, and I'd give you a big crock of gold - you'd be set for life.""  
And he says ""Well that sounds pretty good, and  we can start in a minute, but first I have to ask you: if I make love to you twenty times in a row without stopping, what's to prevent *you* from dying from it? [The milk cow did](#s).""",Milk Cow,2

The moment he turned towards the blackboard, one of the students whistled. He turned, looked at the class and asked the whistler's name ............. As usual and as expected no one answered.

The professor peacefully kept the pen in his pocket and picked up his bag. Saying that, the lecture ends here and that was enough for the day, he started moving towards the gate of the class ........... Students were overjoyed to be free.

Then, he suddenly stopped and turned towards the class, kept his bag on the table and said, ""I'll tell you a story to utilise the remaining time"". Everyone became interested.

Yesterday night I tried hard to sleep, but it was miles away from my eyes, so I thought I'd better get petrol in my car, which will save my time next morning and might induce sleep. After having my tank full, I started roaming in that area, enjoying the peace of a traffic free ride. 

Suddenly, on the corner I saw a girl who was as young and beautiful as the clothes she was wearing. Must have been returning from a party. Out of courtesy, I turned my car towards her and asked if I may be of any help. She asked me if I could drop her to her home, she'll be very obliged, to which I agreed.
(Who would deny a beautiful young company instead of a dry non sleepy need😜😜)

She sat in the front seat with me. We started talking, and to my amazement she was very intelligent, had control on many topics which many youngsters don't. 

When we reached her address, she admitted my courteous nature and behavior and accepted that she had fallen in love with me. 

I also admitted her intelligence and beauty and that I've also started liking her. I told her about my job as a professor in the university.

The girl asked my number, which I gave her willingly. Then she asked me a favor, to which i couldn't have denied naturally.

She said that her brother is a student in the same university, and asked me to take care of him, since we'll be in a long relationship now.

I asked the name of the student.She said that I'll recognise him with one of his very prominent quality.

He whistles a lot.

The moment the professor said this, all eyes in the classroom turned towards the boy who had whistled.

The professor turned to that boy and said,

Apparently he died in Africa somewhere and this Attorney bloke, Jackson Nkomo, emailed me to let me know the news. 

He said that he needed £8,000 to get all the admin sorted so obviously I transferred the wedge over there double lively.

I've given him all my bank details and so now all I've got to do is sit back and wait for all that lovely lolly to to appear in my account!

 while not a brilliant scholar, was a gifted portrait artist.

 Over a short number of years, his fame grew and soon people from all over Ireland were coming to the town of Miltown Malbay, in County Clare, to get him to paint their likenesses.

 One day, a beautiful young English woman arrived at his house in a stretch limo and asked if he would paint her in the nude. This being the first time anyone had made such a request he was a bit perturbed, particularly when the woman told him that money was no object; in fact, and she was willing to pay up to 10,000 pounds.

 Not wanting to get into any marital strife, he asked her to wait while he went into the house to confer with Mary, his wife. They talked much about the Rightness and Wrongness of it. It was hard to make the decision but finally his wife agreed, on one condition. In a few minutes he returned.

 ""T'would be me pleasure to paint yer portrait, missus,"" he said ""The wife says it's okay. ""I'll paint you in the nude all right; but I have to at least leave me socks on, so I have a place to wipe me brushes."" ","An Irish painter by the name of Murphy,",174

Fast forward 10 years. Love comes back from school crying. I ask her what's wrong. Says she is being bullied because of her name. I cheer her up with some ice cream. Problem solved and best dad award achieved. Fast Forward 7 more years. Love has turned into a 9/10. She dresses normal. Always wears red nail polish. But she is shy, very shy. She is still mocked constantly because of her not so ordinary name. She comes home from school one day, obviously disturbed. I ask her if it's about her name. She says nothing and just kisses me on the cheek and leaves. First time she has kissed me since she was a baby. Just wasn't her thing. Then, I hear my wife pulling in. She is home early from work. I hear the door open from daughter's room. The door then opens from garage. Loud blast goes off directly behind me. I fall to the ground. Wife looks at me and screams. I look down and see bullet through my chest. Love says something about her name. I look up at my still beautiful wife and I say: 
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You gave Love
...a bad name","So, I got married once..",4314

He looks at the beautiful car and says to the driver, ''You know, I hardly ever get to drive. Would you please let me?'' 

The driver is understandably hesistant and says, ''I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm supposed to do that.'' 

But the pope persists, ''Please?'' 

The driver finally lets up. ''Oh, all right, I can't really say no to the pope.'' 

So the pope takes the wheel, and boy, is he a speed demon! He hits the gas and goes around 100 mph in a 45 zone. A policeman notices and pulls him over. The cop walks up and asks the pope to roll down the window. Startled and surprised, the young officer asks the pope to wait a minute. He goes back to his patrol car and radios the chief. 

Cop: ''Chief, I have a problem.'' 

Chief: ''What sort of problem?'' 

Cop: ''Well, you see, I pulled over this guy for driving way over the speed limit but it's someone really important.'' 

Chief: ''Important like the mayor?'' 

Cop: ''No, no, much more important than that.'' 

Chief: ''Important like the governor?''

The first fisherman says 'I wish when we get home each of us will have our very own mansions'. 'Granted; they will be waiting for you.

The second guy says 'I wish when we get home we will each have a safe with 100 million dollars each. 'Granted' says the genie. 'I will be there in your mansions.

The third guy thinks for a while and says 'I wish the ocean was made of beer'. 'Granted' says the genie and vanishes.

They all lean forward and scoop a handful of liquid and say at once, 'my god, it's true - this is beer'.

He notices a sign in the window, it said ""pianist wanted."" So the guy heads in to apply.

He walks up to the concierge and says ""where's the fucking cock sucking manager I want to see that cunt today, where the fuck is he?"" The concierge is taken back, he's never heard anyone talk like this in this restaurant before. He says ""Sir you can't use that kind of language in this restaurant, please"" ""fuck you jiggle tits, I want to see the fucking manager right now about this pianist job.""

Faced with a difficult situation, the concierge races to get the manager.

A few minutes later the manager appears and the man says ""are you the fucking manager."" The manager replies ""yes I'm the manager and I would like it if you were not swearing in my restaurant."" ""Whatever"" says the man ""I'm here to apply to pianist job."" The manager tries to distance himself from the man and says ""oh we're not hiring right now. But if you give me a resume I'll put it on file."" ""Bullshit"" says the man and he starts to make a commotion as a crowd gathers.

Knowing the situation is only going to escalate the manager decides to give the man a interview knowing that there's no way in hell he's going to hire him. ""Sir if you would just make your way to the piano I'd like to hear what you can play.""

The two walk over to the piano that sitting in the middle of the room, it's a 20-year-old Steinway.

The manager asks, do you know any blues? The man replies ""blues I know some fucking blues I'll play the best cock sucking fucking blues you ever heard your whole fucking life."" And Sure enough the man starts to play and it's the most beautiful blues the manager has ever heard in his entire life. He's taking completely back. ""That was amazing, that's the best playing I've ever heard my whole life what's the name of that song?"" Said the manager. 

""The name of the song?"" the man replies it's called ""your grandma's cunt is my freedom hole.""

The manager is shocked yet still intrigued, he asks the man if he knows any jazz and sure and enough the man delivers and plays the most beautiful jazz he's ever heard in his life. What was the name of that song? That song was called ""I fucking raped your mother then went upstairs and banged her sister and daughter for fun in A minor""

""Do you know any nice ballads?"" asks the manager. And yet again the man plays is the most beautiful ballad he's ever heard in his life. The manager is impressed, he's never seen talent like this before so he agrees to give The man the pianist job based on the condition that he never speaks into the microphone and he never names any of his songs to the public. 

The man agrees to the terms.

A few months go by and the man is playing up a storm. He's the hottest act in town and the restaurant is seeing record numbers of people show up for the finest food in New York.

One day the pianist is feeling kind of horny so he heads to the bathroom to knock one off. As he gets in the stall he notices there's a porno mag on the toilet he thought to himself ""Well aren't I fucking lucky."" He sits down, whips out his cock and commences jerking off. Moments later he cums. Feeling relieved, the man pulls up his pants and makes his way for the door.

As he's walking down the main hall to the restaurant he is approached by a young woman who says to him ""do you know you have fucking jizz all over your shirt, your shoes, your face and your pants?""

""Know it?? I fucking wrote it.""",Best long joke ever. If you don't get it you're not good at following along.,0

Flea A is sitting in the bar, enjoying his drink, when Flea B walks through the door.  And Flea B is fucking frozen.  Iced up, shivering, shaking, and not looking so good.

Flea A looks at him and says ""What the Hell happened to you?""

""Ugh, I had to catch a ride down here in the mustache of a biker doing 65 down the highway with no helmet on.  I'm freezing!""

Flea A shakes his head at Flea B and says ""Look, buddy, I'll teach you the secret.  What you do, you go to that place the humans call an 'airport.'  And you find a 'plane' that's coming down here, and you go find one of those flight attendants.  Me, I like the female ones.  You crawl up her leg, and you get to that warm, wet spot between her legs, you relax and ride there the whole way here.  It's the fucking best.""

Flea B looks like he just heard the secret of like, nods, and agrees.  ""Hell yeah, man.  Next year!""

So the two have a great summer, say their goodbyes, and go back to flea life for a year.  

Next year, Flea A is sitting in the bar, sipping his drink, and in through the door walks Flea B... shivering, shaking, and iced over.  Flea A is mortified, and just shakes his head.  ""Dumbass, didn't you do what I told you to?""

""YES,"" yelled Flea B, ""I did exactly what you said.  I went to the airport, and I found a flight attendant, and I crawled up her leg, and I got all settled in to that warm and wet place, and it was so fucking comfortable I fell asleep.""

""Well what happened?""

With both the USA and Russia standing on the brink of total nuclear annihilation, the leaders decide to meet. Both agree that nothing on earth is worth an apocalypse, so they decide to end things once and for all; with a winner-takes-all dogfight. Both sides have 5 years to breed a dog, and on the set date of the fight, a single uncontested world power will emerge. 

The Russians immediately find the biggest and meanest Rottweiler in all of Russia. They breed it with Siberian wolves, and when the puppies are born, all but the single strongest one are killed. It gets all its mothers milk, and spends everyday being trained in abuse to become the ultimate killing machine. Specialists from all over Russia are brought in to train and genetically engineer the toughest dog the world had ever seen. 

The five years pass, and it's the day of the fight. Everyone feels sorry for the Americans. The Russians showed up with beast nothing short of a hell spawn, while all the Americans have is an odd looking, 7ft long dachshund. 

The fight begins, everyone is expecting a slaughter. The Russian dog snarls once, and is then is eaten in a single bite by the American dog. 

The Russian president is in disbelief and goes to the American president and says, 

""I don't understand, we spent 5 years and our best people creating an unbeatable killing machine, how did we lose? “

The doctor looks at him and says

""Well, we're all out of medicine for that, but there might be something else I can do for you. Come home, then come back tomorrow with an orange, a Twinkie, and a baseball bat""

So the man goes home and gathers up his supplies, then goes to bed and shows up the next day with an orange, a Twinkie, and a baseball bat. The doctor takes the baseball bat and sets in the corner, then takes the orange and shoves it up the man's butt. He waits five minutes, then puts the Twinkie up after it. The doctor then tells the man to go home and come back the next day with another orange, and another Twinkie.

So the man goes home, and he comes back the next day with another orange and another Twinkie. The doctor takes the orange and he shoves it up the man's butt, then he waits five minutes then puts the Twinkie up after it.

The doctor and the man go on like this for a week, with the man coming back every day with an orange and a Twinkie.

Finally, at the end of the week, the doctor tells the man to come back the next day with just an orange. The man goes home, gets his orange and comes back the next day. The doctor takes the orange and, as is usual, shoves it up the man's butt. Then he waits. Five minutes go by, then ten, and the man starts to get impatient, but the doctor won't let him leave. Finally after half an hour, the man feels something shift inside his stomach. Suddenly, the tapeworm sticks his head out the man's ass and says ""Hey! Where's my Twinkie?"" And the doctor hits it with the baseball bat.

Jesus and St. Peter step up to the tee box on the 17th hole. The 17th hole is a huge dog-leg left with a pond in the middle.

St. Peter says to Jesus, ""Ok Jesus, you can't try to go for the green here. You have to take the safe play down the middle, then go for the green from there. If you go for the green you will almost definitely land in the pond. The only person to get to the green from here was Sam Snead, 1951 Masters.""

Jesus replies, ""Well that was Sam Snead, I'm Jesus Christ, I think I got this.""

St. Peter just shrugs at him and steps up to hit his ball. He makes the safe play and hits it down the middle.

Jesus steps up to the tee box, tees up his ball, and starts taking some very strong practice swings. He lines up, aims for the green, and takes a huge cut at it. The ball is hit well, but still lands in the pond. St. Peter kind of smirks and heads toward his ball.

Jesus goes to the pond and starts walking on the water, looking down to find his ball. A man from the clubhouse sees him doing this and runs out to see. In complete shock of seeing him walking on the water, the man shouts ""Holy crap, who do you think you are? Jesus Christ???""

St. Peter chimes in and says, ""No, Sam Snead, 1951 Masters.""",Jesus and St. Peter are golfing at Augusta National Golf Club (Golf joke),2

Vinny brings his whole family to the courtroom to cheer him on. They are a very loud and rambunctious Italian family.

Vinny stands in front of the judge and the judge says, ""Ok Vinny, before you become an American citizen I have to ask you a few questions about American history""

Vinny very confidently says, ""Hey, not a problem judge."" As he looks back to his family, he can see that they are all very excited and waiting with eager anticipation.

The judge says ""Ok Vinny, who was the first president of the United States?""

Vinny responds, ""Oh judge, that's-a easy one... George-a Washington!""

Immediately Vinny's whole family stands up and erupts into applause. You can hear ""Hey Vinny!"" ""That-a boy!"" Way to go!""

The judge puts his hands up ""Ok, ok, everybody calm down... Second question, when was the Declaration of Independence signed?""

Vinny confidently pulls on his collar a bit, put his hands out in front of him, and says ""Judge, another easy one... 1776!""

Once again his family erupts, making more noise than the last time. ""Way to go Vinny!"" ""That-a boy!""

""Calm down, calm down"" says the judge.

At this point Vinny is pretty confident. He is looking back at his family, giving them a couple of ""Hey-yo, howya doins"" and they are loving it.

It seems as if the judge has lost all control of the courtroom. The family is on their feet and Vinny is in love with himself.

The judge says, ""Ok Vinny last question.""

""Not-a problem judge"" Vinny replies.

The judge kind of smirks, knowing there is no way that Vinny gets this one. He says, ""Who assassinated Abraham Lincoln?""

The crowd goes silent.

Vinny is looking around with his head down, clearly very distraught. It becomes very apparent that Vinny will not get the answer to this one.

Vinny nervously grabs his collar and replies, ""Hey-a judge... well I-a... I don't know.""

His family erupts in the biggest uproar of the night. People are now jumping up and down in excitement. It seems as if the clock just his midnight on New Years Day. The judge is banging his gavel, completely confused as to what is going on. Vinny turns to his family and raises his hands high in the air as if he just won a grand prize.

From deep within the crowd you hear a voice shout out with great pride... ""That-a boy Vinny! Don't-a squeal on-a nobody!""",An Italian guy named Vinny comes to America to become an American Citizen...,22
