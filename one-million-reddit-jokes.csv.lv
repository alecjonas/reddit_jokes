One day the first man, a brunette, opened his lunch and said:


""My wife packed me turkey again! If I have turkey one more time, I'm going to jump off this roof and kill myself."" 


The second man, a redhead, opens his lunch and says:


""Ham again?! If I have ham one more time I'm going to jump off this building and kill myself.""


The third man, a blonde,  opens his lunch and says:


""A BLT again?! If I have a BLT one more time I'm going to jump off this building and kill myself.""


The next day the three men once again took their lunch on top of the skyscraper. The brunette man opened his lunch, saw a turkey sandwich, jumped off the building and died. The redhead opened his lunch, saw a ham sandwich, jumped off the building and died. The blonde man opened his lunch, saw a BLT, jumped off the building and died.


That week at the funeral, the wives of the brunette and redhead were inconsolable. They tried to comfort each other but we're both sobbing uncontrollably at the sudden and devastating loss of their husbands. They then saw that the blonde man's wife wasn't crying, and instead looks rather angry.


""Why aren't you crying?!"" 


Said the brunette man's wife.


""We basically killed our husbands by packing them the same lunch every day.""


The blonde man's wife looked at them and said:


""Speak for yourselves, my husband packed his own lunch every day!""",A joke my dad told me when I was a kid.,80

She puts on her dressing gown and goes downstairs to look for him.

She finds him sitting at the kitchen table with a hot cup coffee in front of him. 

He appears to be in deep thought, just staring at the wall.

She watches as he wipes a tear from his eye and takes a sip of his coffee...

'What's the matter, dear?' she whispers as she steps into the room.

The husband looks up from his coffee, 'I am just remembering when we first met 20 years ago and started dating. Do you remember back then?' he says solemnly.

The wife is touched to tears thinking that her husband is so caring, so sensitive.
'Yes, I do' she replies.

The husband pauses. The words were not coming easily.

'Do you remember when your father caught us in my car?'

'Yes, I remember!' said the wife, lowering herself into a chair beside him.

The husband continues, 'Do you remember when he shoved the shotgun in my face and said, 'Either you marry my daughter, or I will send you to jail for 20 years?'

'I remember that too' she replies softly.

He wipes another tear from his cheek and says...

During the night, believing that Billy is asleep, Jane goes to the front door to let her boyfriend in. Her boyfriend goes to the bedroom and climbs the bunk with her. Jane warns her boyfriend that Billy is just a kid and she wouldn't want him to know the nasty things the couple will be doing up there.

As they tend to talk dirty aloud during sex, they come up with codes: ""carrot"" was dick, ""lettuce"" was vagina, ""egg"" was mouth and ""tomato"" was asshole. And so they begin to wiggle about and shouting sentences like ""oh! shove that carrot in my tomato! sit that lettuce in my egg!"" and all kinds of combinations with their code words.

Obviously at this point Billy was awake and upset, hearing the whole ordeal. When his patience finally runs out he climbs there and shouts ""STOP MAKING THIS SALAD ALREADY! THE MAYO IS SPILLING DOWN HERE!""

He immediately goes to hell, where the devil is waiting for him.


""I don't know what to do here,"" says the devil. ""You are on my
list, but I have no room for you. You definitely have to stay here,
so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got a couple of folks here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.""


Obama thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened
the door to the first room.
In it was Ted Kennedy and a large pool of water. Ted kept
diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over, and over.
He dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in hell.


""No,"" Obama said, ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer, and
I don't think I could do that all day long.""


The devil led him to the door of the next room.
In it was Al Gore with a sledge- hammer and a room full of huge blocks of various-sized chunks of iceberg.
All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.


""No, this is no good; I've got this problem with doing actual work of any kind.
I would be in constant agony if all I could do was work
all day, commented Obama.


The devil opened a third door. Through it, Obama saw Bill
Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his
legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.


Obama looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, ""Yeah, man, I can handle this.""
The devil smiled and said...........


""OK, Monica, you're free to go.""",Obama Dies and Goes to Hell,6

Somehow, though, they didn't know what to call themselves.   

  Seemed like normal routine that every morning over ramen, they all argued about the name of the company, until one morning, one of the team asked, ""Why don't we just ask the Brits, those retarded round eyes seem to come up with creative nonsense that people love, so lets ask them?"".

  As you could imagine with Japanese folk, this was infuriating, but eventually they all agreed to ask (company name redacted for security purposes) for advise on a name for their car line.   So the Brits asked saome questions, like, "" Anything special about the car? Does it get better gas mileage than other cars?  does it change how we see cars?"" and that sort of thing.  
    When the group said no, not anything in particular. The Brits gave up.  So the desperate Japanese folk turned to the Russians.  When they got the same reply, they turned to the French, then the Americans, even to the drunk Irish.  But to no avail.  

So they sunk to asking their greatest rivals of advancing technology, the germans.  

The Germans asked the same questions as everyone else had at first, "" Anything special, better gas mileage, revolutionary design, ect."" When met with the same answer as everyone else got, the Germans asked, ""Well, how long did it take you to make them?""  
They replied, ""About 3 weeks.""

The doctor recommends a thorough examination to which the guy agrees.

When the guy drops his pants, the doctor sees an enormous penis and determines that is the cause of the stutter. 

“What can be done?” the guy asks. 

“The only way to correct the problem is to reduce the size of your penis,” days the doctor. 

It’s a very difficult decision for obvious reasons, but  the guy figures it’s better to be able to go on dates so decides to go through with the procedure.

The operation is a complete success and the guy’s stutter is completely gone. He’s so excited and immediately strikes up conversations with women and sets up dates.

Many of the dates go well and he takes the women back to his place. But every time, when they get into bed, the women laugh at his now very small penis and leave.

The guy goes back to the doctor knowing that he made a mistake and needs to reverse the operation.

He sits down in the doctor’s office and explains the situation. “Doctor, I need to reverse the operation as soon as possible!”

But the doctor replies, “su-su-su-su-sorry.”",A guy with a bad stutter goes to see the doctor. [nsfw],7

post,7bbblu,2qh72,jokes,false,1510034673,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7bbblu/the_tale_of_louise/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time there was a 7-year-old girl named Louise. Now from a young age Louise had always had an interest in science. Someday she wanted to be an astronaut, to pilot a spaceship, and to explore alien worlds, but she didn't have time for any of those things. You see, Louise's family owned this farm, and any time Louise wanted to, say, build a model spaceship or ""plot her Mars base"" (complete with a room that was filled with kitty cats!), as she would often do, her father would say ""Sorry, Louise, there's manure to scoop."" and she would have to go and shovel manure. So Louise would go and she'd shovel the manure. 

Louise had a secret, however. She had discovered this secret the day after her older sister moved out. One of the walls in her room could slide back to reveal a hidden room. Inside this room she kept all her ""space gear"": space goggles, a map of the solar system, a series of stories she wrote about this alien race she made up and all the hell that would break loose when humans encounter them. 

Today was Louise's 14th birthday, and she was tired of shoveling manure. Louise wanted nothing more than to finally speak her mind. She wanted to become a scientist, not work on some farm for the rest of her life. Her parents were eventually persuaded. When she was 18 she left and went to college, got a master's degree in astrophysics, and got a job at NASA.

Louise eventually met a fantastic man named Matt and they fell in love. Within three years they were married and they had one child, a girl named Cassie. Cassie was also interested in science and, of course, her parents were far more allowing of that than Louise's had been.

But all was not perfect. Matt, unfortunately, was killed in a car crash when Cassie was 10. Louise did her best to raise her child on her own.

Cassie went on to discover a strange new species of rabbit found deep underground. They were quite intelligent, and they could breathe without needing oxygen. Cassie had the idea that these rabbits could be used to explore Mars. And soon, Mike and Jake, two space rabbits, were sent out on a mission to Mars.

Mike and Jake, while piloting the spaceship, discovered that there was a stowaway on their ship. Who could it be? 

They looked around. 

Then they searched some more.

The stowaway was hard to find, but eventually they found him, a rabbit named Kevin. Now Kevin was very annoying, and he annoyed the crap out of Mike and Jake while they tried to make it to Mars. Still, there was nothing the two NASA rabbits could do, they were pretty close to approaching Mars and their best option was just to go with it.

So the three space rabbits landed on Mars eventually. Mike was excited, Jake was kinda scared, and Kevin had resorted to singing ""1000 bottles of beer on the wall"". They wandered around the planet rather aimlessly for a while, with nothing to really report. They traveled and traveled and traveled and it seemed like they had been there for an eternity. Eventually, the rabbits heard a strange noise with their large rabbit ears.

*thump thump thump thump thump*

They wondered what that noise could be and started to make their way towards it. Eventually the sound grew louder.

*THUMP THUMP THUMP*

And eventually it sounded like... a beat? Music perhaps?

*T H U M P  T H U M P  T H U M P  T H U M P*

And... they saw it. A silhouette over the horizon. It looked like a rock. No, it was a house. A house? On Mars? Kevin was still annoying as ever and now down to ""4 bottles of beer on the wall"".

They traveled closer to the house. It was definitely a house. A giant mansion of a house. And it was packed to the brim with martians having a party of some sort. 

There were martians in the pool, martians on the roof, martians dead on the pavement. The space rabbits were hungry after their long trip and decided to grab some pizza at this party. But the line to get the pizza was RIDICULOUSLY long. It went upstairs, downstairs again, out the door and around the house at least five times. They gave up on getting pizza. What rabbits eat pizza anyways? So they decided to get some snacks. Chips, pretzels, and the like. But this line was even longer. It went upstairs, downstairs again, out the door and around the house at least ten times. The rabbits were famished and parched. Then, they saw it. They saw it at last. Adventurous Louise, spirited Cassie, and obnoxious Kevin had all led up to this moment. This moment when they could be the first rabbits to set foot on Mars, and, while on Mars consume a fruity drink. Do you know why? Well, there was no punch line.

Once home, the guy urinates into the cup. He then asks his wife to add some of hers. Then he asks his daughter. Then he goes into the garage, gets some oil from his car and adds that to the sample.

Very soon the little bird became too cold to fly and it crashed to the ground. In a matter of minutes the little bird started to freeze solid and thus became unconscious. 

There comes a cow from uphill and saw to help the little bird by covering the little bird in cow dung. The little bird awakes and notices how warm it turned out to be, and expressed his appreciation by singing a happy tune. 

The tune carried through the field and startled the attention of a cat. The cat starts to follow the sound of that tune she was hearing. It didn’t take the cat very long and found the bird sitting in a pile of cow dung, dug him out and ate him.

The moral of the story is, that not everyone that shits on you is your enemy and not everyone who pulls you out of it is your friend. Therefore, if you find yourself stuck in a pile of shit, it’s sometimes wise to just keep your fucking mouth shut. ",A bird flies South,12

Sure enough the knock comes, the door opens and there is Roger, her 85 year old groom, ready for action. They unite as one.

All goes well, Roger takes leave of his bride, and she prepares to go to sleep.

After a few minutes, Jenny hears another knock on her bedroom door, and it's Roger,

Again he is ready for more 'action'. Somewhat surprised, Jenny consents for more coupling.

When the newlyweds are done, Roger kisses his bride, bids her a fond good night and leaves.

She is set to go to sleep again, but, aha, you guessed it - Roger is back again, rapping on the door and is as fresh as a 25-year-old, ready for more 'action'.

And, once more they enjoy each other.

But as Roger gets set to leave again, his young bride says to him, 'I am thoroughly impressed that at your age you can perform so well and so often. I have been with guys less than a third of your age who were only good once. You are truly a great lover, Roger.'

He immediately pulled the car to the side and got out to see if he could help the poor bunny.  It didn't look good.  He raced back to the car to retrieve his bag, but realized almost instantly that he was driving his wife's car and so his bag would not be there.

He rooted through the glovebox, trying to find gauze or water - anything that could be useful.  He found a bottle of what he expected was water and brought it back to where the bunny was laying.  With great care, he poured a cap full and let the bunny drink.  

To the doctor's amazement, the rabbit sprang back to life - jumping up on his hinds and wiggling his tail.  He smiled at the doctor and waved as he began to prance back toward the woods.  He hopped a couple of feet, paused, turned and waved again.  Another few feet and he turned and waved again.  He reached the edge of the trees and again, he turned and waved at the doctor.

Stunned, the doctor brought the bottle up to the light to see what magic potion he had discovered.  Squinting his eyes, he read the label aloud, ""Hair restorer with permanent wave"".  ",The good doctor,341

His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.
""Welcome to heaven,"" says St. Peter. “What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.""
 
""Really, I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,"" says the senator.
""I'm sorry, but we have our rules.""
 
And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him.
Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people. They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and champagne.
 
Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a good time that before he realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises...
The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.
 
""Now it's time to visit heaven.""
So, 24 hours pass with the senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and, before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.
 
""Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now choose your eternity.""
The senator reflects for a minute, then he answers: ""Well, I would never have said it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in hell.""
 
So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above. The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder.
 
""I don't understand,"" stammers the senator. ""Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drank champagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?""

I, the Penis, hereby request a raise in salary for the following reasons: 

I do physical labor.

I work at great depths. 

I plunge headfirst into everything I do.

I do not get weekends or public holidays off , but sometimes more work to do in weekend .

I work in a damp environment.

I work in a dark workplace that has poor ventilation. 

I work in high temperatures.

My work exposes me to contagious diseases. 

Sincerely,
*P. Enis*


The Response:

Dear Mr.P.Enis,

After assessing your request, and considering the arguments you have raised, the administration rejects your request for the following reasons: 

You do not work 8 hours straight.

You fall asleep after brief work periods.

You do not always follow the orders of the management team. You do not stay in your designated area and are often seen visiting other locations. 

You do not take initiative - you need to be pressured and stimulated in order to start working.

You leave the workplace rather messy at the end of your shift.

You don't always observe necessary safety regulations, such as wearing the Correct protective clothing.

You will retire well before you are 65.

You are unable to work double shifts.

You sometimes leave your designated work area before you have completed the assigned task.. 

And if that were not all, you have been seen constantly entering and exiting the workplace carrying two suspicious-looking bags.

Sincerely,

*V.  A. Gina*

--------------

There was this guy walking down the road when he noticed a night club ahead. He went in, went up to the bar and asked for a drink. The bar owner, who was tending bar, said, ""I've never seen you in her before.""

The guy says, ""Yes, I'm not from around here. I'm just passing through on my way to find a job.""

The owner asks, ""What do you do?""

The guy says, ""I write music and play the piano.""

The owner, looking excited says, ""REALLY! I have an ad in the paper looking for someone to play my piano. Please sit down at the keyboard and play for me if you're interested.""

The guy does and as he plays the piano the owner is in awe of his talent and musical abilities. The owner says, ""You play the piano more beautifully than anyone I have ever heard! What is the name of that song?""

The guy says, ""I wrote that song and the name is Two Lesbians Fucking Their Brains Out.""

The owner gasps and is taken back. He says, ""My gosh, that's a terrible name for such a beautiful song. Do you know any others?""

The guy smiles and plays again. Once more the owner is astounded by this guy's talent and musical abilities. He's almost afraid to ask but he does ask what the name of the song he just played.

The guy answers, ""I Fucked Her All Night Until She Couldn't Take Anymore.""

The owner again was shocked. The owner says, ""OK, you play beautifully and the songs you have written are incredible. I will hire you, but you have to promise not to tell the name of your songs to the patrons."" The guy agrees.

That night the guy was playing the piano and the crowd was just as amazed as the owner was with this man's musical abilities. After playing two songs the crowd stood up and applauded. The guy was really pleased and stood up to take a bow. When he stood up and faced the audience, it was apparent that his zipper was open and his dick and balls were hanging out.

One of the patrons close to the piano says, ""Sir, do you know your dick and balls are hanging out?""

The guy smiles and says, ""KNOW IT, I WROTE IT!""",Know It? I Wrote It.,36

The other guy considers that, but after another drink he says ""Bullshit!""

""No, no! I'll prove it!"" So with everyone watching, he jumps off the building and seems to float there for a second before being blown back in.

The partiers cheer, and the other guy says 'Well, fuck me! Do it again!""

So the other guy shrugs, ""Why not?"" And with the crowd chanting ""Jump! Jump! Jump,"" he takes a running leap and jumps off the building.

He falls to the ground and dies instantly.
