A therapist has a theory that couples who make love once a day are the happiest. So he tests it at a seminar by asking those assembled, “How many people here make love once a day?” Half the people raise their hands, each of them grinning widely. “Once a week?” A third of the audience members raise their hands, their grins a bit less vibrant. “Once a month?” A few hands tepidly go up. Then he asks, “OK, how about once a year?”

One man in the back jumps up and down, jubilantly waving his hands. The therapist is shocked—this disproves his theory. “If you make love only once a year,” he asks, “why are you so happy?”

The man yells, “Today’s the day!”

""It's a Moscatel, three years old, made from grapes harvested from the northern parts of the region, aged in a steel barrel. Low quality wine, but acceptable"".

""That is correct,"" said the shocked director, ""bring another sample, please!""

a long while later, the man and the horse are nearing a very steep cliff, and the man is yelling everything at the horse to make it stop.

''Hold it!''

''Wait!''

''Stop!''

''PLEASE''

Until he finally remembers what the old lady said. With all of his might, he forces the words out of him. ''AMEN'' he bellows.

The horse stops right at the edge of the cliff. A second later and... well... he'd rather not think about that.

So without delaying the boy took his father to a farm, that cheered his father up. Among everything at the farm, the boys father was very amazed and interested in the automatic cow milking machine. The boys father look at his son and asked him to send one these machines to India, he said ""I'm a old timer now, I can't milk the cows at the farm in India, maybe these machines could help"".

The boys father went back to India, few days later the automatic cow milking machine arrived. The machine did really help, saved lot of time.

He thought "" What would happen if I insert my penis in one of these pipe?"". To answer it, he sits on a chair, grabs the pipe and shove his penis in, the vacuum instantly pulls his penis down, which felt very comforting to the old timer. He grabs a newspaper to read while the machine did the job of his hand.

He grabs the pipe and pulls it down, Nope it din't come out, his penis was stuck inside the the pipe due to the vacuum, he was tired, and the machine didn't stop. It happened again, he ejaculated for the second time, this got him very angry and tired. The pipe won't come out.

He screamed for help, but no one could hear him with that loud sound of the machine. He was sweating and screaming for help, he quickly decided to call his son to England. He quickly tell his son about the whole situation and that the pipe wont come out.

""I'm keeping up my skills, because when I get out of here, I'm going to be a professional baseball player!"" the inmate replies.

She's says she's never ever even been hugged by any man other than her father. So he asks her if she'd like a hug from him, she nods yes. He hugs her tightly and she smiles. And after a little more talking he goes on his way.

Next day he's taking his daily walk again. And there she sits, crying again. Walking to her again he asks what the matter? She's say well the hug you gave me yesterday was very comforting, but... I've also never been kissed by any man and in my condition probably never will. So he leans in slowly and gives her a little Peck on the cheek. She smile's but he can feel she wants a little more, he leans back in a gives her a passionate kiss on the lips. She now smiles ear to ear and giggles some, satisfied with how happy she was now he goes on with his walk.

Next day same beach, same girl, same tears. He walk over and says now now what's a matter today. She says the hug was nice, the kiss was better but that just has her thinking if that will be all she'll ever have. Will she ever get fucked. Surprised by this he says well maybe I can help with that to. She smiles and nods. So he reaches down lifts her from her chair, walks over and throws her in the ocean.

He somehow returned to the den. He didn't tell the lioness what had happened. But she said, ""he took you to the tree, didn't he?"". 

The lion said ""yes, but how do you know.""

The lioness replied, ""why do you think I told you to not go after him. I've already been fooled by him once"".

One day, after Timmy gets some good grades in school, his parents say, “Timmy, we’re going on a picnic!” and Timmy was so happy because Timmy loves picnics!


So they get everything together. They get the blanket, the basket, some sandwiches, chips, salted nuts, and some nice cold sodas in the cooler. Now, Timmy’s family lives in California, and do you know where families go on picnics in California if they don’t live near the beach? The redwood forest! Where else? So Timmy and his family drive to the mighty redwood forest. Timmy’s excitement is really growing now, because Timmy loves picnics! They park their car and hike in a small distance until they find a nice shady meadow, but not too shady. A meadow shady enough that you can feel the warmth of the sun, but you’re not blinded by it.


Timmy’s parents roll out the blanket and start on some delicious sandwiches. They crack open some nice, cold sodas. Timmy is so happy, because Timmy loves picnics! WHEN SUDDENLY! A BEAR! A GRIZZLY BEAR! COMES ROARING THROUGH THE FOREST AND STARTS MAULING TIMMY’S PARENTS TO DEATH! THE BEAR BITES HIS MOTHER IN THE NECK, AND RIPS OUT HER JUGGULAR VEIN! HER BLOOD SPLATTERS ALL OVER TIMMY! IT GRABS HIS FATHER, ONE PAW ON HIS TORSO, THE OTHER PAW ON HIS THIGH, AND RIPS THE FATHER IN HALF.


With his dying words his father says, “Timmy, run!” So Timmy runs through the forest, he runs for what feels like an eternity until his legs give out and he can run no more. He falls from exhaustion amongst the pine needles. As he lay there, still covered in his mother’s blood, he begins to question his love of picnics. After a short while he gets up, and he looks around. Scanning the horizon he spots a small ranger station in the distance, he slowly makes his way over. As little Timmy bursts trough the screen door of the ranger station he cries out, “My parents! The bear! It killed them!” The ranger, a large man in every sense, gets up. The ranger walks over to Timmy, unzips his pants, “Boy, this just ain’t your day.”

TL;DR: Timmy got molested.

She'd wander around hacking, trying to get it out. I chatted with a vet about this and he suggested i put vaseline on her front paws.  I...uh what?  He explained further - vaseline is a  non-toxic lubricant. If you put it on her paws, cats hate the feeling and will do the only thing they can do - lick it off. The vaseline will coat the throat and allow the hairball to get out. 

I just stared at him for a minute before saying - that sounds incredibly logical, I'll try it.  Sure enough, a week later, she started hacking. I applied some vaseline and she gave me the death stare as she licked it off. But it worked and she got the hairball up and out.  Fantastic!  I repeated the process as needed over the next few weeks and it worked every time. But she hated it every time. 

Yesterday, she started hacking. She looked at me. I looked at her, and like a rocket - she's running away from me.  I take off after her, she runs though an open door - my neighbour, a nice grandmother is sitting on her porch - all she sees is my cat running across the laws, me chasing her with a jar of vaseline going 'here kitty kitty'",My cat had a hairball caught in her throat,40

walk.
 
The man stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes with the officer quietly observing. 
 
After what seemed an eternity and trying his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his own car which he fell into.

He was there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off. 
 
Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off (it was a dry night), flicked the hazard flasher on and off, tooted the horn, and then switched on the lights.
 
He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little, and then remained stationary for a few more minutes as more patrons left in their vehicles.
 
At last ( when almost everyone had left) he pulled out of the parking lot &amp; started to drive slowly down the street.
 
The police officer, having patiently waited all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, promptly pulled the man over and carried out a breathalyser test. 
 
To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence of the man having consumed alcohol at all!

Dumbfounded, the officer said, ""I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the Police Station. This breathalyzer equipment must be broken.""

""I doubt it,"" said the man, ""Tonight, I'm the designated decoy.  They all got away!""",A friend in need,241

They are in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings.

The teacher asks Mr. Trump if he would like to lead the discussion of the word “Tragedy.”  So he asks the class for an example of a tragedy. 
 
One little boy stands up and offers: “If my best friend who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that would be a tragedy.” 
 
“No,” says Mr. Trump, “that would be an accident.” 
 
A little girl raises her hand: “If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.” 
 
“I’m afraid not,” explains the exalted businessman. “That’s what we would call a great loss.” 
 
The room goes silent. No other children volunteer.  Mr. Trump searches the room. 
 
“Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?” 
 
Finally at the back of the room, a boy raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: “If a private jet carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.” 
 
“Fantastic!” exclaims Mr. Trump, “That’s absolutely right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?”

The old farmer replies ""Shur I know that. But I have a brother in New York and another in New Zealand and they both do the same thing. We used always come in jere together of a Friday, so we keep up the tradition"". The barman, touched, happily agrees to keep up the tradition with him.

So it goes until one day, many months later, the old farmer orders only 2 pints. The barman is shocked. He wonders which of the brothers dies but doesn't want to put him on the spot in front of everyone. At the end of the night, with everyone else gone home, the barman finally says ""I'm sorry for your loss. Which one of your brothers has passed on"", and the old man replies ""It's not that, at all.

A man is getting ready to get married to a very Orthodox wife, and he goes to her rabbi for help. He's recently converted and very unfamiliar with Jewish weddings. 
""Rabbi, for the wedding, do I sit with my wife?""
""No, the men sit with the men and the women sit with the women.""
""Okay, can I dance with my wife?""
""No, the men dance with the men and the women dance with the women.""
""Okay Rabbi, a few questions about sex... Can we do it missionary position? Like, man on woman?""
""We don't call it that, but yes, that's fine.""
""How about cowgirl style? Woman on top of man?"" The rabbi scratches his chin.

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal: he'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community. If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave. 
The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate. However, as the rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Yiddish, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate. On the chosen day the Pope and rabbi sat opposite each other. The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The rabbi looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The rabbi pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy . 
Later the Cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our faiths. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all 
around us. The rabbi responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and host to show that through the perfect sacrifice Jesus has atoned for our sins, but the rabbi pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue."" 
Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he'd won. ""I haven't a clue,"" said the rabbi. ""First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole countrywould be cleared of Jews but I told him emphatically that we were staying right here."" 
""And then what?"" asked a woman. 
""Who knows?"" said the rabbi. ""He took out his lunch, so I took out mine.""

There was a little old Jewish man who was having a bit of trouble below the belt. His wife told him to see what was wrong, and after a lot of nudging he finally went to the doctor, and was surprised when the doctor told him he had syphilis. As he sat on the bus on the way home, he turned the word over in his head, he had never heard it before. 
When he got home, his wife said, ""Nu, Hymie, what did the doctor say?""
Hymie shrugged and said, ""I'm not sure. He said it was syphilis, but I'm not sure what that is."" 
""Wait- I'll go look it up.""
Hymie's wife checks the dictionary and returns to the room. She pats him on the back.""We have nothing to worry about. It's a disease of the Gentiles.""",Jewish jokes,23

When the Godfather goes to confront Guido about his missing $10 million, he takes along his lawyer who knows sign language.

The Godfather tells the lawyer, ""Ask him where the money is!""

The lawyer, using sign language, asks Guido, ""Where's the money?""

Guido signs back, ""I don't know what you are talking about.""

The lawyer tells the Godfather, ""He says he doesn't know what you're talking about.""

The Godfather pulls out a pistol, puts it to Guido's head and says, ""Ask him again or I'll kill him!""

The lawyer signs to Guido, ""He'll kill you if you don't tell him.""

Guido trembles and signs, ""OK! You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed at my cousin Bruno's house.""

Goering took Hitler into a shop, went up to the counter, and asked the clerk: “Do you have any left-handed teacups?” The clerk stared at Goering for a moment and then said no, mein herr, I do not.

The two left with Hitler complaining that he did not understand what the point of this was and Goering telling him to be patient. They went to another shop and Goering gave the same act: “Do you have any left-handed teacups?” The clerk stared and shrugged his shoulders.

They left with Hitler becoming incensed over this nonsense and Goering begging for patience. Finally they went into a Jewish shop; Goering again asked the clerk: “Do you have any left-handed teacups?”

The clerk smiled graciously, went into the back room and made a show of rummaging around, brought out a saucer and teacup, set down the saucer, and carefully placed the cup with the handle pointed so Goering could pick it with his left hand. “There you are, mein herr!” the clerk said.

Goering bought the teacup, thanked the clerk, and the two men left. Goering turned to Hitler and said: “See, I told you the Jews were very clever people.”

Just then it starts to rain. As he hears the drops, he remembers about his motorbike, stands up and takes a tube of vaseline out of his pocket. The father immediately stands up and yells 'Okay, okay, I'll do the fucking dishes, just don't touch me!'

Shocked, the flutists end up jumping - while the tenor sax section ends up falling out of their chairs. Drummer gets marked a demerit, everything's fine.

A few months later, the band is back at the bar - having won the state band competition. This time, having mastered the band show, they manage to start playing Melee - they were, after all, a bunch of students. Snare drummer's back at it - except she decides to tell jokes off the Internet.

First joke, fine. Second joke was cutting it, though the third joke was strongly political and conservative. As expected, the single-reed single-payer supporters were extremely offended, and kicked the drummer out. Two demerits this time, and the drummer was ordered to apologize.

The season over, the band decides to throw a major party. Everyone was invited - with a few exceptions. The two tubists who volunteered as bouncers were letting everyone through when the drum line shows up.

""Can't go in here, you're not invited,"" the tubists say as the other drummers go in. ""Says right here.""

The bartender, who knows the senator - now incumbent president - says ""Tequila? That's not your usual drink. What's the matter?"" Obama looks at him with a sad face and says, ""I've been writing my inaugural address and it's not just coming out right. I can't seem to make it work.""

""Well,"" says the bartender, ""why don't you let me listen to it, and I'll tell you what I think.""

Skeptical, Obama pulls out some sheets of paper and begins to read:

""My fellow citizens:

I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.

Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents.

So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.

That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.

These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land - a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights.

Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America - they will be met.

On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.

On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.

We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.

In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted - for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things - some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.

For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.

For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.

For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.

Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.

This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.

For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act - not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric gri
