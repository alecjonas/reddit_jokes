This, of course, knocked the snake about quite a bit.‚ÄùOh, my,‚Äù said the bunny, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm terribly sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt you.

Tell you what, maybe I could slither all over you, and find out what you are, so at least you‚Äôll have that going for you.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOh, that would be wonderful‚Äù replied the bunny.  So the snake slithered all over the bunny, and said, ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre covered with soft fur, you have really long ears, your nose twitches, and you have a soft cottony tail. I‚Äôd say that you must be a bunny rabbit.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOh, thank you! Thank you,‚Äù cried the bunny, in obvious excitement.  The bunny suggested to the snake, ‚ÄúMaybe I could feel you all over with my paw, and help you the same way that you‚Äôve helped me.‚Äù  So the bunny felt the snake all over, and remarked, ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre smooth and slippery, and you have a forked tongue, no backbone, and no balls.

The pheasant pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. And so on.

Finally, after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Whereupon he was spotted by a farmer who dashed into the farmhouse, emerged with a shotgun, and shot the pheasant right out of the tree.

Since young, he always loved the concept of trains and had his parents buy him lots and lots of trains. Toy trains, model trains, you name it, he had it. To no surprise, he grew up with a dream of being a train conductor. He worked hard, studied, and managed to get his dream job, a train conductor. However, one afternoon when he was conducting a train, the train swerved off track and killed one person. He was sent to court, where the judge sentenced him to the electric chair the next day. When asked for his requested final meal that night, he said, ""One banana, please"". He got his banana, and the next day, on the electric chair, they flipped the switch but miraculously, he survived. In this village, they believed that if one did not die to the electric chair, it was a sign from above that his life was not to be ended yet. He was allowed to go, and despite his incident, he managed to get his old job back as a conductor. However, one afternoon when conducting the train, this time, he killed two people. He was sent to court again, where he was sentenced to the electric chair. But this time, for his last meal, he requested for two bananas. He ate his bananas, and on the day after, on the electric chair, the switch was flipped but once again, he did not die. Everyone was astonished, but they had no choice but to let him go as they believed that this was definitely God's will. Shockingly, he managed to return back to work as a train conductor, and one afternoon, he killed three people when conducting the train. When asked for his last meal, he said, ""I would like three bananas, please."" The judge was fed up, and said, ""You know what? No. I've had it with your stupid bananas. Tomorrow, you will go onto the chair without a last meal."" The next day arrived, and although it was against protocol, the judge did as he said and the man went onto the electric chair without his last meal. When the switch was flipped, the man was still alive! The judge could not believe his eyes. ""How are you still alive?"" he demanded. ""I didn't give you a single banana. How?"" The man just smiled and said to the judge, ""It was never the bananas. I survived because... I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was once a little boy who lived in a village...,4

The sheep are extremely connected to each other, so if I kill the white one, the black one will get upset, if I kill the black one, the white one will get upset. What should I do?"".  
The neighbor thinks for a while and doesn't seem to get a good answer so he suggests to go to their Town Hall and ask someone with more intelligence.  
The poor man goes to the Mayor's office and asks him what to to. He tells that he has two lambs, one of them is white and another one is black, the lambs are very interconnected, so if he kills the white one, the black one will turn mad, and if he kills the black one, the white one will get mad. What should he do? The major sits for an hour and thinks about the issue. Then he calls his assistants and advisers and asks for help. Tells them the story. But none of them knows the right answer, so they ask the guy to go to their State Governor, which is much smarter than they. Maybe he could give the right answer. 

The poor guy tells the governor his story ""I am just a poor guy from a village in your state. I had a problem which no one helped me with and they said to come to your office"". The governor listens with attention. ""So I have two lambs"", continues the poor guy ""And I need to kill one of them. If I kill the white one, the black one will get really upset, they are very connected. But if I kill the black one, the white one will get upset. I don't know what to do, neither do people I've asked for a help. Can you help me decide what to do?. The governor asks for a day to think about it. On the next day the guy sees the governor in the office but governor immediately directs him to the president. ""Only he can be helpful in this kind of hard situations"" justifies the governor.  
The guy flies to Washington D.C. to see the president and talk to him about it. He makes an appointment and should wait a week to talk to the president. After a week he finally meets the president for an hour and tells the story. That he has two lambs and they are interconnected and he can't decide which one to kill. The president gets confused and asks the guy to return on the next day. So he does and finds the president without any clue. The president suggests to go to a really smart person in Tibet who is the smartest on the Earth. So he WILL know the answer.  
This poor guy travels to Tibet where he finds the Wise who is very old and everyone knows him for his  smart findings and assistance in international politics even. He stands in a queue to see the Wise, and finally he approaches and says""I am just a guy from a small village. I have two lambs, one of them is black and another one is white. I can't decide which one to kill. If I kill the black one, the white will get upset. If I kill the white one, the black one will get upset. The sheep are very interconnected. I don't know what to do, please help."" The Wise finds this very intriguing and asks the man to come after three days, when he will definitely have the answer. The guy goes and settles in the nearest house and observes the Wise thinking. The wise is mediating day and night. Finally the day came and the Wise shouted happily ""I have the answer!"". The guy runs to him at once and asks about the answer. The Wise says that he should kill the white one. ""But the black one will get upset in that case"" contradicts the man. ""Oh, haven't thought of it"" says the Wise.","One poor man wants to kill one of his lambs, but can't decide which one to kill, so...",0

He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong.

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

‚ÄúPardon me, sir,‚Äù the mailman says, ‚Äúbut you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it‚Äôs only going to end up back at your home in a few days.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again‚Äù replies the Buddhist monk.

‚ÄúBut sir,‚Äù says mailman, ‚Äúyou will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.‚Äù

One day he has finally saved up enough money so he goes down to the dealer. After picking out the perfect bike, the dealer asks if he would like some extra chrome protection added to the bill. The young man is upset because he does not have the extra money, and is now afraid that the chrome will rust as soon as it gets wet. 


The dealer tells him not to worry. There is an old biker trick that will keep the chrome like new. All he has to do is to keep a jar of Vaseline handy and put it on the chrome before it rains - and everything will be fine. The young man happily pays for the bike and leaves. 

A few months later, the young man meets a woman and falls in love. She asks him to come home and meet her parents over dinner. He readily agrees and the date is set. At the appointment time, he picks her up on his new Harley and they ride to her parents house. Before they go in, she tells him that they have a family tradition that whoever speaks first after dinner must do the dishes.

 After a delicious dinner everyone sits in silence waiting for the first person to break and get stuck doing the dishes. After a long fifteen minutes, the young man decides to speed things up, so he reaches over and kisses the woman in front of her family. And no one says a word....... Next he decides to take a more direct approach, so he throws her on the table and makes love to her in front of everyone. And no one says a word..... Now he is getting desperate, so he grabs her mother and throws her on the table. They have even wilder relations. Yet no one says a word..... By now he is getting very worried and is thinking what to do next when he hears thunder in the distance. 

His first thought is to protect the chrome on his new Harley, so he reaches in his pocket and pulls out his jar of Vaseline. And the father says

It hasn't really got a punch line.
There's something to do with them burying the person in the end because they become so small that nobody even knows they're there.

It's like a woman starts to slowly harden or something and the doctors are baffled. They think she's dead so they cut her open and find there's a smaller version of her inside, she's the exact same in every way, just smaller.
And it keeps happening.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A yankee goes down to south Louisiana and wants to go duck hunting. He pays and goes duck hunting and says to his guide, ""man that was fun, and that's a mighty fine dog, I oughtta get one.""

&amp;#x200B;

His guide, the sly cajun he is, says, ""Oh, but now son, that ain't no ordinary dog; and you better know they may try and rip you off.""

&amp;#x200B;

He says, ""really?""

&amp;#x200B;

The guide, with sincerity, returns, ""Boudreaux here is a duck dog--he's special made so he can't sink.""

&amp;#x200B;

The man, surprised says, ""Really!? he looks like an ordinary dog! how can you tell?""

&amp;#x200B;

The guide squats down by the dog and motions with his finger, ""come here son."" And the man stoops down also. He lifts up his tail and points, saying, ""See how small his butt-hole is?""

&amp;#x200B;

The man, intrigued, says, ""Yeah?\`"" And the guide explains, ""A duck-dogs butt-hole is real small so he can't fill up with water and drown, you hear that?""

&amp;#x200B;

The man perks up and shouts, ""yeah, man, thanks!"" The two shake, and the man heads off, going to get a dog the next day before he leaves.

&amp;#x200B;

As he drives through town, he sees a sign up, ""dogs for sale,"" and he goes and checks'em out. He examines each dog, waiting for someone to come see him. Tibideaux walks up and with a look of horror and shock on his face, says, as calmly as he can, ""Man, what are you doin'!?""

&amp;#x200B;

The man says, ""see, sir, I need a duck dog,""

&amp;#x200B;

Perplexed, Tibideaux says, ""You need you a duck dog?""

&amp;#x200B;

He says, ""Yeah, and I really like this one, but all these, their butt-holes are too big--they'll fill up with water and drown.""

&amp;#x200B;

Tibideaux's gets a look of shock as he realises what's going on and his face lights up, with a great gasp, he says long-drawn-out and sincere-like, ""Ohhh, I see. No, these is convertable!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Uhh... convertible?""

&amp;#x200B;

Tibideaux stoops down and lifts the dogs tail and points, saying, ""see how big his butt-hole is? he'll feel up with a bunch a water.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah""

&amp;#x200B;

""watch this,"" Tibideaux grabs the dog's balls and spins'em around, and dog's butt-hole puckers up real small with a yelp, and says, ""See, now he's in hydro-mode!""",A Yankee Goes Duck Hunting....,2

tornados and droughts-not the current situation, where the Wild West means California and you have to brave hottubs, mellowspeak, fires and
earthquakes. That is, it was a simpler time.)

So, Fred found his way to a frontier town and became the bartender at the wildest saloon in the territory. He soon proved how rough and
tough he was, and the owner of the bar was pleased with how he broke up fights and didn't skim too much off the receipts. He told Fred that he (Fred) was doing a fine job, but he should remember one thing: 

""If you ever hear even a rumor that Mad Martin is coming to town, just save what you can, put a bottle of Red Eye on the counter, and head out of
town as fast as you can.""

Fred was pretty perplexed at this, and sought explanation. He was told that Mad Martin was an old mountain man who lived up in the hills
and only came to town once or twice a year. However, Martin was the most dangerous guy they'd ever heard of and few had ever encountered him and lived to tell the tale. 

Fred listened carefully and then promptly forgot all about it. Until, one day a few months later, a cowboy came riding through town at full speed, yelling, ""Martin's coming! Head for the hills!"" The result was incredible. Everybody in town immediately jumped on their horses and took off for the hills. Except Fred. He wanted to see this guy because he didn't believe he could be all that tough. So, Fred just put the bottle of Red Eye on the bar, hid behind the counter, and waited.

He didn't wait long. Soon there was a noise in the street. As Fred looked out a hole in the wall, he saw this huge, mean-looking guy ride down the center of the street on the biggest bull buffalo that Fred had ever seen. The guy stopped the buffalo in front of the bar, jumped off the beast, punched it in the head (dropping the critter to its knees) and bellowed, ""Wait here til I get back!"" 

The fellow turned and walked up the steps. Fred saw that the guy had a pair of huge mountain lions on leashes. He tied them both to a post and kicked them soundly, hollering, ""You pussycats stay here til I'm done!"" The cats fearfully sat down.

Into the bar stormed the fellow, ripping the doors off the wall as he passed. With two strides he approached the bar, picked up the bottle of Red Eye, bit off the neck, and downed it all in one gulp. Poor Fred, thoroughly frightened by now, let out a little whimper. The guy klooked down over the bar and roared, ""What the hell do you think you're looking at!?""

Fred managed to say, ""N..n..n..nothing, mister. Do you want another bottle of Red Eye?"" To which the fellow replied, ""Hell no! I don't have time! I gotta get out of here-Mad Martin's coming!""","Once upon a time, this guy named Fred decided that he was rough and tough enough to seek his fortune in the Wild West.",17

His life was all about tractors. Tractor bedspread, tractor themed birthday parties, tractor t-shirts, school bags, lunchbox, everything Timmy owned was tractor themed in some way. He knew everything there was to know about tractors; big, small, new, old, he knew it all. When he grew up, he was going to drive a tractor. He was saving as hard as a 12 year old could, so that one glorious day, he could buy and own his own tractor. Timmy seriously loved tractors.

As Timmy aged, his obsession grew deeper. He yearned for the day he could own and drive his own tractor, until one day he overheard his parents talking about how they were going to surprise him with a brand new John Deere for his 18th birthday. He could barely contain himself.

Finally, the big day arrived. He was 18! He woke with a start, peeked out the window, and there in the driveway was a giant, brand new John Deere tractor. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TIMMY! Was scrawled on the front windscreen of the tractor. He ran outside, and there were his parents, smiling as widely as any parent could. He ran and hugged his parents, crying and laughing with pure glee in the shadow of the colossus. He had never felt this way before!

But enough was enough. It was time.

He climbed into the cab and sat in the driver's seat. It was perfect. He had waited 18 years for this moment. His hand was shaking as he reached for the key in the ignition. He quickly turned it and‚Ä¶

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

It didn't start. That's odd. Try again.

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

Again? This is weird. Bit of a shame, battery must be a bit flat? Try again.

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

Timmy froze. The tractor wouldn't start. He was let down, betrayed. His whole life up to this point had been a lie. There was a paradigm shift in every fiber of Timmy's being.

Something inside Timmy snapped.

Timmy screamed, and leaped out of the tractor. He ran to the garage still screaming, and returned with an axe and a fuel can. Screaming like a possessed Viking, he hacked and slashed the tractor. The windows, wheels, cab, dash - nothing was left unscathed. Then he doused it in gasoline and lit it up. He stood, panting, watching the tractor burn, with the wails of his parents in the background.

Timmy walked away, to a bar. He was 18 now, and he needed a drink. He sat down and ordered a beer. Timmy sat at the bar reflecting on his life and his disappointment in all things tractor related. He was trying to forget it all when a putrid stench reached his nose. Thick, black, putrid smoke was billowing into the bar, obviously from his burning tractor down the road. Everybody in the bar was coughing and trying to get away to clear air. This smoke was from a tractor and it made Timmy mad, so he jumped up onto the bar and with one deep breath he sucked up all the smoke in the building, and blew it outside.

Everybody stared at him in stunned silence. No one moved. The bartender spoke for everyone in the room

""How on earth did you do that?""

Timmy slowly turned to him. ""I'm an ex tractor fan""",Timmy loved tractors. His life was all about tractors.,18

""Oh that crazy slut"", the dad says at once.

""What??"" The young man says, surprised. ""I can't believe you just said that about my future wife!"", he says, and storms out of the house and goes to the backyard, completely angry at this father.

In the backyard he finds his mother attending to the garden, who notices that something's wrong and asks, ""What's wrong, dear?""

""Nothing's wrong"", says the young man. ""Just had an argument with dad. I gave him great news and he was kind of disrespectful, anyways, it doesn't matter, it's in the past now"", he says.

""A real whore, that one"", says the mother.

""Wait. What???"", says the young man. ""You too, just like dad!"", he shouts in anger.

So the young man, totally irritated gets out of there and starts walking down the street. After a few minutes walking, he notices his friends hanging out at a bar, and so he decides it might be a good idea to join them, have a few drinks and forget about the incidents at home.

After greeting his friends, they ask him what's new, and he says ""I'm getting married"".

""Congratulations"", his friends exclaim. ""That is amazing!"", says another one. Another one shouts to the bartender ""please get us a round of beers, all on me, for the gentleman here that is getting married!"". ""Yeah!"", everyone cheers.

""So, who are you marrying?"", one of them asks.

""I'm marrying Ashley"", our young man responds.

He keeps walking down the street and enters the church. There the priest greets him, ""Hi son! How are you doing? I haven't seen you in years! What brings you to the House of God?""

""I want to know what's the process necessary to get married. No one seems to approve but I'll get married anyways"", the man says, still clearly irritated.
