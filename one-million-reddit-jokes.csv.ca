In the heat of their passion and hurry to get married they did not make a prenup, and when they divided their possessions, the Mustang ended up in the hands of the groom.

The bride, stricken, moved back in with with her mother, who was upset about the unhappiness of her daughter, the divorce and the loss of the family heirloom, the Mustang. She asked her daughter whether or not there was any way for getting the car back to which she told her that she had a plan. The daughter however did not want to tell her mother the plan, but started taking fencing lessons, and practiced night and day, barely doing anything else. The mother tried to inquire the reason for this, but the daughter remained tightlipped about her plan. One morning, she left right before the dawn with her fencing kit and few hour later returned with precious Mustang. Happy with the return of the car, her mother ask how did she manage such a feat.

*“Well, Ma.”* The daughter replied enthusiastically , *“As you noticed, I really wanted to get the Mustang back and told you I have a plan. I consulted some people over the internet and got some fairly good advice from them for getting the car back!  I started practicing my fencing every waking hour. I called my husband and told him I wanted the car back and challenged him to a duel with swords over the car, knowing full well that he would not be able to resist such a gamble.”*

*“So we settled a the time and the place for the duel, and this morning I went to the nearby meadow to meet him, and he brought the car. At dawn we drew swords, and due to my intense practice with the blade, he did not stand a change. It over all over in a few seconds: he attacked me and I parried his blow easily, gaining the upper hand and giving him a fatal blow, and winning back the our lovely Mustang.

At the corner of the street is a three story white house with a large porch. A parrot sits in a cage on the porch by the screen door.
As the woman reaches the corner, she hears from the cage the parrot squawk ""You're fat and you're ugly."" The woman thinks nothing of it at first but again the parrot squawks ""You're fat and you're ugly.""
The woman looks angrily at the bird but decides she must press on. She continues on her walk, her day having taken a decided turn for the worse.
The next day, the woman walks to the same corner and again the parrot angrily squawks from in it's cage. ""YOU'RE FAT AND YOU'RE UGLY! YOU'RE FAT AND YOU'RE UGLY!""
This outburst puts the woman over the edge. She bursts through the gate and up to the porch and begins angrily knocking on the door of the house; all the while the parrot is squawking ""You're fat and you're ugly.""
As the owner of the house answers the door, the woman really lets him have it. ""I have never in all my years met such a misbehaved pet. He's a nuisance to the neighborhood, and I don't much appreciate the way you let him speak so vulgarly! If you don't do something about him, I will!""
The man, of course, is extremely apologetic and naturally agrees to work with the bird. ""Yes maam yes maam, it won't happen again maam.""
A few weeks go by and the woman notices that the parrot is not out on his usual perch. One day, while on her daily walk, the lady notices that the parrot has returned. She hesitates at the corner, almost daring the parrot to say something to her. The parrot sits perfectly silent, and then, with almost a smirk on his beak, stares the woman directly in the eye and says calmly, ""You know.""

Now this is a town that knows how to live! Beautiful, sunny days and warm, balmy evenings. I watched the sunset from a deckchair by our pool yesterday. It was beautiful. I’ve finally found my new home. I love it here.

**September 1:** Really heating up now. It got to 31 today. No problem though. Living in air-conditioned home, driving air-conditioned car. What a pleasure to see the sun every day like this. I’m turning into a sun-worshipper – no blasted rain like back in London! Had the back yard landscaped with tropical plants today. Lots of palms and rocks. No more mowing lawns for me! Another scorcher today, but I love it here. It’s Paradise !

**October 1:** The temperature hasn’t been below 35 all week. How do people get used to this kind of heat? At least today it’s windy though. Keeps the flies off a bit. Acclimatizing is taking longer than we expected. Fell asleep by the pool yesterday. Got third degree burns over 60% of my body. Missed three days off work. What a dumb thing to do. Got to respect the old sun in a climate like this!

**October 25:** This wind is a bastard. It feels like a giant fucking blow dryer. And it’s hot as hell! The home air conditioner is on the blink and the repair man charged R200 just to drive over and tell me he needs to order parts from @#$# Johannesburg. The wife &amp; the kids are complaining.

**October 30:** The temperature’s up around 40 and the parts still haven’t arrived for the fucking air conditioner. House is an oven so we’ve all been sleeping outside by the pool for 3 nights now. Bleeding R4 million house and we can’t even go inside. Why the hell did I ever come here?

**November 4:** Finally got the fucking air-conditioner fixed. It cost R1,500 and gets the temperature down to around 35 degrees. Stupid repairman. Fucking thief. If one more smart bastard says ‘Hot enough for you today?’ I’m going to fucking throttle him. Fucking heat! By the time I get to work, the car radiator is boiling over, my fucking clothes are soaking fucking wet and I smell like baked cat. Fucking place is the end of the Earth.

**November 9:** Tried to run some errands after work, wore shorts, and sat on the black leather upholstery in my car. I thought my fucking backside was on fire. I lost 2 layers of flesh, all the hair on the backs of my legs and off my fucking behind. Now the car smells like burnt hair, fried bum and baked cat. The Weather report might as well be a fucking recording – hot and sunny. Hot and sunny, Hot and fucking sunny. It’s been too hot to do anything for 2 bleeding months and the weatherman says it might really warm up next week. Fuck!!

**November 15:** Doesn’t it ever rain in this darn place? Water restrictions will be next, so my R5,000 worth of palms might just dry up and blow into the fucking pool. The only things that thrive in this hell-hole are the fucking flies. You don’t dare open your mouth for fear of swallowing half a dozen of the little buzzards!

**November 20:** Welcome to HELL! It got to 45 degrees today. Now the air conditioner is gone in my car. The repair man came to fix it and said, ‘Hot enough for you today?’ I wanted to shove the car up his backside. Anyway, had to spend the R2,500 of the mortgage payment to bail me out of jail for assaulting the stupid fool. Fucking PHALABORWA! What kind of sick, demented idiot would want to live here!

**December 1:** WHAT!!!! The FIRST day of Summer!!!!

“What I want you to do,” the man continued, “is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. Tell your descendants to do the same. It shall be our family’s duty to keep this forest strong.”

So they did. Each time the forest lost a tree, the children replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them. And for centuries, the forest remained as lush and pretty as it once was, all because of one man and his re-seeding heirline.",There was an old man who lived by a forest.,361

Every time he did so, the woman was disgusted and told him, ""One of these days, you're going to fart your guts out!""

One morning the woman got up early to cook a turkey for a party they were hosting that night. As she looked down at the turkey's guts and entrails that she had just removed, she got a Mischievous little idea...

The woman took the turkey entrails and guts and walked upstairs to her bedroom, where her husband was still sleeping. She carefully pulled down his shorts and placed the turkey guts inside them. She smiled and went back downstairs to finish her work.

A few minutes later, she heard her husband wake up with his usual ""Sonic-Boom"" fart, immediately followed by a blood-curdling scream. She laughed as she heard him run into the bathroom.

A short while later, he came down to the kitchen still panting from the scare. She tried to hold back a smile as she asked him what was the matter.

This was his reply: ""Honey, you were right! You said one of these days i was gonna fart my guts out,and it happened! But, by the grace of God and these two fingers i was able to get them back in.""",By the grace of God and these two fingers,4

The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulation requiring that family unity be maintained to the highest degree possible. The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. 

When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him. After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him. 

After two recesses to check legal references and confer with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Denver Broncos, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone....",A 15 year old boy....,31

In court, the trucking company's fancy hot shot lawyer, was questioning Clyde. ""Didn't you say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine,'?"" asked the lawyer. 

Clyde responded, ""Well, I'll tell you what happened. I had just loaded my favorite cow, Bessie, into the..."" 

""I didn't ask for any details"", the lawyer interrupted. ""Just answer the question, ...please. Did you, or did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine!'?"" 

Clyde said, ""Well, I had just got Bessie into the trailer behind the tractor and I was driving down the road...."" 

The lawyer interrupted again and said, ""Your Honor, I am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the Highway Patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question."" 

By this time, the Judge was fairly interested in Clyde's answer and said to the lawyer, ""I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite cow, Bessie"". 

Clyde thanked the Judge and proceeded. ""Well, as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite cow, into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my John Deer Tractor right in the side. I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I was hurting, real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.

Shortly after the accident a Highway Patrolman came on the scene. He could hear Bessie moaning and groaning, so he went over to her. After he looked at her, and saw her fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Then the Patrolman came across the road, gun still in hand, looked at me, and said, ""How are you feeling?""

Once the librarian has gotten over the confusion of having a chicken in a library, she wonders whether or not the chicken actually wanted a book. She eventually figures that she might as well humour the chicken's request. If it doesn't know what it's asking for, it won't complain, so why not assume it does? She brings over a book, and as she suspected, the chicken grabs it with its beak and drags it out of the library.

The next day, to her surprise, there's a chicken again. It's the same one. It orders: ""Book, book!"" In equal parts amused and bewildered, the librarian complies with the request, giving it two books, which it drags out of the library as before. The same happens the next day. The chicken comes in and orders: ""Book, book, book!"" The librarian gives it three books, and it drags them off.

This continues, day by day, until the chicken is ordering dozens of books at a time. The librarian is confused and concerned - why is this chicken independently ordering books and not bringing them back? So she decides to close up for the day and follow the chicken to wherever it's going. She has to follow at a safe distance - which lengthens her journey considerably because, of course, a chicken dragging a bag of 25 books is going to be very slow-moving.

Eventually she tracks the chicken to a pond. Oh no, she thinks, the chicken is throwing the books into the pond. This is just like that goose. But no. The chicken calls, and a frog hops out of the water. The chicken presents the books to the frog, one by one...

and the frog says, each time: ""Read-it. Read-it. Read-it.""",A joke that works best when told aloud: The chicken in the library.,23

Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off; it was a fine, dry summer night, flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked the horn and then switched on the lights.  He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little, and then remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patrons' vehicles left.  At last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out and drove slowly down the road.  The police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, and promptly pulled the man over and administered a breathalyser test.  To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence that the man had consumed any alcohol at all!  Dumbfounded, the officer said, ""I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyser equipment must be broken."" ""I doubt it,"" said the truly proud Redneck. ""Tonight I'm the designated decoy.",Recently a routine police patrol was parked outside a bar in the Outback.,22

post,do20e8,2qh72,jokes,false,1572225131,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/do20e8/the_chocolate_house/,self.jokes,,"One day, Dave had met up with one of his oldest friends Matt, who had just returned from his vacation in Belgium.

They discussed the trip, and what Matt had done in Belgium.

 ""I did quite a lot but the most interesting experience I had was visiting the house of chocolates. It may not have been the best tasting, but you can eat whatever you want!"" Matt said with a wink.

Eventually they part ways and Dave has some time to himself. He realizes that he hasn't been on a vacation in several years, and the house of chocolates is something he would really like to see. So Dave books himself a ticket to Belgium for the following week.

The next week Dave lands in Belgium and takes in the sites. He visits the royal palace of Brussels, Gravensteen, the Atomium and many other touristy destinations. Making sure to leave the house of chocolates as his final sight to see.

The day before he leaves, Dave looks up the address for the house of chocolates but can't find the address. He asks the locals around town, who stick their nose up at him and ignore his request for the address. Until one gentleman overhears Dave asking a young couple where the house of chocolates is.

The man approaches Dave with a smile and says ""I overheard you saying you were looking for the house of chocolates?""

""Yes!"" Dave replies ""Everytime I ask someone though, they become extremely uncomfortable and walk away.""

The man replies saying that it was Belgium's best kept secret and that they didn't like to tell foreigners about it. The man tells Dave the address, and with a smile and a wink says ""Have fun!""

Dave thanks the man and rushes over to the house of chocolates.

As he approaches the house he sees several men leaving the house with large smiles on their faces, clearly very satisfied with their visit.

Dave enters the building, and to his surprise he sees that the walls are lined with old blackboards, with women writing on them with their vaginas.

A little taken back, Dave assumes it must be some sort of Belgian custom he is not familiar with.

He decides to ignore it and heads over to the wall furthest from the door, and punches a hole straight through. He rips off a piece of the wall, and is about to take a bite when a woman approaches him and screams ""What the hell are you doing?! I am the madame of this establishment and we do not tolerate this type of vandalism and behaviour in this establishment!""

To which Dave replies ""If this is the house of chocolates, why can't I eat the walls?""",The Chocolate House,3

The woman, excited at his apparent lucidity, replies “Great, thanks! So do you remember who I am? Do you know my name?”

The old man, smile fading, replies “Hmmm... no... no sorry...” 

The woman deflates, gets up and heads for the exit, when the old man stands up as she’s leaving and excitedly shouts “Wait!” The daughter turns around with fresh hope. “Yes?!” She asks. 

The old man, with a grin from ear to ear, shouts “The staff can tell you who you are! They have a list of everyone’s names!”",A woman goes to the senior center to visit their father who has Alzheimer’s,15

So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man said, ""Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. 

“Except what?"" the man asked. 

“Nothing, nothing."" 

“C'mon, tell me! I need something!"" 

""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'"" 

“So what's up with this voodoo dick?"" he asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. 

The businessman laughed, and said ""Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!"" 

The old man replied, ""But you haven't seen what it'll do yet."" He pointed to a door and said ""Voodoo dick, the door."" The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said ""Voodoo dick, get back in your box!"" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more. 

""I'll take it!"" said the businessman. The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. 

The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say ""Voodoo dick, my pussy."" He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.

After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. 

She got it out, and said ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off. 

So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said ""Yeah, right.. Voodoo dick, my ass!""",There was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip.,16

I went up to at least 100 different people in China and asked them a couple of math questions

The first was “What is 109 squared?”. Around 68% of them answered correctly, which I was shocked about.

Then I asked “If 2 lengths of a triangle are 37 and 29.5 then what is the other length?” Again, to my surprise, 73% answered correctly.

So I kept on asking and asking with some consistent results.

Running out of ideas I decided to do an easier question.”If 10 people are standing in a quadrilateral and half of them walked out, how many people are still in there?”

Unexpectedly everybody didn’t answer, in fact nobody even attempted, just straight up denied they knew the answer to this one simple question. This was defiantly a big surprise because even some 6 year olds could work that one out.

So in conclusion it seems that Asian people can be good at math, but refuse to recognise the Ten Men Square Problem","I’ve never understood the stereotype that Asian people are good at math,",59

said Clint. He smiled, and Natasha did too. Life as an Avenger was tough at the best of times, living with the constant danger, with the heavy responsibility, seemingly with only the responsibility for Nat, whilst others wielded the power. And these last few years, these were the worst of times. Since Thanos had snapped his oversized purple fingers and erased from existence 50% of the universe, people had spent five years trying to move on. Some did, but not Nat, and not Clint. And yet they found each other, again, just like in Budapest all those years ago, and maybe they had found hope. Hope for the future, found in the past; as they were currently in 2014, travelling in a spaceship across a foreign galaxy in search of a power as old as time itself. They were, very literally, a long way from Budapest, and it was exhilarating. Clint hadn’t been this far from home since Sokovia, when it was a flying rock in the sky. Nat hadn’t been closer to a home since, well, since she actually had a home. And they were flying a spaceship through space. Perhaps none of this makes sense. But the excitement was palpable, and for the first time in a long time, their smiles were borne of genuine joy.


“Better strap in, we’re making the jump.”


They could see the hexagon coming closer. It was bright, not blindingly so, but enough to illuminate the surrounding emptiness in the void of space. And then more appeared, locked in on each side like a honeycomb, but these were dimmer, as if Space itself knew of their trajectory. Maybe it did, maybe that’s what Nebula meant when she said that their route was fixed. Nat wouldn’t know. Clint didn’t care. They were almost there. They were at the end of the tunnel, and the light had reached them.


And then it was white, and then it was black.


“That felt a bit underwhelming.” Clint thought to himself, before realising that he hadn’t actually been breathing. Letting out a weak laugh to compose himself, he glanced at Nat, who was also panting ever so slightly. They’d just travelled through a wormhole, and for these two, that would always be as crazy as it sounds. Nat reached out and Clint grasped her hand, holding on tightly, as if she might slip away if he loosened his grip. But he wasn’t going to let go. They were closer than ever before.


A warning sound rudely interrupted the moment, and Clint looked ahead. They had arrived, and the ship was preparing to descend. Soon they were cutting through clouds, which Clint swore had not been there a moment earlier, and then they were surrounded by an eerie light, seemingly with no source. There was no ‘Sun’ over here. This was Vormir, they had been told, and it was the dominion of death, whatever that meant. Clint had seen plenty of death. He was responsible for a lot of it recently. But whatever lay in store for them here, they would face it together.


The ship landed with a thud, and Clint again found himself in awe at the astounding technology and engineering that made this possible. They stepped out, and boy was it a sight to behold. Below them were the lakes, scattered between dunes of some sort of solid material. It was like a desert, if the sand was black and the land had been flooded with a copious amount of orange fluid. Mesmerising, but quite creepy. Clint made a mental note never to bring his family here on holiday. When he gets them back, that is. If he gets them back.


“Hey. I think it’s up there.”


Nat’s voice broke Clint out of his latest daydream. He turned around, and in front of him was a giant mountain, seemingly as steep and high as Everest itself, although Clint knew that to be false since he could clearly see the enormous fortress-like thing on its summit. It looked harsh, gloomy, and not at all welcoming. But it stood out, like a beacon of light for two lost souls in search of redemption.


“I bet the raccoon didn’t have to climb a mountain.” Nat rolled her eyes. They were almost at the top, and she was tired.


“Technically, he’s not a raccoon.” Clint was tired too, but he didn’t want to show it. They were so close. They were going to make it, and they can be tired together after.


“Whatever, he eats garbage -” Suddenly they were on alert, gun out for her, arrow at the ready for him. Black Widow and Hawkeye, founding members of Earth’s greatest defenders, ready to face off against the shadow that now blocked their path.


“Welcome,” he hissed, in a soft voice. Clint thought it sounded familiar, maybe from a movie he had watched before. Which was it, Lord of the Rings? The Matrix? Clint couldn’t remember. “Natasha, daughter of Ivan. Clint, son of Edith.”


Clint and Nat exchanged confused looks. This was freaky. “Who are you?”


“Consider me a guide. To you, and to all who seek the Soul Stone.”


“Okay, you tell us where it is, then we’ll be on our way.”


The shadow smiled wryly. It was an ugly smile, as if full of pain and regret. “If only it were that easy. The stone is there, for one of you. For the other… an everlasting exchange. A soul, for a soul.”


He pointed behind him. A long, winding track led to an elevated platform beside a cliff. At the centre of the platform, at the centre of the planet at the centre of the universe, standing tall but no longer steady after eons of wind and rain, was a lever.


Silence fell between the trio as there was no longer any need to explain. It was obvious, only one could pull the lever, and the other would take the stone. It was a trigger, a death sentence for oneself, but hope for the rest of humanity. A steep price to pay, the only question was who would pay it.


Clint caught Nat staring at him. From the depths of his heart he cared for Nat. They had this bond, more so than lovers, more so even than family. It was a special relationship, and Clint knew it. He would never let her get hurt. Whatever it takes.


“I guess we both know who it’s gotta be.”


“I guess we do.” Nat’s voice was soft, but determined. She had a steely gaze in her eyes. And then she took a step forward. And another. Clint frowned.


“I’m starting to think we mean different people here, Natasha.”


But Natasha didn’t stop. She picked up speed, and Clint started running too. He threw one of his grappling hooks, but Nat parried it away with her blade. He whipped out his bow and fired a stun arrow, but Nat anticipated it and dived away. He realised that Nat knew him too well, knew his tricks and knew his thoughts. He couldn’t outwit her here. And the lever was fast approaching.


Clint realised with horror that he wouldn’t be able to catch her. They were equals in strength and ability, but Nat had the head start, and he was carrying more weight. She would get there first, and she would sacrifice herself to save him, to save everyone. But a noble death was still death, and Clint had seen enough of death. He was not going to watch Nat die in front of him. He couldn’t bring himself to do it. Not even for the world.


He forced himself to focus, to think clearly, call upon the fabled split-second decision making of a legendary marksman and think! Nat was going to kill herself. She was going to pull the lever. She was going to die. And suddenly it occurred to him that there was only one way to save Nat – the lever. He couldn’t get there first. But his arrows could.


With one swift motion, honed beyond perfection through years of action, his left hand sought out the bomb arrow and his right hand drew the bow. He dived to one side without breaking stride, and as the unobstructed angle came into view, the arrow soared from its resting point and a split second later, the lever was gone in a cloud of dust and rock.


Nat turned and stared at Clint in disbelief. Clint sat on the ground, drained, not physically but mentally crushed by the realisation of the consequences of his action. Somewhere in the distance, the shadow observe
