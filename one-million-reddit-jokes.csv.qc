After Mass, the priest caught up with him and said, ""Murphy, I am so glad ya decided to come to Mass. What made ya come?""

Murphy said, ""I got to be honest with you Father, a while back, I misplaced me hat and I really, really love that hat. I know that McGlynn had a hat just like mine and I knew he came to church every Sunday. I also knew that he had to take off his hat during Mass and figured he would leave it in the back of church. So, I was going to leave after Communion and steal McGlynn's hat.""
The priest said, ""Well, Murphy, I notice that ya didn't steal McGlynn's hat. What changed your mind?""

Murphy replied, ""Well, after I heard your sermon on the 10 Commandments, I decided that I didn't need to steal McGlynn's hat after all.""
With a tear in his eye the priest gave Murphy a big smile and said; ""After I talked about 'Thou Shalt Not Steal' ya decided you would rather do without your hat than burn in Hell?""
Murphy slowly shook his head. ""No, Father, after ya talked about 'Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery' I remembered where I left me hat.",The Irish Sinner,1520

He was a fair student, but not great, and after several years of study, he graduated with a C average and was assigned as part of a job-placement program to a route in Manhattan.  He loved his new job and everything was great for a while until one day he wasn't paying very close attention and lost control of his cable-car.  It hopped its track and careened off of a pier into the Hudson River.  All of his passengers were killed but Harry managed to swim back to shore.  He was terrified of what would happen so he fled the scene (and, eventually, the city) before police and rescue crews could arrive.

He settled in Houston under an assumed name and took a job in a grocery store, trying to keep as low a profile as possible.  He lived a quiet life, and every day he would watch the Houston cable-cars going up and down the street and he longed for what he had lost.  One day, he decided that he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school again, this time in Houston and under his new name.  He did a little better this time, having been through the classwork before, and graduated with a B average and was assigned to a nice route in La Porte.  His passengers loved him and he loved his job.  But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable car.  It hopped its track and ended up in Trinity Bay.  All of his passengers were killed, but Harry managed to swim back to shore.  Fearing that authorities would put this accident together with the one in New York, he again fled the scene.

This time he ended up in San Francisco with yet another assumed name.  He figured that, if he couldn't operate his beloved cable cars (for fear of getting caught), he could at least see them everywhere he went, as San Francisco is the cable-car capital of the world.  This satisfied him for a little while, but eventually he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school yet again.  He excelled in his classwork this time around (having been through the program twice before) and graduated magna cum laude.  He was assigned the highly-coveted Market Street route and drove it for quite a while without incident.  But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable-car.  It hopped its tracks and ended up in the San Francisco Bay.  All of his passengers were killed and as Harry swam back to shore, the police were waiting for him.

In the subsequent investigation and trial, prosecutors put all the pieces together.  They figured that he was the same guy who killed all those people in Houston and New York.  It was the trial of the century and at the end of it, Harry was sentenced to die in the electric chair for his crimes (the actions having been deemed so egregiously willful and persistent as to constitute premeditation).  He was transferred to Alcatraz to await his execution.
He was a model prisoner, never causing any trouble, and every day he woke and did exactly 52 jumping jacks and 52 sit-ups and 52 push-ups in his cell to keep himself occupied.  The day before his scheduled execution, the warden came to him and asked what he would like for his last meal.  Harry thought about it for a minute and said “I would like a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk”.  The warden stared blankly at him. “Harry,” he said, “we have access to the best chefs in the world.  This is your last meal, and you can have anything you want. Steak, lobster, name it!”  Harry shook his head and repeated his request for a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk.  His disgusting meal was brought to him and he wolfed it down hungrily.  The next day, his head was shaved and last rites were administered, and Harry was led to the electric chair and hooked up.  At the appointed time, prison guards threw the switch and counted to ten before turning off the current to the chair.  But Harry was fine.  Smoldering a bit at the spots where the contacts met his skin, perhaps, but otherwise the picture of health.

Flummoxed, the guards took Harry back to his cell and began the long process of checking and rechecking their equipment for malfunctions, but they couldn’t find anything.  A new execution date was set for one month later, and Harry went back to his morning exercise routine of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups to keep his mind and body occupied while he waited.

The eve of his second execution arrived and the warden visited Harry again to take the order for his last meal. “A rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk,” Harry said.  The warden just shook his head and asked him Harry was sure, then arranged to have his meal brought to him.  The next day, guards shaved his head again, Harry was administered his last rites again, and he was marched to the electric chair and hooked up again.  This time, though, they weren’t taking any chances.  At the appropriate time, they threw the switch and left the juice flowing for a full minute.  And when they were finished, Harry was just fine.

The warden was nervous.  A little known California law stipulated that the state could only make three attempts to execute a prisoner, and if that failed they had to let him go.  Harry was returned to his cell where he resumed his daily morning exercise regimen of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups.  Another month passed, and on the eve of his third execution, Harry was visited by the warden, who just said “let me guess” as he wheeled in a cart with a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk.  Harry thanked him politely and ate his dinner.  The next morning, they shaved his head (AGAIN!) and delivered last rites (AGAIN!) and marched him to the execution chamber, where he was hooked up (AGAIN!) to the electric chair.  This time, prison officials weren’t taking any chances.  The entire Bay Area power grid was diverted to Alcatraz.  They threw the switch (cutting electricity to millions of customers) and left the juice running for a full half hour.  The execution chamber buzzed with the awesome power being fed into the chair.  You could taste the ions in the air.  And when they turned off the power….

Harry was just fine.  The warden shook his head in disbelief.  “Well, Harry,” he said, “we have to let you go.  California law stipulates that we can only make three attempts at an execution.  But before I do, I really have to know.  How did you survive three executions?  Was it the jumping jacks, the sit-ups, and the push-ups?  Was it the rotten banana, rotten apple, and spoiled milk?  What IS your secret?”


Harry just shook his head and shrugged, “I guess I’m just not a very good conductor.”","All his life, Harry wanted to be a cable-car operator...",788

*The woman says: That is okay with me.*  

*For her first wish, she wants to be the most beautiful woman in the world.*  
*The frog warns her: you do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis, to whom women will just flock to!*
  
*The woman replies, That is fine, because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me.*

He checks in on Martin Luther next and he's having a great time with all his loved ones around the dinner table. Satisfied, Jesus moves on to the next one.

On his way to see John the Baptist, Jesus comes across a man sitting in a corner crying. Shocked that anyone could be upset in heaven Jesus walks over to the gentleman.

""What do you think you're doing, son?"" Jesus asked. ""You had better cut that out. There are people here who went to church fifteen times a week to get up here. What if they all started crying too? You had better stop that right now or you'll bring the morale of the whole place down. Alright?""

""I'm sorry. I just can't find him anywhere and I've looked all over."" The man said, still crying.

""What do you mean? Who can't you find?""

The man wipes the tears from his eyes to address Jesus.

""Dats dem up der!"" Says Seamus, pointing at high up bird cage. ""Oi'll tek two a dem budgies up der,"" He says to the shopkeeper, ""an wouldya put em in a pepper bag?""

So they leave the shop, hop in a van parked out side, budgies in hand, and they drive off.
They drive to the edge of a cliff with a 700 ft drop. They go over to the edge, where Seamus takes out the two budgies and a roll of tape lying around in the van.

He places one budgie on his shoulder and wraps loads of tape around the birds feet, attaching it firmly to his shoulder. He does the same with the other budgie on his other shoulder.
He says to Finton: ""You stand ere an watch dis, okay?""

Finton nods his head cautiously, and watches as Seamus takes a long run up and hurls himself off the edge of the cliff, crashing twice along the long drop to his and the budgies' doom.
Finton shakes his head slowly, ""Oi'm never troyin' dat. Doesn't look very sef...""

He turns around to see a small Toyota pull up, and his mate Brendan steps out with another 'pepper bag': ""Y'alright Finton? Where's Seamus?""
""Bottom o de cliff."" Replied Finton.
""Eejit."" Chuckles Brendan. ""Alright, you'll wanna watch dis I tell ye!""

He then takes a parrot out of the bag, opens the boot of the car and takes out a high calibre handgun.
Parrot in hand, he hurls himself of the cliff, clutching onto the poor birds feet. About halfway down he blows the creature's head off, and plummets down to his own death.
""Wot were ye tinkin, Brendan!"" Mutters Finton, despairingly...

He turns around after hearing another car approaching. A battered old Renault pulls up alongside the other 2 vehicles. Out pops Fergle.
""How'reya Finton? Ye ready fer a show?""
""Ye don't haf te do dis. It in't sef. Seamus an Brendan are at de bottom o de cliff, an dey don't look too good..."" says Finton.
""Oi'm a trillseeker... it'll be fun!""

He carries on by pulling his 'pepper bag' out the car, and from there removed a large chicken. He placed the chicken between his thighs and flung himself off the edge, before Finton could say anything else. 
His body lands crumpled with the chicken's, near the two other men's.

""Jaysis!"" Says Finton, ""Oi told ye! Dese trillseekin sports ain't sef! First Seamus wit his budgie jumpin, then Brendan wit his parrotshooting! Now you wit yer feckin henglidin!""",Two Irish guys walk into a pet shop,135

As he walks into the parlor, he eyes a man behind the counter and tells him his troubles. The man says, ""Well, that's a pickle, but I'm Harold, the janitor. You want to speak with Helga, the Headmistress,"" pointing to the side.


He walks over to her and repeats the story. Money exchanges hands, and he's directed down the hall, first room on the left.


He's never actually been with a prostitute before, so some awkward conversation precludes intercourse. In the act, he manages to get a third of the way in before she starts yelping in pain. He pulls out, apologizes for the inconvenience, and goes back to the Headmistress.


She's a little taken aback, but still proposes a solution - second door, right side.


The man is a more than a little frustrated (and certainly a touch embarrassed), by this point, so no conversation occurs and he gets right into it. A third goes in. Then half. She yelps. He dismounts, and storms back to the Headmistress, not even bothering to put his clothes back on. He demands a refund.


She tells him that she has one last option for him - if it doesn't work, she will gladly refund every penny of his purchase. Last door on the left. He goes in, and the room is very dark. A woman lies on the bed, waiting for him. He mounts her - a third of the way, half-way, and all the way in. She offers no complaint. Gleefully he begins thrusting, when to his horror (and the dim light) he notices she appears to be foaming from the mouth. In a panic, he runs back to the Headmistress.


""That girl is foaming at the mouth! I think you need to call a doctor!""

I came home from work early today, and I saw my beautiful wife sleeping naked in bed with another man's clothes on the floor. So of course I started looking for the bastard who slept with my wife.""


""Like I said, I lived in an apartment. There weren't that many places to hide, but I couldn't find him anywhere! Just when I was about to go confront my wife, I see him. The bastard was hiding outside the window, holding onto the windowsill. I go up to him and started stomping on his hands over and over again, but he wouldn't let go. I finally kicked him in the face and he fell. Unfortunately, he landed on a bush and bounced to safety. In my anger, I grabbed my refrigerator and throw it out after him. However, the cord from the refrigerator wrapped around my leg and pulled me to my death.""


St. Peter nods and says, ""You're story is acceptable. Welcome to heaven."" He goes to the second man a brawny working-man type and says, ""What's your story?""


""I'm a window washer,"" says the man. ""I've been a window washer for over 20 years. Well today, I'm washing the windows of the 35th floor of this apartment building when my scaffolding breaks. I thought I was going to die, but I manage to catch myself on the windowsill of the story below. All of a sudden this maniac comes out and starts mashing my fingers. I try my best to hold on, but he kicks me in the face and I fall. Once again, I thought I was going to die, but I land on this hedge and bounce away no worse for the wear. I look up and BOOM. Dead. Last thing I saw was a refrigerator.""


St. Peter holds back a chuckle and lets him into heaven. He goes to the third man, a ridiculously handsome fellow with sandy-blonde hair, and asks, ""What's your story?""

They all live in a big fancy house together, and life is good. But each of Ahmed's four wives has a sister who despises Ahmed; Khadijah has a sister named Nur Sayyida, who used to be very close with Khadijah until she married Ahmed, and Nur resents Ahmed very much for this. Yasmin has a sister named Nur bint Khalid, who once wanted to marry Ahmed and still holds a grudge against her sister for marrying him instead. Niloufar has a sister named Nur Tehrani, a stern member of Iran's Revolutionary Guard who once arrested Ahmed for public intoxication during his wild undergrad years. Yes, Ahmed is clean now, but she's always just waiting for him to slip up. Jessica, of course, also has a sister named Nur Muhammad-Smith---all the in-laws are named Nur if you didn't gather that already---and she doesn't actually have any real problem with Ahmed. She just hates him because the other three in-laws hate him and she doesn't like feeling left out. Now, as fate would have it, all four of Ahmed's in-laws have time off for Eid Al-Fitr, and Ahmed's wives have planned this huuuuge end-of-Ramadan feast. Naturally, the four sisters are invited. So.... The table is set for nine people; Ahmed, Khadijah, Yasmin, Niloufar, Jessica, Nur, Nur, Nur, and Nur. Ahmed has braced himself for the avalanche of drama that is sure to fall on his house. But, oh no! Khadijah tells Ahmad with tears in her eyes that Nur Sayyida won't be able to make it to dinner, because she sprained her ankle during fencing practice. Yasmin, then, tells Ahmed, that Nur bint Khalid got held up at the border because of an anti-Trump post she made while visiting her home country of Iraq. Niloufar is very distraught to tell Ahmed that her sister, Nur Tehrani, has to stay in Tehran over the holidays on some Revolutionary Guard duties. Finally, Nur Muhammad-Smith decided not to come because she wanted to visit Nur Sayyida in the hospital. Nur Muhammad-Smith considers Nur Sayyida to be like a sister to her, despite having no blood relation and in fact, only having spoken to eachother for about thirty seconds at the marriage of Ahmed and Jessica. Ahmed looks up and down the table, at the four seats which will now be empty. He strokes his beard, and ponders these revelations for a long moment. Finally, he speaks, firmly and with authority.

-------------------------
Folks generally aren't very creative in choosing names for their dogs.
That's why there are so many named Rover and Spot.

But, have you heard the plight of the fellow who thought he'd be cute and named his dog Sex?
It goes like this:

""One day Sex and I took a walk and he ran away from me. I spent hours looking for that dog. A policeman came by and asked what I was doing in this alley at midnight? I told him I was looking for Sex.
My case comes up next Tuesday.""

""But, that ain't the worst part.... 
One day, I went to the town hall to get a dog license for Sex. 
The clerk asked me what I wanted. I told him I wanted a license for Sex. 
He said, 'I'd like to have one, too.'
Then, I said, 'You don't understand. She's a dog.'
He said he didn't care how she looked.
When I told him I'd had Sex since I was 5, he said, “You must have been an early bloomer.""

""When I decided to get married, I told the minister I wanted to have Sex at the wedding. He told me I'd have to wait until after the wedding. When I protested that Sex had played a big part in my life and that my whole life revolved around Sex, he said he didn't want to hear about my personal life.""
""After my wife and I were married, I took the dog with us on the honeymoon. When I checked into the hotel, I told the clerk I wanted a room for my wife and wanted one for Sex. 
She said. 'Every room in the hotel was for sex.' 
I said, 'You don't understand. Sex keeps me awake at night.' 
The clerk said, 'Me, too.'

""When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. When I told the Judge I had Sex before I was married, he grinned and said, “ Me. too.""

""Now that I've been thrown in jail, married, divorced and had more trouble with that dog than I ever imagined, I'm in counseling. My psychiatrist asked me what my problem was. I said 'Sex has died and left my life... . It's like losing a best friend and I'm so lonely,' I told him.
He said, “Look, you and I both know that sex isn't man's best friend. Get yourself a dog.""",Dog named 'Sex',5

The minister shakes his head. ""Are you kidding me? That's nothing. I've saved over three hundred people in the past year and a half!""

The rabbi simply laughs. ""You guys are pathetic! Attendance rates at our synagogue are at an all-time high, and we're getting converts every week!""

""Well, to decide who's better, we should hold a competition,"" says the priest.

""I agree,"" replies the minister. ""It shouldn't be easy, either.""

""I know!"" the rabbi exclaims. ""Whoever can convert a bear to their respective faith will be declared the winner!""

So, the three leave the bar, and a week passes before they meet up again. The priest and the minister both show up a few minutes early and order their drinks. They wait for fifteen minutes before finally, the rabbi stumbles into the bar, his arm in a cast and his face covered in claw marks.

Both guys ask the poor rabbi what happened, but he simply shakes his head. ""Nah, it's not important. I'll tell you later. How did you guys do with the bear?""

""Well,"" the priest proclaims proudly, ""I got the bear all signed up for RCIA, and he'll be baptized next Sunday!""

""And I already saved the bear!"" says the minister. ""At this moment, he's currently out in the wood, preaching to and converting all the little squirrels and deer!""

""So how did you do?"" the priest asks the rabbi.

Once again, the rabbi simply shakes his head. ""I *really* shouldn't have started with circumcision.""","A priest, a minister, and a rabbi are all drinking together at a bar.",11

He gave her a peck on the cheek and fell fast asleep.
When Brian awoke a few hours later he found a strange man was standing at the end of his bed wearing a long flowing white robe. “Who the hell are you?” demanded Brian, “and what are you doing in my bedroom?”

The mysterious Man answered, “This isn’t your bedroom, and I’m St Peter”.

Brian was stunned “You mean I’m dead!!! That can’t be, I have so much to live for, I haven’t said goodbye to my family… you’ve got to send me back straight away.”

St. Peter replied, “Yes you can be reincarnated, but there is a catch. We can only send you back as a dog or a hen.” Brian began to consider his options.

He was devastated, but knowing there was a farm not far from his house, he asked to be sent back as a hen.

A flash of light later he was covered in feathers and clucking around pecking the ground…

“This ain’t so bad,” he thought, until he felt this strange feeling welling up inside him.

The farmyard rooster strolled over and said, “so you’re the new hen, how are you enjoying your first day here?”

“It’s not so bad,” replied Brian, “but I have this strange feeling inside like I’m about to explode”.

“You’re ovulating,” explained the rooster, “don’t tell me you’ve never laid an egg before.”

“Never,” replied Brian

“Well just relax and let it happen.”

So Brian focussed on his breathe and relaxed, and after a few uncomfortable seconds an egg popped out from under his tail. An immense feeling of relief swept over him. His emotions even got the better of him as he experienced motherhood for the first time.

When he laid his second egg, the feeling of happiness was overwhelming and he knew that being reincarnated as a hen was the best thing that ever happened to him… ever!!!

The joy kept coming, and as he was just about to lay his third egg he felt an enormous smack on the back of his head and heard his wife shouting,

“Brian! Wake up you drunken bastard, you’re sh****ng the bed!”",Brian and the Hen,12

A man is driving along a road, and starts to hear a clunking noise coming from under the hood of his car. Luckily for him, an auto repair shop is just down the road. As he drives into the shop’s garage, he’s greeted by a waddling penguin. The man, who is absolutely confused as to why a penguin would be in a car shop, looks around for another person. There’s no one but the penguin, who has approached his driver’s side window. The man says to himself “I must be going crazy, this penguin can’t be a mechanic.” “But I am sir”, squawks the penguin, “professionally trained and certified”. The man is completely beside himself. After several awkward seconds the man manages to compose himself again and asks “I’m very grateful you’re a mechanic, but how does a penguin end up in this line of work?” The penguin cocks its head and squawks “I wanted to be a pilot, but penguins can’t fly”

Edit: I used the bus version in class, and it was well received.

A man boards a bus for his journey home. To his surprise, the driver is a penguin. Looking around, none of the other passengers seem bothered. “I must be going crazy, this driver can’t possibly be a penguin.” he mutters to himself “But I am, sir”, squawks the penguin, “professionally trained and certified”. After an awkward silence, the man regains his composure and asks “How does a penguin end up in this line of work?” It squawks in reply “I wanted to be a pilot, but penguins can’t fly.”",How is this story joke?

Often, the emperor would ask Jiddles to entertain him with a grand poem whenever he found himself in a sour mood.

Eventually, there came a day where the emperor was so taken with Jiddles' poems that he decided to try his hand at writing some poems himself. He secluded himself and spent an entire week on his poem, trying to write the best piece of literature ever read.

When he finally finished, he excitedly called Jiddles into his throne room. ""Jiddles, I believe I have written a poem truly worthy of song! Have a listen."" The emperor, with all the spirit and emotion he could muster, read his poem in a thundering voice throughout the throne room.

When he finished, he stood proudly and looked to Jiddles. ""Well my boy? What do you think? Was it a poem worthy of dubbing me Basileus?""

Jiddles looked at the emperor uncomforably and replied, ""Your Imperial Majesty, I'm afraid...it could use some work. It was rather weak.""

The emperor, unable to control his rage at all the hard work he put in, yelled for his guards. ""My Varangians! Seize this poet and throw him in the stables for speaking out against the emperor!""

With little effort, Jiddles was manhandled by the guards and hauled to the stables, where he was forced to sit in for two days.

Several months later, the emperor grew curious about poetry again. He, once more, decided to try his hand at writing a poem. This time, he locked himself away for two weeks, which grew quite concerning to his wife and court. Finally, however, he left his chambers, poem in hand, and demanded that Jiddles be brought before him in the throne room at once.

Jiddles entered warily. He approached the emperor and said, ""How may I help you, Your Imperial Majesty?""

""Jiddles, I'm prepared to tear you a poetic new one!"" The emperor excitedly exclaimed. ""This poem will be worthy of more than song. There will be tales written of me, the Poetic Emperor! Gilgamesh will wet himself from his grave. And, the greatest prize of all, my wife will say that I am finally ready to talk to my in-laws!""

Jiddles issued no reaction.

The emperor began reading his new ballad with a fervor he never knew he had. From the darkest recesses of his mind, he spoke like history's greatest general about to lead an army to war. The room shook with the power of the emperor's vocal chords.

At long last, he finished, completely out of breath. He looked to his servant. ""Well Jiddles? How did that one tickle your Basileus?""

With no words, Jiddles turned around and began walking out of the throne room.

""Jiddles? Where are you going?!"" the emperor demanded.

With a simple turn, he looked at the emperor and said, ""the stables!""",There once was an Emperor of the Byzantines who loved poetry.,1

He rushes to the hospital, runs in to the ER and says his wife's been in an accident. They tell him Dr. Smith is handling the case. They page the doctor. He comes out to the waiting room to see a terribly upset Mr. Jones.
""Mr. Jones?"" the doctor asks.
""Yes sir, what's happened? How is my wife?""
The doctor sits next to him and says, ""I have good news and I have bad news. First the bad news: Your wife's accident resulted in two fractures of her spine."" ""Oh my God"" says Mr. Jones. ""Will she ever recover?""


""Well, Mr. Jones, her vital signs are stable. However, her spine is inoperable. She'll have no motor skills or capability. This means you will have to feed her. Mr. Jones begins to sob. ""And you'll have to turn her in her bed every two hours to prevent pneumonia."" Mr. Jones begins to wail and cry loudly.


""Then, of course,"" the doctor continued, ""you'll have to diaper her as she'll have no control over her bladder and of course these diapers must be changed at least five times a day."" Mr. Jones begins to shake as he cries, sobs, wails. The doctor continues: ""And you'll have to clean up her feces on a regular basis as she'll have no control over her sphincter. Of course, you must clean her immediately to avoid bedsores.""


Now Mr. Jones is convulsing sobbing uncontrollably and beginning to withe off the bench into a sobbing pitiful mass.


Just then Dr. Smith reaches out his hand, pats Mr. Jones on the shoulder, and says ""I also have some good news""
""What could possibly be good about this!"" Wails Mr. Jones
Dr. Smith: ""I'm just fucking with you, she's dead.""",Mr. Jones gets a call from the hospital.,25

The next day the duck returns and quacks twice at the librarian who gives it two books, one under each wing. The third day, the duck quacks thrice and the librarian gives it three books, one under each wing and one in its beak. The duck waddles. By this time, the librarian is becoming very curious about what the duck is doing with her library’s stock so when the duck returns the next day and quacks four times, she gives it three books as before and follows carrying the fourth book. 
The bird waddles down the road and turns off into a wood. In a clearing there is a pond with all the library books strewn around the perimeter. On a lily pad in the middle of the pond sits a large bullfrog. The duck carefully sheds two of the tomes it is carrying and swims out with the third to the bullfrog who gives it a quick disdainful look.

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.
He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.


Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.
He made it out, but a single person died.


Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.
He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.
When the day of the execution came, he requested a single apple as his last meal.


After eating the apple, he was strapped into the electric chair.
The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.
The man was perfectly fine.


Well, at the time, there was an old Algerian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.
And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.
Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.


Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.
The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.
For his final meal, the man requested two apples.
After eating the apples, he was strapped into the electric chair.
The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.


Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.
And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.
To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.


And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.
On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three apples.
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid apples and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""
Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.
The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.
The executioner was speechless.
The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the apples had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""

best salespeople there one at a time, for one
month each. The idea being to aquaint them with
the people and customs of the region. 
Well, the first salesman spent a month there and
then it was another salesman's turn. The two of 
them meet at a remote train station as the first
is leaving and the second is on his way in. ""Man 
it was great"" says the first, ""the scenery is 
beautiful, the people are friendly and everything
is so cheap."" 

Then the first salesman cracks a devious smile...
""and I've got a special surprise for you. Go into
any resturaunt and order the extra special
egg-roll, hold the hotsauce. Got that?"" ""Extra
special egg-roll hold the hotsauce "" the second
salesman replies. ""Right"" says the first ""you're
going to love it!"" And with that the two part
company. 

Well the first night there the new salesman
remembers the advice, goes to a resturaunt
and orders the extra special egg-roll, hold the
hotsauce. ""Extra special egg-roll hold the 
hotsauce, one dollar"" Says the waiter. The man
gives the waiter a dollar. 

""You now in strange exotic land ..."" says
the waiter, ""where many words have special and
hidden meanings"" and he points to curtain leading
to a hidden room. The salesman walks through the
curtain and behind it is the most beautful, dark
haired oriental girl he has ever seen. She is
totally naked and the salesman has a hard-on
inside of five seconds. Without saying a word
she drops to her knees, undoes his pants and
gives him the most incredible blowjob of his 
entire life. 

The salesman cannot beleive his good fortune. 
After all he has many, many dollars and a whole 
month to spend them. Each night he goes from 
resturaunt to resturaunt and it's always the same.
Extra special egg-roll hold the hotsauce, you are
now in strange exotic land where many words have
special and hidden meanings, incredible naked 
girl, unbeleivable blowjob. 

On his last day there, on the way to the train 
station he figures he just has to do it one more
time. This time, however, he's running late and a
big hurry. ""Give me the extra special egg-roll"",
in his haste he neglects to say hold the hotsauce
""here's the dollar."" ""You now in strange exotic
land ..."" the salesman interupts ""yeah, yeah, yeah
where many words have special and hidden meanings,
blah, blah, blah."" And off he goes to the back 
room. 

He can't beleive his good fortune, this girl is
even more ravishing than any of the others. 
""What a way to go out"" he thinks as he hurridly
un-buckles his pants. She's on him in a second,
it's feeling fantastic, until ... 

She chomps down with all her might on his pecker.
""OH MY GOD ..."" he screams in agony ""why the hell
did you BITE me?"" He lays writhing on the floor 
in pain, blood gushing from his nearly severed 
member. 

""You now in strange exotic land ..."" says the 
girl, wiping the blood from her mouth, ""where 
many words have special and hidden meanings.""
She smiles a wry little smile. ""You forget to say
hold the hotsauce ..."" 

""Extra special egg-roll WITH hotsauce have little
bite to it.""

Everyone met to decide how they could remember the little dog. The decision was to cut off his tail and stick it up behind the bar to remind everyone of the little dog's wagging tail. The little dog went up to heaven and was about to run through the pearly gates when he was stopped by Saint Peter, who questioned the little dog as to where he was going. The little dog said, ""I have been a good dog - so I am going into heaven where I belong!"". Saint Peter replied, ""Heaven is a place of perfection, you can not come into heaven without a tail, where is your tail?"" The little dog explained what had happened back on earth. St Peter told the little dog to go back down to earth and retrieve his tail. The little dog protested that it was now the middle of the night on earth, but St Peter would not change his mind. So the little dog went back down to earth and scratched on the door of the pub until the bartender who lived upstairs came down and opened the door. ""My goodness, it is the spirit of the little dog. What can I do for you?"", asked the bartender. The little dog explained that he wasn't allowed into heaven without his tail, and he needed it back. The bartender replied, ""I would really like to help you, but my liquor license doesn't allow me to retail spirits after hours!"" ","In a small country pub,",7

It started as a single alarm fire but quickly grew to a 3 alarm blaze. The owner of the warehouse arrived on scene and quickly realized that the fire department wasn't going to be able to save the building. His biggest concern was the secret formula stored in his office. 

He approached the chief and said ""Sir, I don't care about the building but you have to save my secret formula! If you do, I will give you $500,000.""

The chief thought about all the fire engines that $500,000 could buy and decided to send a crew to get the formula. The crew made it half way there before they had to turn back due to the conditions.

By this time, the blaze had reached 4 alarms and the owner upped his offer to 1 million dollars. The chief decided to take a different approach and send a crew around the back side but again, conditions were too bad and they had to back out. 

While all of this was going on, no one noticed the lone, old, volunteer engine company coming in from the neighboring town. Much to everyone's amazement, the old engine with its crew drove right past all of the new and state of the art fire apparatus, into the blaze, and out of the other side of the building with a filing cabinet stuck to the front bumper. The warehouse owner saw that it was the cabinet that contained his secret formula and decided that such an act of heroism and bravery deserved the reward to be doubled again to 2 million dollars. 

Upon telling the chief of the old engine company that they were getting such a large sum of money, the owner couldn't help but ask, ""What are you going to do with 2 million dollars?""

The old chief's response was, ""Well first we are going to fix the damn brakes...""",Warehouse fire (long),39

There was only one little thing bothering me - it was her beautiful younger sister.


My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight miniskirts, and generally was bra-less. She would regularly bend down when she was near me, and I always got more than a nice view. It had to be deliberate. Because she never did it when she was near anyone else.


One day her “little” sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn’t overcome. She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. Well, I was in total shock, and couldn’t say a word.


She said, “I’m going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.”


I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door.


I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car. Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!


With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and said, “We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn’t ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.”


And the moral of this story is:
Always keep your condoms in your car.",I was a very happy man.,11

So amused were the Gods that not even their omnipotence could have foretold the ironic way in which the white flash of light transmogrified the brown skinned serf. An idea became present to them in that moment; they took the ingredients to a devout taco shop owner and proclaimed,  

""Hola ese, tengo algo de premo. Hacer algo delicioso para la cena. Te veré más tarde, mang!""
