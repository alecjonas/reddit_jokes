For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires.
The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a noosed rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.
The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",Once upon a time there were three kingdoms...,17

Everything checks out, and the bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. An employee drives the Rolls Royce into the bank's underground garage and parks it there.
Two weeks later, the woman returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer approaches her and says:
""We are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we're a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked out your accounts and found that you were a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is why would you bother to borrow $5,000?""

The king and the queen went fishing. On the way he met a man with a fishing pole riding on a donkey, and he asked the man if the fish were biting.
 
The fisherman said, ""Your Majesty, you should return to the palace! In just a short time I expect a huge rain storm.""

The king replied: ""The palace meteorologist assured me there would be no rain. I hold him in high regard. He is an educated and experienced professional. I trust him.""
 
So the king continued on his way. However in a short time a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King and Queen were totally soaked. 
 
Furious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to fire the meteorologist. Then he summoned the fisherman and offered him the prestigious position of royal forecaster. 
 
The fisherman said, ""Your Majesty, I do not know anything about forecasting.  I obtain my information from my donkey.  If I see my donkey's ears drooping, it means with certainty that...it will rain.""
 
So the king hired the donkey.
 
And thus began the practice of hiring dumb asses to work in influential positions of government.

The practice is unbroken to this date.

""You know, I'm tired of going through life without an education. Tomorrow, I'm going to go to the community college and sign up for some classes!""
Jim Bob thinks its a good idea and the two leave.

The next day, Bubba goes down to the college and meets the Dean of Admissions, who signs him up for four basic classes: Maths, English, Science, and Logic.

""Logic?"" Says Bubba, ""What's that?""

The Dean says ""I'll show you. Do you own a weedeater?""

""Yeah"" Bubba replies

""Because you own a weedeater, I'd logically think that you have a yard.""

""Correct again!""

""And because you have a yard, I'd think that you have a house.""

""Thats right, I do have a house.""

""And because you have a house, you probably have a family.""

""Yes, thats right.""

""And because you have a family, you probably have a wife.""

""Yes.""

""And because you have a wife, logic tells me that you are probably a heterosexual.""

""Wow! It's amazing that you found out all of that just because I have a weedeater!"" 

Excited to take the class, Bubba returns to the bar, where Jim Bob is drinking.
He tells him that he was signed up to four classes: Maths, English, Science, and Logic.

""Logic?"" Says Jim Bob, ""Whats that?""

""I'll show you."" Replies Bubba, ""Do you own a weedeater?""

""No."" Jim Bob answers.

""Well then you're fucking gay.""

First was the guitarist, he pulled out his electric guitar and specially designed amp. And began to strum the guitar playing the most melodic sounds the others had ever heard, his music was so loud that the entire state of New York heard him play, and any building with windows of a one mile radius were shattered.

Next was the Horn player, he developed an instrument that combined the trumpet, saxophone, and trombone; all into one instrument that had it's own electric amp built in. The Horn player just went at it, creating a giant wave of funky grooves and rhythms. His music was so loud that reports were in that citizens of Florida could just barely hear his funky rhythms. Every window in New York that wasn't already shattered, well they were shattered now, same went for New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania.

Finally there was the flute player. He just had a flute, no speaker, no special modifications, just a flute. He played ""Mary Had A Little Lamb"". 

After he finished, the first musician turned to second.

Saint Peter was puzzled, but he complied. Saint Peter went down to the Pearly Gates, and when the first person arrived, Saint Peter explained the rules. The man sighed, and begun his explanation.

""You see, Saint Peter, I was a man who lived to support my family. I was a hard worker, and every day I got home tired. And today, I arrived home at my high-rise apartment, and I saw my wife covering her naked body on the bed. And I thought to myself 'how could she do this? I live to support her, so how could she dare cheat on me?' I was furious, and I nearly tore my apartment down looking for whoever she was cheating with. Finally I found him, he was hanging off the edge of our balcony. I started stepping on his fingers, I was so angry. He let go eventually, and he fell down 6 stories to the ground below, but somehow he didn't die! I hardly had any control of myself however, and I was so mad that I just grabbed my refrigerator and threw it off the balcony. But my adrenaline was too high, Saint Peter, and I had a heart attack and died.""

Saint Peter decided that this story was more than interesting enough, so he let the man pass into heaven. Saint Peter then explained the rules to the next man, and the man told his story.

""You see Saint Peter, I'm a man of fitness, and I really care about my physique. So I was running on my treadmill, up in my 7th floor apartment, and, I don't know, something happened to my treadmill and it started getting faster and faster, and before I was able to pull the emergency stop, I was shot out of my apartment. By some miracle I managed to grab onto the balcony, and then some asshole comes and starts STOMPING on my fingers! Would you believe me Saint Peter?  I was forced to let go of the balcony, but somehow I managed to survive the fall, and then a fucking FRIDGE falls on me!""

Saint Peter was shocked at the coincidence, and let the man pass into heaven. A third man came, and Saint Peter explained to him the rules. The man smiled, and said ""Are you ready for this Saint Peter? Ok, so I'm naked, and I'm hiding in a fridge...""",The New Rule for Entry to Heaven,148

The next morning, one member of each household awoke early to check their yards. But no deer were found. The next morning was the same. Villagers awoke, but there were no deer.

Over the next couple of weeks most of the villagers stopped waking up early. It continued like this, until one day when only one man, Jin, awoke early. As he stepped out into the early sun, he saw in his yard a dead buck. Frightened, Jin lifted it onto a wagon, pulled it across the street, and left it in his neighbors yard.

The village awoke to the cries of the emperors guard. As they rushed out of their homes, they saw the dead deer and knew what it meant. Another villager would be killed.

As the eldest man was dragged from his home, Jin held back a smile. With one action, he had not only saved his own life, but began the time honored tradition of passing the buck.",There is a story passed down in China about an emperor from the Ming Dynasty.,14

He eventually decides to go and see a Doctor.
 
The Doctor said, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches.
The bad news is that it will require castration.
You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.    

The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.' 

Joe was shocked and depressed.He wondered if he had anything to live for. 

He had no choice but to go under the knife. The surgery cost him $15,000.

When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.   

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. 

He saw a Men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new Suit.' 

He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new Suit.' 

The elderly Tailor eyed him briefly and said, 'Let's see... size 44 long.

Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?' 

'Been in the business 60 years!' the tailor said. 

Joe tried on the suit it fitted perfectly. 

As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, 'How about a new shirt?'

PHOTOCOPIERS : These are female, because once turned off....it takes a while to warm them up again.

They are an effective reproductive device if the right buttons are pushed...but can also wreak havoc if you push the wrong Buttons.


TIRES : Tires are male, because they go bald easily and are often over inflated


HOT AIR BALLOONS : Also a male object... Because to get them to go anywhere.....you have to light a fire under their ass.


SPONGES : These are female...because they are soft......squeezable and retain water.


WEB PAGES : Female...because they're constantly being looked at and frequently getting hit on.


TRAINS : Definitely male... Because they always use the same old lines for picking up people..


EGG TIMERS : Egg timers are female because....over time...all the weight shifts to the bottom.


HAMMERS : Male..... Because in the last 5000 years.....they've hardly changed at all...and are occasionally handy to have around.


THE REMOTE CONTROL : Female. Ha! You probably thought it would be male....but consider this: It easily gives a man pleasure, he'd be lost without it...and while he doesn't always know which buttons to push...he just keeps trying... ",Is it Male or Female?,38

While crossing a narrow bridge, they hit each other head on, mangling both cars. 

The yankee fan manages to climb out of his car and survey the damage. He looks at his twisted car and says ""man I'm lucky to be alive!"" 

Likewise the Red Sox fan gets out of his car uninjured, he too feeling fortunate enough to survive 

The Red Sox fan walks over to the yankee fan and says ""hey man I think this is a sign that we should put away our petty differences and live as friends instead of being rivals"" 

The yankee fan thinks for a moment and says ""ya know, you're absolutely right! We should be friends! In fact, I'm going to see if something else survived the wreck""

The yankee fan then pops open the trunk and removes a full and undamaged bottle of jack Daniels. He says to the Red Sox fan ""I think this is another sign we should toast to our newfound friendship"". The Red Sox fan agrees and grabs the bottle. After sucking down half of the bottle, he hands it back to the yankee fan and says ""your turn!""

The yankee fan calmly twists the cap back on the bottle, throws the rest of the bottle over the bridge into the river, and says ""nah, I think I'll just wait for the cops to show up"". ",One foggy night,41

A cowboy was taken prisoner by a bunch of angry Indians. They were all prepared to kill him but their Chief declared that since they were celebrating the Great Spirit, they would grant the cowboy three wishes before he killing him. 

The Chief comes up to him and asks:
- What do you want for your first wish?
- I want talk to my horse, - replies the cowboy.

The Chief allows him to talk to the horse. The cowboy whispers in its ear. The horse neighs, rears back, and takes off at full speed. About an hour later, the horse comes back with a naked lady on its back. Well, the Indians are very impressed, so they let the cowboy use one of their teepees. A little while later, the cowboy stumbles out of the teepee, tucking in his shirt. 

The Chief asks him once again:
- What do you want for your second wish?
- I want to talk to my horse, - once again replies the cowboy.

Again, the cowboy whispers in the horse’s ear. The horse neighs, rears back, and takes off at full speed. About an hour later, the horse comes back with another naked lady on its back. Well, the Indians are very impressed indeed. So, once again, they let the cowboy use one of their teepees. The cowboy stumbles out a little while later. 

The chief comes up to the cowboy and asks: 
- So, what do you want for your last third wish?
- I want to talk to my horse, - for the third time replies the cowboy.

&amp;nbsp;

Sean Bean is walking down the street, enjoying his Sunday night. Suddenly, a black paneled van pulls up next to him. Four massive dudes in ski masks wearing all black leap out and try to grab him. Sean remembers his GoT training and manages to take one of them out, but the other three quickly overpower him. He feels a prick in his neck. The world goes dark.

He awakens in a room reminiscent of Saw. Harsh fluorescent lighting illuminates cold, sterile subway tile. The center of the floor holds a filthy, possibly clogged drain, contrasting with the rest of the room. His arms are held by chains that disappear into the ceiling, and his seated form is further constrained by a metal bar across his waist. The bar runs through a pair of loops and is secured by a pair of padlocks. It's clear he's not going anywhere.

It's at this time the knockout drugs relent a little more. He realizes he's not alone in the room. In an identical situation, on the other side of the room, sits the one and only Barbara Bush, former First Lady of the United States. She looks worse for wear, but a sad smile crosses her face when she sees Sean come around.

""Yes, you're not the only one they've grabbed. No, I have no idea who they are. No, I have no idea where we are. And no, I very much doubt help is coming. They took out my Secret Service agents instantly. They knew exactly what they were doing."" She hangs her head. ""Poor Robert. He watched me for twenty years. His family...""

""What do they want?"" Bean breaks in, if only to refocus the First Lady from her sorrow.

""I don't know that either. I just heard a snippet that they serve customers with very exclusive tastes, whatever that means.""

They lapsed into silence for several minutes.

The door burst open. An impressively tall man, dressed all in black, stepped through. His face was hidden in darkness within a cowl. He spoke with an impossibly deep voice. ""Glad to see both of you have survived our hospitality. We wouldn't want our clients to be disappointed.""

""What do you want with us?"" Sean demanded.

""Oh, we have something very special to offer. Our clients have tasted all the delicacies of the world. Every exotic dish, they have sampled and grown bored with. It is our job to discover new, more exciting ways to tickle their palates.""

""They're going to eat us?"" Barbara exclaimed, horrified.

The giant laughed. ""Oh, nothing so passe my dear. We merely prepare our proteins in...unique ways."" He waved behind him, and a crew hustled in. Barbara struggled, but they easily injected her restrained form, and she slumped, unconscious. Sean received similar treatment, and the world went black again.

He awoke on a stage with excruciating, burning pain in his abdomen. The glaring white lights didn't prevent him from seeing the former First Lady was to his left, also on the stage. Her abdomen was similarly distended. He felt rather than saw hundreds of eyes on him, out in the dark theater. Finally, he realized someone was speaking at a podium to his right. It was the giant.

""...and you know how this works. Our bidding on the First Lady begins at $500,000.""
It quickly rose past $600,000, eventually settling on an even million dollars. When the gavel came down, a chef sliced open the distended stomach of the woman and extracted a perfectly cooked Cornish game hen. With a flourish, he served it to the winning bidder. 

A surgeon quickly sewed her up and wheeled her off the stage. 

Sean now knew it was his turn. The bidding began in earnest, and he was surprised when it raced past a million. Then $1.5 million, then $1.75 million, before finally settling on $2 million. Despite all the torture, despite his horrifying situation, a tiny piece of his actor's ego was pleased. The chef again approached with his razor-sharp knife. He sliced open the actor and pulled out one perfectly cooked Cornish game hen. 

Before the pain and blood loss could make him pass out again, he had to ask. He could not stop the question from passing his lips. 

""Auctioneer! Why? Why $2 million for me and $1 million for her?""

""Sean, don't you know? A bird in the Hand is worth two in the Bush.""

The man rushes upstairs and finds the bathroom. There's a small room on the left with a worn out, old toilet. He rushes to the door, but it's locked!

Unable to take it anymore, the man runs over to the corner where he sees a bucket, near to which is a large hole in the floor, and relieves himself there.

He's on the bucket for a solid thirty minutes. As he gets up, he dumps the bucket into the hole to cover his tracks.

Satisfied, he makes his way downstairs to discover, to his shock, that everyone is fleeing the bar, chunks of smelly brown stuff had been flung everywhere. The bartender has taken cover behind a counter.

-The client: is room 39 empty?


-The boss: yes, sir.


-The client: can I book it?


-The boss: of course you can.


-The client: thank you.

Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.

The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.

The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.

Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.

In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.

He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.

The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.

The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.

The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.

This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.

Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.

The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.

The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up. 

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.

The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.

In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.

-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''


-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.


-''Swear''


-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''


So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss. 

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.

When he does, I will let you know... thank you for reading.",A handsome man went into a hotel...,0

post,6p0uv5,2qh72,jokes,false,1500809688,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6p0uv5/mordreds_hidden_power/,self.jokes,,"King Arthur has lately been very fond of Morgause. News has it that she bore him a son which was named Mordred, not thinking about the repercussions it might bring to his kingdom. On the other hand, the G brothers (Morgause's sons to her husband Lot) weren't very fond of their mother's incest-begotten son. 

Yeaes have passed, the brothers wanted to get rid of Mordred. However, it was very unhonorable for a knight to kill a boy who can't defend himself. The brothers then waited for Mordred to become a knight himself. When he became a full-fledged knight in service of King Arthur, the brothers came up with a plan. 

One of them is to challenge Mordred to a duel, and would dismiss his death as an accident while sparring. The brothers agreed that this is a foolproof plan, as Mordred seemed weaker than any of them, but boy were they in for a surprise. 

It was Gaheris who challenged him. After exchanging a couple of blows, it seemed like Mordred changed his weapon and armor in the blink of an eye, countering his arsenal. With this new weapon and armor, Gaheris knew that he can't possibly defeat Mordred now. 

Aggravayne challenged him next, and the same thing happened during their battle. Mordred's armor and weapon changed in the middle of the battle, and his greatsword became useless. As he fell on his knees, he came up with a better plan. He warned his brothers about this power, and that they should challenge him 2 on 1.

No longer wanting to further taint their family's honor, Gawain and Gareth challenged Mordred 2 on 1 to get rid of him for good. They expected him turn down this challenge, but he obliged. They thought that they have the upper hand as there are two of them, but they underestimated Mordred's power. In less than a second, his armor hardened that not even a diamond can scratch it. Their swords broke as they clashed with Mordred's. Hopeless, the 2 of them surrendered and asked Mordred about his ability. 

Mordred, with the most impish grin he can muster, simply told them:

""Does it ever drive you crazy just how fast the knight changes?""",Mordred's hidden power,0

Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled.

So naturally, many people wanted to work for them.

However, to maintain their standards, they were very strict in recruiting soldiers. You had to be extremely fit. Now, in a country that was being invaded by General Choo, there lived a group of beggars. They were close friends and none of them wanted to die. Among them was a boy named Johnny, who was born with an unusually large arse. Since they had no other choice, they decided to enroll themselves in Choo's army, so they went to one of the barracks.

There, they were rigorously tested, pushing them to their limits. While most of the group was able to get through the training and join the R's, Johnny was not able to. You see, if you have a big arse, and you are trying crawl towards the enemy, you would be spotted more easily. So Johnny was given the job of a slave, take care of the officers and do what he was told. He decided to speak to the Asian sergeant to try and talk his way into a better position.

He asked the sergeant why he was rejected. The sergeant replied, ""You cannot. You have arse. You have *big* arse.""  Johnny replied, ""Well why can't I be a radio operator or something. Anything other than this job of a servant"" The sergeant ordered the guards to execute Johnny for treason. Johnny was shocked. ""Why cant I just be one of the R's!!!"" He screamed. The sergeant replied, ""Because, *big arse can't be Choo's R's.*""",There was once a defected army general named Choo who was hellbent on taking over the world,5

Turns out, they had a lot in common, such as they both have birthdays in April, and they love trying new things. Those two similarities, mixed with many other happy comparisons, led to Lucy and Sid falling in love.

One day, Sid proposed to Lucy, with a beautiful ring adorned with two diamonds, both of their birthstones. She was so happy, she went to celebrate with her friends. Lucy's friends were the partygoing type. ""Oh girl,"" they would say, ""We're gonna get you higher than the sky.""

Those were the last words she remembered, and the last thing said to her while she was sober. You see, Lucy died that night from falling off a building, due to drug-induced hallucinations.

Sid, heartbroken, attended her funeral with tears in his eyes. Wanting to preserve his love with Lucy, now in heaven, he tied her engagement ring to a balloon, and let it soar to the clouds.

The boss thought to himself - I'm not hiring that lazy Cajun, so he decided to set a test for Boudreaux hoping he wouldn't be able to answer the questions and he'd be able to refuse him the job without getting into an argument.

The first question was, ""Without using numbers, represent the number 9.""

Boudreaux says, ""Dat's easy"" and proceeds to draw three trees.

The boss says, ""What in the world is that?""

Boudreaux says, ""Tree 'n tree 'n tree makes nine.""

""Fair enough"" says the boss. ""Second questions, same rules, but represent 99"".

Boudreaux stares into space for a while, then makes a smudge on each tree.

""Der ya go sir,"" he says.

The boss scratches his head and asks, ""How on earth do you get that to represent 99?""

Boudreaux answers, ""Each tree is dirty now, so it's dirty tree 'n dirty tree 'n dirty tree - dat 99.""

The boss is getting worried he's going to have to hire

 Boudreaux so he says, ""All right, question number 3.

 Same rules again, but this time represent the number 100.""

Boudreaux stares into space again, then he shouts, ""I got it!""

He makes a little mark at the base of each tree and says, ""Der ya go sir - 100.""

The boss looks at Boudreaux's attempt and thinks, ""Ha! got him this time."" He then tells Boudreaux, ""Go on, Boudreaux, you must be crazy if you think that represents a 100.""

Boudreaux leans forward and points to the little marks at the tree bases and says, ""A little dog comes along and craps by each tree, so now ya got dirty tree an' a turd, dirty tree an' a turd, and dirty tree an' a turd, which makes 100. When do I start my job?""",Job Applicant,2

Now, Rick loved to ride his motorcycle, but was tired of driving up and down the same roads, day after day.

One morning, he woke up, and decided to travel the world. So he saved up some money, got on a plane, along with his trusty Harley, and set out to explore the globe.

For the next few weeks, Rick spent his days riding to and through some of the most popular European cities like Paris, London, and Rome.

After seeing all Europe had to offer, he moved on to explore the rest of the world. Over the next few months, he rode through the African savannas, the deserts of Egypt, and even made it to the top of Mount Everest.

He was having the time of his life until he reached a small town in China. Unexpectedly, and out of nowhere, a beautiful Chinese maiden crossed his path, causing him to fly off and crash his motorcycle. Apologizing, the maiden offered Rick to pay for the repairs and a place to stay while they fixed his bike. ""My name is Yu! It's an honor to meet you!"" the beautiful maiden introduced herself to Rick.

It turned out she was the daughter of a rich magistrate, so he spent the night in a small palace in the center of town. However, due to the scarcity of motorcycle parts, Rick had to spend several days in the palace, in the presence of Yu. Over the next few days, she took a liking to him and his strange American ways. As expected, Rick took a liking to her, too.

The two quickly became inseparable, but Yu's father did not approve, for Rick was an outsider. By the time the motorcycle was finally up and running, Rick had fallen madly in love with Yu and refused to leave. Yu begged her father to let him stay, but instead, the Magistrate had Rick banished from the town. He warned him if he ever came back, he would have him beheaded.

Rick was devastated, he had no motivation to continue on the rest of his journey. It seemed as though there was nothing left for him in the world, if he didn't have his beloved Chinese maiden.
So he did the only thing any other sane guy would do....

Rick rolled back into town screaming,

Within moments the old man began having trouble breathing and was gasping for air. It was clear he would not live much longer.

The lawyer was going nuts not knowing why this man would want a law degree and pay so much for it when he knew the end was near.

He always excelled in his studies, and so naturally when it came time to apply to colleges, he had his pick of the top ones in the nation. 

Being able to go anywhere, Timothy chose to go to Harvard. He was accepted into their prelaw department as a social science major. However, Harvard was much more difficult than high school and Timothy was overconfident. It didn't take long before Timothy had flunked out due to laziness. 

Downtrodden, Timothy began walking the streets around the college late at night, wondering what to do. He had spent so much money on just that first semester, and now he had no life plans. However, as he turned a corner and walked past an alley, he saw a mysterious door standing in the middle of the alleyway. It stood up on its own, and had a faint glow about it. 

Curious, Timothy walked up to it, turned the handle, and opened it. To his amazement, there appeared to be a long hallway on the other side of the door! Timothy walked in, shutting the door behind him. He walked down the hallway and found three doors on the opposite end. Timothy chose the door on the left and opened it.

Inside this room were rows and rows of lit candles, and more importantly, a massive pile of cash at the opposite end of the room. Timothy was apprehensive at first, but he decided to himself ""I need the money, and what's the worst that could happen?""  So Timothy walked over and began filling his pockets with the hundred dollar bills laying around. 

No sooner had he taken the first bill when candles began falling over, causing the floor to catch fire. Timothy quickly began stuffing as much money as he could into his pockets, his shirt, his pants, even his mouth. The fire quickly grew and Timothy had to sprint for the door. He barely made it out and slammed the door behind him. The fire somehow appeared to be contained by this, so Timothy left with his fortune. 

As Timothy left the magical door back into the alleyway, he spotted none other than his best friend and one semester roommate, Mark. They hadn't known each other for long, but there was a certain special chemistry that let them become such strong friends. 

""Tim?!"", yelled Mark. ""What happened to you?! You're loaded with cash but your eyebrows are singed and you look like you've got some first degree burns! And what's with that door?""

""Hey Mark!"" replied Timothy. ""You may not believe me, but this door takes you to a long hallway with three rooms. There's a lot of money in there free for the taking. Just be careful!""

Mark trusted his friend Timothy, so as Timothy walked away, Mark entered the door. He walked all the way down the hallway until he came upon the three doors. Being an avid marching band member, Mark started with his left foot and thus first came to the left door. He saw an orange glow and felt the handle was hot. 

""Hmm,"" thought Mark, ""this must be how Tim got burned. I better try another door."" 

Mark proceeded to the middle door. Upon entering, he found himself in a long hallway with an aquarium in the ceiling. At the end of the hallway was an open treasure chest filled with diamonds, emeralds, and rubies. Mark excitedly ran over and took out a diamond. 

As soon as he did this, he heard a crack in the aquarium ceiling and saw one appear. He thought nothing of it though and took another jewel. This caused another crack to appear. Now scared, Mark hurriedly grabbed as many jewels as he could. This caused the aquarium to begin to shatter. Mark sprinted out as water and fish fell from the ceiling, and he barely made it out and shut the door behind him before the room completely flooded. 

With his pockets filled with valuable jewels, Mark left the hallway and went back into the alley. No sooner had he entered the alleyway than he saw his crush, Marlene. Marlene was a one of a kind beauty. Long, flowing, raven hair with piercing green eyes and a smile that sent chills down your spine. 

""What are you doing here?"" sputtered Mark. 

Marlene replied ""I like to take walks late at night sometimes. The better question is what are you doing here Mark? And why are you soaking wet?"" 

Mark pulled out a diamond and explained to her the nature of the magic doorway. Marlene was intrigued to say the least, so she decided to enter. 

She walked down the hallway and saw the three doors. She noticed the first door was glowing and felt heat coming from it, so she decided against it. She saw water leaking out from the middle door, and realizing it was likely the reason Mark was wet, also decided against it. Thus, she chose the rightmost door. 

Upon entering, she found that she was in a dimly lit room filled with tombstones marked with many names. However, there also was a large sack of gold and platinum bars sitting at the end of the room. Nervously, Marlene walked up and picked up the bag. As soon as she did however, a tombstone sprouted from the ground in front of her, with her name on it! 

The floor began to fall away in front of her, prompting her to sprint away with the sack slung over her shoulder. She nearly slipped and fell into the rapidly growing abyss beneath her, but she narrowly escaped and slammed the door shut behind her. 

10 years later, each of those three people were in their separate homes. Timothy was in an enormous mansion secluded away in a mountain, when one day his house mysteriously caught fire, killing Timothy. 

Mark had a beachside mansion in a gated community. He had long since moved on from Marlene and was happily married and had two adorable children. Sadly, one day there was a tsunami that reached his home. Strangely, nobody was killed in that tsunami other than Mark. 

This left Marlene as the last living person who had taken from that home. She had a penthouse suite with multiple stories and her own personal butler and chef. Life was good, to say the least. One day, she heard a booming knock on her door. A knock that was inhumanly loud and strong. She got out of her bed and walked downstairs to check. As she approached the door, a second knock occurred, so strong that the door fell down entirely. On the other side was a floating casket. 

The casket began floating towards Marlene. Terrified, she began trying to run away. Not thinking, she ran up to her room and locked the door to her bedroom. The casket simply knocked down that door too, trapping her. Desperate, she started throwing things at it. Pillows, books, her cell phone, anything she could get her hands on. 

Finally she opened her nightstand drawer and threw its contents at the casket. Magically, this caused the casket to disappear! Marlene, shaken, called the police. 

They promptly arrived and saw the devastation in her apartment. They asked her what happened, and she explained that a floating magic casket had attacked her, then disappear d when she threw her nightstand drawer at it. 

One cop mocked her for even suggesting such an occurrence was possible, but the second motioned for the first to be quiet. 

""Ma'am,"" he said, ""you were lucky. This nightstand had NyQuil in it, and NyQuil makes the coffin go away.""",The dangers of easy money [long],88

One day, unbeknownst to his wife, he put the cat in his car and took it to the end of the block and let it go.  When he got home he saw that the cat had beat him home.  

Undeterred, he put the cat in the car and took it a few miles across the city and tossed it out the car again.  Upon returning home, he was astonished to see that the cat had beat him home again.

Determined at this point, the man took the cat and drove him across the city, over the river, through the woods, and clear across three counties before putting the cat outside and driving off. 

Several hours later the man's wife was at home when the phone rang.  She picked up and it was her husband.

""Is the cat there?""  He asked.

""Yes..."" she replied.

It was an Asian family with twins in the grade above me named Ving and Ling. Over the years we had gotten close and began to hang out more and more.

Eventually, I learned that Ving was unhappy and the source was his name. It was a name that was common in his family, passed down from generation to generation. But in America, it certainly stood out. However, his dad was a traditionalist and never budged on the matter, stating Ving was his name and would always be. With his eighteenth birthday fast approaching, he confided in me that he was going to take action; he was going to change his name.

For weeks he planned with his sister, trying to figure out what the perfect name would be until he finally was happy. The name he decided on was Lee, after the great Bruce Lee. It would still reference his Asian heritage, while also fitting in more with American culture.

The end of senior year approached for him and his birthday came. He and his sister invited me to go to the courthouse to watch as his documents were filled out for the name change. Being interested in the process, I decided to come along. We arrive and the secretary informs him of the process- he must fill out the form and pay a $50 bill to process all the document changes. With the official paper in front of him, he had Ling hold the payment so he could put his new signature down, Lee.

A minute passed and he still didn't sign. ""I... I can't do it! My dad will be furious with me, it's a slap in the face to the family!"" Suddenly, the door burst open. It was his dad. Dread was evident on the faces of the twins and I worried what punishment they would suffer.

But instead, the dad called out:
Don't stop! Be Lee, Ving! Hold on to that fee, Ling.",The Twins Next Door.,3

They are both very successful, very competitive builders.  Every time they'd see each other outside, an argument about who was better ensued.  The wives grew sick and tired of it, so one evening early in the week when it started up yet again during a big family meal, their wives told them to shut up because they had a solution.  On Saturday morning at 9 A.M., they were to meet up and have the exact same tools, exact same building materials and were to build the exact same houses.  Whoever finished first would be declared the winner and they were never allowed to argue about it again.  The brothers agreed to it.

Saturday morning at 8:59 they're standing there very anxious to get started, then the clock hits 9 and they're both building away.  The race is incredibly even, nail for nail, hammer swing for hammer swing, and finally, brick for brick.  One of the brothers realizes he's messed up somewhere along the way and is going to end up with an extra brick.  Upon noticing, he looks over to see his brother's progress and sees that he's fixing to lay his last one.  The brother with the extra brick couldn't bear the thought of losing, so he throws his brick up in the air and said he was done.

-------------------

A young mother boarded an airplane with her infant baby girl.  The stewardess told her how adorable her baby was, followed by the rest of the passengers as they boarded.  That went on until the last passenger boarded late with his prized hunting dog and sat right in front of the lady and her baby.  The baby had started crying and the man yelled, ""Woman, shut your baby up!""  She said, ""I'm sorry, sir.  I tried feeding her, rocking her in my arms, giving her a pacifier, but none of it is working.  Infant babies cry, so please don't be mean and raise your voice, it's upsetting her even more.""  That just made things worse, as he went on to tell her how ugly her baby is and that she shouldn't have even brought her on the flight since she knew her baby might cry, just being very hateful.

The young mother calls the stewardess to come over and tells her how mean the man is being to her and her baby.  The stewardess says, ""Sir, this lady paid for a ticket just as you did so stop it,"" but that did no good so she called the captain who says to the man, ""You need to stop this right now, or I'm gonna take matters into my own hands.""  When the man asks, ""and just what do you think you're going to do?"" the captain says, ""I'll throw your hunting dog out the window,"" to which the man laughed saying, ""You can't do that,"" and that earned him a ""You've been warned"" response as the captain walks back to the cockpit.  Of course, it just got worse.  The baby and mama were both hysterical at this point, and the mean S.O.B. pulls out a cigar, lights it up and starts blowing smoke in both of their faces, causing both of them to have coughing fits.  The captain was called back once again and tells him that there's no smoking on the airplane as he took the cigar from the man's mouth and threw it out the window.  As the captain reached the cockpit again, the horrible male passenger has another one lit up which brings the captain right back to their seats one last time.  He said, ""I told you what would happen if you didn't stop which you didn't,"" so the captain proceeds to grab the dog and throw him out the window, and that infuriated the man.  

After the captain had returned to the cockpit, the mean passenger realized there's nothing that could be done at that point.  A few minutes go by when the now angry man and young mother both notice something out the window, and it's that prized hunting dog. He was just floating by doing the dog paddle through the air with something in his mouth.  

What was in the dog's mouth?

A brick.",Is there a point?,1

About the third day of their trip, their small turbo prop plane begins to malfunction, and they make a crash landing near an uncharted island. They swim to shore where they are  immediately found by hostile, spear-wielding tribesmen. The tribesmen tie them up and take them to the camp, where their chieftain greets them.

""Must you perform ritual. Holy tribe test. Or eat you!"" He rattles off in broken English. They must have had prior encounters with sailors or tourists.

The chieftain through a series of broken English phrases and gestures explains the tribe's rite of passage: they can join the tribe and be spared, but only if they display significant courage and resiliency under extreme agony.

The chieftain tasks them with going into the jungle and finding three of any fruit. They then have to bring those fruit back and insert all three completely into their rectums, without making any faces or sounds. 

They head off into the jungle, and after about an hour, Sam is the first back. He has three oranges. He nervously squats, all eyes on him, drops his pants, and starts sticking the orange in. He almost gets the first in before grunting in pain. The tribesmen descend upon him with a flurry of spears. Sam is no more.

They cook and eat Sam, and after about another hour, Robert comes back. He has three kiwis. Certainly a lot easier than an orange.

Robert looks off into the distance and begins working the kiwis up there. He makes it to his third and final kiwi before he bursts out laughing hysterically. The tribesmen are confused, but, regardless, he failed the test, so they kill him. The chieftain walks over and wonders: "" Me no understand. Him why laugh? Crazy.""

Suddenly a rustling is heard from the direction that Robert was facing. 

It's Joe, with three pineapples in his arms.

As he grew up, he took all the train-related electives and participated in all the train-related extracurriculars. He got into the best train conductor school in the world and proceeded to graduate top of his class. He was ecstatic to accept a position driving the biggest freight trains across the American countryside. He was living the life. 

Then one day, Timmy saw a few hobos passed out on the tracks. Timmy thought to himself, ""Man, I sure do hate hobos."" So he cranks that train up as fast as it will go, a full 100mph with the weight of 3 miles of fully loaded freight cars behind him, and slams into the hobos, splattering them into dust. 

Timmy is found guilty of murder and is sentenced to death. For his last meal, he requests a blue banana. At this time of year, the only place the blue banana grows is at the top of Mount Everest. To honor Timmy's last meal request, they put together an expedition to get the blue banana. 

When the expedition reaches the top, they see a small bush with a single blue banana hanging from a branch. Expedition leader Bill reaches out to pick the banana. As soon as it snaps off the branch, a yeti jumps out from behind a rock and proceeds to slaughter every member of the expedition...except for Bill. 

Bill returns with the blue banana and hands it to Timmy. Timmy peels the banana, eats it, and says ""I'm ready."" Timmy is strapped into the electric chair and the switch is thrown. Nothing happens. The switch is thrown again. Still nothing happens. The switch is thrown a third time. Timmy remains unaffected. Since the electric chair failed and this particular state didn't have another method of execution, they had no choice but to let Timmy walk free. 

With murder on his record Timmy is fired from his previous job, but with his other credentials he is able to land a job as the conductor of a small tourist steam train. Things are going pretty well until one day Timmy sees some hippies hanging out on the tracks. Timmy thinks to himself, ""Man, I sure do hate hippies."" So he cranks that train up as fast as it will go, 40mph with the steam pouring out of the smokestack, and slams into the hippies, sending their bodies flying. 

Timmy is again found guilty of murder and again requests a blue banana for his last meal. At this time of year, the blue banana only grows at the bottom of Challenger Deep in the Marianas Trench. Bill once again leads the expedition. Once at the bottom of the ocean, the expedition finds a small bush with a single blue banana floating from a small branch. Bill carefully pilots his submersible to the bush and guides the mechanical arm toward the banana, gripping it gingerly and plucking the banana from the bush. As soon as he does, a Kraken barrels out of the dark and destroys every submersible killing everyone inside...except for Bill's submersible. 

Bill returns and hands the banana to Timmy. Timmy peels the banana, eats it, and says ""I'm ready."" Timmy is once again strapped into the electric chair and the switch is thrown. Nothing happens. The switch is thrown again. Still nothing. The switch is thrown a third time and left on as the executioners go to lunch. When they return and turn it off, they find that Timmy is still alive! With no other method of execution at their disposal, they are once again forced to let Timmy go free. 

Now with a second murder conviction on his record, Timmy can't find work anywhere. He eventually decides to open a small kiddie train at the local mall. It's not the life Timmy dreamed for himself, but at least he's still driving a train. Then one day, Timmy sees some hipsters making condescending remarks about everyone at the mall. Timmy thinks to himself, ""Man, I sure do hate hipsters."" So he cranks that train up as fast as it will go, a whopping 3mph with a couple of scared and screaming kids, and runs over the hipsters' ankles, possibly breaking one or 2.

Timmy is only found guilty of attempted murder this time, but to avoid taking further chances Timmy is sentenced to death anyway. He once again requests a blue banana as his last meal. At this time of year the blue banana only grows in the middle of Siberia. Bill is once again put in charge of the expedition. 

This time he takes no chances, bringing along a full battalion of soldiers, tanks, and air support. When the expedition finds the blue banana hanging from a small bush in the middle of a field, a several mile wide perimeter is established with guns and missiles pointed at every possible hostile entry vector. Once satisfied with the security measures, Bill walks up to the bush and carefully picks the banana. As soon as he does, the Siberian traps open up, throwing lava and noxious gas every which way and violently killing the entire battalion. Even Bill is thrown hundreds of miles through the air by the eruption, but by some miracle lands on a massive pile of pillows that were about to be loaded and shipped to Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond. He manages to escape without a scratch...and with the blue banana still in hand.

Bill returns and hands the blue banana to Timmy. Timmy peels the banana, eats it, and says ""I'm ready."" Timmy is strapped into the electric chair and the switch is thrown. Nothing happens. The switch is thrown again. Still nothing happens. The switch is thrown a third time and left on overnight. The executioners come back the next morning to find the entire power grid shut down due to the massive amount of electricity expended on Timmy, yet Timmy was still alive! Finally, one of the executioners asks Timmy, ""How do you keep surviving the electric chair?!""

Timmy responds, ""I guess I'm just a bad conductor.""","The Blue Banana (warning, very long)",8

So when they all ended up going on their first dates all on the same night, you might say he was a bit angry.

The farmer agreed, but only if he could meet each potential suitor at the door with his shotgun at his side. Of course, he would never be pushed to use it, but showing some rowdy young boys who the boss is, never hurt. 

The night comes, the three girls are all dolled up and waiting upstairs. Farmer brown is sitting on the couch, looking into his driveway, shotgun on his knee.

About 15 minutes passes, and a car pulls up. A well-dressed young man gets out and approaches the door. Farmer brown opens it, shotgun just slightly in view past the threshold.

""H-hi...sir, m-my name is Joe. I'm uh...here for Flo, we wanted to go see a sh-show.""

Farmer brown looks him up and down, and decides ""you know what? You're an alright kid, Joe."" He calls Flo down, all giggly and excited, and they head out.

Farmer brown smiles and sits back down for the next guy. Not five minutes later does a rusty truck pull up, out comes a red headed guy in a new set of overalls.

He comes up to the door. This time, farmer Brown has let down his guard, so the shotgun has been left on the table.

""Hello Mr. Brown! My name is Eddie, and I'm here for Betty. We're going to get some spaghetti.""

Farmer Brown talks to him for a second before deciding that Eddie is an alright guy too.

Eddie and Betty head off, Farmer Brown is calm now and very proud of his young daughters' taste in men.

About 45 minutes passes, the next guy is running late. Farmer Brown hates being late and hates it even more when other people are.

Around that time, an old, worn out convertible comes sloppily cruising down his driveway, parking crookedly near the cattle pen. A scruffy looking kid stumbles out and hobbles on over. Farmer Brown is annoyed now and decides to put his gun back on his lap.

The guy comes up to the door and knocks. Farmer Brown opens, and the kid starts off:

""Hi, my name is Chuck, and I-

And then farmer Brown shot him.",A farmer's three virgin daughters are all going on their first date...,50
