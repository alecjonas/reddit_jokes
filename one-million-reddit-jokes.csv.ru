 It gallops along at a steady and rhythmic pace, but the blonde begins to slip from the saddle.

She tries to throw her arms around the horse's neck, but she slides down the side of the horse anyway.

 The horse gallops along, seemingly oblivious to its slipping rider.

 Finally, giving up her frail grip, she leaps away from the horse to try and throw herself to safety.

One day Tyrone's mother came to the school to check on her son, and his teacher told her that he was a disaster, always had bad grades, and was probably the dumbest kid she ever taught.  Tyrone's mother was so furious she removed Tyrone from the Detroit school and they moved to Cleveland.

25 years later, the teacher was diagnosed with an almost incurable cardiac disease.  All of her doctors advised her that she needed heart surgery, but the only one able to do it was a doctor in Cleveland.  Since she had no other options she decided to have the operation and it was successful.

When she opened her eyes she saw a handsome young doctor smiling down at her. She wanted to thank him, but she couldn't talk.  Her face started to turn blue, and she raised her hand as if she was trying to tell the doctor something but quickly died.  

The doctor was shocked and wondered what went wrong so suddenly.  Then he turned around and saw our friend Tyrone, the janitor at the clinic, who had unplugged her life support equipment in order to connect his vacuum cleaner.

===========
If Linda, Kate, Paula and Janice go out for lunch, they will call each other Linda, Kate, Paula and Janice.
If Fred, Luke, Bradley, and Jeff go out, they will affectionately refer to each other as Bruno, Scrappy, Peanut-Head and Godzilla.

Eating Out
===========
When the bill arrives, Fred, Luke, Bradley, and Jeff will each throw in $20, even though the total is only $34.25. None of them will have any smaller bills and none will admit they want change back.
When Linda, Kate, Paula and Janice get their bill, out come the 
pocket calculators.

Money
===========
A man will pay $10 for a $5 item he needs.
A woman will pay $5 for a $10 item that she doesn’t need, because it’s on sale.

Bathrooms
===========
A man has five items in his bathroom: a toothbrush, razor, shaving cream, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Motel 6.
The average number of items in a woman’s bathroom is 284. The average man would not be able to identify most of them.

Arguments
===========
Women always have the last word in an argument.
Anything a man adds after that is the beginning of a new argument.

Cats
===========
Women love cats.
Men may say they love cats, but when women are not looking, will men kick cats.

The Future
===========
A woman worries about the future — until she gets a husband.
A man never worries about the future — until he gets a wife.

Success
===========
A successful man is one who makes more money than can be spent by his wife.
A successful woman is one who can find that a man.

Marriage
===========
A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn’t.
A man marries a woman expecting that she won’t change, and she does.

Dressing Up
===========
A woman will dress up when she goes shopping, empties the garbage, answers the phone, waters the plants, gets the mail and reads a book.
A man will dress up for weddings and funerals.

Natural
===========
Men wake up looking as good as when they went to bed.
Women will somehow deteriorate during the night.

Children
===========
A woman knows all about her children. She knows about their best friends, romances, secret hopes and dreams, favorite foods, fears and dental appointments.
A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.

Maturity
===========
Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year old females can function as adults. Most 17-year old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.

Handwriting
===========
To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken-scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their “i’s” with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their “p’s” and “g’s”. It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she’s dumping you, she’ll put a smiley face at the end of the note.

Groceries
===========
A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampett’s car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 12-items-or-less lane.

Going Out
===========
When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go out. When a woman says she is ready to go out, it means she WILL be ready to go out, as soon as she finds her earrings and finishes putting on her makeup.

Low Blows
===========
Let’s say a man and a woman are watching a boxing match on TV. One of the boxers is felled by a low blow. The woman says, “Oh, gee. That must have hurt.” The man groans and doubles over, and actually FEELS the pain.

Laundry
===========
Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat.

The Wedding
===========
When reminiscing about weddings, women talk about “the ceremony”. Men talk about “the bachelor party”.",DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN,40

Dear Friends:
I have the distinguished honor of being a member of the Committee to raise $50,000,000 for a monument to Hillary R. Clinton. We originally wanted to put her on Mt. Rushmore until we discovered there was not enough room for her two faces.
We then decided to erect a statue of Hillary in the Washington, D.C. Hall of Fame. We were in a quandary as to where the statue should be placed. It was not proper to place it beside the statue of George Washington, who never told a lie, or beside Barack Hussein Obama, who never told the truth, since Hillary could never tell the difference.
We finally decided to place it beside Christopher Columbus, the greatest Democrat of them all. He left not knowing where he was going, and when he got there he did not know where he was. He returned not knowing where he had been, and did it all on someone else's money. 

Thank you, 
Hillary R. Clinton Monument Committee

P.S. The Committee has raised $2.16 so far.","Donation Request ----SENT FROM FORMER 3 STAR GENERAL, FORMER SENATOR, ROBERT WINGLASS ( AND CLASSMATE )",3

""Peter, come here!""
So, again Peter tries to climb the cross to get to his lord, when the roman soldier draws his sword and says if Peter comes back they will but his arms and legs off. Peter is getting a little pissed and wants to go back to his buddies, but again Jesus summons. The guard can't believe that Peter is trying yet AGAIN to climb to the cross, and chops peters arms and legs off. Peter is now covered in blood and demented from the blow to the head and wants to call it a day. Jesus calls again. 

""Peter, please, come to me!"" 
By now, the guard is tired of chopping limbs, so he lets Peter be. Peter climbs all the way up and after a long time he finally arrives at his Lord's side.

Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first time.
The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. He tells the pharmacist it's his first time and the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.
That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. ""Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!""
The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated.
The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down.
10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.
Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, ""I had no idea you were this religious.""
The boy turns, and whispers back, ""I had no idea your father was the pharmacist!""",Make love for the first time.....,0

The man explained to the kennel owner that he wanted the biggest, meanest, most vicious dog in the kennel, and the owner offered to take the man on a tour of the premises. After they had been walking for a few minutes, they came upon a large dog. He was snarling loudly and biting and clawing at the cage.""He looks like he'd be a pretty good attack dog,"" said the buyer.""Well, he's not bad,"" replied the owner, ""but I have something better in mind for you.""They continued walking around the premises, and after a while they found an even larger, meaner dog than the first. He snarled at the two men and tried to bite them through the wire on his cage.""Ah,"" said the buyer, ""This must be the dog you were referring to earlier.""""Well, no."" said the owner. ""I have something better in mind for you.""The men continued their tour. Eventually, they came upon a fairly large dog that was lying quietly on his side, licking his butt. He did not seem to notice as the men approached.""This is the dog I had in mind for you,"" said the owner. The buyer was flabbergasted. ""You're joking!"" he exclaimed.""This dog seems quite tame; he doesn't act at all like an attack dog at all. Hell, he's just lying there, licking his butt!""""I know, I know,"" said the owner.

Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...

During the tour of the Tower of London, a man from Prague and another man from Athens struck up a conversation about some point in history.

Donning armour and chain mail, they prepared for a battle to the death.
This attracted the attention of the rest of the tour group, who crowded around for a better look. Inasmuch as the combatants were in period dress, the people couldn’t tell one from another. “Is that the Greek wearing the chain mail?” asked one tourist.

Then the town folk found they could buy a cow in Sicily quite cheaply. So, they brought the cow over from Sicily. It was absolutely wonderful. it produced lots of milk every day and everyone was happy.

They bought a bull to mate with the cow to get more cows, so they’d never have to worry about their milk supply again. They put the bull in the pasture with the cow but whenever the bull tried to mount the cow, the cow would move away. No matter what approach the bull tried, the cow would move away from the bull, and he was never able to do the deed. The people were very upset and decided to go to the local veterinarian, Dr. Santucchi, who was very wise, tell him what was happening and ask his advice.

“Whenever the bull tries to mount our cow, she moves away. If he approaches from the back, she moves forward. When he approaches her from the front, she backs off. If he attempts it from the one side, she walks away to the other side.”

The veterinarian rubbed his chin thoughtfully and pondered this before asking, “Did you by chance, buy this cow in Sicily?”

The people were dumbfounded, since no one had ever mentioned that they had brought the cow over from Sicily. “You are truly a wise veterinarian,” they said. “How did you know we got the cow from Sicily?”

The Vet replied with a distant look in his eyes, “My wife is from Sicily.”",Cheap cow...,691

He stopped the man with no arms and explained his story, ending by saying, ""...so I was about to jump off that building until I saw you down here. You have no arms, but you're dancing! You've got it so much worse than me but you've found a way to enjoy life, and I just have to know your secret!""

The interviewer said, ""I do not think we could employ someone who would be womanizing all over the country.""

I'm writing this slow 'cause I know you can't read fast.

We don't live where we did when you first left. Your 
Dad read in the paper that most accidents happen 
within 20 miles of home, so we moved.

I won't be able to send you the address as the last 
family here took the numbers with them for their 
next house, so they wouldn't have to change their 
address.

This place has a washing machine. The first day I put 
four shirts in, pulled the chain, and I haven't seen 'em 
since.

It only rained twice this week, three days the first 
time and four days this time.

The coat you wanted me to send you, your Aunt Sue 
said it would be a little too heavy to send in the mail 
with the heavy buttons, so we cut them off and put 
them in the pockets.

About your sister, she had a baby this morning. I 
haven't found out whether it's a girl or a boy, so I 
don't know if you are an Aunt or and Uncle.

Not much more news this time, write soon.

Love,

Mom

P.S. Was going to send you money, but the envelope was already sealed.

Shortly after they got captured by indigenous people and were taken to see the tribe's chieftain.


Chieftain (quite surprisingly knew how to speak English): ""Now ye gotta do whatever we tell ye to do or we will cut yer balls off, roast 'em and feed 'em to ye before beheading ye.""


The three castaways were left with little choice but to obey to their abductors.


Chieftain (still in English): ""Now all three of ye must go in the jungle and bring me 100 of the same fruit.""


And so they went into the deep jungle, several hours after one of the castaways popped out of the jungle with a hundred oranges. The chieftain ordered him to put all the hundred oranges in his arsehole, but he should do it so without crying, screaming or letting any sound out of his mouth or he would meet a gruesome end.

The castaway began to put the oranges in his rump, but at the count of ten he could not sustain the heavy deserialization of his buttocks, and so he begged for mercy. The chieftain without hesitation relieved him of his nutsacks, roasted them, feed them to him before proceeding with cutting off his head.


After even more hours, the second castaway came out of the jungle with a hundred gooseberries, and same stuff happened... The chieftain ordered him to put all the hundred gooseberries in his booty, but he should do it so without crying, screaming or letting any sound out of his mouth or he would meet an unorthodox end.

And so the castaway began to fill his intestines with gooseberries... He did pretty well but reaching the 100th gooseberry he could not refrain himself from laughing out loud. 

The chieftain, bemused: ""Why did ye messed up so close to the goal? Ye could have been free!""

The castaway said: ""Sorry, I knew I was near from achieving the objective, but I just could not stop myself from laughing when I saw the other dude coming out of the jungle with a hundred watermelons!""",Three castaways on a island...,2

The waiter replied, 'Senor, you have excellent taste! Those are not oysters... they are called Cojones de Toro, bull's testicles from the bull fight this morning. A rare delicacy!'

The cowboy said, 'What the heck, bring me an order.'

My cousin, calm and undeterred, announced ""Well you can say what you want, but my kitty cat had PUPPIES!"". He then walked away with confidence abundant, because he was right.

One day, a construction crew turned up to start building a house on the empty lot.

The young family’s 5-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers.

Eventually the construction crew, all of them “gems-in-the-rough,” more or less, adopted her as a project mascot. They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important.

At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars. The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars “pay” she’d received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.

When the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.

The little girl proudly replied,  “I worked last week with a real work crew building the new house next door to us.”

“Oh my goodness gracious,” said the teller, “and will you be working on the house again this week too?”

The little girl replied, “I will if those assholes at Home Depot ever deliver the f**king sheet rock…”

 So, there's a man crawling through the desert.

 He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.

 He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out
 and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.

 He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon
 how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,
 he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication
 later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give
 him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle
 in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the
 direction he thinks is right.

 He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's
 been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and
 whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.

 He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.

 By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the
 town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.

 As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,
 he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.

 Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back
 up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.

 He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.

 He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.

 He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in
 his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't
 find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.

 Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.

 Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.

 As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.

 He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait
 any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large
 rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly
 swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry
 and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes
 another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.
 He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to
 make some difference and keep himself from passing out.

 He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,
 it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty
 sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.

 He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,
 dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.
 Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.

 After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat
 stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.

 After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He
 knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing
 donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy
 enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if
 he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,
 trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.

 He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.

 He walks through the sand.

 After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't
 remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he
 doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.

 But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures
 that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from
 there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.

 Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third
 time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll
 just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.

 While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally
 gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through
 the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert
 in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any
 rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -
 shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.

 He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,
 he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees
 is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he
 sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more
 dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.

 Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper
 fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the
 cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from
 here. He's going to have to go down there and look.

 He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.
 After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.

 He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough
 energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When
 he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot
 in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.

 So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins
 to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to
 have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages
 of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't
 have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last
 chance.

 He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the
 dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting
 his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just
 keeps crawling.

 Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,
 where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone
 area.

 His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark
 stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun
 overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying
 down on the nice cool surface.

 Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's
 probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and
 dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the
 beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him
 a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.

 He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here
 in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the
 center before he goes. He keeps crawling.

 It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's
 hearing. He would swear that someone just said, ""Greetings, traveler. You do
 not look well. Do you hear me?""

 He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and
 knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something
 different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few
 seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and
 tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands
 and tries again. Better this time.

 Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse
 of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or
 pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet
 out of the stone, at an angle.

 And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and
 seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long
 desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.

 He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and
 run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his
 final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to
 move from this spot.

 Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than
 dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a
 little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves
 it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a
 moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.

 Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -
that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.

 He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here
 because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was
 likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was
 now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had
 actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white
 post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe
 they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake
 was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.

 He tries to clear his throat to say, ""Hello,"" but his throat is too dry. All
 that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going
 to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the
 bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,
 almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't
 good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes
 out.

 He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,
 and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then
 swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk
 now.

 He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to
 spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, ""Hello? Is there anyone here?""

 He hears, from his side, ""Greetings. What is it that you want?""

 He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed
 to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a
 speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides
 to try asking for help.

 ""Please,"" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, ""I'd love to not be
 thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?""

 Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was
 coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its
 mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he
 falls forward, face first on the stone, ""Very well. Coming up.""

 A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits
 up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily
 disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the
 sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped
 around the tilted white post, still looking at him.

 He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.
 He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder
 again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -
 they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been
 bitten. By the snake.

 ""It'll feel better in a minute."" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He
 hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more
 importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!

 ""Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the
 afterlife?""

 ""Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,"" says the snake. ""That's the way I
 work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.""

 ""You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a
 drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be
 thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for
 the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?
 Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?""

 ""No,"" says the snake, ""I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I
 didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I
 bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just
 sitting around here.""

 The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the
 desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a
 snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not
 great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no
 longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt
 hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool
 stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer
 dying of thirst.

 ""I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your
 system with the next request,"" continued the snake. ""I can guess why you
 drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left
 in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or
 two, if you drank enough of it.""

 ""Ummm, n-next request?"" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting
 shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.

 ""That's the way it works. If you like, that is,"" explained the snake. ""You
 get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish."" The snake grinned at his
 own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.

 ""But there are rules,"" the snake continued. ""The first request is free. The
 second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of
 responsibility."" The snake looks at the man seriously.

 ""By the way,"" the snake says suddenly, ""my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,
 Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound
 used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand
 for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into
 names. You can call me Nate, if you wish."" Again, the snake grinned. ""Sorry
 if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds
 somewhat threatening."" The snake give his rattle a little shake.

 ""Umm, my name is Jack,"" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. ""Jack
 Samson.

 ""Can I ask you a question?"" Jack says suddenly. ""What happened to the
 poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?
 What do you mean by that's how you work?""

 ""That's more than one question,"" grins Nate. ""But I'll still try to answer
 all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question."" The snake's grin gets
 wider. ""Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need
 to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not
 be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make
 it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at
 all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to
 get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.
 You've been changed.

 ""For the third question,"" Nate continues, ""you are still dying. Besides the
 effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.
 In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.
 Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is."" Nate seemed vastly
 amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.

 ""As for the fourth question,"" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack
 could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read
 talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, ""first you have to agree
 to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell
 you.""

 ""Wait,"" joked Jack, ""isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd
 have to kill me?""

 ""I thought that was implied."" Nate continued to look serious.

 ""Ummm...yeah."" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was
 talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a
 nasty temper. ""So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really
 stop the effects of the methanol?"" Jack thought for a second. ""And, what do
 you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper
 fluid, and just denature it?""

 ""They may, I don't really know,"" said Nate. ""I haven't gotten out in a
 while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and
 on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you
 pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume
 that they still color wiper fluid blue?""

 ""Yeah, they do,"" said Jack.

 ""I figured,"" replied Nate. ""As for being bound by secrecy - with the
 fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,
 this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you
 decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,
 write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will
 lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of
 course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm
 guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding
 anyway, so you won't notice."" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.

 Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a
 little nervous at this. ""Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know
 that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?""

 Well, Jack,"" said Nate sadly, ""I can't tell you that, unless you make the
 second request."" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.

 ""Umm, well, ok,"" said Jack, ""what is this about a second request? What can I
 ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?""

 ""Sure!"" said Nate, brightening. ""You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes
 to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and
 before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or
 omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous
 and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and
 sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be
 omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very
 useful, at least in my opinion."" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was
 staring at him.

 ""Well, anyway,"" continued Nate, ""I'd probably suggest giving you permanent
 good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be
 immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long
 time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to
 recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a
 request to me.""

 ""Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?"" said Jack. ""And keep me healthy for a
 long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request
 about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not
 really a change to me?""

 ""Right,"" nodded Nate.

 ""Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?"" Jack asked, hopefully.

 ""That takes two requests, Jack.""

 ""Yeah, I figured so,"" said Jack. ""But I could ask to be a genius? I could
 become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?""

 ""Well, I could make you very smart,"" admitted Nate, ""but that wouldn't
 necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you
 very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.
 You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some
 truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It
 all depends on what you decide to do with it.""

 ""Hmmm,"" said Jack. ""Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,
 after this one?""

 ""Maybe,"" said Nate, ""it depends on what you decide then. There are more
 rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second
 request. You know how it goes."" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had
 shoulders.

 ""Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent
 health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.
 Do I need to sign in blood or something?""

 ""No,"" said Nate. ""Just hold out your hand. Or heel."" Nate grinned. ""Or
 whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,
 that's how it works - the poison, you know,"" Nate said apologetically.

 Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it
 didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better
 about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot
 snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to
 be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack
 tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it
 wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.

 ""Hey, Jack,"" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind
 him, ""is that someone else coming up over there?""

 Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of
 nowhere? And did they bring food?

 Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...

 Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through
 his jeans...

 Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. ""I would have
 decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to
 hoodwink me like that.""

 ""I've been doing this a long time, Jack,"" said Nate, confidently. ""You
 humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -
 especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of
 minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the
 health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.""

 ""Yeah, well, still,"" said Jack, ""it's the principle of the thing. And nobody
 likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or
 something instead?""

 ""More meat in the typical human butt,"" replied Nate. ""And less chance you
 accidentally kick me or move at the last second.""

 ""Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify
 to hear,"" answered Jack.

 ""Ok,"" said Nate. ""Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to
 just start talking?""

 ""Just talk,"" said Jack. ""I'll sit here and try to not think about food.""

 ""We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,""
 answered Nate.

 ""Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!"" Jack jumped up.
 ""What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically
 whip up food along with your other powers?"" Jack was almost shouting with
 excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.

 ""I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite
 it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,
 that is,"" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.

 ""Ugh,"" said Jack, sitting back down. ""I think I'll pass. I can last a little
 longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it
 is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.
 No thanks. Just talk.""

 ""Ok,"" replied Nate, still grinning. ""But I'd better hurry, before you start
 looking at me as food.

 Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.
 ""You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.""

 Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate
 sceptically.

 ""Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,"" said Nate. ""Stand up
 and look at the symbol on the rock here."" Nate gestured around the dark
 stone they were both sitting on with his nose.

 Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a
 representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around
 was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches
 left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it
 looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and
 embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.

 Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the
 setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the
 sky.

Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another
 night out here! Arrrgh!

 Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and
 stood next to Nate. ""In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,"" said
 Jack. ""Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to
 have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw
 desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.""

 ""It's about 30 miles that way."" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail
 this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to
 the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. ""But that's 30 miles by
 the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be
 able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head
 out early tomorrow, Jack.""

 Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and
 then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading
 out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting
 stuff. ""Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?""

 ""Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,"" said Nate. ""He
 figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a
 'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he
 could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from
 across the ocean. He worried about that for a while.""

 ""Garden of Eden, hunh?"" said Jack. ""How long have you been here, Nate?""

 ""No idea, really,"" replied Nate. ""A long time. It never occurred to me to
 count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I
 do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands
 of years, at least.""

 ""So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?"" said Jack.

 ""Beats me,"" said Nate. ""Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your
 kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it
 could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant
 requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.""

 ""Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out
 of the stone there?"" asked Jack.

 ""Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much
 bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember
 if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But
 one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do
 something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've
 been here ever since.

 ""What is this place?"" said Jack. ""And what did he ask you to do?""

 ""Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?"" Nate loosened his
 coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into
 the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to
 enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned
 over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as
 Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but
 Nate was suddenly there in the way.

 ""You can't touch that yet, Jack,"" said Nate.

 ""Why not?"" asked Jack.

 ""I haven't explained it to you yet,"" replied Nate.

 ""Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,"" said Jack. ""You'd push it
 that way, and it would move in the slot.""

 ""Yep, that's what it is,"" replied Nate.

 ""What does it do?"" asked Jack. ""End the world?""

 ""Oh, no,"" said Nate. ""Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it
 'The Lever of Doom'."" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing
 voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and
 grinned.

 Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned
 Jack laughed. ""Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it
 really do?""

 ""Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,"" smirked Nate. ""I just thought
 the voice I used was funny, didn't you?""

 Nate continued to grin.

 ""A lever to end humanity?"" asked Jack. ""What in the world is that for? Why
 would anyone need to end humanity?""

 ""Well,"" replied Nate, ""I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.
 Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really
 bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are
 the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I
 didn't think to ask back when I started here.""

 ""Rules? What rules?"" asked Jack.

 ""The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it
 unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human
 can be bound in that way at a time. That's it."" explained Nate.

 Jack looked somewhat shocked. ""You mean that I could pull the lever now?
 You'd let me end humanity?""

 ""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""if you want to."" Nate looked at Jack carefully. ""Do
 you want to, Jack?""

 ""Umm, no."" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. ""Why in
 the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want
 that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,
 wouldn't it?""

 ""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""being as he'd be human too.""

 ""Has anyone ever seriously considered it?"" asked Nate. ""Any of those bound
 to secrecy, that is?""

 ""Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or
 another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and
 think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get
 disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.
 But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here."" Nate grinned some more.

 Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at
 the same time. After a bit, he said, ""So this makes me the Judge of
 humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?""

 ""That seems to be it,"" agreed Nate.

 ""What kind of criteria do I use to decide?"" said Jack. ""How do I make this
 decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are
 bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?""

 ""Nope,"" replied Nate. ""You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's
 up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed
 to know.""

 ""But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel
 horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?""
 protested Jack.

 Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. ""You don't. You just have to
 try your best, Jack.""

 Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly
 getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.

 Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. ""Nate, was Samuel the
 one bound to this before me?""

 ""Yep,"" replied Nate. ""He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to
 read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried
 in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months
 ago.""

He sighs and turns off the light. The blowjob was even better than before. She went on for a while with her opera and he had the most amazing mind-blowing orgasm. Lights go on, she is paid and leaves.

The following night he wants to know once and for all. He heads to the bar, brings her back to his place and turns off the light. He unzips his pants and she starts singing opera.

After a minute, he runs over to the light switch and turns it on. The prostitute is holding a glass eye.",Mind-blowing orgasm,0

One night, we had to do a night hike, alone, for a merit badge. I had left the campsite about an hour earlier and a terrible storm rolled in. The sky opened up and the ground was quickly saturated. I tried to continue my hike for another few minutes, but it got cold and I was chilled and soaked to the bone, so I decided to try to head back to camp.


Lightning was starting to crackle above me, so I thought I should try to take a shortcut to make my hike back quicker. I pulled out my compass and found my direction, but the rain made it impossible to see more than five feet in front of me.


I was looking down at my compass, not paying any attention to where I was going, and suddenly felt weightless. The feeling didn't last long as I thumped down on slippery earth a second later.


I had fallen onto a ledge on the side of a rather steep cliff, the bottom of which was at least fifty feet down.


I sat there, contemplating on how to get back up this cliff as water rolled over the edge ten feet above me. There was nothing to grab onto to pull myself up. I was stuck there.


After a few minutes, I noticed the little ledge I was standing on was slowly getting smaller. The water was coming down so hard it was eroding the tiny bit of safety I had.


I dug through my pockets, thinking maybe I had something, anything, to help me out of my precarious situation. All I had was my compass, a cough drop, and a match. I was screwed.


So, I sat there, watching the edge of the ledge I was on get closer and closer to my feet, when suddenly I felt something pushing on my back.
I turned slightly and saw a wooden box sticking out of the cliff behind me. It was working its way out of the side, the rain surely helping it along. I tried to move away from it, but the ledge wasn't very wide and the box kept coming out, pushing me farther to the weak and failing edge.


As more of the box came out, to my horror, I realized it was a coffin! I had no idea how old it was, but it looked rather rotten. All I could think of was being pushed off this ledge, and the rotten coffin breaking and dropping a skeleton onto my broken and battered body at the bottom.


The coffin crept closer, my foot began to slip. I grabbed onto a root that was sticking out of the cliff side and dug in my pocket once more.


I hurriedly tore the wrapper off the cough drop and stuck it in my mouth.

It stopped the coffin. ","A compass, a cough drop, and a match.",10

An elderly woman wakes one morning and looks out of her bedroom window. Across the road she sees two men from the local council office slowly making their way up the grassy embankment at the side of the road.



The man in front starts to dig a hole in the embankment and after some time moves forward and begins digging another hole. The second man then proceeds to immediately fill in the hole which the first man had only just finished digging. Perplexed by the odd behaviour of the men, the old woman continues to watch them to see if they will do the same with the next hole.



Surely enough, the men from the council continue this pattern for a good 30 minutes before the old woman, agitated with confusion and curiosity; decides it's time to find out what the men are doing.



""Excuse me young man, what on earth is the point of this, what are you doing?"" Says the old woman, ""The point?"" Says the first man, ""The point is to improve the appearance of the roads in this area, to give them a more natural look"". 



""Natural?"" Exclaims the woman, ""How exactly does this make the road look more natural?

post,52tak0,2qh72,jokes,false,1473894385,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/52tak0/why_did_the_chicken_cross_the_road/,self.jokes,,"To get to the other side is the most common answer, however this answer leaves a great deal of room for interpretation. As noted historian and sociologist Ian Ormwell stated, ""A joke cannot be taken at face value; all jests are subjective in their appearance and impact."" Contrasting this view, the philosopher Ben Hoovian posited, ""All things being equal, a joke must remain in its proper context. A joke with no context is not a joke."" The issue was finally settled by post-modernist Irma J. King, who unequivocally stated, ""It is the nature of humans to analyze, and all literature created should be subject to analysis."" (For a more complete treatment on the subject I strongly recommend reading her seminal book ""6000 Years of Humor and Counting: Humor's influence on Human Civilization."")

As for the original chicken joke, the most common interpretation would be to take the joke at face value: we are dealing with a ""real"" chicken and road. The humor of the joke is based on its simplicity: while most jokes rely on the extraordinary, the humor of this joke is based on the ordinary.

Of course, one does not need to take the joke at face value. The chicken and the road can be viewed metaphorically. What if the chicken is a metaphorical coward, and is a human rather than an avian. The humor is then based not on the randomness of chicken desires, but becomes an example of cowardice and retreat.
Even deeper, the road could be a metaphor for a dividing line, perhaps ""the other side"" is some kind of forbidden knowledge, perhaps even death. The simplicity of the joke reinforces the listener's ignorance; the joke raises more questions than answers. Sadly, we may never know. Obviously, more research is needed as to WHY the chicken crossed the road. But what kind of road is it? What kind of chicken is it? And if ""the other side"" is indeed death, what are the implications for our own existence?

Please review my sources for their veracity. Let me know of any discrepancies so I can further treat the topic with more accuracy.",Why did the chicken cross the road?,16

The bartender tells the man that they have a horse in the stable out back, and if the man can make the horse laugh, he gets to keep the jar of coins which is full to the brim, but has to pay $1 for every attempt at making the horse laugh. The man decides to have a go and sure enough, leaves the stable with the horse laughing hysterically. He finishes his drink and takes the jar home with him.

Fast forward a couple months, the man enters the bar again to see that the jar is full. He asks the bartender if he can have another go at making the horse laugh. The bartender says he can, but this time he has to make the horse cry. Again, the man enters the stable, and upon leaving, the bartender notices that the horse is crying. As the man picks up the jar of coins, the bartender asks - ""So how did you do it? No one has ever managed to achieve it!""

Any body suspended in space will remain in space until made aware
of its situation.

Daffy Duck steps off a cliff, expecting further pasture land.  He
loiters in midair, soliloquizing flippantly, until he chances to
look down.  At this point, the familiar principle of 32 feet per
second per second takes over.

Cartoon Law II

Any body in motion will tend to remain in motion until solid matter
intervenes suddenly. Whether shot from a cannon or in hot pursuit
on foot, cartoon characters are so absolute in their momentum that
only a telephone pole or an outsize boulder retards their forward
motion absolutely.  Sir Isaac Newton called this sudden termination
of motion the stooge's surcease.

Cartoon Law III

Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation
conforming to its perimeter.

Also called the silhouette of passage, this phenomenon is the
speciality of victims of directed-pressure explosions and of
reckless cowards who are so eager to escape that they exit directly
through the wall of a house, leaving a cookie-cutout-perfect hole. 
The threat of skunks or matrimony often catalyzes this reaction.
