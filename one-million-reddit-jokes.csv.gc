That night, the husband arrives home and sees his wife in the kitchen cooking. He thinks to himself, “what a perfect opportunity to test her hearing”. 

He stands in the doorway of the kitchen and promptly asks;

“What’s for dinner honey?”

No answer. He moves closer. 

“What’s for dinner honey?”

Still no answer. He moves even closer. 

“What’s for dinner honey?”

Still his wife doesn’t answer. He now sees how serious her hearing problem is. At this point, he is stood right next to his wife.

All these easy laughs are making us dumber by the second, and we just keep rewarding them with upvotes that convince the lazy among us to keep churning out lazy jokes. Comedy is one of the only common traits things in every society and culture on this planet and we may not always agree with what is funny, it's very subjective, but no society or culture has no comedy. It's one of the most effective unifiers in all human existence. Of course it's just my two cents, but we really need to avoid cheapening it. There are 6500 spoken languages in the world and this is the most widely spoken, the least spoken languages of course being sign language. Someone once said ""a world without laughter would be like a world without warmth, a dark hole in the ground filled with cold water."" I know they mean well, but I think it's worse than that. There are three unwritten rules for how comedy should function in the world. We have to learn to follow them or we're doomed as a people, forever, however just like there are two butts in the word ""assassin"", there are two caveats to this dire situation with lessons learned from the best there is. One is the lesson we can take from Switzerland, I'm not entirely sure what makes them so good at integrating comedy into their lives, but their flag is a huge plus. The other is the lesson we can learn from farmers who know how to put what's important first, how to put in the effort into growing something, and they are always outstanding in their field. We get too caught up in standard modalities of thinking and none of us are totally all right, in fact most of us are at least close to half left. In closing, the absence of comedy when you really think about it, is fear. Fear of the ups and downs of life, much like a fear of elevators. And just like a fear of elevators, we all must take steps to avoid it. Thank you for your time.

He hears laughing and general good humor echoing from the little town so he decides to investigate. 

The rabbit hides behind a little bush and what he finds he almost can’t explain! The town is filled with little blue smurf like creatures going about their day filled with joy and good humor. 

As he is watching these little blue creatures he can’t help but be jealous of their happiness and elation towards life. 

After watching them all day the rabbit decides that he will go back in the morning to watch how these little blue creatures start their day so he can figure out why they are so happy all of the time. 

The next morning the rabbit wakes up before dawn and heads to the village. He gets there and what he sees greatly disheartens him. All of the little blue creatures are angry and grumbling at one another. They are spitting, cursing and arguing amongst themselves. 

Eventually the king, with his crown and scepter, comes out of his house and all of the blue creatures stand in line. They are still angry and grumbling as the king approaches the line. The king walks straight up to the first little blue creature and kicks him right over. When he hops up he is laughing and smiling and walks away. 

The king goes down the line kicking the angry little blue creatures over and having them hop back up smiling and laughing. 

The rabbit watches the rest of the day as these little blue creatures go about their business happy as could be. 

The rabbit is confused, but decides that in order to be as happy as those little blue creatures he has to be kicked by the king. 

So next morning he wakes up early and heads to the town to find its inhabitants coming out of their houses grumbling and upset. And as the king comes out the rabbit hops over to the end of the line. 

The king walks up to the first little blue creature and gives him a kick then sends him flying over and laughing when he gets back up. The rabbit is beginning to get excited as the king works his way down the line. 

Finally the king gets to the rabbit and looks up at him and says in a firm commanding voice “what are you doing here rabbit?” 

The rabbit timidly replies “I’ve been watching your people for a few days and was wondering, first of all, what are you?” 

The king replies in his thunderous voice “we are the Trids! And us Trids are a proud folk who do not take kindly to outsiders.” 

The rabbit, who is growing nervous now, says “I understand that Mr. King Trid, but I was wondering if you could kick me over so I could be as happy as all of the Trids in your beautiful little town?” 

The king Trid looks up at the rabbit as a smile crosses over his lips and replies with rather good humor, “silly rabbit, kicks are for Trids!” ",My dads favorite joke (long),11

They quickly recognize their friend Jim and they turn to St. Peter and say, wait a second this guy wasn't that great why does he get such good treatment?   So it turns out he lived a good life and only told 10 lies during his entire life, so he gets the good life.

They have a quick visit with him and then move on to the next room where their friend John is having sex with this horrible ugly woman, who is shrieking at him that he's not going fast or hard enough and that his penis is too small.  She tells him that he is worthless and a bum and he doesn't deserve her.   When the two inquire as to what is going on, St. Peter says, ""well John lived a mostly good life but he told 100 lies and was unfaithful, so he gets to have sex, but it's pretty unpleasant"".  Fair enough.

At this point, one of the admins comes in and whispers to St. Peter and says, ""Scott we can use you now please go into that chamber over there"".  So Scott goes in and all is good.  Eventually the curiosity gets the better of Steve and he asks St. Peter what's going on.   St Peter says lets take a look and when they open the door they see him having sex with the most gorgeous woman anyone has ever seen.  She is doing everything right, and whatever he wants to do she's all for it.   So Steve says, hey, wait a second what did he do to deserve this, and St. Peter says, ""Oh ,no, she killed the Pope.""

","These two guys , Scott and Steve die in a horrible plane crash",8

The BBC Reporter said, ""I’m a reporter to the end. I want to take out my tape recorder and describe the scene here and what’s about to happen. Maybe someday someone will hear it and know that I was on the job till the end.”

The ISIS leader directed an aide to hand over the tape recorder and dictated some comments. The reporter then said, ""Now I can die knowing I stayed true until the end.”

The ISIS leader turned to the Israeli commando and said, “And now, Mr. Israeli tough guy, what is your final wish?”

“Kick me in the butt ,” said the soldier.

“What?"" asked the leader, “Will you mock us in your last hour?”

“No, I’m not kidding. I want you to kick me in the butt ,” insisted the Israeli.

So the terrorist leader shoved him into the open and kicked him in the behind. The soldier went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9 mm pistol from under his flak jacket, and shot the leader dead. In the resulting confusion, he jumped to his knapsack, pulled out his carbine and sprayed the terrorists with gunfire. In a flash, all terrorists were either dead or fleeing for their lives. As the soldier was untying the reporters, they asked him, “Why didn’t you just shoot them in the beginning? Why did you ask them to kick you in the butt first?”

He goes to the biggest department store downtown and applies for a job. The HR rep asks him if he has any experience in sales. So the guy says 'yea I was considered one of the best salesmen  out Bush'. The rep isn't amused. 'This is Sydney's most prestigious stores, your experience out Bush just won't cut it. It's Friday,  I'll give you the afternoon as a trial, if you are successful you can start Monday.  but I'll warn you that our standards are high' says the rep.

So they give him the afternoon. As the store closes the rep approaches the outback guy.
'How many customers did you serve' says the rep
'Just one' replies the outback guy
The rep scoffs 'Just one? And how much was that sale for'
So the outback guy passes his receipt over and says ' the sale was for $245,890.40'
The rep is looking at the receipt shocked. 'But but how? That's the biggest single sale we've ever had how did you do that?'

So the outback guy explains 
'Well first I sold him some fish hooks, then I said you'll probably need some sinkers to go with that. Then I told him he'll need some lures. By then we had a lot of stuff so I told him he'll need a tackle box. All this new tackle would be wasted on some old rods, so I took him to buy some new fishing rods while we were at it. I then asked him where he fished and he said the local creek. I told him if he wanted to catch some serious fish he needs to get out on the ocean. So we headed over to the boat department. We settled on a 15 footer, all the accessories , with a trailer to boot. I then asked him what kind of car he had and he said he had a Honda civic. I told him that the Honda would struggle to tow the boat, So we went over to the auto division and picked out a brand new Toyota 4 wheel drive, with all the optional extras, to tow the boat. And that's how I got my sale.'

The rep is there in shock. After a few moments of contemplation he asks the outback guy 'so your telling me a guy came in here looking for fish hooks and you managed to convince him to buy a boat and car?'

And the out back guy replies
'Actually no. The bloke came in saying he needs to buy some Tampons for his girlfriend. So I told him well mate since your weekend is fucked, you might As well go fishing'

Usually, she slept through the class.

One day the teacher called on her while she was napping, ""Tell me, April, who created the universe?""

When April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear. 

""GOD ALMIGHTY!"" shouted April and the teacher said, ""Very good"" and April fell back asleep.

A while later the teacher asked April, ""Who is our Lord and Saviour,"" But, April didn't even stir from her slumber.

Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. 

""JESUS CHRIST!"" shouted April and the teacher said, ""very good,"" and April fell back to sleep.

Then the teacher asked April a third question. 

""What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?"" 
And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin. 

This time April jumped up and shouted, ""IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR ARSE!""

john: ""What's with these sounds?""

St. Peter: ""On this floor are the Evangelicals, they like to sing, and that seems to make them happy, so we leave them alone""

They climb to the second floor where, it is completely quiet and there's a smell of incense

john: ""what's with the incense?""

St. Peter: ""On this floor are the Buddhists, they like to meditate, and that seems to make them happy, so we leave them alone""

so they go by many floors where Jews, Jehovah's Witnesses, and others were doing their own thing

They eventually end up on one floor at the entrance of which there is a soundproof sealed door.

St. Peter slowly opens and closes it after them trying not to make noise and tells John to whisper

So Deb gets home, parks the car and gets on her knees and starts blowing hard into the tail pipe.

Her sister walks in on her. 

""What are you doing?"" The sister asks.

He went to a sex shop and explained his situation. The man there said, ' Well, I don't know that I have anything that will keep her occupied for so many weeks, except, perhaps... The Magic Penis!'

The husband said, 'The what'?

The salesman repeated, 'The Magic Penis,' and pulled out what seemed to be a very ordinary dildo.

The husband laughed, and said, 'It looks like a dildo!'

The man then pointed to the door and said, 'Magic Penis, door!'

The penis rose out of its box, darted over to the shop door and started pounding away at the keyhole.

The whole door shook wildly with vibrations, so much so, that a crack began to form down the center.

Then the salesman said, 'Magic Penis, return to box!' and the penis stopped and returned to the box.

The husband bought it and took it home to his wife.

After the husband had been gone a few days, the wife remembered the Magic Penis. She undressed, opened the box and said 'Magic Penis, my vagina.'

The penis shot to her crotch. It was absolutely incredible. After three mind shattering orgasms, she became very exhausted and decided she'd had enough. She tried to pull it out, but it was firmly stuck.

Her husband had neglected to tell her how to turn it off so she put her clothes on, got in her car and started for the closest hospital.

On the way, another incredibly intense orgasm made her swerve all over the road.

A police traffic car was close by and the officer immediately pulled her over.

He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink.

Gasping and twitching, the woman said, 'I haven't had anything to drink officer. You see, I've got this Magic Penis thing stuck in my crotch and it won't stop screwing me rigid.'

The Police officer glared at her for a second, shook his head and replied,
 'Yeah right... Magic Penis, my ass'

Bill is understandably shocked and when he asks God why he should do that, the instructions are repeated, only louder. So Bill, having been raised a God- fearing person, does just that. A few weeks later, he's driving into Vegas and gets his second message from God: ""Bill, go to the MGM casino. "" Again, Bill questions this and is told again by God. So he gets to the casino and God says, ""Bill, go to the high rollers blackjack table with all of your money."" At this point, Bill is starting to feel uneasy, but does as he's told. 

Once at the table, God instructs him to put all of his money, several hundred thousand, on one hand. By now, Bill is a nervous wreck. He starts telling God how hard he worked to build the business and now he was being told to risk it all on one hand of blackjack? 

""Do you dare question your Maker?"" God asks in that booming voice.

Bill gives all his money to the dealer and his stacks his huge pile of chips on one hand. 

Sweating nervously, Bill's heart sinks when he is dealt a hard 17, and the dealer has a face card showing. When he asks God what he should do, the booming voice replies, ""Hit it!"" Bill hesitates, but is slightly relieved when he is dealt a deuce, giving him 19. Then God speaks again, ""Hit it again!"" Bill knows this is a bad play, and starts to question it when God repeats the instructions, louder. 

So Bill takes another card. He nearly faints when he sees an ace. Now at 20, Bill slowly exhales when God speaks yet again. ""Hit it again!"" Bill can't believe what he's hearing. He starts to tell God that he just can't, it's a terrible risk and all that, when God interrupts him, ""HIT IT AGAIN!!""

The dealer implores him to stand, as do several others crowding around the table, but Bill feels he can't contradict God, so with terror in his heart, he takes another card. 

It's an ace, giving Bill 21. 

But before he can start celebrating, he hears that booming voice of God one last time: 

""Another ace?! Un-fucking-believable!""","Bill, a small business owner is at work one day and hears God speak to him.",10

SARAH PALIN: The chicken crossed the road because, gosh-darn it, he's a maverick!

BARACK OBAMA: Let me be perfectly clear, if the chickens like their eggs they can keep their eggs. No chicken will be required to cross the road to surrender her eggs. Period.

JOHN McCAIN: My friends, the chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road.

HILLARY CLINTON: What difference at this point does it make why the chicken crossed the road?

GEORGE W. BUSH: We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either with us or against us. There is no middle ground here.

DICK CHENEY: Where's my gun?

BILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken.

AL GORE: I invented the chicken.... and the road.

JOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it.

AL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white?

DR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he is acting by not taking on his current problems before adding any new problems.

OPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross the road so badly. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to give this chicken a NEW CAR so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.

ANDERSON COOPER: We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.

NANCY GRACE: That chicken crossed the road because he's guilty! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.

PAT BUCHANAN: To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.

MARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way the chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.

DR SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told.

ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die in the rain, alone.

GRANDPA: In my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.

DONALD TRUMP: We should build a wall so the chicken can't cross the road.

BARBARA WALTERS: Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its lifelong dream of crossing the road.

ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

BILL GATES: I have just released eChicken2014, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents and balance your checkbook. Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken2014. This new platform is much more stable and will never reboot.

ALBERT EINSTEIN: Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken?

COLONEL SANDERS: Did I miss one?",Why did the chicken cross the road?,293

A store that sells husbands, Husband-Mart, has just opened.  Here a woman may go to choose a husband from among many men.  The store is composed of six (6) floors, and the men increase in positive attributes as the shopper ascends the flights.  There is, however, a catch.  As you open the door to any floor you may choose a man from that floor, but if you go up a floor, you cannot go back down except to exit the building. 

 

So a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband.  On the first floor the sign on the door reads:  Floor 1 - These men have jobs. The woman reads the sign and says to herself, “Well, that’s better than my last boyfriend, but I wonder what’s further up?”  So up she goes. 

 

The second floor sign reads:  Floor 2 - These men have jobs and love kids. The woman remarks to herself, “That’s great, but I wonder what’s further up?”  And up she goes again. 

 

The third floor sign reads:  Floor 3 - These men have jobs, love kids and are extremely good looking. “Hmmm, better” she says.  “But I wonder what’s upstairs?” 

 

The fourth floor sign reads:  Floor 4 - These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking and help with the housework. “Wow!” exclaims the woman, “very tempting.  BUT, there must be something better further up!”  And again she heads up another flight. 

 

The fifth floor sign reads:  Floor 5 - These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak. “Oh, mercy me!  But just think...what must be awaiting me further on?” 

 

So up to the sixth floor she goes.  The sixth floor sign reads:  Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor.  There are no men on this floor.  This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please.  Thank you for shopping at Husband-Mart and have a nice day. 

 

 

To avoid gender bias charges, the store’s owner opened a Wives store just across the street. 

 

The first floor has wives that are extremely good looking. 

 

The second floor has wives that are extremely good looking and love sex. 

 

The third floor has wives that are extremely good looking, love sex and have money. 

 

The fourth through sixth floors have never been visited. ",Women are impossible to please !!,114

First guy goes and swims for a bit before he gets eaten up by the piranhas. 

Next guy steps up and swim a good amount but tires out and down under he goes. 

The third guy steps up. Swimmers body and confidently handsome, he gloats that he's going to win the daughters heart. He swims and swims and a few meters away from the finish he gets bit in the balls and goes down. 

At this rate, they didn't think anyone was worthy enough to win his daughters heart. Until ... 

\*Splash\* Every one looks and they notice this man in the pool. He's swimming but then he gets pulled down. Shooting back up, bloody and all, he keeps on swimming and swimming until he reaches the end. 

Now the rich man is excited to meet his potential son-in-law and congratulates him. As he shakes his hand and asks him ""My boy, what is it that you want as your consolation prize?""

""Is it riches you seek?"" 

 Out of breath, the man replies ""NO""

""Surely you'd love my daughters hand in marriage"".

Again he replies ""NO""

The barman looks at him and says, ""Hang on! You're a duck.""

""I see your eyes are working,"" replies the duck.

""And you can talk!"" Exclaims the barman.

""I see your ears are working, too,"" Says the duck. 

""Now if you don't mind, can I have my beer and my sandwich please?""

""Certainly, sorry about that,"" Says the barman as he pulls the duck's pint.

""It's just we don't get many ducks in this pub.. What are you doing round this way?""

""I'm working on the building site across the road,"" Explains the duck. 

""I'm a plasterer.""

The flabbergasted barman cannot believe the duck and wants to learn more, but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it.

So, the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his sandwich, bids the barman good day and leaves.

The same thing happens for two weeks.

Then one day the circus comes to town.

The ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the barman says to him

""You're with the circus, aren't you? Well, I know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. He talks, drinks beer, eats sandwiches, reads the newspaper and everything!""

""Sounds marvelous,""says the ringmaster, handing over his business card. 

""Get him to give me a call.""

So the next day when the duck comes into the pub the barman says, ""Hey Mr. Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money.""

""I'm always looking for the next job,"" Says the duck.

""Where is it?""

""At the circus,"" Says the barman.

""The circus?"" Repeats the duck.

""That's right,"" Replies the barman.

""The circus?"" The duck asks again.

“”With the big tent?"" ""Yeah,"" the barman replies.

""With all the animals who live in cages, and performers who live in caravans?"" says the duck.

""Of course,"" the barman replies.

""And the tent has canvas sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?"" persists the duck.

""That's right!"" says the barman.

The duck shakes his head in amazement, and says...

There was this tramp  (""bum"" in the U.S.A ?).



One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard



a cry for help from a nearby lake.



He turned to see a little girl struggling in the broken ice in the middle



of the lake.  She'd been skating and had fallen into the icy water.



Without a moment's hesitation the tramp ran onto the ice and slipped and



slided over to the little girl.  He managed to pull her out without breaking



the ice further and he carried her back to the road.  He took off his coat



and wrapped the little girl in it and began looking for a car to flag down.



A few moments later a huge chauffeur-driven limo pulled up, and who stepped out



but the little girl's father - the mayor of the nearby town and a



multi-millionaire.



""How can I ever thank you sir?"" says the father after putting his daughter



into the warmth of the limo.  ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""



""Ahem, well ..."" stammered the tramp ""...eh I'm a little short of cash,



perhaps you could help me out""



""Certainly"" says the girl's father and he pulls out his wallet.



""Oh dear"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have



ten dollars - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe""



""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten dollars is more money than I've seen in



my whole life - that will be plenty"".



""Well, if you insist"" says the father - ""now what will you do with your



money?""



""Oh that's easy"" says the tramp ""I've not had a rest in 20 years.  I think I'll



buy myself a holiday (vacation)""



""Well good luck"" says the father, and he gets into the car and signals his



chauffeur to drive home.



""Ten Dollars"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich!  I'm rich!"", and off he goes



to the town, to buy himself a holiday.



He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes



up to the desk.  ""I'll have one holiday please!""



""Ahem, which holiday would sir like"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile



""Oh, any holiday I don't mind"" replied the tramp.



""Well how much money does sir have to spend on sir's holiday?""



""Oh lots - anything up to ten dollars""



""TEN DOLLARS!!  You'll *never* get a holiday for ten dollars"" says the girl



incredulously.



""Oh dear"" said the tramp, ""and I was so looking forward to a holiday - I'll



probably never get another chance - isn't there anything you can do?""



""Well I don't think so sir, but hold on and I'll check""



The girl goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest



filing drawers she can find.  There - to her amazement - she finds an old



file.



""Well you'll never believe it"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop.



""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class



round the world cruise - and it costs ten dollars""



""Yippee"", exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it""



The tramp takes the tickets and, shouldering his dirty old pack, he heads



out the door to hitch-hike to the port where the ship is waiting.



*************************



A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the



most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-



going liner he has ever seen.



Amazed at his luck and good fortune, he slings his pack over his shoulder,



and marches up the gangplank.



""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms



down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.



""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""Super-duper, ultra-hyper,



mega-economy class, and I want on!""



Hardly believeing his eyes, the captain examines the ticket and admits that



our man the tramp is correct.



""Ahem, well O.K."", says the captain, ""But you can't come on just now,



I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you.  Come back at midnight



when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""



So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the



dockside, and he falls asleep.



""Psst"", says a voice, waking him with a start.  It was the captain.



""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin""



The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway,



and onto the ship - and what a ship!



The tramp had *never* in his wildest dreams imagined luxury like this.



First they went doen through the first class level:



Oriental carpets - 6"" pile.



A genuine Rembrahndt on every wall.



Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair.



24 ct gold trim everywhere.



Then the second class:



As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep.



and so on...



3rd, 4th, 5th class,



.



.



.



.



down past the casinos,



.



.



.



.



and the ballrooms,



.



.



.



.



down through the crew's quarters,



.



.



.



.



down through the galleys, and the engine rooms,



.



.



.



.



 until finally,



.



.



at the lowest point in the ship,



against the very hull,



.



.



the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with



a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.



""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""



""I'm glad you like it"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing...""



""Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship,



at night - when all the other passengers are asleep.  So that's what the



alarm clock is for.  Enjoy your cruise.""



Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time.  Sleeping



by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it.



One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...



Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd



have a go on the diving board of the pool.  He had just enough time for



one dive before he had to go below.



He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived....



...and what a dive...!



Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.



Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old



tramp - was standing watching this.



""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like



that?""



""Eh, well I've never actually dived before"" replied the tramp.



""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen ....""&gt;



He broke off.



""Hey, I've an idea"", he started again.



""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the



other passengers.  I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first



class!""



""It's a deal!"" says our man.



For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced.



Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it



he tried it.



Then one morning the captain came to talk.



""O.K. I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days.  We're



going to erect a high diving board for you.""



""O.K."" agreed the tramp.



Two days passed, and the big day arrived.  The ship was humming with



excitement.  Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver.



The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks



and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck.



Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe.



Then the tramp turned to regard the diving board.



Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column



of metal.



""Well tramp"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do.""



And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie.



And the tramp began to climb....



up and up ...



up and up ...



higher and higher ...



below him the ship grew smaller ...



up and up ...



on and on ...



past a solitary albatross ...



and still higher, till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below ...



on



and on



.



.



.



.



still further, till the ocean grew dim, and the earth itself began



to shrink...



and higher, ever higher ...



on and on ....



past our moon ...



and on ...



and mars ...



and on ...



higher, and higher , through the asteroid belt,



and on and on towards the diving board,



... past the outer planets, until...



... finally ...



... on the outermost reaches of the Solar System ...



... he reached the board.



He climbed on top and radioed the captain .... and then...



               .



             .' '.



            .     .



           .       .



he jumped .         .



                     .



                     .



                     .



                     .



                     :



slowly at first      :



but speeding up      :



                     :



                     :



                     :



faster, and faster



speeding past Pluto



and the other outer planets



 .



 .



 .



 .



 .



through the asteroid belt:



 .



  .



.



  .



   .



  .



 .



past Mars,



and the moon,



faster,



and faster,



faster - ever faster,



and by now the earth was growing large in the distance,



the oceans and land masses grew clear,



faster, and faster...



past the albatross,



faster



.



.



.



double-back somersault,



.



.



.



and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,



.



.



.



hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,



Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,



""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!""



The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...



NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!



DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!



SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!



DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!



SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!



DOWN!



DOWN!



THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!



THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!



SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!



AND DOWN THROUGH THE STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!



STILL DOWN...!



.



.



.



.



DEEPER,



.



.



DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,



.



..



...



.......



TILL..........



.



.



SMASH!  into into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.



Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam



frantically for the surface.



Up and up, desperate, gasping....



Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng



wild with acclaim.



HERO!  WONDERFUL!  AMAZING!  BLOODY GOOD SHOW WHAT!



And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over



the crowd.



""Well tramp, I have *NEVER* seen anything like that, *EVER*.



That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen""



The tramp blushed.



The captain went on:



""But tell me; most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this



boat after you dived - how did you do it.""



And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly:



""Well you see....



....I'm a poor tramp...



...so you must understand ...



... I've been through many a hardship in my life""

The  crowd murmurs their approval. The man stands up on the bar, drops his  trousers, and places his privates in the alligator's open mouth. The  gator closes his mouth as the crowd gasps. After a minute, the man grabs  a beer bottle and raps the alligator hard on the top its head. The  gator opens his mouth, and the man removes his genitals, unscathed, as  promised. The crowd cheers, and he receives the first of his free  drinks.  


The man stands up again and makes another offer: ""I'll pay anyone $100 who's willing to give it a try.""  


A hush falls over the crowd. A moment later, a hand goes up in the back of the bar.

It says Sisters of Mercy House of Prostitution 10 Miles. He thinks it was just a figment of his imagination and drives on without a second thought. Soon, he sees another sign which says Sisters of Mercy House of Prostitution 5 Miles and realizes that these signs are for real. When he drives past a third sign saying Sisters of Mercy House of Prostitution Next Right, his curiosity gets the best of him and he pulls into the drive.  


On the far side of the parking lot is a somber stone building with a small sign next to the door reading SISTERS OF MERCY. He climbs the steps and rings the bell. The door is answered by a nun in a long black habit who asks ""What may we do for you, my son?"" He answers ""I saw your signs along the highway, and was interested in possibly doing business.""  


""Very well, my son. Please follow me."" He is led through many winding passages and is soon quite disoriented. The nun stops at a closed door,and tells the man ""Please knock on this door.""

He wanted something light hearted because he’d been under a lot of stress. An aide recommended Rush Hour and the President chortled and laughed throughout the film, much to the aides delight. 

When it was over, the President said he wanted to meet Jackie Chan. Confused, the Presidents aides nonetheless did as instructed. Jackie Chan’s agents were surprised and asked Jackie if he’d like to meet the President of the United States.

Jackie said yes and a date was set. 

The following week, President Trump met Jackie at the White House. After a brief photo op, the two sat down to lunch. 

Jackie started a conversation, thanking the President for the invitation. He told the President he was delighted to be there, but confused about why he had been invited. 

The President just smiled and said, “Jackie, I recently watched a movie you were in: Rush Hour. And you were great! Just great! I haven’t laughed that hard in a long time!”

“Thank you, Mr. President,” Jackie replied. “Though I did that movie long time ago, I remember it well. Working with Chris Tucker was a wonderful experience. I have him to thank for how well our scenes went together. You invite me to America because of this movie?”

“No, Jackie,” the President told him as lunch was served. “The reason I invited you is because you’re well known, well liked, and I think you would be an excellent spokesperson for me! From what I saw of your performance, I think you’re the perfect man for my idea.”

Jackie Chan was even more confused. “How?”

When I arrived at the shops, I was pleased to see there were only 30 or so people in front of me in line and figured I’d have no problem making my flight.  However, every transaction took an abnormally long time.  The patrons would get to the front of the line, then hem and haw for ages before placing their order.  It was unbelievable because there weren’t even that many options to choose from. 

After almost three hours, I was still a good 5 people from the front of the line.  “This is outrageous!” I exclaimed.

“Are you in a hurry?” the man in front of me in line asked with a pleasant Spanish accent. 

“I am. I had given myself three hours to catch my flight, but now it looks like I’m not going to make it.” I replied.

""Yeah. I've had an outstanding hearing since I was born, but it didn't really matter until that night. 

I was sitting in some public toilet, taking a shit. Suddenly, a demon appeared right in my cabin. He was looking like a giant nightmare dog. Glowing red eyes, razor sharp teeth, that kind of stuff. I was sitting there speechless, and then he started talking.

He said that according to some demon code he can't leave me unharmed now that i've seen him. But its not really my fault, so he will play a game with me. If I can guess the exact moment next person in this toilet relieve itself, he will set me free. If I fail though, he will bite off my hand.

I didn't really had a choise, but he knew nothing of my excellent hearing either. So, as he commanded, I put my hand between his teeth and started listening. Soon enough, I heard some shit splashing the water. Right away, I said to the demon, that this is the moment. He was impressed, if I could tell by looking at a dog face. As he promised, he agreed to set me free. 

But before that, he offered me another game. If I managed to do it again, I would get ten thousand dollars. I was a poor student back then. I hesitated for a moment, then put my hand back in his mouth. Tension was unbeliavable, but I heard shit hit the water and did it once again. 

Demon looked unsatisfied. This time he offered me a billion. I knew I could do it, it was not even that hard this time. A splash, and the billion is right in my hands.

Demon was losing his mind. He said he wanted to play big this time. He offered me an eternal life, but in exchange he wanted something more valuable than just a hand. I thought for a moment, took a deep breath and put a tip of my enis between his teeth.""

I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

Here's the joke I told:

""What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.""

One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said ""I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?""

The two were always getting into trouble and their parents could be assured that if any mischief occurred in their town their two young sons were in some way involved. The parents were at their wits end as to what to do about their sons’ behavior. One day, the mother heard of a clergyman in town that has been successful in disciplining children in the past, and asked for his help.

The clergyman agreed to speak with the boys, but asked to see them individually. The 8-year-old went to meet with him first. The clergyman sat the boy down and asked him sternly, “Where is God?” The boy made no response, so the clergyman repeated the question in an even sterner tone, “Where is God?”

Again the boy made no attempt to answer, so the clergyman raised his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy’s face, “WHERE IS GOD?”

At that the boy bolted from the room and ran directly home, slamming himself in his closet. His older brother followed him into the closet and said, “What happened?”

The younger brother replied, “We are in BIG trouble now… They can’t find God and they’re blaming it on us!”",Two Little Troublemakers,7

A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next door neighbour. Before she says a word, Bob says, “I’ll give you $800 to drop that towel.” After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob.

After a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,…

“Who was that?” “It was Bob the next door neighbour,” she replies. “Great!” the husband says, “Did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?”

*Moral of the story:*

If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lesson 2:**

A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, “I’ll give each of you just one wish” “Me first! Me first!” says the administration clerk. “I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.” Poof! She’s gone. “Me next! Me next!” says the sales rep. “I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life.” Poof! He’s gone. “OK, you’re up,” the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, “I want those two back in the office after lunch.”

*Moral of the story:*

Always let your boss have the first say

&amp;nbsp;

**Lesson 3:**

A priest offered a lift to a Nun. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said,”Father, remember Psalm 129?” The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again said, “Father, remember Psalm 129?” The priest apologized “Sorry sister but the flesh is weak.” Arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, “Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.”

*Moral of the story:*

If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity

&amp;nbsp;

**Lesson 4**

A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A rabbit asked him, ”Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day long?” The crow answered: “Sure, why not.” So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.

A fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.

*Moral of the story:*

To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very high up

&amp;nbsp;

**Lesson 5:**

Power of Charisma

A turkey was chatting with a bull “I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,” sighed the turkey, but I haven’t got the energy.” “Well, why don’t you nibble on my droppings?” replied the bull. “They’re packed with nutrients.” The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.

*Moral of the story:*

Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there

&amp;nbsp;

**Lesson 6**

A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.

*Moral of the story:*

1. Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy

2. Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend

3. And when you’re in deep shit, it’s best to keep your mouth shut!

&amp;nbsp;

Edit:

1. Thanks for the Platinum/Gold/Silver kind strangers. This is my first time getting each of these and it happened in a single post.

2. To all those people saying this is very old, yes, I did pull this out of my stash from 2012. So it is guaranteed older than that. But I have not seen it on reddit so thought of posting it.

The smell of food from your kitchen is amazing, would I be able to have dinner here tonight for free?'

Moved though he is, the maitre d' replies that he is sorry and he can't give out free food. 'But', replies the man, 'what if I show you something truly incredible - something you've never seen before'. Curious at the originality of the offer the maitre d' agrees, at which point the homeless man pulls out a tiny hamster and a miniature piano and places them on his hand. At a nod the hamster sits at the instrument and starts to play. Amazed, and being a man of his word, the maitre d' ushers the homeless man inside and takes his order. 

Half way through the meal the homeless man beckons the maitre d' over and says 'this food is delicious, but what would go really well with it would be a bottle of wine - would you indulge me if I were to show you another truly incredible spectacle?'. Assured of the man's ability to produce the remarkable the maitre d' agrees and the homeless man pulls out the hamster and piano from one pocket and from the other a small frog. The hamster sits at the piano and starts up a tune, at which point the frog bursts into song. 

The performance lasts a few minutes and by the end the maitre d' is rushing off to grab the most expensive bottle he can find for the homeless man. While he is away from the table a rich businessman leans over and says to the homeless man 'That was the most amazing thing I've ever seen! I'll give you £100,000 for the pair of them'. The homeless man furrows his brow in thought and though he looks tempted he eventually says to the businessman 'I'm sorry, that's a lot of money but these amazing creatures are my livelihood - I simply can't part with them'. Not to be deterred the businessman replies 'Okay I understand - but what about £200,000 for just the frog?' Considering the offer the homeless man agrees, they make the exchange and the businessman leaves. Upon returning to the table and hearing of the deal the maitre d' is incredulous. 'Why did you make this deal sir? A talking frog is totally unheard of - you could have made millions from it! What on earth compelled you to part with it. Finishing his meal the homeless man stands up and says to the maitre d' - 'Oh don't worry, the hamster's a ventriloquist'

The class remains quiet, then little Eddy raises his hand and says ""Madam, I know"".

The teacher says, ""OK Eddy, please explain.""

Eddy: ""Well, first before anything you need a permit from the city for the construction project to begin, that could take months. Once you get the permit, then come the bulldozers to basically dig into the earth to create the foundation. Then, cement is poured into the foundation and pylons are inserted. Around the pylons, the outer structure of the building is made, floors, walls, ceilings.Then comes wiring and plumbing. Next drywall can be installed along with flooring and fixtures. When all is said and done, you still have to get an occupancy permit from the city before you can actually use the building.

The class remains quiet.

The teacher says: ""WOW Eddy! Bravo, that was amazing, how did you learn all that?""

Eddy: ""For the past many months, just a few doors down from our house, they have been building what I think is a huge whore house, I've watched the whole thing from start to finish.""

At that moment, all the girls suddenly get up and start to walk out.

Eddy looks around and says:
