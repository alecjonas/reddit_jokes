post,eaeuyp,2qh72,jokes,false,1576295616,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/eaeuyp/all_was_lost_almost/,self.jokes,," A nun and a priest were crossing the Sahara desert on a camel. On the  third day out, the camel suddenly dropped dead without warning.  
 

After dusting themselves off, the Nun and the Priest surveyed their situation. After a long period of silence, the Priest spoke.  
 

'Well, Sister, this looks pretty grim.'  
 

'I know, Father. In fact, I don't think it likely that we can survive more than a day or two..'  
 

'I agree,' says the Father. 'Sister, since we are unlikely to make it out of here alive, would you do something for me?'  
 

'Anything, Father.'  
 

'I have never seen a woman's breasts and I was wondering if I might see yours.'  
 

'Well, under the circumstances I don't see that it would do any harm.'  
 

The Nun opened her habit and the Priest enjoyed the sight of her shapely breasts, commenting frequently on their beauty.  
 

'Father, could I ask something of you?'  
 

'Yes, Sister?'  
 

'I have never seen a man's penis. Could I see yours?'  
 

'I suppose that would be OK,' the Priest replied, lifted his robe, and almost immediately he was sporting a huge erection.  
 

'Sister, you know that if I insert this in the right place, it can give life.'  
 

'Is that true Father?'  
 

'Yes, it is, Sister.'  
 

'Oh Father, that's wonderful ... stick it in the camel and let's get the f\*\*k out of here!'",All was lost - Almost,3

A drunkard with a ragged, dirty look came in to apply for the position.  The director of the winery wondered how to send him away. He gave him a  glass to drink.  
 

The drunk tried it and said, “It's a Muscat, three years old, grown on a north slope, matured in steel containers. Low grade, but acceptable.”  
 

""That's correct"", said the boss. Another glass...  
 

“This is a Cabernet, eight years old, a south-western slope, oak  barrels, matured at 8 degrees. Requires three more years for finest  results.”  
 

""Correct."" A third glass... ""It's a Pinot Blanc Champagne, high grade and exclusive,'' the drunk said calmly.  
 

The director was astonished. He winked at his secretary, secretly  suggesting something. She left the room, and came back in with a glass  of urine.

Their sergeant gathered them all together and laid out some rules. The soldiers were to go out on their horse, drink and have fun at the small village nearby, and return exactly by midnight. The soldiers were excited to have a night out, so they got on their horses and went on their way.


As midnight was nearing, the sergeant waited outside of the tent, looking to see if his soldiers has actually listened to what he had told them before. Midnight came, and no soldier was to be seen. 


When 00:15 rolled around, the first soldier returned to the sergeant, on foot, with his horse nowhere to be found. ""Soldier, why is it that you are 15 minutes too late?"" The sergeant asked the soldier. ""You're never gonna believe this, Sir. Midnight was nearing so I got on my horse and went on my way here, but what do you say, when I almost arrive back, the horse just dropped dead in the middle of the road! And without my horse, there's no way I could have made it back in time!"" 


""Hm, well alright than, but off to sleep now."" The sergeant grumbled. And the soldier did as told. 


00:30 rolled around and the second soldier returned to the sergeant, on foot, with his horse nowhere to be found. ""And you, Soldier, why is it that you are 30 minutes too late?"" The sergeant asked the soldier. ""You're never gonna believe this, Sir. I got on my horse and went on my way here, but what do you say, when I almost arrive back, the horse just dropped dead in the middle of the road! And without my horse, there's no way I could have made it back in time!"" 


""Hm, well alright than, but off to sleep now."" The sergeant grumbled. And the soldier did as told. 


00:45 rolled around and the third soldier returned to the sergeant, on foot, with his horse nowhere to be found. ""And you, Soldier, why is it that you are 45 minutes too late?"" The sergeant asked the soldier. ""You're never gonna believe this, Sir. I got on my horse and went on my way here, but what do you say, when I almost arrive back, the horse just dropped dead in the middle of the road! And without my horse, there's no way I could have made it back in time!"" 


""Hm, well alright than, but off to sleep now."" The sergeant grumbled. And the soldier did as told. 


01:00 rolled around, the sergeant was getting impatient when the fourth soldier returned to the sergeant, on foot, with his horse nowhere to be found. ""And you, Soldier, why is it that you are an hour too late?"" The sergeant asked the soldier. ""You're never gonna believe this, Sir. I got on my horse and went on my way here, but what do you say, when I almost arrive back, the horse just dropped dead in the middle of the road! And without my horse, there's no way I could have made it back in time!"" 


""Hm, well alright than, but off to sleep now."" The sergeant grumbled. And the soldier did as told. 


2:00 rolled around and the fifth soldier returned to the sergeant, on foot, with his horse nowhere to be found.


The sergeant, getting highly annoyed by the soldier's late return, spoke up. ""Let me guess, you were on your way back, all was fine and well, and your horse just dropped dead?"" 


""Well, you're never going to believe this, Sir. I was on my way back and I was going to make it in time, but when I'm almost back here, what do you say, I couldn't go through because there was a pile of dead horses right in the middle of the road!""",The only joke my dad ever tells us,3

He sees a group of rough rider lookin' scoundrels playing poker and he musters up enough courage to sit down with 'em (thinkin' he might get a story out if he was lucky). ""Mind if I play?""

The others look up with a scowl that would curdle milk, but one looks at the clock and shakes his head. He points out the time to the others and they gather up their chips and go. ""Play alone, we're a-leavin'. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""

The writer is confused, but smells a story brewing; a strong one at that. He hoofs it up to the bar, passing most other patrons on their way out, and slaps a whole dollar bill on the table, ""Barkeep, give me a beer and a story, and you can keep the change.""

After taking a quick glance at the clock, the bartender shakes his head, pours the beer, and pushes the bill back to the reporter. ""The drink is on the house, but I suggest you drink it quick and leave. Wild Bill is coming to town."" Without another word the 'tender puts his last glass away and walks right out the swinging doors, leaving the man in an empty bar.

Now fear in his gut tears at him as he hears the emptiness in that bar. This emptiness seems to seep in as he realizes that he's about to be the last man in this town, alone with only the sound of that ticking clock to keep him company. Still, a story of this caliber must be worth something; so he waits...

Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, Bong&lt;CRACK!&gt;- Just as the clock strikes the first chime of twelve, a sound like thunder splitting a mountain is heard outside. The reporter runs to the doors to see what it is. In the distance and closing fast is a tornado coming right for the bar. The reporter hits the ground and watches as the tornado comes up to the bar and stops.

The wind settles and there is a giant of a man riding a grizzly bear. He steps off the bear, and instead of hitching it, he punches the great beast right in the face &lt;WHAM!&gt;, knocking it cold on the ground.

The writer is so scared he runs back into the bar and dives behind the counter, sure that this is the last of his days. &lt;KaPLOW!&gt; the giant kicks in the saloon doors, and they turn to splinters that imbed themselves into the walls and break bottles and glasses that they touch.

The beast of a man walks up to the bar, breaking every floor board with each thundering step. He looks down at the writer and slams his fist on the bar, cracking it down the middle, ""GIMME A DRINK!""

The writer comes up, shakily holding out two bottles of whisky; which the giant snatches up, chews the glass tops off of, and drinks down as fast as the amber liquid can spill from the bottles. He throws both bottles in the air, whips out his six-shooter and fires off a round. The single bullet rips through both bottles showering the frightened writer with shards that rain down.

Regretting his curiosity and repenting of his life, the writer stands on weakened legs and whimpers out, ""W-w-w-would y-you like a-another drink?""

The Goliath turns to him, fire in his eyes, then glances at the clock... ""Nah, I gotta go. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""",An old dime store novel writer walks into a saloon...,9

The post office workers, heartbroken, pool in what they can, and buy the boy a hat and a scarf. Unfortunately, they couldn't collect enough for mittens. They send the gifts to the orphanage.

Two weeks later, as they come back to work after Christmas, they find another letter with the same, familiar handwriting.

""Dear Santa,

Thank you very much for your gifts. I received the hat and the scarf. I didn't get any mittens though. Must be those thieving assholes at the post office"".",Post office workers are going through the mail and find a letter addressed simply To Santa,16

This man would go up to them and start to stomp and clap a beat for them. Most of the time the musicians would enjoy and encourage the assistance. 

One day when this man was off doing his thing, a talent agent who happened to be commuting through the same metro station heard this man’s percussive assistance and had a brilliant idea.

The talent agent realized that his clients, as good as they were with singing lacked a steady rhythm. So the talent agent decided to try to hire this man who had a gift for rhythm.

The agent approached the little man and asked him, “ Hello sir, I represent a certain talent agency that works with famous singers, and I couldn’t stop my self from hearing your rhythmical talents. I was wondering if you would want to come and work for me assisting famous singers maintain a solid beat?”
 
The little man replies with delight, “Boy, I’d love too!”

So the farmer took Henry back to the farm. Before setting him loose in the hen house though, he gave Henry a little pep talk. ""Henry"", he said, ""I'm counting on you to do your stuff."" And without a word, Henry then strutted into the hen house.
Henry was as fast as he was furious, mounting each hen like a thunderbolt. There was much squawking and many feathers flying, till Henry had finished having his way with each hen. But Henry didn't stop there, he went in to the barn and mounted all the horses, one by one and still at the same frantic pace. Then he went to the pig house where he did the same.
The farmer, watching all of this with disbelief, cried out, ""Stop, Henry, you'll kill yourself."" But Henry continued, seeking out each farm animal in the same manner.
Well the next morning, the farmer looked out and saw Henry lying there on his lawn. His legs were up in the air, his eyes rolled back, and his long tongue hanging out. A buzzard was already circling above Henry.
The farmer walked up to Henry saying, ""Oh you poor thing, look what you did, you've gone and killed yourself. I warned you big buddy.""

At the second house they presented him with a box of fine imported cigars.
The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.
At each of the houses along his route, he was met with congratulations, farewells, cards, and gifts of all types and values.
At the final house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful young blonde in a revealing negligee. She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door (which she closed behind him), and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where they had a most passionate liaison.
Afterwards, they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice.
When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge.
""All this was just too wonderful for words,"" he said, "".....but what's the dollar for?""
""Well,"" she said, ""Last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you?""
He said, ""...Scr*w him .........give him a dollar.""
The blonde then blushed and said, ""....But the breakfast was my idea.""",It was the mailman's last day on the job after 35 years of carrying the mail through all kinds of weather to the same neighborhood.,632

In response, Socrates said ""Surely I'm not, for there's so much about this world that I don't know. I know not the meaning of life nor truth nor purpose, and so much more. Please, Oracle, let me find the true wisest man and bring them to you.""

He set out about questioning everybody and anybody, searching for a wise man who had the answers he so sought. He went to the fish monger, to the politican, to the soilder and to the baker.

In the end, they all had answers to the meaning of life and truth and purpose. Family, legacy, honor, money.

But there was no one answer. No universal, agreed upon idea. Socrates returned to the Oracle of Delphi, hanging his head in shame and defeat. ""I've found nobody with a proper answer, and I have no answer myself, for I am clueless and know nothing of the vast truth that lies beyond my comprehension or understanding.""

After looking for several days, he hadn't found anyone willing to do it. Discouraged, he went home and got on his computer to cancel his flight/hotel. Right before he canceled them, he heard a knock at the door. He got up, went to the door, and when he opened it, his jaw dropped. In front of him, was a man who had no arms. 

Surprised, he asked ""Can I help you""?

""I'd like the bell tower job please""

""Um, not to be rude or anything, but because of your disability, how are you going to ring the bell""?

""No, I can do it, I swear. Tomorrow, come to the bell tower and I'll show you!""

""Okay, I guess""

Confused, the man went to sleep, wondering how on earth this armless man intended to ring the bell each hour. He woke up early in the morning, and went down to the bell tower. He climbed to the top, and the man was waiting for him. 

""Well""?

The man ran as fast as he could toward the bell, and jumped up and hit the bell with his face. It rung as if it had been done by someone with actual arms. 

""Wow, if that really doesn't hurt, you can have the job, thank you!""

The next day, the man went on vacation. He enjoyed a week at the beach, knowing his job was taken care of. After a week, he traveled home, arriving late at night. He crawled into his bed, but woke up the next morning to strong banging on the door. When he opened it, there was two police officers standing there.

""Can I help you officers""?

""A man was found dead on the ground near your bell tower. It looks like he fell from the top. We would like you to come and see if you can identify the body.""

The man got into the police car and drove to the bell tower. He got out and walked over to the body.

When four of Santa's elves got sick, the trainee elves did not produce toys as fast as the regular ones, and Santa began to feel the pre-Christmas pressure.

Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her Mother was coming to visit, which stressed Santa even more.
When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two others had jumped the fence and were out, Heaven knows where.

Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all the toys were scattered.

Frustrated, Santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor.

In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor.

He went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom.
Just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated Santa marched to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big Christmas tree.

The angel said very cheerfully, ""Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn't this a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?""

And thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the Christmas tree.

That night, the Jewish Rabbis gathered in the synagogue to decide who will debate against the Pope. However none of the Rabbis wanted to debate against him, so they started arguing. The synagogue janitor, who was attracted to the commotion, volunteered to oppose the Pope. 

""You are just a janitor, how could you possibly win in a debate against the pope?"" said the chief Rabbi. But since nobody else was brave enough to volunteer, the janitor was chosen.

On the day of the debate, the Pope walked onto the stage with his advisers, all dressed in white and wearing golden crosses. The janitor also walked onto the stage, surrounded by the oldest Rabbi with their long beards and black garments. The debate began.

The Pope immediately pointed at the janitor and then at the sky. Without hesitation, the janitor pointed at the ground beneath his feet. The Pope then pointed at the janitor with his finger, and the janitor responded by pointing three fingers at the Pope. Next, the pope took out an apple from his pocket and held it in the air. The janitor reached into a paper bag at his waist, and took out a flatbread. The Pope looked surprised, and announced that they would not expel the Jews.

Back at the cathedral, the Pope's advisers asked the Pope,""Father, the exchange during the debate was too difficult for us to follow, please explain what happened.""

The Pope replied: ""I first pointed at the heavens and the earth, indicating God's marvelous creations. But the Jew pointed at the ground, telling me that hell exist too. I then pointed at him with one finger, telling him that only one God exists. But the Jew countered that by pointing three fingers at me, acknowledging the holy trinity. I then abandoned theology for science, and held out an apple, showing how people think the earth is round even though the scriptures state the earth to be flat. The Jew held out a flatbread, acknowledging that the earth is flat as the scriptures teach. I could not find fault with his argument so I withdrew.""

In the synagogue, the janitor also had to explain what happened during the debate.

""So he points at me as if to tell me to get out, but I want to stay right here, so I point at the ground. He then points one finger at me to curse me to death, so I point three fingers at him to curse him three times. Then he brings out his lunch, so I bring out mine.""","In medieval times in Rome, the Pope, influenced by some conservative advisers, decided to expel all Jews from the city",7

As we strolled into the pub I said I’d get the first round in and walked to the bar to order. As I approached the bar I thought this is strange... the barman was a donkey?? However he must be capable as he’d been given the job, so I thought ho-hum and went ahead and ordered.
‘One pint of Carling please’ (for John) ‘and I’ll go for the best bitter please’. The donkey sort of waved his hoof in acknowledgment (obviously he struggled to give a thumbs up) and started pouring the Carling. Due to his lack of opposable thumbs he couldn’t tilt the glass and the head was enormous and it took for ever to pour. I advised that perhaps it was best to start pouring the bitter whilst he waited for the Carling to settle to pour the rest, so off he trotted to get another glass and began pouring the second drink. As the glass was still a bit wet he managed to drop it cause he didn’t have handy fingers so had to grab another.
He flicked from one to the other slowly topping them up until they were both full and settled. The donkey then awkwardly gathered them in his hooves and put them on the bar - ‘eeyore’.",It was Friday afternoon and I called a friend of mine to see if he fancied going to the pub for a swift half.,3

The fox, slightly embarrassed of his smoking habit now that the rabbit made such a fuss, decides ""What the hell. Maybe you're right. Okay fuck this stuff, let's go for a run!"" And rips the paper and throws the weed away, and they both take off on their run.

A bit farther down the path, they run into a deer. When they get closer, they notice the deer is in the process of rolling up a joint. Instantly the rabbit stops in front of the deer.

""Hey deer! What you doing bro? Getting high? You're wasting your life away! Come with us. Let's go for a run instead! Running is healthy, and there's no better feeling than health!""

The deer, nervous from being called out by his peers, and not wanting to be the only loser using drugs, decides ""You guys are right. What's the point? This is a habit I need to kick!"" And rips the paper and throws the weed away, and the three take off on their run.

A bit farther down the path, they run into a squirrel, in his tiny little hands is a tiny little paper and a tiny amount of weed, in the process of being rolled into a tiny little joint. The rabbit, being at the front of the group, stops right in front of the squirrel.

""Hey squirrel! What you doing bro? Drugs again? Aren't you bored of the same old shit? Come with us, bro. Let's go for a run instead! Running is healthy, and there's no better feeling than health!""

The squirrel, being a friend of the deer and the fox, and painfully aware that he usually gets invitations from them to smoke and he never returns the favor, curses his own selfishness and decides ""You guys are right. This isn't who I want to be. Enough of this!"" And rips the tiny paper and throws the bit of weed away, and the four take off on their run.

A bit further down the path, as they get closer to a clearing, they start to smell the stench of Marijuana. When they arrive at the clearing they see a monkey with a bong in his hand letting out a massive cloud of smoke, and when he notices the rabbit, he immediately starts giggling.

As Nate sat there, in the middle of the road, pondering the urgency created by using three exclamation points on the sign, there came a car speeding down the road.
At the wheel of the car was a blue-haired little old lady, and next to her, in the passenger seat, sat her equally blue-haired old lady friend.
The driver was speeding, and could barely see over the steering wheel.
So, there Nate sat, pondering the sign.
And onward drove the old ladies, speeding down the road toward Nate and this world-ending lever in the middle of the road.
Much too late, the old lady who was driving (again, at reckless speeds), saw the snake, and saw the lever with the sign on it.
She had only a split second to make her choice: Would she hit the snake, or would she end the world?
At the last second, she swerved, and hit the snake, killing him.
She turned to her old lady friend, whose mouth was agape at what had just happened.
The driver just shrugged.

God answered, “It is done.” All the mice had beautiful little roller-skates.

Benson runs a nail factory and decides his business needs a bit of advertising. He has a chat with a friend who works in marketing and he offers to make a TV ad for Benson's Nails.

""Give me a week,"" says the friend, ""and I'll be back with an ad.""

A week goes by and the marketing executive comes to see Benson. He opens his laptop and presses play. A Roman soldier is busy nailing Jesus to the cross. He turns to face the camera and says with a grin ""Use Benson's Nails, they'll hold anything.""

Benson goes mad shouting: ""What is the matter with you? They'll never show that on TV. Give it another try, but no more Romans crucifying Jesus!""

Another week goes by and the marketing man comes back to see Benson with another ad. He turns his laptop around and hits play. This time the camera pans out from a Roman standing with his arms folded to show Jesus on the cross. The Roman looks up at him and says 'Benson's Nails, they'll hold anything'.

Benson is beside himself. ""You don't understand: I don't want *anything* with Jesus on the cross! Now listen, I'll give you one last chance. Come back in a week with an advertisement that I can broadcast.""

A week passes and Benson waits impatiently. The marketing executive arrives and puts on the new video. A naked man with long hair, gasping for breath, is running across a field. About a dozen Roman soldiers come over the hill, hot on his trail. One of them stops, turns to camera and says 'If only we had used Benson's Nails!'.",TV ad for Benson's Nails,207

""My name is Amy. I was sitting in the waiting room for my first appointment with a new dentist.

I noticed his BDS degree on the wall, which bore his full name.

Suddenly, I remembered a tall , handsome, dark-haired boy with the same name had been in my high school class some 25-odd years ago.

Could he be the same guy that I had a secret crush on, way back then?

Upon seeing him, however, I quickly discarded any such thought. This balding, gray-haired man with the deeply lined face was way too old to have been my classmate.

After he examined my teeth, I asked him if he had attended St Xavier's high school.

""Yes. yes, I did.' he gleamed with pride.

""When did you graduate?"" I asked.

He answered, ""In 1987. Why do you ask?""

""You were in my class!!!!"", I exclaimed.

""You have tennis elbow.""

Well that's bullshit, thinks Kevin, I don't even play tennis! So he decides to test the machine. 

He heads home and has his wife pee in a cup. He collects some of his daughter's saliva, some of his dog's shit, and to top it off, he jacks off into the cup. He heads back down to the drug store with this mix and another $10, and inserts it into the machine.

So she did - He didn't - They did it.

A couple of hours later, she repeats the process - he is still passed out - they repeat the pairing. Then Just before dawn the wife wants one more ride. So she reaches over and plucks a third ass hair!

While she was out, they went to the museum, attended a wedding (the reason for the trip), and went to see a movie, Frozen 2, as long as she promised not to spoil it for our family. 

When she got back after her weekend, it seemed that being away from her younger siblings made their existence that much more annoying. 

It seemed like nothing they did was right. 

“Stop screaming!” she screamed at them. 

“Get our of my room!” she’d yell, even though the second bathroom was in there and needed. 

“Go to bed!” they’d hear just a second after stepping out of their room to use the restroom. 

Finally tired of hearing her repeatedly verbally assault her sisters, even after telling her to stop after each incident, I told her, “Elsa, you’ve gotta stop.”
