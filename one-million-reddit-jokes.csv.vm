post,3hird7,2qh72,jokes,false,1439945018,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3hird7/new_sales_job/,self.jokes,,"A young guy from North Dakota moves to Florida and goes to a big ""everything
under one roof"" department store looking for a job.

The Manager says, ""Do you have any sales experience?""

The kid says ""Yeah. I was a vacuum salesman back in North Dakota.""

Well, the boss was unsure, but he liked the kid and figured he'd give him a
shot, so he gave him the job.

""You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did.""

His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. 

After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor. 

""How many customers bought something from you today?""

The kid frowns and looks at the floor and mutters, ""One.""

The boss says ""Just one ?!!? Our sales people average sales to 20 to 30
customers a day. 

That will have to change, and soon, if you'd like to continue your
employment here. 

We have very strict standards for our sales force here in Florida. 

One sale a day might have been acceptable in North Dakota, but you're not on
the farm anymore, son.""

The kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss
felt kind of bad for chewing him out on his first day. 

He asked (semi-sarcastically), ""So, how much was your one sale for?""

The kid looks up at his boss and says ""$101,237.65.""

The boss, astonished, says $101,237.65?!? What the heck did you sell?""

The kid says, ""Well, first, I sold him some new fish hooks. Then I sold him
a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. Then I asked him where he was
going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need
a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine
Chris Craft.

 Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him
down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 Expedition.""

The boss said ""A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat
and a TRUCK!?""

The kid said ""No, the guy came in here to buy tampons for his wife, and I
said, 'Dude, your weekend's shot, you should go fishing.'",New sales job!,280

When suddenly he sees a brown cub in the distance. He aims at it, shoots it, and wounds it. He gets closer for the coup de grace, when he feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around. It's the father of the bear. Heâs obviously not pleased. The big brown bear tells him:

""Francis, either I kill you, either I fuck you in the ass"". 

Francis is confused as to how a bear can speak, and even know his name! Nonetheless he choses life, and what happens, happens. After that, he obviously needs to go to the hospital and to take a few days to recover. His ass hurts really bad. But he's alive, and he decides to go back to the forest to get his revenge. He tracks down the brown bear for days, and finally sees it in the distance. He aims, shoots, and wounds it. He gets closer for the coup de grace, when, once again, he feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around. It's a grizzly bear. Heâs obviously not pleased. The grizzly bear tells him:

""Francis, you know the drill. Either I kill you, either I fuck you in the ass"". 

Once again Francis has to choose life over death, but this time itâs really bad. He ends up needing stitches, weeks of recovery; itâs a real mess. Francis is hesitant to go back, but his pride is too strong, he has to get his revenge. 

And so he goes back. This time it takes him weeks to track down the grizzly bear. At one point he is exhausted, running out of supplies, about to give up. When all of a sudden he sees that damn grizzly bear in the distance! He aims, shoots, and wounds it. He gets closer for the coup de grace, when, you guessed itâ¦ he feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around. It's a huge polar bar. Like his predecessors, heâs not pleased. He looks at Francis right in the eyes, and tells him:

One day while they were sailing, they saw that a pirate ship had sent a boarding party to try and board their ship. The crew became worried, but the Captain was calm.

He bellowed to his First Mate, ""Bring me my red shirt!""

The First Mate quickly got the Captain's red shirt, which the captain put on. Then he led his crew into battle against the mean pirates. Although there were some casualties among the crew, the pirates were defeated.

Later that day, the lookout screamed that there were two pirate vessels sending two boarding parties towards their ship. The crew was nervous, but the Captain, calm as ever, bellowed, ""Bring me my red shirt!"" And once again the battle was on!

The Captain and his crew fought off the boarding parties, though this time more casualties occurred.

Weary from the battles, the men sat around on deck that night recounting the day's events when an ensign looked at the Captain and asked, ""Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before the battle?""

The Captain, giving the ensign a look that only a captain can give, explained, ""If I am wounded in battle, the red shirt does not show the blood, so you men will continue to fight unafraid."" The men sat in silence. They were amazed at the courage of such a man.

As dawn came the next morning, the lookout screamed that there were pirate ships, 10 of them, all with boarding parties on their way. The men became silent and looked to the Captain, their leader, for his usual command.

The Captain, calm as ever, bellowed, 'Bring me my brown pants!!!'

Writing down the order again she looks to the cat.

""Yeah I'll have the same. But I'm not paying for it! I won't pay a single penny."" He said as he turned his nose up at her.

The waitress smiles and walks off to the kitchen. She appears again later with three huge meals and 3 bottles of champagne.

After the man and his companions had finished their meal the waitress returned to the table to ask him if there was anything else. The man said no and she went to fetch the bill.

""That'll be Â£164.95 please.""

The man reached into his pocket and pulled out Â£164.95 exactly in cash and placed it in the waitress's hand.

She looked up at him in shock and asked him how he could possibly have the exact money ready for her.

""Oh thats a funny story actually, I found an old lamp the other day and a Genie popped out of it and granted me three wishes. My first wish was to always have the exact money in cash readily in my pocket whenever I needed it.""

""And the second and third wishes?"" Inquired the waitress.

Relieved, the man asked about the types to which the saleslady replied: ""There are the Catholic, the Salvation Army, the Presbyterian, and the Baptist types. Which one would you prefer?""

Now totally befuddled, the man asked about the differences between them.

post,3hewet,2qh72,jokes,false,1439877519,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3hewet/its_long_but_its_worth_it/,self.jokes,,"Three men were standing in line to get into heaven one day. Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, and Patrick had to tell the first one, âHeavenâs getting pretty close to full today, and Iâve been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So whatâs your story?â

The first man replies: âWell, for a while Iâve suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didnât reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldnât you know it, he wouldnât fall off.

So I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and started hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldnât stand that for long, so he let go and fellâbut even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldnât stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony.â

âThat sounds like a pretty bad day to me,â said Patrick, and he let the man in.

The second man comes up and Patrick explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. âItâs been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldnât hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved! But then he started beating on me and kicking me. I managed to hold on until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but okay. Just when I was thinking I was going to be all right, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me, killing me instantly. And, now Iâm here.â

Once again, Patrick had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death.

The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated. Patrick explained that heaven was full and asked for his story.

âOK, picture this,â says the third man, âIâm hiding naked inside a refrigerator....â","It's long, but it's worth it.",9

He decides on the spot, that he must see them for himself, however it is illegal to travel there. No matter, he has his assistant do some research, and sure enough there is an illegal charter he can take to the island, with a tour guide who promises to bring him to see the Sentinelese for the right price.

He lines up the trip, and the next month he and his tour guide make land on North Sentinel Island under the cover of night.

The first thing he notices is that off in the distance the sound of drums fills the night air. Intrigued and excited to be one of the few people in the world to have heard such drumming, he asks, ""What are the drums we are hearing? Is it some kind of ceremony?""

The tour guide, looking startled turns around as says, ""Drums good. Drums stop, bad."" and continues into the jungle.

They travel inland for miles, the drums getting louder and louder all the time, and finally as the sun is beginning to set - stop to make camp. At this point, the drumming has gone on non-stop for 12 hours and is loud enough that they need to raise their voices to communicate.

The businessman, getting annoyed, says to his guide, ""This is getting ridiculous! Do they ever stop that blasted drumming?!""

The tour guide, looks at the businessman with a serious expression and again says, ""Drums good. Drums stop, bad.""

The businessman does his best to sleep through the noise, but his head is splitting from a headache and he is barely able to get any rest. They pack up their things in the morning and head off, again deeper into the jungle - the noise from the drumming getting louder and louder with every step.

Finally, the businessman can take it no more. He reaches forward and grabs his guide by the shoulder and spins him around. Screaming to be heard over the drums, he asks, ""What is with these god damn drums? Don't tell me 'Drums good. Drums stop, bad.' again! I want to know what happens if the god damn drums stop!""

The guide, pauses and looks at him with fear in his eyes.

Little Bobby agreed, and they went to the store and purchased a bass, amp and cable and found a flier for a local bass instructor. Saturday morning, Little Bobby packed up his bass and went off to his first lesson.

Upon returning home, Papa Tavoli stopped him and asked, ""What did you learn at your lesson this week?""

Little Bobby removed his bass from his gig-bag and said, ""I learned the E string."" He plucked the lowest string a few times and said ""E. E. E.""

Papa Tavoli, pleased with the results sent Little Bobby off to practice for his next lesson.

The following Saturday, Little Bobby scurried off eagerly to meet with his instructor. Again, as he walked in the door, his father stopped him and asked Little Bobby to show him what he had learned.

Little Bobby once again removed his bass from the gig-bag and said, ""This week we learned quarter notes."" He plucked the E string four times, keeping fairly good time and saying ""1. 2. 3. 4.""

Excited about his son's progress, Papa Tavoli patted Little Bobby on the back and sent him to continue his studies.

On the third Saturday, Little Bobby was up early practicing his E string and quarter notes and then left for his lesson without so much as a goodbye. When he returned an hour later, Papa Tavoli stopped him again, and said ""Little Bobby, show me what you...""

But Little Bobby interrupted him and said, ""Sorry Dad, no time to talk. I've got a gig, gotta go.""

post,3haywr,2qh72,jokes,false,1439811411,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3haywr/a_timeless_irish_classic/,self.jokes,,"About twenty years ago, the Irish government decided to set up a secret service, much like MI5 in the UK. The three best Gardai (Irish police officers) were selected to participate in a number of tests in order to determine who would receive the coveted title of 001.
The three Gardai, each representing the various characteristics of most police officers were Garda Murphy from Cork, Garda Ryan from Dublin and Garda O'Sullivan from Kerry. Murphy, being a Cork man, was very agreeable, a sound man altogether. Garda Ryan was stern, by the book and extremely literal when it came to the details. Garda O'Sullivan was a Kerry man, and represented all that is wrong with police officers; idiotic and with a disturbing lack of foresight.

So the day of the final test arrives, and the three participants are lined up outside a room and handed a gun each. They are told that they must enter the room and shoot whoever is sitting in the chair in order to pass the final test.

Garda Murphy from Cork is first to go in, and shutting the door behind him, he sees his very own wife sitting in the chair. Without any thought, he unties her and walks out a separate door, failing the test. ""Unfortunately Garda Murphy, you have failed the test. The gun is loaded with blanks. We would never have made you kill Mrs. Murphy."" Garda Murphy walks out.

Garda Ryan from Dublin is next. He takes the gun and enters the room. After some quick deliberation, he sighs, cocks the handgun and fires at his wife. Understandably, he leaves the room with his wife quite upset, but satisfied in the knowledge that he has passed the test. ""Congratulations, Garda Ryan. You're surely in the running for 001.""

Finally, the intellectually challenged Garda O'Sullivan from Kerry enters. He takes the gun and enters the room. Lo, Mrs. O'Sullivan is sat in the centre of the room.

Twenty minutes later, Garda O'Sullivan exits the room with his bloodied and deceased wife.

""Lads, some stupid cunt filled the gun with blanks so I had to beat her to death with the fuckin' chair!""","A timeless, Irish classic.",95

Jake sighs, puts down the suitcases and glances at his wrist. ""It's a quarter to six,"" he says.

""Hey, that's a pretty fancy watch!"" exclaims the stranger. Jake brightens a little. 

""Yeah, it's not bad. Check this out"" - and he shows him a time zone display not just for every time zone in the world, but for the 86 largest metropolises. He hits a few buttons and from somewhere on the watch a voice says, ""The time is eleven 'til six"" in a very West Texas accent. A few more buttons and the same voice says something in Japanese. 

Jake continues, ""I've put in regional accents for each city."" The display is unbelievably high quality and the voice is simply astounding. The stranger is struck dumb with admiration. 

""That's not all"", says Jake. He pushes a few more buttons and a tiny but very high-resolution map of New York City appears on the display. ""The flashing dot shows our location by satellite positioning,"" explains Jake.  ""View recede ten,"" Jake says, and the display changes to show eastern New York state.

""I want to buy this watch!"" says the stranger.

""Oh, no, it's not ready for sale yet; I'm still working out the bugs,"" says the inventor. ""But look at this,"" and he proceeds to demonstrate that the watch is also a very creditable little FM radio receiver with a digital tuner, a sonar device that can measure distances up to 125 meters, a pager with thermal paper printout and, most impressive of all, the capacity for voice recordings of up to 300 standard-size books, ""though I only have 32 of my favorites in there so far,"" says Jake.

""I've got to have this watch!"" says the stranger.

""No, you don't understand; it's not ready -""

""I'll give you $1000 for it!""

""Oh, no, I've already spent more than -""

""I'll give you $5000 for it!""

""But it's just not -""

""I'll give you $15,000 for it!"" And the stranger pulls out a checkbook.  Jake stops to think. He's only put about $8,500 into materials and development, and with $15,000 he can make another one and have it ready for merchandising in only six months. 

The stranger frantically finishes writing the check and waves it in front of him. ""Here it is, ready to hand to you right here and now. $15,000.  Take it or leave it.""

Jake abruptly makes his decision. ""OK"", he says, and peels off the watch.  They make the exchange and the stranger starts happily away. 

""Hey, wait a minute,"" calls Jake to the stranger, who turns around warily. Jake points to the two suitcases he'd been trying to wrestle through the bus station.  ""Don't forget your batteries.""",The First Smartwatch (long),10

The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the bird's mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity. John tried and tried to change the bird's attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to 'clean up' the bird's vocabulary.

Finally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even more rude. John, in desperation, threw up his hand, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer.

For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute. Fearing that he'd hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John's outstretched arms and said ""I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I'm sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior."" John was stunned at the change in the bird's attitude. As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird spoke-up, very softly, ""May I ask what the turkey did?""

With that as his mission he began searching for the perfect woman. After a diligent, but fruitless, search up and down the east coast, he started to head west. Shortly thereafter he met a farmer who had three stunning, gorgeous daughters that positively took his breath away. So he explained his mission to the farmer, asking for permission to marry one of them. 

The farmer simply replied, ""They're all lookin' to get married, so you came to the right place. Look them over and select the one you want."" 

The man dated the first daughter. The next day the farmer asked for the man's opinion. 
""Well"" said the man, "" She's just a weeeeee bit, not that you can hardly notice, but pigeon-toed."" 

The farmer nodded and suggested the man date one of the other girls; so the man went out with the second daughter. 

The next day, the farmer again asked how things went. 
""Well,"" the man replied, ""She's just a weeeee bit, not that you can hardly tell, cross-eyed."" 

The farmer nodded and suggested he date the third girl to see if things might be better. So he did. 

The next morning the man rushed in exclaiming, ""She's perfect, just perfect! She's the one I want to marry!"" So they were wed right away. 

Months later the baby was born. When the man visited nursery he was horrified: the baby was the ugliest, most pathetic human you can imagine. He rushed to his father-in-law asking how such a thing could happen considering the parents.

There was a fly buzzing along a river near the shore, exactly 3 inches above the water. It was preparing to descend onto the surface of the river when a fish happened to notice it.  The fish thinks to itself, ""when this fly drops 3 inches to the surface of the water, I'm going to jump out and eat the fly."" Now, unbeknownst to the fish was a bear sitting under the trees on the riverbank.  The bear also notices and fly as well as the fish and thinks to himself, ""when this fly drops 3 inches, the fish is going to come to the surface of the water and I'm going to grab it."" The next character in our story is a hunter who is sitting a bit further back in the woods from the water. The hunter too sees all this unfolds and says to himself, ""when the fly drops, the fish will surface, and the bear will step out in the open to get the fish. that's when ill make my move and shoot the bear."" Now the hunter, he happens to be eating a cheese sandwich. We'll say its cheddar cheese.  In a nearby bush is a mouse who also sees all of this unfolding. The mouse concludes that when the hunter attempts to shoot the bear, he must drop his cheese sandwich to do so.  Thus the mouse thinks,""when the hunter drops the cheese sandwich, I'll scurry out and grab it!"" And finally the last participant in our story is a cat who is crouching gracefully high in a tree above all of this. The cat thinks,""when the fly drops 3 inches, the fish will come to the surface, the bear will step out to the get the fish, the hunter will shoot the bear, the mouse will run to grab the cheese sandwich, and I will pounce on the mouse!""  All of this happens in an instance - The fly drops 3 inches, the fish eats the fly, the bear grabs the fish, the hunter drops the cheese sandwich and shoots the bear, the mouse grabs the cheese sandwich, BUT the cat pounces completely missing the mouse and lands SPLASH in the river. What is the moral of this story?

An enterprising mayor of the city of Granby, Quebec, a community
south of Montreal, established a municipal zoo that has become a significant
tourist attraction.  It has also given rise to many unusual events.

Last September one of the star attractions, Arnold, an Indonesian
ape,  escaped to the dismay of the zoo director.  The matter was a serious
one because the members of the staff of the zoo, while expert at caring for
animals,  had had no experience whatever in rounding them up or capturing
them.

The zoo director appealed to the office of the mayor for help and the
secretary to the mayor asked, ""Have you looked in the yellow pages""?  The
director said he hadn't, but would, immediately.

To his surprise, under ""animal capturing service""  he found a listing
for the Acme Ape Apprehenders.  He called them immediately

Within 20 minutes a panel truck arrived at the admin office of the
zoo and a small man emerged and rushed to the director who was waiting at
the door.

""Is there a wooded area in the vicinity?"", the little man asked.  The
director said there was, within one half mile from the zoo.  ""Hop in the
truck"", the little man said. The director did and they
drove off.

Minutes later they arrived at a small grove and immediately spotted
Arnold on a branch about 25 feet above the ground.

The two men got out, went to the back of the truck and the little man
opened the door.  An excited little dog jumped out and began running around
in circles.
The little man reached into the truck and took out a suicase which he
opened.  In the suitcase were a pair of handcuffs,
which he handed to the zoo director, a sawed off shotgun, which he
leaned against the trunk of the tree, and a baseball bat.

""Now,"" the little man said, ""I'm going up into the tree with the
baseball bat, and I'm going to knock the ape out of the tree.  The instant
the ape hits the ground the dog, well trained, will grab the ape by the
crotch.   The ape, instantly and instinctively will grab at his crotch with
both hands. and you snap the handcuffs on and we've got him.

The zoo director, pointing to the shotgun leaning against the tree,
said ""I'm not too sure about this, what's the gun for?""

The little man said, ""Look, I'm an expert.  I know what I'm doing and
things will go just fine, after all, I have the baseball bat.  I know my
job and it'll never happen but if the ape should,  by any chance, knock ME
out of the tree,

What I liked best is that the program was personalised to me specifically so I could start the program first thing the next morning after I arrived. Iâm told often guests arrive at the airport in afternoon/evening, are met by their driver who then escorted me to the retreat where I checked in, took a shower and relaxed. All my program information was waiting for me in my room, and the next morning I had my program orientation and started my program.

The weight loss retreat is REALLY amazing with fresh organic (and simply delicious!) raw food in the beginning while detoxifying, and then a variety of lean proteins (like fish and chicken) with many tasty sides and a nice big smoothie or fresh coconut to wash it down. The fitness classes are awesome fun, they have everything from boot camp and CrossFit style training, to Pilates and Yoga, TRX suspension training, Muay Thai boxing, weight training, 1-on-1 sessions, and so much more! Itâs all put together into a program which destroys fat, builds lean muscle while detoxifying your body and making you look and feel great!

So far itâs going great and my weight is down almost 5kg, hoping to lose 14kg in the rest of my time on the retreat.",My Weight Loss Retreat at PhuketFit,0

He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauperâs cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost.
I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.
I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didnât know what else to do, so I started to play.
The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like Iâve never played before for this homeless man.
And as I played âAmazing Grace,â the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.
As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, âI never seen nothinâ like that before and Iâve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.â

He noticed that on Tuesdays and Thursdays, while he was working out, that when he got home the bed would be kind of messed up, and his wife always made the bed.
So one Thursday he decided to leave work early. He got to his apartment and started to unlock the locks and heard some noises. 
He finally bursts in and sees a pair of men's pants, mans button up shirt, and tie.
He then goes into a raging fit demanding that his wife tells him where the man is.

The neighbor upstairs, which happens to be watering his plants on his balcony, hears the commotion and tries to lean over to hear what is going on better. When he does he loses his grip from his balconies railing, falls off his balcony, but is able to catch himself on the arguing couples balcony. All of the sudden the husband, looking for the guy that is screwing his wife, rushes out on the balcony and sees the neighbor hanging from his balcony and automatically assumes that his wife was screwing the neighbor.

He starts yelling at the neighbor ""JOHN, YOU SON OF A BITCH! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS, YOU GODDAMN, NO GOOD PIECE OF SHIT! I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!""
He then starts punching John and pushing his arm and hand off of his balconies railing. Before John can even say anything, he falls from the balcony and on the ground, but is still alive.

The husband then sees that John is lying on the ground moving around a bit. The husband then yells ""I AM GOING TO FINISH THE JOB YOU BASTARD!"" The husband, in a rage, then starts looking around the apartment for something to throw down at John. He sees the refrigerator, pushes it through the balconies sliding glass doors, then over it's railing on to John killing him instantly.

As this is going on, God is telling Peter that heaven is starting to get full of the people he requires, and to only let people in that have died a horrible, tragic, death. Not long after god tells Peter this, poor old John pops up.

Peter asks John how he died. John then tells Peter, in grisly detail, the unfortunate way he died. Peter is taken aback and tells John. I am sorry my son, that is such a terrible way to pass....You may enter into heavens gates. 

Not much longer after John popped up at heavens gates, Bill Clinton was behind him in line. He approached Peter after Peter had talked to John.  Peter recognizes who he is and says. Well Hello there former president Clinton, how in the world did you end up here?
Bill then says Peter, it's the craziest damn thing. I was hiding in this refrigerator....

All he wanted to do was go to the circus then on his birthday his dad bought him two tickets to the circus. He was so happy and couldn't wait to go. The circus finally came and he was so happy. Him and his dad went into the main tent and went to find the seats. They finally got to the top of the seating. They were the worst seats in the house, but Ralf loved it. The clowns juggled and there were lions and horses and the clown car. Ralf loved all of it. Then at the end the ringmaster came out and asked for a volunteer. Ralf raised his hand high and enthusiastically and the clown called on him. He was so happy as we he went down to the stage. The clown called for his horse.

After that he devoted his entire life to getting back at that clown. He practised comebacks all through highschool and applied to Harvard's secret school of comebackery.

After all, she never called or came back, so how was she to know?

The brunette was thrilled to be home early. She did a little gardening and went to bed early.

The redhead was elated to be able to get in a quick workout at her spa before meeting a dinner date.

The blonde was happy happy happy to be home, but when she got to her bedroom she heard a muffled noise from inside. Slowly, quietly, she cracked open the door and was mortified to see her husband in bed with HER BOSS!!!  Ever so gently, she closed the door and crept out of her house.

The next day, at coffee break, the brunette and redhead mentioned leaving early again, and asked the blonde if she was with them.

""NO WAY,"" she exclaimed, ""I almost got caught yesterday!""",3 ladies at work (yes it's yet another Blonde joke),127

I get really intense about them, though, and can't stand starting a new one until I've finished the last one. I refuse to use dictionaries and things on principle, and I'll sit and ponder them until something comes along.

Anyway, I'd been working on one for about a month straight, stuck on one last clue. I'd stopped going to work, stopped bathing, shaving. I barely ate, barely slept. I was pretty sure my girlfriend had left me because it had been a bit quiet, but I couldn't be sure.

Most of my mates had abandoned me, except my friend from Jamaica- good guy, great friend.

So, he came round to visit me, takeaway curry in hand, and sat down next to me. It took me a moment, but I realised he was there, and looked up at him.

""Come on"", he said, ""you've got to give up. It's not good for you. You're...."". He trailed off after that, but that 'twirly finger by the ear' thing everyone knows means 'fuck, mate, you're insane'.

""I can't"", I replied through my luxurious crossword-beard, ""I need to finish this one last thing, and then....and then I'll be fine. Fine. Promise""

He sighed, and shook his head, but gestured anyway. ""Alright, what is it?""

""Monumental""

'Well, good luck doing all of the thinking if you can't see where you're going,' say the eyes. 'We should be in charge.'

'What good is it going to do seeing, if you can't get anywhere?' asked the legs.

'Well, without us, you'd have no oxygen,' said the lungs.

'Are you serious?' said the stomach. 'How are you supposed to process energy and do any of this stuff, without me??'

'Well, what about me?' piped up the asshole. 'I'm important too...'

'You?!?' laughed the other parts. 'Shut up, asshole!'

So the asshole went on strike.

A week and a half later, the brain couldn't think straight. The eyes couldn't focus, the legs were asleep from sitting on the pot, and the stomach was so jammed up full of crap that the lungs could barely breathe.

Finally, they all went to the asshole and said, 'Look, we're sorry, we're sorry!! Just come back to work, you can be in charge!'

...and that's why all bosses are assholes.""

A Mom visits her son for dinner who lives with a girl roommate.

During the course of the meal, his mother couldn't help but notice how pretty his roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship between the two, and this had only made her more curious.

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and his roommate than met the eye.

Reading his mom's thoughts, the son volunteered, âI know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, we are just roommates.""

About a week later, his roommate came to him saying, âEver since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?""

He said ,""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure.""

He sat down and wrote :

Dear Mother:

I'm not saying that you âdid' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you âdid not' take the silver plate .. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.

Love,

your son

Several days later, he received an email from his Mother which read:

Dear Son:

I'm not saying that you âdo' sleep with your roommate, and I'm not saying that you âdo not' sleep with her. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver plate by now, under the pillowâ¦

Last week, a group of Hells Angels bikers were riding South on I-85 in North Carolina country when they saw a girl about to jump off the Catawba River Bridge.

They stopped.

George, the top biker was a big burly man of 53, gets off his Harley, walks through a group of gawkers, past the State Troopers and he says, ""Hey Baby, whatcha doin' up there on that there railin'?""

She says ""I'm going to commit suicide!""

George says ""Well, before you jump, Honey-Babe, how about you give ol' George here your best goodbye kiss?""

Without hesitation, she leaned back over the rail and did just that. And it was a long, deep, lingering kiss plus a few more real wet ones. George gets cheers of approval from his biker-buddies, onlookers, and even the State Troopers.

""Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had, Honey! That's a real talent you got there, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me.
Why the hell are you committing suicide?""

Since he has no one waiting for him in his apartment, he decides to go to his favorite pub to celebrate.

So he arrives, and pay for everyone's drink because of his mood. Everyone is happy and he is soon the man of the night. He then drinks a bit more, learn to know everyone, but he sees two girls on the other side of the bar which are ignoring him and not really cheering. 

He goes to them, and to start the discussion, buy them drink. At first, they are a bit cold, but as he learns to know them, they appear way more happy and cheerful. As he finds out, they are both really beautiful and nice, but are also siamese sister, binded by the arm.

Since everyone drank much, he feels confident enough to ask all the question about the issues siamese people might encounter, and then, inhibited, try to hit on one of them.

Surprisingly, the girl is really responsive, as she later explain, a lot of people start to be uneased when they find out their condition, so she is pleased by the attention. He then ask about the other sister : "" Is it ok ? Will she not feel uncomfortable ?"" The  courted sister answers that they are used to it, and because of their condition they learned to make concession to the other they have to live with.

After a while, and bolstered by the answers of the girls, Max ask the girls if they would like to go home with him for a last drink. The girls ask for a moment, go to the bathroom, probably to discuss a bit, then come back a accept the proposal.

As they drink in his appartment, things heat up between Max and the sister he fancies. He asks a last time the other sister if it is ok with her, and then they start to take off their clothes and to have sex together. 

They do it once, twice, but as they start the third time, the second sister tap on Max's shoulder; asking, while taking the instrument out of her purse : ""do you mind if I play the bugle while you're at it ?""
Max is somehow shocked, but answer that, no he doesn't mind, he understands that she feel a little bit bored.
The night of love continues, as Max is galvanized by the sound of the bugle and discovers new skills he was not aware of. When the morning comes, he is exhausted but had the best night of his life.

On the morning, he is told that his date really enjoyed the night, but, because of her condition, she could not really start a relationship together but she will try to keep in touch with him. Since Max had fun but don't know if he can really manage this situation on a daily basis, he is quite relieved to hear this.

Then, three months later, the sisters are walking in front of the bar. One say to the other : ""You remember this bar ? We met a really cool guy there, he was really nice and we end up in his appartment.""
The other answers : ""Yeah, it was a really nice night ! Do you think he remembers us ?""

He was parked on the side of the road trying fix it, when a Jaguar pulled up in front of him and offered to help. After a few minutes the two men obviously weren't going to get the old car going again, so the Jaguar driver offered to tow the Dodge to the nearest garage.

A few minutes later the two had hitched up the old Dodge to the Jaguar, and they agreed that if the Jaguar driver was going too fast, the man should blow his horn and flash his lights to get him to slow down. With that the two men got into their cars and the Jaguar driver started to pull away with the Dodge behind it.

At the first traffic light, a Ferrari pulled up beside the Jaguar and started to rev his engine. As soon as the light turned green the Ferrari and the Jaguar hit their accelerators and took off. Before long the cars were racing at over 120 mph. As the cars speed along, they passed through a police speed trap. The officer couldn't believe his eyes when he saw the three cars go by, and he decided that he couldn't catch them all by himself, so he decided to radio for help: ""You won't believe what I just saw! I saw a Ferrari and a Jaguar doing 120 mph side by side, and a beat up old Dodge behind them flashing his lights and blowing his horn trying to get by!""",Officer couldn't believe his eyes.,115

&amp;nbsp;

The store owner says ""I have just the thing for you! We have a parrot that I think would be the perfect fit. He speaks over 500 words."" The old woman is elated, buys the parrot, and takes him home. Sure enough, the parrot is a delightful companion and they barely spend a second apart for the entire week.

&amp;nbsp;

On Sunday morning, the old woman goes to church - but not wanting to be away from her parrot, brings him along by hiding him in her purse. Halfway through the priest's sermon, the parrot jumps out of her purse onto her shoulder and shouts ""HOLY FUCK IT'S COLD IN HERE!"". Horrified, she tries to cram him back into her purse - but he jumps out again, onto her shoulder, and again screams ""HOLY FUCK IT'S COLD IN HERE!"". The entire congregation sits in silent horror, staring at the old woman and the bird. She grabs her parrot and runs out of the church, embarrassed beyond belief.

&amp;nbsp;

First thing on Monday morning, she returns to the pet store and says ""You have to take him back. He jumps out and screams obscenities in church!"" to which the store owner knowingly nods his head and says ""I was worried that might happen. Look, it will probably never happen again... but just in case, the next time he does it, just grab him by his feet, swing him around your head three times, and put him back on your shoulder. That's how he's been taught to know when he's saying something he shouldn't."" Hesitantly, she takes the parrot home again.

To their disappointment, they find nothing.  Being too early in the year for crops to grow, every garden they find is bare.  The rabbits begin to worry they may starve.

They arrive at a park where they see a boy flying a kite.  He takes a rest for a moment to open a lunch container filled to the brim with vegetables.  Carrot sticks, cucumbers, broccoli.  The boy takes a few and munches on them by himself.

The rabbits watch from a distance and are salivating.  Mama rabbit says to the Papa rabbit, âyou should go up to him.  Ask him if he'll share some of those carrots with us.â

Papa rabbit shakes his head.  âNooo,â he says.  âHumans don't like us.  They always build fences around their gardens to keep us out.  He'd never share those carrots with us.â

Mama rabbit says, âplease?  We are starving.  Ask him anyway.  Maybe he'll be generous, just this once.â

Papa rabbit says, âwhy don't YOU ask him?  If you think he'll share with us, you be the one to ask him.â

Mama rabbit backs away, and says ânooo, I could never!  You ask him!  You're the brave one of us.  I'd be too frightened!â

Baby rabbit says âwill you two stop arguing?  I'LL ask him, if neither of you will!â

Before they can stop him, Baby rabbit hops up to the little boy.  Baby rabbit says, âexcuse me.  I noticed you've got some vegetables there.  They look awfully delicious, and you've got far too many to eat by yourself.  My family here is very hungry.  We actually haven't had a full meal in quite a few days.

When the guy came to, the zookeeper was anxiously bending over him, and as soon as he was able to talk he explained what had happened. The zookeeper nodded sagely and explained that in gorilla language, pulling down your eyelid meant âFuck youâ.

The next day he bought two large knives, two party hats, two party horns, and a large sausage. Putting the sausage in his pants, he hurried to the zoo and over to the gorillaâs cage, into which he tossed a hat, a knive and a party horn.

Knowing that the big apes were natural mimics, he put on a party hat. The gorilla looked at him, looked at the hat, and put it on. Next he picked up his horn and blew on it. The gorilla picked up the horn and did the same. Then the man picked up his knife, whipped the sausage out of his pants, and sliced it neatly in two.

Furious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to fire the weatherman at once! Then he summoned the farmer and offered him the prestigious and high paying role of royal forecaster.

""You bet,"" says the seller, and then with some afterthought, ""tell you what kid, I like the look of you - I'll sell this car to you cheap if you promise to keep her in good nick.""

""Hell yeah!"" he says eagerly, still amazed by sound of the engine

""Good, all you need to do is put some lube down the exhaust just before it starts to rain. You *must* do this without fail, or it will rust. You promise?""

""Promise,"" he says, and gladly pays the seller who hands him over the keys and a large tub of lube for the rain.

That evening he sets off with his girlfriend to her parents house in their new car, and right as he's about to ring the doorbell - his girlfriend grabs his hand and says:

""My parents are very nice accommodating people, but they have ONE rule - whoever talks first during dinner has to do the washing up.""

The guys shrugs 'okay', and in they go. 

Her parents really are as easy-going and open-minded as his girlfriend made them out to be, but then they all sat down for dinner and the conversation suddenly stopped.

They all ate in silence, and as each course of the meal progressed the plates started to pile up. *That sure is one big stack of washing up* thought the man to himself, *these guys will probably commit murder before they speak again*.

Figuring that he could get away with anything, he gets up and stands behind his girlfriend, and starts fondling her breasts really intimately, finally pulling her up from the chair and breaking out into full blown sex on the dinner table as her parents watch in mute bewilderment. 

After he finishes and no one says a word, he looks past his girlfriend at her mother and figures that she's not that bad looking either.
