But when she was on her deathbed—and with her blessing—he opened the box and found a  crocheted doll and $95,000 in cash.

“My mother told me that the secret to a happy marriage was to never  argue,” she explained. “Instead, I should keep quiet and crochet a doll.”

Her husband was touched. Only one doll was in the box—that meant she’d been angry with him only once in 60 years. “But what about all this money?” he asked.

“Oh,” she said, “that’s the money  I made from selling the dolls.”",All Dolled Up,17

'You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.'

Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He had no choice but to go under the knife.
When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life.

He saw a men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need. A new suit.'

He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new suit.'

The elderly tailor eye d him briefly and said, 'Let's see, Size 44 long.'

Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?'

'Been in the business 60 years!' the tailor said.

Joe tried on the suit it fit perfectly.

As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, 'How about a new shirt?'

Joe thought for a moment and then said, 'Sure.'

The salesman eyed Joe and said, 'Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.'

Joe was surprised, 'That's right, how did you know?'

'Been in the business 60 years.'

Joe tried on the shirt and it fit perfectly.

Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new underwear?'

Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure.'

The salesman said, 'Let's see, Size 36.'

Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! I got you! I've worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old.'

The salesman shook his head, 'You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.'",Bad news,3924

It lies deep in the African Savanna, and is little know to science. The legend says, that if the Foo bird poops on you, and you wipe it off, you will die a terrible, violent death. Now, one day three explorers decided to go off and hunt for this mysterious bird. And soon the trio discovered its nest. The explorers approached the nest, and and rapid succession the bird pooped on all three. ""This is disgusting!"" said the first explorer, and without a second thought he wiped it off. Within seconds, a great lightning bolt crashed down from the sky and killed the first explorer. The second explorer said, ""Its probably just a coincidence. After all, a silly ancient myth couldn't possibly be true!"" And the second explorer wiped the dropping of his face. Suddenly a huge bolder from a nearby mountain crashed to the ground, crushing the second explorer. The third explorer, having watched his companions die violent deaths right before his eyes, decided to leave the feces on his head. When he finally got out of the savanna, he bought the biggest hat he could find, and stuck it firmly on his head. And for 20 years all was well. The man became very rich, got a wife and 3 children, and everything else he could ever want. However, one day his wife asked him, ""Dear, why don't you take off that hat of yours? I've never seen you without it."" And the man said, ""I'm sorry but I can't do that."" The wife replied, ""Dear, take off the hat."" And again the man refused. Finally his wife yelled, ""DEAR, REMOVE YOUR HAT!"" The man, realizing he had no other option, removed his hat. And on top of his head was the most disgusting, slimy, crusty pile of crap that anyone has ever seen. ""DEAR!"" cried his wife, ""Wipe that off right this minute!"" And the man explained, ""There is a legend that if I wipe this off, I shall die."" And his wife said, ""Don't tell me you believe that nonsense! If you don't wipe that off right now I will leave you, and take the children!"" And the man thought to himself, ""What is my life without my kids."" And so, the man went to the bathroom, and took a wet rag, and wiped off the bird poop. And as he was walking out of the bathroom to show his wife, a chandelier fell from the ceiling and broke his neck. The moral of this story? If the foo shits, wear it!",[Long] The Tale of the Foo Bird,2

The doctor said that masturbating before sex often helps men last longer. The man decided, “What the hell, I’ll try it.”

He spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it. He couldn’t do it in his office. He thought about the restroom, but that was too open. He considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe.

Finally, he realized his solution.

On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the highway. He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the trucks undercarriage.

Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to masturbate.

Thinking that the car’s undercarriage was a bit of a turn-off, he firmly closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to the big finish, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants.

Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, “What?”

He heard, “This is the police. What’s going on down there?”

The man replied, “I’m checking out the rear axle, it’s busted.”

Then he heard the reply, “Well, you might as well check your brakes too, because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago.”",A man wanted to last longer during sex,4

He wanted to be sure his collection would not be damaged or stolen so, in his eccentric mind, he thought they'd be safe kept in a large woven hut built in the woods. He figured no one would expect anything valuable to be kept in such a place.   

He traveled the world over, seeking out the most lavish of chairs, and carefully brought each of them back to his hut.    

His family found out what he was doing, and begged him to keep his collection in a safer place.    

He insisted on keeping his collection where it was, but decided to move into the hut, to personally watch over his collection.    

As could be expected, disaster eventually struck, in the form a forest fire which destroyed both his hut, and his priceless collection.    

The man managed to escape unharmed, but was devastated at his loss, and with nowhere to live, soon died penniless.

He says to his friends, ""I'm going to go back to school. I haven't done anything really important with my life and need to do better.""
His friends tried to dissuade him by telling him he didn't need to go back and that he made good money in his current job.  He was convinced though that he needed to do it to better himself, and not because of money.  So he goes to the local college and talks to a counselor about signing up for classes. She tries to get him to do two classes since he hasn't ever had any higher level learning, but he is adamant that he wants to take at least three.  The counselor gives in and tells him ok, you can take algebra, English, and a critical thinking analysis class.  Intrigued, he asks, ""what is this critical thinking analysis class I'm signing up for?""   She tells him that it's a great class and that it will help how he analyzes and deduced information. So to give him an example she asks, ""do you have a weed eater?""  He says, ""yeah I got a weed eater.""  So she tells him, ""ok that means you probably have a yard. And that means you probably have a house. And if you have a house, at your age, you're probably married. And also because of your age, you and your wife probably have children.  See, usually people with children try to have a house with a yard for them to play.""  The man is thoroughly impressed.  He says, ""wow! You figured all that out just by asking if I had a weed eater?  That's really neat, I think I will like this class.""  So he's talking to his buddy at the bar a couple of days later and is telling them about the classes he signed up for.  When he tells them he's in a critical thinking analysis class, one of his friends asks what that's about.  He says, ""man, its a class to help with thinking.  It's kinda hard to explain, I don't know if you'd understand.""  So his friend says, ""well, try me.""  ""Ok,"" says the guy, ""do you own a weed eater?""  His friend replies, ""no.""

Giving you do that, you'll be fine."" 

The maneuver thinks the mentor is distraught however guarantees to yell the order. The race starts and they approach the primary obstacle. The maneuver disregards the mentor's ludicrous guidance and the steed crashes straight through the focal point of the bounce. 

They continue and approach the second obstacle. The maneuver, to some degree humiliated, whispers ""Aleeee ooop"" in the steed's ear. A similar thing happens - the steed crashes straight through the focal point of the bounce. 

At the third obstacle, the maneuver considers, ""It's awful, I'll need to do it,"" and shouts, ""ALLLEEE OOOP!"" truly boisterously. Beyond any doubt, the steed cruises over the bounce without any issues. This proceeds for whatever remains of the race, however because of the prior issues the stallion just completes third. 

The coach is smoldering and asks the move what turned out badly. The move answers, ""Nothing isn't right with me - it's this grisly steed. What is he - hard of hearing or something?""","The ""deaf"" horse",2

""Give me another condom because my girlfriend's sister is very cute. She always crosses her legs in a provocative manner when she sees me and I think I might strike a luck there too."" ... 

The pharmacist gives him a second condom and as Peter was leaving again he turns back and says: ""Give me one more condom because my girlfriend's mum is still hot and when she sees me she always makes eye contact and since she invited me for dinner I think she is expecting me to make a move ...

The bartender obliges, and notices the man's dog-tags while he pours the drink. ""First one's on the house – for your service."" The veteran nods in approval and reaches towards his glass, but drops it just as he picks it up, spilling the whiskey all over himself. As he wipes himself off, bartender realizes his hand is actually an incredibly realistic prosthetic, unnoticeable all but to the closest inspection. “Had a friend that lost his in the war”, says the bartender, as he motions to the veteran's arm, “what took yours?” The veteran stiffens a bit, gazing into the bar-top. “Well sir, I returned home unharmed.” 

He takes a sip of the new drink the bartender has passed him, while shaking his head. “My wife, Katherine, she picked me up at the airport. I hadn't seen her in months, and that nervous feeling in the pit of your stomach – you know, the one you get when you've waited for something for so long it hurts? – it disappeared as soon as she was in my arms.”

“That's great, son,” the bartender started, “and I don't mean to pry, but… how does this relate to the arm?” The veteran takes his good hand and rests it on his temple, pensively tapping. “Well,” he paused, “on the ride home my wife tells me she has a surprise, and that it couldn't wait 'til we got home.” His eyes welling up, he turns his face to the floor. “She hands me a picture. It's her, standing next to a very pregnant woman. I look up at her, confused, but her smile is beaming and I instantly know what she's about to say.” He digs his fist into his thigh. “'It finally happened! She chose us!' she says through happy tears. That's when the car hit us.”

The bartender, in shock, focuses intently on the man's story. He asks gravely, “That took the arm? What about your wife?” At this point the veteran isn't trying to hide the tears running down his face. “Well, sir, I woke up a few days later without a right arm,” lifting his prosthetic, “and the rest of me was broken so badly they told me I wouldn't ever walk again. In fact, I didn't until I got the leg.” The veteran pulls up his jeans to reveal a state-of-the-art prosthetic leg. “I couldn't afford both until..” he trailed off. “Until the settlement. See the driver was drunk. My wife lasted for a few weeks but, but in the end I had to make the hardest decision of my life. I had to let her go. I had to shut it off.”

Shell-shocked, the bartender reflects upon this man's terrible fortune. He pours three more doubles and slides them over. “I can't even begin to tell you how sorry I am. That's something that no one deserves. I know this must be difficult, and please stop me if it's too much so, but what about your kid?” The veteran sobs. “Without my wife, I wasn't eligible to adopt. The woman, Mary, wanted her daughter – my daughter – to go to me but the state said no. That I wasn't fit. I threw all my money at family lawyers, any lawyers, trying to honor my wife's memory by adopting this child she loved so much.” He shamefully dropped his shoulders and said, “I'm here with my last fifty dollars. I just don't see how I can continue on without this child to remember my wife, but I've got nothing left to my name. I sold the house, the car, even my wedding ring.”

The bartender feels for the young man, and racks his brain trying to come up with something to help. “I've got a thousand dollars stashed in the safe in the back, and I know quite a few regulars here would be willing to help your cause.” The veteran looks up, with the slightest hint of happiness. He dries his eyes and profusely thanks the bartender, but lets him know it couldn't be nearly enough. “These guys are more expensive than you could ever imagine. I know I wasn't prepared.”

The bartender tries a last-ditch effort, “Couldn't you sell the prostheses? They look pretty expensive. And you said it took a settlement to buy them. What did they cost?” “Oh,” replies the veteran, “an arm and a leg.”

Fortunately there is a farmhouse nearby within walking distance.   They knock on the door and a world class bombshell of a young woman answers the door.  They explain their plight, and the woman tells them to wait on the porch while she gets her father. She closes the door, and the guys quietly go nuts over how friggin hot this lady is.  The farmer then comes to greet them.  He says that he knows of a guy who can help them get their car fixed, but it won't be until the next day.  Until then, they could share his sons old room for the night.  The guys express their gratitude and ask what they could offer for his generosity. He tells them not to worry about it and turns to walk in the house.  Before he gets through the doorway he turns back and tells them that actually the one thing they can do is not fuck his daughter. See, she's home on break and her promiscuity has got her into a few jams, and the farmer and his wife are doing what they can to help get her right.  So under no circumstances should they consider any funny stuff.  After a beat, they guys assure him they'll be on their best behavior. 

At dinner, they all share a fabulous meal prepared by the farmers wife and daughter. There is simple conversation, nothing earth shattering. As they are cleaning up, the farmers daughter slips a note to one of the guys, whispering to him ""tonight"".  When the guys are alone they read the contents of the note, it is simply a phone number. 

After everyone has settled to their rooms for the evening, the guys decide to text the phone number.  It is of course the farmers daughter's, and she proceeds to tell the guys how she hasn't got laid in weeks and really needs...well y'all are on Reddit so I'm sure you can figure out what she needs, and that with 3 teenage guys she doesn't need to do much convincing.  They decide that one at a time they'd sneak into her room and...satisfy her needs. 

They draw straws, and the guy who wins leaves the room.  He tip toes down the hall, and about halfway down the wood creaks very loud below his feet. Now, the hall is on the second floor, with the farmers bedroom on the first.  He wakes up and calls up the stairwell asking who's there.  The guy thinks frantically and the first thing to come to mind is to mimic a cat.  He meows, and the farmer curses the cat and goes back into his room.  The first guy makes it the rest of the way to the daughters bedroom and gets the job done. 

Guy number one gets back to the spare room and tells the other two of his experience.  Guys number two is foaming out the mouth for his turn, but before he heads out asks guy number one what he did when the floor creaked.  Guy number one told him to be the cat.  Guy number two nods his head and leaves the room.  Halfway down the hall he creaks the floor in the same spot, and the farmer again is awakened.  He yells up the stairway if it's the cat again, guy number two meows, and the farmer curses the cat again and goes back to bed.  

Guy number two gets back to the spare room and tells of his adventure, getting fist bumps from his buddies.  Guy number three can't wait any more and excitedly gets up to leave the room.  Guys number one asks if he's sure he can get past the creaky board, to which guy three says yeah, the cat, got it. He gets to the same spot in the hallway, and the board creaks yet again.  The farmer wakes up thus time as well and calls up the stairwell who goes there, to which guy number three replies ""The Cat!"" ",The Cat,2

An old couple were driving down a street in their neighborhood during a freak storm. Suddenly a tornado crosses the road and lifts their car. They're thrown about for several seconds before landing upside down in someone's yard. They're both shaken, but mostly alright. The wife crawls out of the wrecked vehicle and notices that all her clothes were ripped off during the chaos.

""Honey!"" the husband shouts, ""My leg is stuck, I can't get out! Go find help!"" 

""I'm naked! I'm not running down the street like this!"" she says in protest.

He grabs his shoe that was lying on the ceiling and tosses it to her. 

""Here, cover up and go find help!"" 

The wife places the shoe over her crotch and runs down the street. Luckily she spots a passing car and flags them down. 

""Excuse me, sir! My husband's stuck and he can't get out! Please help us!""

The driver looks at the shoe, pauses, and then looks at her again.

After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read- You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water, avoid heavy labor. It will be better in two weeks.

That evening, while thinking how amazing this new
technology was and how it would change medical
science forever,Jack began to wonder if it could be fooled.

He decided to give it a try.

He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from
his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter.
To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.

He went back to the drug store, located the computer,
poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00.? 

The machine again made the usual noises, flashed lights,
and printed out the following analysis.......

*1.*Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener.?

*2.*Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal
shampoo.?

*3.*Your daughter is getting’ screwed by three guys at
the same time and has urinary infection. Put her on
Antibiotic and keep a track of her outings.

*4.* Your wife is pregnant . . . twins. They aren’t yours.
Get a lawyer.

*5.* And Bastard, If you don’t stop masturbating, your
elbow will never get better!

the teacher went on to the 80s And when he got to 88%, He had
one paper remaining. I then asked myself,could I have scored a
90% in maths? I was feeling very anxious and happy now that I
knew I had proved the so called genius wrong, Could I have
gotten 88%? I thought my dreams have been answered......... The
whole class was amazed as every one kept looking at me. It was

The following day, the old man receives a response e-mail from his son: ""Beloved Father, please don't touch the garden. It's there that I have hidden 'the THING'. I love you, too, Ahmed"" 
At 4pm the US Army, The Marines, the FBI, the CIA and the Rangers visit the house of the old man, take the whole garden apart, search every inch, but can't find anything. Disappointed they leave the house. 
A day later, the old man receives another e-mail from his son. ""Beloved Father, I hope the garden is dug up by now and you can plant your potatoes. That's all I could do for you from here. I love you, Ahmed.""",An old Arab lived close to New York City for more than 40 years.,19

""Father, I've been thinking real hard about this and I just can't figure it out.""

The priest replies:

""Thinking about what, my son?""

""Well, I've been wondering, y'know, about wether God is a boy or a girl, and I'm just not sure.""

The priest chuckled then said:

""Well, you see, God doesn't really have a gender in the way you and I normally think of gender. In a way God is both; he's both male and female.""

The boy looked at the priest, thought about it, then nodded his head in understanding and ran off to play with his friends.

Next Sunday:

The boy comes back to the priest and says:

""Well, you know that thing you told me last week?""

""Yes.""

""I told my friends about it and they all agreed but they wanted me to ask you something else.""

""What is it?""

""They wanted me to ask you about wether God is black or white.""

The priest smirked and said:

""Well, again I'll have to say both.""

The boy thought about it and thanked the priest for his help.

A few minutes later the boy comes back with all of his friends and says:

""Well, we've all be talking and we had one more question for you.""

""Yes?"" The priest said.

""So, if God is both a boy and a girl; both black and white;
does that mean God is Michael Jackson?""",A boy walks up to a priest…,30
