However, by failing to bear a son, the king feared for the future of his kingdom. A daughter, was all that would remain of his line. 

So, to resolve this issue, the king came up with an offer. One day, he requested an audience with all of the bravest men in the village. He said ""I need to find an heir to my throne. But only the bravest warrior will be worthy of it."" 

Pointing to the highest cliff in the land he continued to say, ""Whoever shall be brave enough to dive off the cliff, survive the 100 foot drop, swim to the island 200 meters away whilst avoiding the sharks, run through the tiger infested island and retrieve the golden flower that blooms within, and make it back past the tigers, the sharks, and by scaling the 100 foot cliff again shall be named by heir. With this, you shall receive my blessing to wed my daughter, my gold and riches, and fortunes beyond your wildest dreams."" The challenge had been set. 

A large crowd gathered at the edge of the cliff, hoping to witness an act of bravery. A day passed without any takers. 

Two days...

Three days... 

On the fourth day, a brave man leaps off the cliff, and plunges into the water. Swimming with all his might, he avoids shark after shark. He reaches the island unscathed and dashes into the jungle. He reappears minutes later, clutching a golden flower, fleeing from a ravenous tiger. He dives back into the sea, and makes his way past the sharks again to the cliff. He scales it and minutes later, pulls himself up to a roar from the crowd. 

""Congratulations my boy!"", says the king. ""You have proven yourself worthy and I hereby give you, my daughters hand in marriage, my riches, and my fortunes."" 

The man, hands on his knees and panting from the debacle looks up to the king and says ""Look man, you can keep your shit. Juts find me the cunt who pushed me off the cliff."" ",A King's Offer,8

They decided to go to a therapist to try and sort it out. They are sitting together on a couch across from the doctor. The doctor asks the old farmer man. 

""What do you think is the issue with your sex life?""

The farmer responds ""Nothin' is the issue for me! It's all her, she never wants to have sex with me!""

So the therapist asks the farmer's wife ""what do you think is the issue?""

She responds ""we been married 30 years, and I am just not attracted to him anymore!""

The farmer is shocked. The therapist tells the farmer. ""The solution is simple, you need to do something new! You have to do something sexy to attract her.""


The next day the farmer is out in his cornfield. Driving around. His wife is inside the house cooking dinner. The farmer pulls up to the house, gets off his tractor, takes off his pants and starts fucking the exhaust. The wife sees out the window and runs out screaming.

""What the hell are you doing, what the fuck is wrong with you!?""

The farmer stops thrusting and looks at his wife with a confused look ""the doctor told me to do something sexy to a tractor...""",An old farmer couple is having sexual problems.,1

Aight so with that out of the way, the joke I can't remember is similar because it has a shouted punchline. But I just can't remember any details besides that.

To make the camel start walking, he must say 'few', to make it go faster he must say 'oh no', and to make it stop he must say 'amen'. Easy enough, thinks the man.
The next day, 'few' and he rides his steed until he comes to a fork in the road. His usual route takes him over flats but is heavily exposed to the sun. Worried for his new beast of burden, he takes the other route through the hills where it's shadier. Some time passes and, shock-horror, he realizes that he and his camel are approaching a cliff edge. Stricken with panic, he begins to babble ""Oh no, oh no..."" the camel going from a gentle canter, into a gallop and into a headlong sprint. Having forgotten the word to make it stop, he steeples his hands and shouts, ""Oh God, please let me survive this drop, amen!!"" and the camel halts at the very edge of the cliff.

The first time she realized this was when she got scared. There had been a noise in her room, coming from under her bed, or from the closet.

Julia ran down the hall, crying, “Mommy! Daddy!”

“What’s wrong, honey?”

“I huh-heard a m-monster,” Julia glubbed.

She expected them to comfort her, or roll their eyes, or get annoyed. Instead, they jumped up immediately and raced to her bedroom, where they checked under the bed, inspected the closet, and tested the window lock. They poked, prodded, and scoured every inch.

Julia caught on quickly. She knew what they were doing. By taking her fears seriously, they were showing their little girl that she was safe and loved. They had probably read about it in some book.
But the lesson Julia learned was that she had power. Thereafter, waking her parents became a nightly event. Julia would scream and cry, they would rush to her bedroom, and Julia would hide her grin behind tears. But not once did they ever complain.

One night she could stand it no longer, and she burst out laughing when Daddy fell down while examining the light fixture, as if a monster could fit up there.

“What’s so funny?” he asked, rubbing his backside.

“You,” Julia smirked. “You always believe me.”

Daddy wasn’t angry. He just looked at Mommy.

“Once,” he said quietly, “just once, we didn’t believe your brother.”

And Julia, an only child, did not sleep well that night.",[Long] A bump in the night....,2

First Bull: ""Boys, we all know I've been here 5 years. Once we settled our differences, we agreed on which 100 of the cows would be mine. Now, I don't know where this newcomer is going to get HIS cows, but I aint' givin' him any of mine."" 

Second Bull: ""That pretty much says it for me, too. I've been here 3 years and have earned my right to the 50 cows we've agreed are mine. I'll fight 'im till I run him off or kill 'im, but I'M KEEPIN' ALL MY COWS."" 

Third Bull: ""I've only been here a year, and so far you guys have only let me have 10 cows to ""take care of"". I may not be as big as you fellows (yet) but I am young and virile, so I simply MUST keep all MY cows."" 

They no sooner finished their big talk when an eighteen-wheeler pulls up in the middle of the pasture with only ONE ANIMAL IN IT: the biggest Son-of-Another-Bull these guys had ever seen! At 4700 pounds, each step he took toward the ground strained the steel ramp to the breaking point. 

First Bull: ""You know, it's actually been some time since I really felt I was doing all my cows justice, anyway. I think I can spare a few for our new friend."" 

Second Bull: ""I'll have plenty of cows to take care of if I just stay on the opposite end of the pasture from HIM. I'm certainly not looking for argument."" They look over at their young friend, the 3rd bull, and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns, and snorting. 

First Bull: ""Son, let me give you some advice real quick. Let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it."" 

Third Bull: ""Hell, he can have ALL MY COWS. I'm just making sure he knows I'm a bull!""

He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery in the Kentucky backcountry.

As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost and, being a typical man, I didn’t stop for directions.

I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.

I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.

And as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”

His friend replies ""Funny story. The same happened to me! Let's ask our rabbi about this.""

""No way! I like having an engineer on the staff - I'm keeping him!"" Satan says.

It finally happened. Can’t say its not expected. I am male. She came back from college and I we were talking in her room late that night. Her parents were both home, but I didn’t really think much of it at the time. We started talking. And there was this one thing I always wanted to ask her…and I did. So I lied down on her bed.

“ Is that alright for you?”

“ I’m a guy. I LIVE for this.”

“ Mmm.”

“ Could you…”

”You mean.”

“ A little more”

”Like this.”

“ No, the other”

”Is that it?”

“ Not quite just a little…”

”Here?”

“ OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH”

”You like that, huh?”

“ YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS”

”I didn’t know I could make you this happy. If I did, we could have done this much earlier.”

“ MMMMMMMMMMMM” 

“Are you drooling?” 

“Probably.”

Then her mom walked in. And we just looked up at her. She just looked at us funny. Then she opened her mouth. 

Mom: “What the hell are you two doing?”

Her: “What does it look like we’re doing?”

Me: “You don’t have to stop. Its your mom, not a hurricane.”

Then her dad walked in. And he kinda stared at us.

Me: Hiya.

Dad: Hey. How’s it going?

Me: Doing all right. This is really nice.

Dad: Is it? That looks fun. Can I get in on that?

Her: Uh-huh.

Me: Oh HELL NO. The line starts here. We’ll probably be finished up in about 5 minutes or so if you want to wait. 

Her: Yeah. I’ve got some extra time if you want to wait around, Dad.

Me: You and the mrs should try this sometime. Its really really relaxing and the stress is just melting away.

Dad: Oh, believe me. I’ve tried it. I’ve been married 23 years.

He looks to his wife.

Dad: Hey, why don’t we do that anymore? Just because the kids grew up does not, mean we should just stop. I mean…am I wrong?

Me: No, you’re not. I think its every wife’s prerogative to have an open mind occasionally.

Mom: There is no way that I am doing that. Not now at least. Dinners going to be on soon.

Then her 16-year-old brother walks in.

Brother: Hey man. What’s going on?

Me: Take a look. This feels really really good. I mean…your sister is really something else. This is almost bliss.

Brother: Really? Got room on that bed for 2?

Her: Actually, I’m almost done with him. Can you hang around for 5 minutes?

Brother: Sure.

Mom: Well, dinner’s ready in about 5 minutes, so you kids just go ahead and have fun. K?

A good-as-new Porsche, for 20 bucks. ""It's a prank,"" he thinks. ""Like that Hooters girl and the Toyota/'toy Yoda' thing."" Still, he's not really in need of $20, so he decides to be a good sport and humor the seller.

He drives out to the address in the ad and it's this big mansion, clearly owned by somebody who can at least afford a normal-priced Porsche. Waiting there is a little old lady who takes him into the garage; sure enough, inside is a full-size Porsche with barely a dent in it. He's still wary, though; maybe the engine is broken in a way that can't be repaired and doesn't show on the outside of the car? 

So he asks to take the car for a test drive, and it works like a charm. Finally convinced it's no joke, he pulls back up to the mansion to give payment. As he's doing so, he asks, ""Listen ma'am, the Porsche is great and all, but why sell it for so cheap?""

The woman begins, ""It used to be my husband's, you see...""

The man's face crumples, ""Oh, I'm so sorry...""

Patty explains that he will need to secure the loan with some collateral.

The frog says, “Sure . I have this,” and produces a tiny porcelain elephant, about an inch tall, bright pink and perfectly formed.

Very confused, Patty explains that she’ll have to consult with the bank manager and disappears into a back office.

She finds the manager and says, “There’s a frog called Kermit Jagger out there who claims to know you and wants to borrow $30,000, and he wants to use this as collateral.”

She holds up the tiny pink elephant. “I mean, what in the world is this?”

The bank manager looks back at her and says…

""Mommy, mommy! What are they doing?""

Flabbergasted by this situation, but wanting to spare her daughter's innocence, the mother says ""They're making cake, dear.""

The daughter thinks nothing of it and the family continues their journey at the zoo. Things soon go back to normal until they get to the kangaroos. The little girl sees two kangaroos getting hot and heavy, then tugs on her mom's arm. 

""Mommy, mommy! What are those kangaroos doing?"", asked the curious girl. 

The mother, thinking her white lie worked good enough last time repeated the same story to her daughter: 

""They're making cake, dear"". 

The girl thinks nothing of it, and the family moves on to more attractions at the zoo. Finally, they arrive at the tiger's den, and sure enough the little girl sees two tigers having their way with each other. Again, the little girl tugs on her mom's arm and points to the tigers. 

""Mommy, mommy! Are those tigers making cake, too?"" 

Thinking that this was rather cute, despite the circumstance, the mother plays along and says ""yes"". 

That night the family goes home, and later the daughter is fast asleep in her bed. After her dad checks on her he goes to the kitchen and approaches his wife, caressing her from behind, and whispers in her ear ""Why don't we go to the bedroom and make some of your own cake?"" 

The girl's parents do the deed all night, resulting in the mother making a late breakfast the next morning. While she's in the kitchen busy at the stove, the little girl comes up to her. 

""Mommy, mommy! You and dad made cake last night, didn't you?"" 

Dumbfounded beyond belief the mother trips her over her own words, until she gets her bearings. 

""How did you know?"", exclaimed the mother. ""Did you hear us?"" 

The little girl shakes her head. ""Uh uh."" 

""Did you see us?"" 

Again, the girl shakes her head. ""Nope!""

Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round.

I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength.

In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&amp;Ms. I consider this “grant money.”

The explained to the kids that they wouldn't be able to talk to them all the time because their phones wouldn't work. However they promised to call at least every few days. A week into their vacation, Sarah wanted to see how the family was doing so she called them from the hotel. Benny, barely age 10, picked up the phone. Sarah was delighted to hear him so she asked him how things were going. Benny replied bluntly, ""Spot died."" Sarah burst into tears and Tom who had overheard the conversation picked up the phone to talk to Benny. ""Benny,"" Tom said, ""You know how much your mom loved spot. You have to be more careful how you tell her things. You should've started slowly. When we called you today you should've said that spot keeps playing in the street. When we call you again next week, you say that it got hit by a car. In two weeks, you tell us that he's in the hospital and it doesn't look good. Finally, at then end of our vacation, you tell us that he passed away softly. This is called tact.""

""Alright Dad,"" Benny replied, ""I'm sorry. I understand.""

""Good,"" Dad responded, ""So how is everything else? How is grandma doing?""

The shop owner replied, a talking catapilla. Still confused the man said i will give it a try and took the catapilla home. 

All excited with his new pet he decides to take him for a walk. So the man opens the match box slightly and says to the catapilla. Fancy coming for a walk around the block? The catapilla didn't repy. So the man shut the match box and thought he must be sleeping and went on his walk.

The next morning he tried it again and asks the catapilla do you fancy a walk around the block? Same again not a peep from the catapilla. Now the man was unhappy he thought he has been scammed by the shop owner. And would return it the next day. 

A day later the man wakes up and opens the match box slightly for a peep. And says to the catapilla. Right we are going for a walk if you like it or not or I'm taking you back.

The wife was dismayed because no matter what she did to attract the husband's attention, he'd just shrug her off with some bored comment.

This went on for many months and the wife was going crazy with boredom. Then one day at a pet store, the wife saw this big, ugly, snorting bird with a hairy chest, powerful hairy forearms, beady eyes and dribble running down the side of its mouth.

The shopkeeper, observing her fascination with the bird, told her it was a special imported ""Goony bird"" and it had a very peculiar trait. To demonstrate, he exclaimed, ""Goony bird! The table!""

Immediately, the Goony bird flew off its perch and with single-minded fury attacked the table and smashed it into a hundred little pieces with its powerful forearms and claws! To demonstrate some more, the shopkeeper said, ""Goony bird! The shelf!""

Again the Goony bird turned to the shelf and demolished it in seconds.

""Wow!"" said the wife, ""If this doesn't attract my husband's attention, nothing will!"" So she bought the bird and took it home.

When she entered the house, the husband was, as usual, sprawled on the sofa guzzling beer and watching the game. ""Honey!"" she exclaimed, ""I've got a surprise for you! A Goony bird!""

The husband, in his usual bored tone replied, ""Goony Bird, my ass!""",The Goony bird.,1

Once there was a woman who had ninety kids. She had so many kids, that instead of giving them normal names, she gave them numbers, her oldest child was named One, and her youngest was named Ninety.

Once, this family's house burned down, and the fireman only found one survivor, and that was Ninety.

Ninety, being the youngest and was still just a toddler, was sent to an orphanage where she was raised and spent the rest of her childhood.

When Ninety was an adult, she had children of her own, three sons. She gave her children normal names though, they were named Peter, Alex, and Spencer.

One day, while the three were at the park, they came across a stray dog. Peter, Alex, and Spencer instantly fell in love with this dog and decided they *must* keep it as a pet. However, their mother hated dogs and they knew she would not allow them to keep one as a pet. So they kept the dog in secret. 

They had a plan to keep the dog in the basement. And then everyday, they would take turns going and caring for the dog. They also planned to call it ""This"". Because any normal name would make their mother suspicious of who they were talking about.

One night, when it was Spencer's turn to check on This, he came up and told his brothers that This had ran away. No one was able to find This after that night. No one except for those three brothers ever knew that This was a dog.

so without trouble he gets her a mug of punch which she happily empties. Then they enjoy some more.

Now it's well past midnight and they gotta go. So he gives her a ride home. There he learns that her parents are not at home and that she's all available - to him.

He immediately takes her upstairs to her room, rips open his fucking tux, rips open her fucking prom dress and starts to make passionate love to her.

Suddenly, while he's about to climax, he sees that she's all quiet. Like very quiet. So he asks her, ""Babe, you liking it?"" There's no reply.

This tendency extended to when it had come time to end the relationship.  Every time I got close to saying that I thought it was time for a break, or I couldn't do this any longer, she would suddenly remember something she had to do, something else we needed to deal with - or, better yet, something she'd picked up.    
  To provide a little background: in the over 5 years of our relationship, she had come to know my preferences and passions quite well.  One of my greatest weaknesses is for specialty dried fruits.  Just when things were at their worst, apricots rolled in cinnamon or plums soaked in exquisite liqueurs and sun-dried would appear on our apartment's lone table out of thin air.  Though I could never quite find out where it was located, she frequently ordered from some shop that dried and prepared grapes in the most incredible blends of spices and sweet flavorings I have ever tasted.

When he was a young child, they noticed something a bit peculiar about him, he refused to climb on-top of something that was above the ground. When they tried to pick him up off the ground he threw a fit and wouldn't stop crying until they put him back down. They decided that he would just have to crawl everywhere. When he was older and learned to talk, he started expressing his fear of getting off the ground. When he first went to school, the Physical Education teacher tried to get him to run but he refused. He said that to run he would have to have both of his feet off the ground and would rather have steak attached to him and have hound released on him than to have both his feet off the ground. His teacher said he could walk the mile but he would be graded based on how fast people his fellow students ran. When he started the mile, he was able to keep up with his fellow classmates. The PE teacher thought that he was going as fast as he could and that he would run out of energy. When they came around for the final lap, he noticed that Energy was able to keep up with everybody else. Thus began a long career of fast walking. By the time he was in high school, he was able to walk a 6 minute mile. He always wanted to break the 5:30 second walking mile. He trained and he trained all while never allowing both his feet to leave the ground. By this point, his parents were getting very angry because they couldn't drive anywhere with him because he always wanted his feet on the ground. They were also worried about what would happen to his back because he had only been sleeping on the ground so he could stay in contact with the ground. They decided to get a therapist to help him. After going to therapy to help him get over his fear, he was finally ready to try and go off the ground. The therapist had him sit on his table with his feet on the ground. Then she told him to lift his feet off the ground. This was the first time since he was a baby that he had been able to take his feet off the ground. He was ecstatic and climbed onto the table and stood on it. 

His therapist then told him ""You have a lot of potential, Energy.""",There once was a boy named Energy.,46

The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank’s president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. 

An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank’s underground garage and parks it there. 

Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, “Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. 

We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. 
What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?”

His advisors were notified and they in turn spoke in confidence with the pope. The Pope informs them that he needs a day to pray about it.

The next day the Pope summons his advisors and has the room sealed.
""My sons, after much prayerful consideration I have an answer. These are troublesome times and as such, it is not a good time to be without a leader of the church for even a short while. I have decided that you shall arrange for this most unusual treatment to preserve my life, for the good of the church, but on three conditions.""

""What are the conditions, Your Holiness?""

""First, the woman that you choose must be blind. For if she sees that she is with the pope, she may either get sense of self-importance as the only woman to ever bed a pope, or she may lose her faith in the sanctity of my station. She must be blind.""

""It will be so, what about the next condition?""

""For the same reason, she must also be deaf. While I try to be a righteous man, I am a man and as such I may cry out in pleasure during the act. She must not know that she is with the pope, so she must be deaf.""

""Very wise, it will be done. What is the third condition?""

The dog could point, flush and retrieve with the very best, and the friend offered to buy the dog at any price.

The General declined, saying that 'Sarge' was the very best bird dog he had ever owned and that he wouldn't part with him at any price.

A year later the same friend returned for another week of hunting and was surprised to find the General breaking in a new dog.

''What happened to ole ''Sarge'?' he asked.

''A friend came to hunt with me and couldn't remember the dog's name. He kept calling him 'Colonel'. 

After that, all that damn dog would do was sit on his ass and bark !!",A General Retired after 35 years,0
