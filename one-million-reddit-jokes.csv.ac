He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.

The woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.

They roll their eyes, but say, ""Okay.""

She's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.

She's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.

They congratulate her and invite her back the next week.

She smiles, and says, ""I'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45.""

The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.

Only this time, she plays left-handed.

The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.

They're totally amazed.

They can't figure her out.

She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.

They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.

The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.

This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.

The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.

However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.

This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.

They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, ""How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?""

The lady blushes, and grins. ""When my dad taught me to play golf, I learned that I was ambidextrous."" she replies. ""I like to switch back and forth.""

""When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.""

The guys think this is hysterical.

Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, ""What if it's pointing straight up?""

She says, ""Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.""","A woman joins a country club and when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, ""I played on my college's golf team. I was pretty good. Mind if I join you next week?"" No one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot‚Ä¶",42787

The plushie had several taped messages inside, telling children how to wash their hands properly and practice proper hygienic standards set bt the WHO.

The parents of the kids were overjoyed to know this, and within days, the plush toy had already sold out.

The laboratory took this as a success and was took over by more requests. They transitioned into a toy company as a result.

In December 2019, one of the plush toys went on auction in Wuhan, China. The proceeds would be donated to an American charity.

The auctioneer spoke. ""Alright, our starting price is $100. Anyone have $110? $115?""

One spoke up. ""$120!"" 

""$120, any more? Going once!""

""$150!"", a second one popped. A third one came in as quickly as the second, bidding $160. Then a fourth, a fifth...

...

""$2000!"" ""$2010!"", the eighteenth bidder stated.

""It's going good. Anybody else bidding?""

A woman spoke. ""$2020!"" Another voice popped up beside the person who had said it. It was her father. ""Yeah, same.""

""Nice. Nobody? Going once, going twice. And... sold for $2020!""

The auction went quite well, and the plush toy went into the hands of the woman and their father.

They were quite hungry afterwards, so they went to the seafood market nearby and bought a bunch of fish.

However, the dather felt sick, and they decided to go back to their hotel room while the woman bought some food for them both.

Over the next few days, the father's condition worsened. Their breathing got worse, they suffered a fever, and it was decided to bring them to the hospital.

After a few days, it was found that he had a new disease, which looked oddly similar to the plushie his daughter had bid for in the auction. 

This new disease rapidly spread around the world throughout 2020, becoming a pandemic. After becoming the subject of humiliation, the death of his daughter due to the illness, and various death threats, the father realized the laboratory's possible relation to the disease. He analyzed the plushie, and sure enough, traces of the virus causing the disease were on it. He looked up the company and threatened to sue it. 

The story became embedded in myth, and, centuries later, is still the leading myth on how the Virus of 2020 spread across the world.

The man became known not by his name, but by the disease, and the worst mistake he would ever make...

He got Co-bid 19.",They kept on bidding...,0

""What happened to Dr. Michaels?""

""I'm sorry to tell you this, Mrs. Lewis, but he retired a couple months ago. I'm Dr. Carradine, and I'll be performing your examination today."" The new Dr. gives her a reassuring smile, and she's still uncomfortable but tries to go with it. Dr. Michaels had been getting on in years, after all.

But then it was Dr. Carradine's turn to look uncomfortable as he began the examination. Mrs. Lewis couldn't figure out why that was, but the new Doctor looked visibly upset the entire time.

Finally, she had to know: ""Doctor, is there something wrong?""

""Well... no. No, everything's fine...""

As the exam went on, though, the new, young Doctor just didn't lose that look of being perturbed by something going on down there.

""Look, tell me what's going on! Right now!"" Karen blurted.

The new Doctor sighed, shook his head, and said, ""Well, I... I don't really know how to tell you this. There's nothing *wrong,* exactly, but...""

""But what!""

""Well, it's just that you've got the biggest vagina I've ever seen...""

Well, that was it. Karen was seething. She told Dr. Carradine that the examination was *Over*, got her clothing situated, and stormed out of the office. On her way home, though, she started to calm down and think about it. The doctor hadn't been trying to *insult* her... in fact, he'd gone out of his way to keep his mouth shut about what he was seeing until she blustered him into telling her. She decides she'd better have a look for herself.

She gets home, goes into the bedroom, then lays the full length mirror in the corner on the floor. She undresses and puts one foot on either side of the mirror, then looks down.

Just then, her husband leans around the door frame. ""Hi, honey, whatcha doin'?"" he asks, curious.

After the concert, at which they played Symphony No. 3, Op. 44, by Rachmaninoff, they were starting to head back to the school. A tuba player thought it would be funny to hide with the instruments under the bus. The conductor, pre occupied with the many students, didn't keep track of that one player.

 Back at the school, one of the other Tubists, who was in on the gag, jokingly said ""We must have left him at the concert hall."" The conductor, only now realizing that the kid was missing, told everyone to unload the bus, and he would go get the kid. 

Once the conductor was already leaving to get the kid, there was a scream. A girl had started to unload her instrument when they saw the Tubists, dead and crushed.

Soon, however, the curse darkened and diggers the man had hired to help work his claim began to die in bizarre ways. 

One was killed by an African scorpion that should never have made it to Alaska, let alone have survived the cold. A second drank a gallon of the mercury used to separate the gold from the ore.  A third was found with a tree growing up through his body.

The man himself who owned the claim became more and more pale. His eyes became all white. His skin began to give off an overpowering smell of sulfur. He slept all day and at night he wandered the mountain above his claim, coming back each day looking more like a beast than a man.

The curse became so bad the last worker alive ran away to the nearest town to tell the authorities what was happening at the claim. 

In an attempt to save the claim owner's life and lift the curse, a priest was brought in by dogsled to perform an exorcism on the man.

A sherriff from the town came with the priest as a bodyguard. 

The exorcism was long, but apparently successful. Immediately the man's color returned, the sulfur smell disappeared, and he was able to sleep through the night for the first time in six months.

After the man awoke, the sherriff immediately arrested the man and brought him back to town with the priest. Standing in front of the judge, the sherriff was asked what charge the law had against the claim owner whose life had just been so dramatically turned around. 

The sherriff looked at the man, then looked back at the judge and said in a slow and rumbling voice, ""Possession as a miner.""",A man with a gold claim in Alaska was cursed.,7

Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold
indeed,"" the meteorologist at the weather service
responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service
again. ""Is it going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied, ""it's definitely going to be a very cold winter."" The
Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""

When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.

After the community sing-along led by Alice at the piano, it was time for
the star of the show - Claude the Hypnotist!




Claude explained that he was going to put the whole audience into a trance.
""Yes, each and every one of you and all at the same time,"" said Claude.




The excited chatter dropped to silence as Claude carefully withdrew, from
his waistcoat pocket, a beautiful antique gold pocket watch and chain.




""I want you to keep your eyes on this watch"" said Claude, holding the watch
high for all to see.  ""It's a very special and valuable watch that has been
in my family for six generations,"" said Claude.




He began to swing the watch gently back and forth while quietly chanting,
""Watch the watch --- watch the watch ---- watch the watch""




The audience became mesmerized as the watch swayed back and forth.




The lights were twinkling as they were reflected from its gleaming
surfaces.  A hundred and fifty pairs of eyes followed the movements of the
gently swaying watch.




They were all hypnotized.




And then, suddenly, the chain broke!!!




The beautiful watch fell to the stage and burst into a hundred pieces on
impact.




""SHIT,"" shouted Claude.




It took them three days to completely clean up the Senior Citizens' Home and
Claude was never invited back again.",Claude the Hypnotist,24

They chat for a bit and eventually she decides she wants to take him home. The guy hesitates for a second, but eventually agrees.

At her place, they have some more alcohol and they start making out. The girl reaches for his belt and tries to unbuckle it, saying: ""I don't usually do this on a first date, but I'm willing to make an exception for you""

The guy gets really nervous, stands up, buckles his belt up again, scribbles a note of his phone number and says he has to go meet up with his friends again.

Confused, the next day the woman decides to text him. ""Heyy, I really liked having you around yesterday. How about another date tonight?""

The guy agrees. This time, they get in her bed and watch Netflix together. Again, whilst making out, the woman tries to unbuckle his belt, the guy makes up an excuse and leaves again.

And so it goes on. After their seventh date, the woman desperately texts him, asking why he won't have sex with her.
The guy finally confesses the problem. He tells her that he thinks he has a micropenis. She tells him she's been with guys with micropenises before, and that it's okay.

The next time they meet up, the guy finally built up enough courage to get his dick out. The woman looks at it, thinking it's not that bad at all. She looks him in the eye and says:
""I can't believe you've been this embarrassed about such a small thing all this time!""",A guy and his pals are going out for some beers,3

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.

Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.

""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""

The counselor asks her, ‚ÄúYou say you‚Äôve been married 20 years. So what seems to be the problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe wife replies, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my husband. He‚Äôs driving me crazy! I‚Äôm going to leave him if he continues!‚Äù
‚ÄúHow does he drive you crazy?‚Äù
‚ÄúFor 20 years,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs been doing these stupid things.

First, whenever we go out, he‚Äôs always looking at the floor and refuses to go near anyone. It‚Äôs very embarrassing.‚Äù
The marriage counselor is amused, ‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù
‚ÄúHe keeps picking his nose all the time! Even in public!‚Äù
‚ÄúHmm, anything else?‚Äù
The wife hesitates, ‚ÄúWhenever we‚Äôre making love, he NEVER lets me be on top! Once in a while, I‚Äôd like to be in control!‚Äù
‚ÄúAh,‚Äù says the counselor, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll talk to your husband now.‚Äù

So the wife goes out of the room and the husband says to the counselor, ‚ÄúFor years I‚Äôve been loving and considerate and I‚Äôve always given her what she wants! What could be the problem?‚Äù
The counselor explains, ‚ÄúShe says you‚Äôve got these habits that are driving her crazy. First, you‚Äôre always acting strange in public‚Äîlooking at the floor and never going near anyone else.‚Äù
The husband looks concerned, ‚ÄúOh, you don‚Äôt understand! It‚Äôs one of the few things my father told me to do on his deathbed and I swore I‚Äôd obey everything he said.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did he say?‚Äù
‚ÄúHe said that I should never step on anyone‚Äôs toes!‚Äù
The counselor looks amused, ‚ÄúActually, that means that you should not do anything that would cause anyone else to get angry.‚Äù
The husband looks sheepish, ‚ÄúOh. Okay.‚Äù

The counselor continues, ‚ÄúAnd you keep picking your nose in public.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs another thing my father specifically commanded me to do! He told me to always keep my nose clean.‚Äù
The counselor smiles. ‚ÄúThat just means you should stay out of trouble.
And,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúfinally, she says that you never allow her to be on top during your lovemaking.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù says the husband, ‚Äúis the last thing my father commanded me to do on his deathbed, and it‚Äôs the most important thing.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat did he say?‚Äù

Even though she seemed dumb and stupid, he knew that she was in for the money and that once he dies she will inherit everything he owns since he had no sons. ‚ÄúWhat the heck, why don‚Äôt I choose her? An obvious gold digger,  but why do I care? I have no children and I want some fun before I get too old. I don‚Äôt need bussiness companions, I need fun!‚Äù

A month later he met Margharet, an Australian hardworking housewife. She was born in the wild Australian outback and learned to fight with wild animals at a young age. ‚ÄúA heck of a housewife! I pay my housekeepers and maids 10.000¬£ a day in total and I can‚Äôt fuck them. Not only will I save money, but I also get to fuck her! Money means nothing to her, she only likes me because I go hunting and trekking often. If I get too old and boring will she leave me?‚Äù

So, who did Mr. Mann choose?

The one with the biggest tits, obviously!",Mr. Mann‚Äôs choice,0

So imagine my mild mannered German 70 year old great uncle calmly telling this joke to the whole table. I had never heard him tell a joke before. It's still one of my favourite jokes*]

A man wins the lottery after years of crippling debt and financial stress.

His first idea is to quit his horrible job. Upon arrival at work and before he can say anything, he is summoned to the office of his boss.

""I'm sorry, but we have to let you go due to changed priorities. As this is not your fault, you will be compensated with a severance pay of $50,000. I'll be happy to introduce you to any future employer. Again, I'm very sorry.""

Astonished and surprised, the man leaves his former work place and thinks about his next plans.

He decides to buy his dream car. 

At the car dealership, he is greeted by confetti, flowers and large banderole reading ""Congratulations, customer #100,000!""

As the prize is a fancy sports car, he enthusiastically speeds home to finally tell his wife.

Stepping into his home, he slowly tip-toes from room to room to be able to surprise her.
After nearly checking the whole house, it almost seems like his wife is not at home, even though the door was not locked.

Suddenly he sees that the ladder to the attic is lowered. Slowly ascending, he is overcome by a strong suspicion and starts to breathe heavily.

And yes: there she is, dangling from a rope, a chair toppled over, a suicide note on the neatly placed shoes on the floor.

The man stands silent for a minute and finally speaks to himself.

One example that stands out was that of Sir John. A strong and noble knight who had a short temper when it came to his family name. He spent his days upholding the rules laid out for him and drinking inordinate amounts of ale.

Two peasants ran up to an intoxicated Sir John and blurted ‚Äúyour mom‚Äôs a rocket, man!‚Äù

Three seconds later, the usually steel faced knight slapped the bums across their faces. It took no longer than a few minutes for the king himself to show up with a sickle in an attempt to flex his muscles. He decreed ‚Äúit shall be as such. One limb for each of the men you have dishonoured.‚Äù As the peasants pinned Sir John down at his right side. The king began to swing.

Five slices, it took to remove Sir John‚Äôs appendages. Unfortunately he died of blood loss at the scene. The king was so excited to have made an example of a senior member of the military that he rode off on his horse with unprecedented haste, swinging the arm &amp; leg around as trophies.

Eight rebel knights and three of their squires decided to hold a ceremony for their departed John. A funeral for a friend. As John‚Äôs corpse was being lowered into the grave, his widow came running down from the keep, yelling for the men to stop. 

Thirteen strides, the fair maiden took. All in attempt to hold her beloved once more. She made it to the valley and to her husband. She lay with his dead head in her arms. Love lay bleeding in her hands.

Twenty one years later, the lady Fibonacci was telling the story to her kids, on her deathbed. The legend of sir John and the mockery of the old rule.

The 3 princes were old enough for him to decide, so he gives them each a duck. The king says, "" which ever of you sale your duck for the most money will be the heir to the throne. Go my sons fulfill this task.""

The eldest prince leaves...

A little later on the middle prince leaves...

Finally the youngest son leaves, as he's walking thru the woods he thinks to himself, ""I've never sold a thing in my life, the kingdom could never be mine""

He walks hopelessly around the woods and eventually runs into a beautiful woman bathing in a pond. He is struck. He approaches her and says, ""Excuse me ma'am you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I will give you this duck for sex"". 

She agrees. 

When they finish he hands her the duck. She looks at the duck confused on what to do with it and says to the prince, ""I will return this duck for one more go 'round"".

He agrees. 

After they got finished the prince heads back to the kingdom as its getting dark. He feels defeated as he is walking back duck still in hand. 

Suddenly the duck jumps out of his hands and an 18 wheeler suddenly runs it over flat! Devestated he picks up his flat duck. At that moment a guy on a 4 wheeler pulls up and says to the prince holding the flat duck, ""Whoa! That's a bad ass duck dude I'll give you 5 dollars!""

The prince agrees and heads back to the kingdom and all the princes meet back with their father. The eldest prince says, ""I sold my duck for 1 dollar!"" The second goes, ""that's nothing I sold mine for 2 dollars!"" The third prince smiling, says, ""I got fuck for a duck. Duck for a fuck. And 5 dollars for one fucked up duck!""","A King must give his kingdom to one of his sons, he gives them each a duck and a task...",18

They begin to get cold and hungry. The mathematician gets the idea to start a campfire for warmth and cooking. The problem is that they do not have any wood. The chemist then suggests to go out and find some loose twigs and burn them.

As they venture out, the chemist hits the jackpot. Hundreds of stumps of wood are stacked up in a pile near their campsite. The difference between this wood is that it‚Äôs placed there for campers. None of the wood there came from the trees in the forest that they were camping in. He comes back with some wood and tells the mathematician about it.

‚ÄúCheck this out. I found a huge pile of wood up north of our campsite not very far away. We can take just a few stumps and we will be good for campfire fuel for the rest of the time we are here.‚Äù

The mathematician hesitated but the chemist ignores him and continues to take wood from the mysterious free pile.

When the chemist gets back he sees the mathematician with some wood and an axe. Curious about what‚Äôs going on the chemist asks him about it.

Chemist: ‚ÄúWhere did you get that wood? Why do you have an axe with you?‚Äù

Mathematician: ‚ÄúI used the axe to get some wood from some nearby trees.‚Äù

Chemist: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre killing trees for no reason. Why wouldn‚Äôt you just take from the abundance of wood in the huge pile that I‚Äôve been getting it from?‚Äù

Mathematician: ‚ÄúBecause I prefer natural logs.‚Äù",A chemist and a mathematician are going camping in the woods.,3

staff. While waiting for the coffee machine to finish its brewing, the
colonel decided to pose a question to all assembled.

He explained that his wife had been a bit frisky the night before and
he failed to get his usual amount of sound sleep. He posed the
question of just how much of sex was ""work"" and how much of it was
""pleasure?"" A Major chimed in with 25-75% in favor of work . 
A Captain said it was 50-50%. A lieutenant responded with 25-75% in
favor of pleasure , depending upon his state of inebriation at the
time.

There being no consensus, the colonel turned to the PFC (Private First Class) who was in
charge of making the coffee. What was HIS opinion?

Without any hesitation, the young PFC responded, ""Sir, it has to be
100% pleasure.""

The colonel was surprised and, as you might guess, asked why.

""Well, sir, if there was any work involved, the officers would have me
doing it for them.""",Is sex work?,487

On the last day of his trip he hooked a monster fish and proceeded to reel it in.

The guide, holding a net, yelled, 'Look at the size of that Son of a B#tch!'

'Son, I'm a priest. Your language is uncalled for!'

'No, Father, that's what kind of fish it is - a Son of a B#tch fish!'

'Really? Well then, help me land this Son of a B#tch!'

Once in the boat, they marveled at the size of the monster.

'Father, that's the biggest Son of a B#tch I've ever seen'

'Yes, it is a big Son of a B#tch. What should I do with it?'

'Why, eat it, of course. You've never tasted anything as good as Son of a B#tch!'

Elated, the priest headed home to the rectory.

While unloading his gear and his prize catch, Sister Mary inquired about his trip.

'Take a look at this big Son of a B#tch I caught!'

Sister Mary gasped and clutched her rosary, 'Father!'

'It's OK, Sister. That's what kind of fish it is, a Son of a B#tch fish!'

'Oh, well then, what are you going to do with that big Son of a B#tch?'

Sister Mary informed the priest that the new Bishop was scheduled to visit in a few days and that they should fix the Son of a B#tch for his dinner.

'I'll even clean the Son of a B#tch', she said.

As she was cleaning the huge fish, the Friar walked in.

'What are you doing Sister?'

'Father wants me to clean this big Son of a B#tch for the new Bishop's Dinner'

'Sister! I'll clean it if you're so upset! Please watch your language!'

'No, no, no, it's called a Son of a B#tch Fish.'

'Really? Well, in that case, I'll fix up a great meal to go with it, and that Son of a B#tch can be the main course!

Let me know when you've finished cleaning that Son of a B#tch.'

On the night of the new Bishop's visit, everything was perfect. The Friar had prepared an excellent meal. The wine was fine, and the fish was excellent.

The new Bishop said, 'This is great fish, where did you get it?'

'I caught that Son of a B#tch!' proclaimed the proud priest.

'And I cleaned the Son of a B#tch!' exclaimed the Sister.

The Friar added, 'And I prepared the Son of a B#tch, using a special recipe!

The new Bishop looked around at each of them. A big smile crept across his face as he said, 'You mother f---ers are my kind of people!'

After awhile he asked her if there was anything that he could do for her. She thought for a little bit and said, ""Make love to me. Eat my pussy.... Fuck me like you never have before...""

He thought this was a little much in her condition, but since It might be one of the last times he sees her he decided to comply.

Well.. he walked in and they talked, and she requested they make passionate love again, and again he complied.

After about 5 days of this she had fully recovered, and was able to go home. She walked into the living room to find that Joe was crying.

Lawyers should never ask a Mississippi grandma a question if they aren't prepared for the answer.

In a trial, a Southern small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness, a grandmotherly, elderly woman to the stand. He approached her and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know me?' She responded, 'Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'

The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?'

She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a 
youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'

The defense attorney nearly died.

The judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said,

'If either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the electric chair.'‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",Mississippi Grandma,7

Right under the surface swims a fish. ""Yummy, when the spider jumps down on the water strider, I'm gonna shoot up and eat them both!""

Close to the shore lurks a bear. ""When the spider jumps down on the water strider, and the fish shoots out of the water, I'm gonna catch it midair and have a nice meal!""

On the other side of the lake patiently waits a hunter. ""When the spider jumps down on the water strider, and the fish shoots up to eat them both, and the bear comes out to catch the fish, I'll shoot the bear!""

Next to the hunter sits a small, tiny mouse. ""When the spider eats the water strider, and the fish the spider, and the bear the fish, and the hunter shoots the bear, he'll be distracted so I can steal the cheese sandwich from his bag.

Next to the mouse sneaks a cat. ""When the spider gets the water strider, the fish the spider, the bear the fish, the hunter the bear, then the mouse will come out so I can catch it!""

All is thought and done. The spider jumps down and catches the water strider. Suddenly, the fish shoots up and catches them both, only to be caught midair by the bear. The hunter aims and shoots the bear. The mouse snatches the cheese. The cat runs to the mouse, trys to catch it, misses and falls straight into the lake.

Year after year, Ethel would ask Lester ""Honey, can we go on a helicopter ride?""

Being brought up during the Great Depression his reply was always ""Honey, that ride is twenty dollars, and twenty dollars is twenty dollars.""

This time, the man running the helicopter rides overhears the conversation and chimes in ""Look, you two have been coming here year after year and never once have you taken a ride. Tell you what: I'll make you a deal. If I take you on a ride, and you can manage to stay silent the entire time, it's on the house.""

Ethel exclaims ""Oh please Lester! I can be quiet, and I know you can. Let's face it, we're both getting on in years, this could be our last chance!""

Lester relents, and agrees.

They climb into the helicopter and the pilot takes off. He does everything he can to get a reaction from the two. Going up, down, side to side... If you could do a barrel roll in a helicopter, he'd've done it. When their time is up, he starts letting the copter down and prepares to land, saying ""I'm pretty impressed. I did things that even scared me, but you two didn't make a peep. Congratulations, this one's on me.""

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and then put the cat in the backyard. When our Uber arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our parakeet we didn't want to leave them unchaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again. Because I didn't want the Uber driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. 

A few minutes later he got into the Uber all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the car pulled away, ""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and I had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so I grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat ass down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""

""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday."" 

I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.

My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, 
""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" 
It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me."" 

I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""

We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. 

She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. 
We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?"" 

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" 
She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""

After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, 
""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""

""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.
