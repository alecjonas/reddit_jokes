I only had a savings account so I didn't have an ATM card at the time. There was always this cute chick working there. She'd always smile and greet me, and I'd always try to go to her line. As she was a bank teller, I only saw her sitting down. This is important later. One day, I just work up all the confidence I can and I ask her out as I'm taking out some money.
She said yes! So we set up a time around the weekend for me to come over and pick her up. She gives me her number, I get her address, and I skip home (not literally, but you know) as happy as can be. So it's the weekend, and I drive up to her house in my little beat up honda.
I knock on her door and her dad answers. A split second of ""oh shit"" comes over me, but he just gives me this heartwarming smile and invites me into this house. I instantly feel at ease and we go sit down in the living room. Her dad is all happy like ""i'm so glad you're taking my daughter out"" and ""i really really appreciate it"" and all this crazyness. So i'm starting to think to myself ""uh oh what have i gotten myself into""
So her dad reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of car keys. He says ""I want you to take my car."" I said ""No thats okay I have my car""
He's all like ""no no no"" practically forcing the keys into my hand. Still keeping his big smile on his face. No sooner does he give me the keys than do I hear from up the stairs ""BZZZZZZZZZZ""
No shit, she's in a wheelchair! A split second of shallow human being comes over me, but I think about it and say to myself "" I can do this! She's awesome and has a great personality, fuck it!""
We go outside, and I realize why her dad wanted me to take his truck. It was all rigged up with the belts and harnesses and the door that came all the way out for the wheelchair. So I took his truck, and we head to the movies. Best part? The handicap spot!
So we're in the theater, and no sooner does the movie start, than she starts putting her hands on my junk! She's a freak! That's totally cool with me! We start making out almost during the whole movie.
My parents are out of town that weekend, so I ask her if she wants to come back to my place. She says Yes so we get back in her dads truck and we're on the way to my house.
We arrive at my house, I have stairs, so I have to carry her inside. Thankfully my room is on the first floor. So i get her inside, throw her on the bed, and we start going at it.
I've got her in missionarry position, it's pitch black in my house and i'm pounding the fuck out of her, when all of a sudden i hear a ""POP""
Sure as shit, her leg fucking comes off. She's got a fake fucking leg! How did I miss that shit?
""KEEP GOING"" she screams as I pull her leg and throw that shit across the room.
So I'm fucking her and fucking her and sure as shit, I hear another POP!

""5 pounds and in you go"" replied the Entertainer.

The old fella moves into the tent and looks at the donkey before whispering into its ear.

The donkey looked at the old man and started to laugh. The Entertainer is stunned.

""How...? I... but how?"" he stammered

""My secret but I do believe you owe me one thousand pounds"" the old man beamed.

Paid his winnings, the old man leaves.

The next day the Entertainer is back.

""Ladies and Gentlemen, The one who can make my Donkey cry, without physical contact, will win one thousand pounds"" shouted the Entertainer.

Many, once again, tried and failed. Throughout the day the donkey remained dry eyed. As it started to get late the old man, who made the donkey laugh, appeared.

""Ahh you again, I take it you would like to try?"" the Entertainer asked.

""Yes"" the old man replied.

The fee paid, the old man walks into the tent and faces the donkey. He opens his coat and the donkey stares, after a few seconds the Donkey bursts into tears.

The Old man exits the tent triumphantly. The Entertainer cannot believe it.

After kicking for hours they finally reach the shoreline, completely exhausted.  The Japanese dude gets up and sprints with deer-like speed into the jungle.  The American and French dudes look at each other and shrug, then get to work.

""have you taken drugs or something?"" The drunk asks

""Nope just getting high on what I am doing."" The strange man laughs.

""How?"" the drunk is curious but a little dubious too.

""Come stand on the manhole and jump as high as you can and then at the peak of your jump shout 13"" The strange man explains.

""Why 13?"" 

""Why not?"" The strange man replies.

So the drunk stands on the manhole and jumps up as high as he can and shouts 13.

""No, no, no, no. Higher and louder"" the strange man shouts

Again the drunk jumps but higher and shouts even louder, after a couple of jumps he starts to feel good.

""Oh shit, you're right. I'm starting to feel good"" the drunk shouts happily and begins to jump again.

Just as the drunk reaches the peak of his jump the strange man yanks the manhole cover off and lets the drunk fall to his death. He places the cover back on and continues to do what he did before the drunk arrived.

A politician shows up at the Pearly Gates, and asks to come in.

""Not so fast,"" says St. Peter. We have a special routine for your kind. First you spend a day in Hell, then a day in Heaven. Once you've tried both, then you get to choose where you want to spend Eternity.""

With that the politician finds himself in the middle of Hell. It looks like a golf course, and all his friends are there, drinking, banqueting, and generally having a great time. Before he knows it, a very pleasant 24 hours have passed, and he finds himself in the middle of Heaven. He floats on clouds, sings with the Heavenly Host, and before he knows it, another very pleasant 24 hours have passed, and he finds himself once again at the Pearly Gates, standing before St. Peter.

""Gee,"" stammers the politician. ""I never thought I'd say this, but actually I think I'd like Hell better.""

Once again, he politician finds himself in the middle of Hell. But this time it's a burning refuse heap, and all his famished and parched friends are picking through it for dung to eat.

""What's going on here!?"" demands the politician. ""This isn't anything like it was yesterday!""

Behind him the Devil chuckles, ""Yesterday, we campaigned. Today, you voted.""

And as we wind on down the road

Our shadows taller than our soul.

There walks a lady we all know

Who shines white light and wants to show

How everything still turns to gold.

And if you listen very hard

The tune will come to you at last.

When all are one and one is all

To be a rock and not to roll.

...

AND NOW

Today i-is Friday, Friday

The old rooster says to him, ""I know the farmer bought you to replace me, but give me one chance to prove my worth.  We'll race around the barn for ten laps.  If I win, you leave, but if you win, I'll leave.  To make it fair, I just want a 50 foot head start.""

The young rooster knows he's in way better shape, and that even a 50 foot head start won't help the old rooster, so he agrees.  

The race begins and after one lap the young rooster has started closing in on the old rooster, he's only 30 feet behind.  After two laps he's 15 feet behind.  After three laps he's one foot behind when BLAM!!  

Suddenly there's nothing left of the young rooster but a big bloodstain on the barn wall.  Standing across the barnyard is the farmer, holding a smoking shotgun.

You'll need to spend a few rounds as a Tibetan monk or Mississippi slave to save up enough God coins to unlock the exclusive angel-cake skin. By choosing white you get a “likely to be well received by strangers” bonus; random encounters will have a 25% greater chance of yielding favorable results (unless you're in bizarro world, aka gangland, where all stats have the opposite effect and are twice as powerful).

The only time I doubt the power of whiteness  to work in my favor is when I abruptly have to hide outside at night. My skin is one shade off from reflective; I was never very good at manhunt. But I'm an adult now and I need no longer evade members of my peer group pursuing me on foot. At this age and skin color, the authority in my world is mostly stationary. It's like vegetation that  you walk around. Police officers are poison ivy. White people have to grab them with their bare hands before there's any lasting repercussion. 

The one thing white people have to fear from cops is the taser, but what actually scares them isn't being tasered; it’s watching a viral video of yourself being tasered (convulsing and diarrhea-ing as you clutch your shoplifted Keurig). 

White people aren't afraid of getting shot by cops because we know cops would rather not shoot us. Every time a cop has shot a white person it's because he accidentally drew his gun instead of his taser. Granted, cops did intentionally use guns on white people before the invention of tasers, but only while wishing that something like tasers existed, primarily because shooting white people carries things like consequences (good to have around when you'd rather not get murdered).

The traveler asks if he could stay the night,   and the Chinese guy agrees -- as long as he doesn't sleep with his granddaughter.

This is not a case of twisting, but of the refined manner of presentation by witty minds. A good case for reference.

One evening, after attending the theatre, two gentlemen were walking down the avenue when they observed a rather well dressed and attractive young lady walking ahead of them. One of them turned to the other and remarked, ""I'd give $250 to spend the night with that woman.""

Much to their surprise, the young lady overheard their remark, turned around, and replied, ""I'll take you up on that offer.""

She had a neat appearance and a pleasant voice, so after bidding his companion good night, the man accompanied the young lady to her apartment. The following morning, as he prepared to leave, the man gave her $125.

She demanded the rest of the money, stating, ""If you don't give me the other $125 I'll sue you for it.""

He laughed, saying ""I'd like to see you get it on these grounds.""

Within a few days, he was surprised when he received a summons ordering his presence in court as a defendant in a lawsuit. He hurried to his lawyer and explained the details of the case. His lawyer said, ""She can't possibly get a judgment against you on such grounds, but it will be interesting to see how her case will be presented.""

After the usual preliminaries, the lady's Lawyer addressed the court as follows:
""Your Honour, my client, this lady, is the owner of a piece of property, a garden spot, surrounded by a profuse growth of shrubbery, which property she agreed to rent to the defendant for a specified length of time for the sum of $250. The defendant took possession of the property, used it extensively for the purposes for which it was rented, but upon evacuating the premises, he paid only $125, one-half of the amount agreed upon. The rent was not excessive, since it is restricted property, and we ask judgment be granted against the defendant to assure payment of the balance.""

The defendant's Lawyer was not only surprised but also impressed AND amused by the way his opponent had presented the case. Naturally, his defence was somewhat different from the way he had originally planned to present it. He rose to the occasion!

'Your Honour,"" he said, ""my client agrees that the lady has a fine piece of property, that he did rent such property for a time, and a degree of pleasure was derived from the transaction. However, my client found a well on the property around which he placed his own stones, sunk a shaft, and erected a pump, all labor performed personally by him. We claim these improvements to the property were sufficient to offset the unpaid amount, and that the plaintiff was adequately compensated for the rental of said property. We, therefore, ask that judgment not be granted.""

The young lady's lawyer answered, ""Your Honour, my client agrees that the defendant did find a well on her property. However, had the defendant not known that the well existed, he would never have rented the property. Also, upon evacuating the premises, the defendant removed the stones, pulled out the shaft, and took the pump with him. In doing so, he not only dragged the equipment through the shrubbery, but left the hole much larger than it was prior to his occupancy, making the property much less desirable to others. We, therefore, ask that judgment be granted.""

In the Judge's decision, he provided for two options, ""Pay the balance $125 to the plaintiff, or have the equipment detached from its current location and provided to the plaintiff for damages.""

The defendant wrote out a cheque immediately.",A Well-Argued Court Case,491

The Republican is opening the gates, when Peter declares, ""Not so fast...""

""I take it,"" Peter continues, ""that nobody has explained the procedure to you yet...""

""What's the procedure?"" asks the Republican.

""Everyone who has just made it to the afterlife,"" Peter continues, ""has to spend one day in Heaven and one day in Hell, so that they can choose one for spending eternity.""

""That's okay,"" the Republican replies. ""I'll be fine just taking Heaven.""

""I'm afraid,"" Peter interjects, ""that I'm not allowed to skip the part about the first two days.""

""Rules are rules,"" Peter explains.

""Rules?"" the Republican asks, puzzled. ""I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that...""

""Off to Hell you go,"" Peter declares before the Republican can finish, pulling a lever.

The Republican senator looks around and realizes that he is on an escalator going down.

""Oh, H-E-double hockey sticks..."" the Republican mutters as the escalator reaches the bottom.

A set of double doors opens, and the senator walks through and sees that he's on a golf course.

The course is quite verdant and the air is crisp, and an elegant clubhouse lies in the distance.

Some men in fine evening wear rush out to greet him, and the Republican realizes that they are his friends from the Senate's Republican caucus, as well as some friends he had from the House of Representatives and the State Senate.

The senator joins them for their game, and then for a seven-course dinner including lobster and champagne.

The group is joined by the devil, a pale fellow in a flight jacket, with big ears and brown hair that is now mainly gray.

Everyone is very happy, and they laugh, joke, and tell stories about the old times, with all the kickbacks they took, the lies they told, and the stupid people they manipulated with fear and calls to nationalism.

As the night is drawing to a close, the Republican senator turns to the devil to address him.

""You know,"" states the Republican senator, ""H-E-double hockey sticks is nothing like I thought it was going to be.""

""And it's so weird that you're the devil,"" he continues, ""and that you seem so much smarter down here.""

""Always the one you least suspect, eh?"" the devil asks.

""Well, actually..."" the senator mutters but is cut off by the devil.

""I'm afraid that it's time for your day in Heaven, though,"" notes the devil, pulling a lever.

Again, the Republican is on an escalator, but going up.

""Oh, fudgesicles,"" the Republican mutters. ""Why do I have to go to this Heaven place?""

Soon, he reaches St. Peter again, and goes through the double doors.

The Republican finds himself in a place with black marble floors and moving, color lights.

Some rock music is playing noticeably in the background, but the senator can't figure out the source.

""This is that stuff that's probably filled with the backwards lyrics about not sitting still and obeying,"" the Republican mutters to self.

Just then, he notices that he's being met by six females who each look about twenty-one, with gorgeous faces and thick, wavy hair, flat stomachs, tight butts, and long, thin legs, clad in revealing lingerie and high heels.

""What are these odd, sinful creatures?"" the Republican muttered. ""And why does one look like the players from that Negro League. Their kind isn't supposed to be allowed in...""

His musings were cut off by one of the girls, who said, ""Hi, I hear you're new here. We try to give everyone a nice welcome, so you get all six of us. You want to go upstairs?""

""Why?"" the Republican asked. ""Is O'Reilly playing on a TV there?""

The girl giggled, then said, ""No, we were going to play.""

""Bingo?"" the Republican inquired, excited. ""Great, I'm a master at G52!""

""No,"" the girl responded, giggling again. ""we had something better in mind. Actually, you can have me first, all three ways.""

""Wait,"" the Republican responded, confused, ""so we'll do regular Bingo, then corners, and postage stamp?""

The girl, now very amused, contined, ""Actually, we can..."" then leaned over and whispered in his ear.

The Republican yelped, and then ran into the bathroom, where he locked the door and crouched down by the toilet, in tears.

After an hour, he managed to crawl up, where he saw some dispensers on the wall.

""Why, these are those sin balloons,"" he noted, before picking up a bottle next to the sink and wondering, ""and what is this odd, gooey substance?""

Eventually, the night passed, and he heard a knocking on the door.
""Are you okay in there?"" called Peter. ""Because it's time for you to make your decision...""

The Republican senator cautiously opened the door, and peered around to make sure the girls were gone.

""You've experienced a day in Heaven and a day in Hell,"" Peter noted. ""So where would you like to spend eternity?""

""I can't believe I'm saying this after all I'd heard on Earth,"" the Republican replied, ""but I much preferred the other place... you know, H-E-double hockey sticks. I'd like to go there.""

""Sure thing, Republican,"" Peter responds while reaching for a lever, ""go to Hell.""

Before he knows it, the Republican senator is back on the escalator, heading down.

""Fine and dandy,"" notes the Republican as the double doors open.

He walks out and finds himself in a barren land, covered with garbage and with flames occasionally bursting from the ground.

His friends are in rags, picking up endless streams of trash and getting poked with pitchforks, as they move along a floor of hot coals.

The devil appears and the senator approaches him.

""I don't get it,"" cries the Republican. ""Yesterday I played golf and drank champagne. My friends had fancy clothing and the land was picturesque. 

This place looks painful, and everyone looks miserable. 
What happened?""

Of course, human cloning being illegal, their staff was limited to a select few that had both the credentials and the disregard for rules that was considered essential to be a successful researcher at the facility.  And then, naturally, there were the volunteers.  


Many of the volunteers were quite popular with the scientists, but chief amongst them was Benny.  Benny was the picture of human health, over 6 feet tall and in great shape due to the rigorous exercise regimen set for the subjects.  As expected, Benny becomes the first human to be cloned en masse, owing to his impressive physical abilities.  


The cloning process goes beautifully, with the facility now churning out dozens of new Bennies.  However, there was one oddity that was observed.  Every cloned Benny had experienced a pronounced growth in body hair, enough to make each Benny appear more like Bigfoot than Adonis.  


 Curious, the scientists decided to take a random Benny from the barch of clones and shave all of his hair off.  They dosed the Benny and put him under, restraining him and systematically shaving off the body hair that covered every inch of skin.  Before long, they had completed their work, and sat back to watch in amazement the physical perfection that the Benny had hidden beneath so much hair.  


At that moment, the heart monitor starts to beep frantically, eventually emitting a continual tone as the Benny's heart stopped.  Somehow, shaving a Benny resulted in his death.  Devastated, the scientists  solemnly bring the Benny to the crematorium on-site.  There is a quick service, a moment of silence, and a goodbye to the unfortunate Benny.  His body is then burned, leaving behind only some ash, given back to the scientists in an urn.  This happens a few more times, each experiement ending in failure, with no further understanding of the relationship between the Bennies and their hair.  Soon, unable to take the grief, the scientists decide to halt the research into the Bennies' hair.  



Eventually, the director of the facility comes by the lab, and asks the chief scientist whether they would be continuing with the research into the cause of the overgrown body hair on the Bennies.  The scientist, outraged and in mourning, grasps a jar full of a Benny's ashes and answered,

_________________________________________________

So, there once was a man named John, living in Kansas.  He'd lived his life in the ""right way,"" whatever that means.  He went to school, never did drugs, never drank underage, always went to church, went on to a good college, and eventually to a great job at a great company.  

However, throughout all of his life he had never found ""the one.""  Always, there was a part of him that felt...empty.  

One day, he decides - once and for all - to go out into the world and find somebody that could fulfill his life, mending the void inside him.  As luck would have it, during a business trip to Beijing, he meets an absolutely gorgeous woman named Mei Chin.  She was stunningly beautiful, with a brilliant mind to match.  They hit it off immediately, and after months of perfect romance, he pops the question.  She says yes, of course.  

The wedding goes fabulously, and around the same time, John gets to meet all of Mei's family.  He especially got along with her brother, Wu Xiang Chin.  Unfortunately, he never did get very good at Chinese, and after repeated difficulty pronouncing Wu Xiang's name, they agree to simply refer to his brother-in-law as Chin, or sometimes ""Skinny Chin,"" as he was so thin that his own family frequently called him ""Skinny.""  

After the honeymoon, he settles down with Mei in the little village she grew up in, with all of her extended family nearby.  Life is simply beautiful.  He and Mei tended to their little farm, raising chickens and growing vegetables, selling what they did not need to provide the extra income for what luxuries they could afford.  They were not wealthy by any means, but it was a happy life.  

Until...one fateful day.  A group of bandits that had wreaked havoc in the surrounding communities had finally descended on the little village, intent on pillaging what they could to feed their growing numbers.  Before long, the bandits arrive at John and Mei's little farm, and demand that they hand over the chickens.  Now, while the chickens didn't provide much income, their eggs and occasional meat provided essential nourishment for him and Mei.  Set upon on all sides with scimitars and spears, John cowered, unable to risk Mei's life, nor his own, as precious as the chickens were.  

Suddenly, there is a yelp from behind the group of bandits.  Chin crashes through the mass of men, planting his feet firmly in front of the chicken coop, with arms stretched, clearly defying the bandits and protecting the livelihood of Mei and her husband.  Chin glowers at the bandits as they begin to circle him, brandishing their weapons.  Witnessing his brother-in-law's spirit, John finally finds his courage and rises, standing next to his kin in solidarity.  

Immediately, the bandit's leader growls, ""Get out of the way, or we'll cut him down, and you'll be next.""

John stared at the leader right in the eyes, and whispered,

The Arab immediately steals three pastries and puts them in his pocket.

He says to the Jew, ""See how good I am? The owner didn't see a thing."" The Jew says to the Arab, ""That's typical of you Arabs. I am going to show you an honest way to get the same result.""

He goes to the owner of the bakery and says, ""Give me a pastry and I will show you a magic trick.""

Intrigued, the owner accepts and gives him a pastry. The Jew swallows it and asks for another one. The owner gives him another one. Then the Jew swallows that one and asks for a third pastry and eats that, too.

The owner is starting to wonder where the magic trick is and asks, ""So what did you do with the pastries?""

The Jew replies, ""Look in the Arab's pocket.....""

post,3c7nkm,2qh72,jokes,false,1436117875,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3c7nkm/a_village_of_glass_houses/,self.jokes,,"There once was a village in the middle of a vast open field. The village had survived for centuries based on their tradition and culture. This consisted of specific dances and celebrations, body paint, and the most noticeable and apparent: the use of glass buildings and structures. The people who lived in the village believed in complete and utter honesty. Therefore, telling a lie was punishable by death, and nothing could be hidden from anyone. Everything was out in the open just as it had been for centuries. 
        Their leaders had been the best of the society, the most honest and able to lead. So, when one leader died, there were 7 days and 7 nights of grieving, and then 7 days and 7 nights of celebration for the new leader, who would be selected by the elder council over the time period. And so after a week of eating, drinking, and dancing, the new leader was announced. A young man named Joseph, who was young but very effective and of course honest, was to be the new ruler. As the village celebrated, Joseph was officially crowned. 
        Another part of the culture of the strange village was the elaborate, beautiful thrones that were created specially for each new ruler. Craftsmen spent hours upon hours crafting them from stone, precious gems, and of course, mainly glass. Joseph was created his throne within the next few days after his crowning and it was given to him. He loved it, just as all the rulers before him had loved theirs. Everything was well in the village for the next months. Joseph was a fantastic leader (as expected) and the village was successful and efficient. However, the peace was shattered one day by the most heinous crime committed in the village. 
        As the people awoke one Monday, word spread like wildfire that Joseph's throne had been stolen. The people were appalled, and Joseph was infuriated. In the many centuries the village had thrived, this crime was the worst. Such an honest society of people had never seen such a evil deed, especially including something as important as the throne. Joseph ordered a search of everyone for the next 7 days and 7 nights, but it was clear that it would not be found considering nobody saw the throne in anyone's glass house. 
        The craftsmen quickly created a new and arguably better throne for Joseph, and slowly the town calmed down and went back to normal, despite the air of suspicion and distrust between the villagers. These feelings intensified in to chaos when the second throne was found stolen as well. As anarchy ensued, Joseph did his best to keep order while also finding his beloved thrones. Another search was ordered,  and the guards of the city worked tirelessly to find the missing thrones. At the end of the 3rd day of searching, a guard named Gary was walking home to his glass home when he passed Joseph's old home he resided in before he became leader. As he walked past it, he noticed a small path that lead through some tall grass in the backyard. Suspicion amplified due to the unrest throughout the village, he decide to investigate. 
        Gary followed the path for a while before he reached the end, which held a small glass house, one he didn't know about. Through the glass he saw the two stolen thrones, both perfectly intact. He rushed to report his findings to the remaining search force, and as the investigation unraveled, it was found that Joseph himself was responsible for the theft of his own thrones. His obsession with the beautiful thrones had come to a point where he smuggled them in to his childhood home just so he could have more and more. A trial was held, and Joseph was unanimously sentenced to death as the town began to recover from the shock of such an event.

The moral of the story?

Those in glass houses shall not stow thrones. ",A village of glass houses...,6

Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate. When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards."" He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth..."" Suddenly, the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing.""","When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard.",6282

God clearly posses a great potential for talent, but his attitude is recalcitrant and his conviction is seriously lacking. He left a project, that had been assigned an eternity ago, until the last week before it was due. Then throwing the piece together in a very haphazard manner and doing nothing on the seventh day; the very day before it was due. When asked why he had not used this time to go over his work and eliminate some of its obvious defects, he became righteously offended that this would have intruded into his day off. In recognition of his talents, and in an effort to foster their development, God was given an indefinite extension for the assignment before grading. In this time he has made little to no effort to improve upon his original work, and appears to have lost all interest. God's holier-than-thou attitude has risen to such arrogance that he seems to believe that he is just owed worship, and need make no effort at all. A very disappointing result.

""We're flying US Airways,"" was the reply.  ""We got a great rate!""

""We'll be at this little place over on the Tiber River called Teste.""

""Oh, I know that place.  Everybody thinks it’s going to be something special and exclusive, but it's really a dump."" You should not stay in Rome, and you should not visit the touristy things there.

Our parents didn't like that we were together but we didn't care. We were in love, and so we got married at sunset in San Diego, where she had grown up. Our friends came but not our parents. It didn't really matter though. We didn't need their money to help us with the marriage, my wife is very well off, and I'm not doing too bad myself. The first few weeks of marriage were amazing. We treasured every moment of it. But then on the sixteenth of June, everything turned bad. My wife found a lump on the underside of her breast. We immediately went to the doctors, and they said they caught it too late and it had spread to her brain. We were devastated. We cried for what seemed like hours. My beautiful wife lost all her hair and was being bombarded by radiation and chemo. I stayed with her at the hospital for 80% of the day. My office paid me while I was gone, God bless them. I assumed hers did too she got a letter from them and said they were. She didn't want me to worry... Then she started getting real bad. That cough. It was heartbreaking. The doctor said she only had about a week left to live. I cried my fucking eyes out. For that week I spent every second with her. On the night of July 2nd she passed. I cried so fucking much. I lifted her up and found that letter. The letter that said her work would pay her during sick leave. I opened it up. Then my heart broke even more. We would not have the money to pay for our bills. She hadn't been getting paid sick leave. On the letter it read 3 words: Victoria, you're fired.",My wife was sick.,0

Of course, this last selfish request would have left his widow destitute, but apparently, a lifetime of love and devotion wasn’t worth much to him.

“Now listen, when I die I want you to take all my money and place it in the casket with me,” the man said to his wife shortly before he passed away.

“Because I want to take all my money to the after life.”

He made her promise that she would honor his dying wish, and being a good Christian woman, she remained true to her word.

On the day the man was laid to rest, the widow dressed in black and watched her husband’s body stretched out in the coffin as her best friend sat beside her for support.

Before the casket was closed, she placed a shoebox containing all of her deceased husband’s money beside him.

“I hope you weren’t crazy enough to put all that money in there with that stingy old man,” exclaimed the woman’s friend in disbelief.

“Yes, I promised. I’m a good Christian, I can’t lie. I promised him that I was to put that money in that casket with him,” the widow replied.

“You mean to tell me you put every cent of his money in the casket with him?” asked her friend.

The trooper told the driver he was fascinated by juggling and said if the driver would do a little juggling for him then he wouldn't give him a ticket. He told the trooper he had sent his equipment ahead and didn't have anything to juggle.

The trooper said he had some flares in the trunk and asked if he could juggle them. The juggler said he could, so the trooper got 5 flares, lit them and handed them to him.

While the man was juggling, a car pulled in behind the State Trooper's car. A drunken good old boy from central Texas got out, watched the performance, then went over to the Trooper's car, opened the rear door and got in. The trooper observed him and went over to the patrol car, opened the door, and asked the drunk what he thought he was doing.
