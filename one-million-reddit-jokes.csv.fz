Every weekend these modern day gladiators would fly to Paris and install themselves in the Grand Hotel. The locals, particularly the young ladies, would be desperate to sit at nearby tables so they could join in with boisterous and drunken revelry. The aviators would take it in turns to be first to chose the most beautiful maiden to seduce and tonight it was the turn of Marcel Bleu the famous French fighter ace.

At the stroke of midnight Marcel stands up, slowly looks around the ballroom, spies the most exquisite of ladies and says, ""Tonight Cheri you are mine.""  

Amidst cheers and whistles Marcel escorts his prize up the stairs.

On entering his room Marcel walks to the cocktail cabinet, selects a bottle of Green Chartreuse soaks his finger with the sticky liqueur, wipes it on her lips and proceeds to lick it off. The young girl squeals in delight and says, ""Oh Marcel I am in heaven"".

To which Marcel replies, ""When Marcel Bleu the famous French fighter ace kisses a woman she knows she 'as been kissed"".

After several minutes of the most delicious and delicate foreplay Marcel arrives and a perfect areola surrounding an erect pink nipple. He walks to the cocktail cabinet and selecting a bottle of Chambord he drizzles it onto her nipple and proceeds to lick it off. ""Oh Marcel"", she says ""I die in your arms tonight"". To which Marcel retorts, ""When Marcel Bleu the famous French fighter ace loves a woman, she knows that she 'as been loved"".

Fifteen minutes later Marcel arrives at a perfect innie navel. He walks to the cocktail cabinet, selecting a bottle of Pastis he slowly fills her up and sucks it out. ""Oh Marcel you are killing me"" she murmurs, to which Marcel replies, ""When Marcel Bleu the famous French fighter ace loves a woman no other man will do"".

Some time later Marcel arrives and a moist, pink and gently throbbing vulva. He walks slowly to the  cocktail cabinet and selects a bottle of 1875 Remy Martin. He slowly pours it into her pubes, steps back and throws a lit match in.

As her box explodes with a mighty woompf she dashes to the bar and using the soda siphon she puts out the flames. Looking down at her steaming, smoking wreck of a crotch piece she screams, ""You stupid French bastard what did you do that for?"".

To which Marcel replies,

&amp;#x200B;

When Marcel Bleu the famous French fighter ace  goes down, 'e goes down in flames!

post,an74fh,2qh72,jokes,false,1549318686,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/an74fh/a_man_works_at_an_aquarium/,self.jokes,,"Technically it was a zoo/aquarium, but they got more people coming in for their aquatic animals, so they called it an aquarium.

Most notably among those, were their seals. The seals had been taught to do tricks at another aquarium before they'd been moved over. But at the time the aquarium hadn't had any trainers, so they came up with a gimmick, where people could purchase treats for the seals to get them to do tricks on their own.

This worked wonderfully, people would buy the treats, get the seals to do the tricks, then throw them in. Unfortunately, this had the side effect of the seals starting to put on weight very rapidly as more and more people came to see the seals that would do tricks whenever people wanted.

In fact, this sort of thing wound up being a problem with a number of the animals. Small things the staff overlooked resulting in animals getting out of shape or otherwise ill. So they had a bunch of their best animals needing things.

By this point, however, the aquarium/zoo hybrid had gotten very successful. Suddenly, they had a lot of money on their hands, more than they would normally know what to do with.

Normally, that is.

Right now, they had something they could spend it on: getting proper health care for their animals. So they made a conference, sort of a... auction, to see who could provide the best services and methods to get their animals healthy and happy again. 

There was a guy who did dental work on predatory cats, a pair of twins (as in, two pairs of twins not just two people who were twins) who rehabilitated sick pandas, and a lady who did fitness programs for seals, among many others. 

And as they would go down their list they would call out people by their service. So like, ""would the lion dentist please approach the stand.""

They were going through this, and finally got to the woman who had proposed her service to get the seals back in shape. 

But unfortunately, she'd had to go to the bathroom and wasn't in the auditorium at the time. 

So their first call of ""Would the Madam for seal fitness please head to the stage?"" got no answer, as she was in the bathroom. ""Could the woman with the seal exercise program please identify herself?""

Having received still no reply, the announcer called out one last time:

""Would the seals gym lady please stand up?""",A man works at an Aquarium,5

post,an5ste,2qh72,jokes,false,1549311459,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/an5ste/you_are_not_a_monk/,self.jokes,,"A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.",You are not a monk,83

Weeks later, Sandy tells his mother that he has got a job as a fence fixer. She is overjoyed for him, but something doesn't seem right. She has noticed her son occasionally sneaking out at nights. One night, she follows him, all the way to the rich neighbourhood on the other side of town. She watches as he rips out a fence from the front lawn of a house, and lays it down next to its foundations. Just before he leaves, she confronts him.

""Why have you been destroying other people's fences?"" she asks.

""They will pay me the next day to fix it,"" Sandy answers, ashamed. ""Rich people can give me up to £100 just for putting their fence back.""

""But why do you need the money?""

Hundreds of years ago, there was a European salt trader who went all over the world on his caravan selling his wares. One year as he was traveling through Africa, he was betrayed by his caravan and left for dead. Thankfully, was found by a remote tribe who took care of him until he returned to full health. The man was so impressed with their hospitality that he decided to stay and join the tribe. Many months later, the chief's daughter became pregnant and gave birth to a white baby. The chief saw this and immediately confronted the trader. He told him - we take you in and this is how you repay us? You get my daughter pregnant? I should have you killed!

&amp;#x200B;

The man fervently denied it, but the chief was not having any of it. He demanded - ""well, how do you explain it then?""

The man looked out towards the nearby grassland and said ""my Chief, in nature many unusual things happen. Why look, there is a flock of sheep out there. You can see that while most of them are white, a few are black, and we don't question it.""

The chief looked back at the man and said ""Okay okay, I'll make you a deal. I won't tell anyone about you and my daughter, but you can't tell anyone about the sheep.""","Hundreds of years ago, there was a European salt trader who was stranded in Africa",10

When the Godfather goes to confront Enzo about his missing $10 million, he takes along his lawyer who knows sign language. 

The Godfather tells the lawyer, ""Ask him where the 10 million bucks is that he embezzled from me.""

The lawyer, using sign language, asks Enzo where the money is.

Enzo signs back, ""I don't know what you are talking about.""

The lawyer tells the Godfather, ""He says he doesn't know what you are talking about.""

The Godfather pulls out a pistol, puts it to Enzo's temple and says, ""Ask him again!""

The lawyer signs to Enzo, ""He'll kill you if you don't tell him.""

Enzo signs back, ""OK. You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed in my cousin Bruno's backyard in Woodbridge !""

The Godfather asks the lawyer, ""What did he say?""

Every day, it returned, and soon the owl became a tourist attraction.

Visitors from different continents came to see the owl, while the Kebab place prospered.

One day, the owner, a man named John Spon, decided to lock up the owl.

He had fears that it would leave forever, and leave his business in ruins.

So he chose to hire hunters to catch the owl.

The Spon family was large, and fortunately his 3 brothers Joe, Jack, and Jim all volunteered for the job.

Joe had regular poaching trips to Africa, and boasted he could catch any animal.

Jack had been stranded in the Amazon after a plane crash, and had met a local tribe that taught him their ancient secrets.

Jim worked in a futuristic lab, and had access to all kinds of gadgets.

John decided to trust his 3 brothers, and worked on a plan.

On a random weekend, the gang decided that it was time.

The four Spon brothers closed the Kebab shop, and waited in the darkness for the owl to arrive.

The owl came in and prepared to dance, but saw nobody in the room.

Confused, it started to leave when the Spon brothers popped out.

Joe was the first to act, and threw a giant net at the owl.

However, the owl gracefully dodged it.

The net got caught in one of the giant fans in the ceiling, did a 180° spin in the air, and entrapped Joe.

Jack pushed away Joe, and targeted the owl with his blowdart.

The owl, now being aware that he was in danger, squeezed his insides and shot yesterday's dinner inside Jack's weapon, stuffing Jack's mouth with well digested kebabs and a very sharp dart.

Groaning, Jim pushed a small red button.

Suddenly, hidden doors began to open, revealing an array of different turrets armed with weapons beyond imagination.

The owl began to panic, but quickly thought of a plan.

He squeezed his belly once more, spraying Jim's face in an artistic manner.

Jim was enraged, and he was completely ignorant that his face looked exactly like the owl.

He pressed another button, and got covered with bubble gum.

The owl took one last look at the place, and flew away.

John Spon was the only man left standing, and he realized his selfishness had made the owl leave.

Sadly, he put up a sign on the door that the owl was no longer coming to his Kebab place.

Needless to say, Spon kebab fans were left disappointed at the Superb owl.",An owl flew into a Kebab place and started dancing.,3

“Advice offered to the court by a third party.”

 _Why is this on my medical test?_ He thinks. The man glances over to his right in askance, but sees the other students diligently writing. Determined to not make a fool of himself, he writes “prescription”.


He reads the next question:

 “An admission of guilt on the principle of not contesting the charges.” 

He glances around again, confused, and ends up writing “c-section”.


He reaches the third question, and is well and truly lost. 

”The principle that recognizes legal practices, regardless of whether they are codified.”

He writes down “delivery”, but then leans over to ask another student for help. The other student glances at his paper, and says:


“It’s not delivery! It’s de jure, no?”",An OB/GYN student is late for his final exam.,9

At least twice a week, Stanley went out in the woods with his hunting buddies Cletus and Jimmy. They never shot much, but they always had a few cases handy and always had a good time. They were practically inseparable and were often seen bumbling around town together.

Now, one day Stanley was working out in the shed when his lit cigarette ignited a nearby gas can. The can exploded, Stanley was engulfed in flames and, tragically, died from his injuries. After the police investigation ruled the explosion an accident, his mangled body was sent to the morgue. The entire front side of his body was burned beyond recognition, but everyone in town knew that if anybody could confirm it was Stanley, it'd be Cletus and Jimmy.

The mortician called Cletus in to identify the body. ""Thank you for coming in, Cletus,"" she said gently. ""I know this isn't easy for you and I appreciate you taking the time."" Cletus replied in a somber tone. ""No trouble at all, ma'am."" The mortician lifted the sheet from the body, revealing Stanley's horribly burned frontside. She asked Cletus if this was indeed Stanley.

""Weeeeeeeell,"" said Cletus. ""I don't know. I really can't tell. Why don't you flip him on over?"" The mortician was confused, but obliged, revealing Stanley's relatively unharmed naked backside. With hesitation, Cletus exclaimed, ""Nope, that ain't Stanley!"" The mortician was surprised, but thanked Cletus again for his time and sent him on his way.

She then called Jimmy to the morgue to see if he could provide a positive identification. As with Cletus, she offered her sympathies and thanked him for coming in. Then she pulled back the sheet and asked Jimmy if he could confirm it was Stanley.

""Weeeeeeell,"" Jimmy said pensively. ""Hard to say. Would it be alright if you flip him over?"" The mortician was even more surprised this time, but again obliged. After only a second, Jimmy said confidently, ""Nope, that ain't Stanley."" The mortician was dumbfounded.

""I have to ask,"" she said. ""Why on earth did you want me to flip the body over? Cletus said the exact same thing!""

Jimmy replied, ""Well you see miss, this man's only got one asshole.""

""One asshole?!"" the mortician cried. ""What's that got to do with anything?!""

""Weeeeell you see,"" said Jimmy, ""Whenever me and Cletus and Stanley walked through town, everybody would point and say, 'There goes Stanley with them two assholes!'""",Stanley: a tale of friendship.,5

After reading his note explaining his problem, the doctor gave him a thorough examination, and returned to discuss his diagnosis with him.


""Well, Mr. Smith, the problem seems to be that you have an extremely large penis, and it's been effecting the ability of your voice box to make words.  I would suggest that we remove 6 inches to see if that will fix things.  I know this is a big decision, so think about it and come back tomorrow.""

&amp;#x200B;

So the man went home, and talked about it, as best as he could, with his wife, had dinner and they made love.  In the morning he had made up his mind that a normal voice and ability to actually talk to his wife was more important that having a 12 inch penis.

&amp;#x200B;

That day, he had his penis reduced to 6 inches, and the Dr. asked him to say something.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hello there.""  Amazed, Smith broke out into a huge smile, hearing himself say words without a stutter for the first time in his memory.  

So with that he went home to his wife, and they talked and talked for the first time ever.  After some time, he had the bandages off his penis, and with the Dr's permission, he went to have sex with his wife, and she was very disappointed, since he had a lot less to work with.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, his wife grew tired of his constant yammering (because he couldn't help but talk about everything and anything he could) and the lack-luster sex life, walks out on him, leaving him devastated.

&amp;#x200B;

Desperate, he decides to get things back to where they were just a couple of months before, so he returned to the Dr's office, to inquire about having his penis re-attached.

&amp;#x200B;

""N-n-n-n-o-t p-p-p-p-p-p-ossssss-i-ble!"" The Dr. replied ",A man with a horrible stutter goes to the Dr. to see if there's a way to fix it...,11

But i heard that in the GDR there is a car where you have to wait 15 years to get it. Think of the exclusivity. I want you to go there and buy me one.

So his secretary takes a plane and flies to east Germany and goes into a Car Dealership. He goes to the sales desk and says: I would like to buy a car for my boss. The Car Dealer replies: Who is your boss? The famous American Billionaire answers the secretary. The Dealer seems confused and picks up the phone to call his supervisor.

The supervisor also doesn’t know what to do so he redirects the secretary to the towns magistrate, who in turn redirects him to Erich Honecker, General Secretary of the GDR. Even he seems confused but then says to the secretary: Our socialist friends in the imperial west shall get a car.

So the secretary fills out the paperwork, pays the money and handles the shipping of it. 

Eventually he returns to his Boss, and says: Everything is done Boss, they were even so nice to include a motorised cardboard model in the order to look at while you wait on the car.

post,amo9vf,2qh72,jokes,false,1549187645,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/amo9vf/the_secret_to_the_monastery/,self.jokes,,"One night, a young man got lost in the woods while out hunting. As he walked to and fro to find a familiar landmark, he stumbled upon a very old and dreary looking building. He banged at the wooden double doors and called out, ""Help please! I am lost! Could you help me?""

The door opened with an eerie creaking sound, and a hooded man whose face could not be seen peeked out, ""Are you alone?""

The young man nodded, positively creeped out but desperate nonetheless. ""I am John and I got lost in the woods. Do you have a phone I could use to call for help?""

The hooded man responded, ""We do not have a phone in the monastery, but you may stay here if you like and leave in the morning.""

Hesitating for a bit, John resigned himself to the situation. ""Yes,"" he finally said, ""that would be helpful. Thank you.""

The hooded man let John in, and he was surprised to see the interior of the monastery to be well-lit and cheerful looking, as opposed to the dreary exterior. The hooded man, raising his hood for a bit, was an elderly monk, or so he said, and the monastery housed about fifty of them. The monk led the young man to the kitchen, where another hooded monk was cooking dinner.

John joined with the entire monk congregation and ate with them. The elderly monk who met him at the door, whose name was Philip, introduced him to the others. After dinner, Philip ushered John to the second floor quarters, where he could stay at a vacant room.

Along the way, John encountered a room whose door was different from the rest. It was ornate, carved with various designs that looked like waves, and he could resist to ask, ""Why is this room different from the rest?""

Philip responded, ""That room houses the monastery's secret. It is something we have kept hidden and only the monks of this monastery may know of it.""

They have reached the room and John was under the blankets in no time, being tired and all from his long walks. In the middle of the night, he was suddenly brought awake by a very strange scraping sound coming from the other room. As he was a hunter and keen of hearing, he judged that the sound came from about three rooms far; precisely where the secret room was. He decided to let it go, when he was awoken yet again by it after some time. When the sound repeated for three more times, he decided to ask the monk what it was in the morning.

Come morning, John immediately asked Philip about the room. Philip replied, ""It is something only the monks of this monastery may know of. I cannot tell you more.""

Possessed of a very sudden curiosity, John asked, ""How could I be a monk in this monastery?""

At length and to much amusement, Philip explained the process to John. After sometime and having finished, Philip asked John, ""Do you understand?""

Thinking for a few minutes, John finally decided, ""Yes, I would like to be a monk.""

What followed was three-month's worth of disciplined training, daily devotion and everything else that was required to be a monk in the monastery. Yet, after the three months, there were a lot of other requirements, such as prolonged fasting, readings, and more disciplined training. In sum, over a year has passed, and finally, John was ordained a monk of the monastery. In all of this time, John's curiosity has not waned, and he was convinced that his unusual curiosity was because of the secret of the monastery, hidden in the unusual room.

Now that he was a monk, after the ordaining ceremony, he was led to the second floor, in front of the ornately carved door. It was Philip who accompanied him, and the elderly monk started, ""Do not be surprised at what you will see inside this room. Be prepared; we have gone to great lengths to keep it and preserve it. Keep the secret to yourself, as long as you live, as would all our brothers here in the monastery.""

With that, Philip opened the doors, and a blinding flash of light startled John. When he saw what was in the room, he was absolutely befuddled.

But I cannot tell you what it is, for you are not a monk of the monastery.",The secret to the monastery,2

 Al told them to imagine the food they wanted and then, Al would say ready tray sir or ready tray miss.
 The food would then, magically apear in the tray! Life was good in the village but especially for Al! All the parents liked him and All the kids wanted to play with him except for one kid... That kid was named Garry.
 Garry was jealous of all the attention Al was getting so one day, Garry told the village people that Al was poisoning them and stealing thier children's souls... Soon, the village people banned Al from the village... Al was so hurt that he ran, and ran until he couldn't run anymore... Then, he collapsed...
The next thing he knew, he was laying on a bed. There was a man looking at him.

Where am I? Al asked.
Your in my house. Said the man. Im a fisher by the way. I fish all day, every day.
I get just enough food to fead myself and nothing more.

One day, the man got very sick... He called Al into his room and said:""when I die, I want you to bury me in a village far to the north next to my parents.""
A few minutes later, the man died... All rolled the man up in his blanket and carried him to the village. Suddenly, Al realized that this was the village he grew up in!

He misses his wife, his tv, his wife, his la-z-boy, and most of all...his wife. 

His mind starts to wander as he thinks of his wife; her figure, her face, that thing she does that he’s too bashful to talk about. 

Just as his thoughts become unbearable, something some might consider a mirage appears around the bend. 

A brothel. An honest to goodness brothel. 

He pulls into the driveway, straightens his suit, runs a comb through his hair and walks in the front door. 

The Madame greets him and gestures her hand out to all the women lounging on the main floor. 

“May I interest you in one of our girls?” She asked. “My, yes. But, er, you see, I only have this $20 bill, will that do?”

“Of course!” exclaimed the Madame as she took his money. “Anything to please you sir.  Simply go up the stairs and into the first room on the right.   You’ll be well looked after”

The man rushed up the stairs stripping his clothes off as he rounded the corner and that’s when he saw her. Her figure tormenting him in the moonlight. Unable to contain himself, he pounced on her and made the sweetest of love to her. 

After several minutes of the best sex he’d ever had, he climaxes. Soon after, his euphoria turned to dread as she limply turned to her side and began foaming at the mouth. 

Terrified, the man began screaming that scream you only hear in movies. 

The Madame casually walked in, leaned against the door jamb and took a long drag of her cigarette before yelling down the stairs. 

“Heather! The dead one’s full again!”

When I got home, my husband seemed excited to see me and exclaimed delightedly, ""Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight."" He then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, ""Happy Birthday!""",Beans the magical fruit,28

The cop carefully approaches the car to get a closer look. Then he sees a young man behind the wheel, reading a computer magazine. He immediately notices a young woman in the rear seat, knitting. Puzzled by this surprising situation, the cop walks to the car and gently raps on the driver’s window.

The young man lowers his window. “Uh, yes, officer?”

The cop says: “What are you doing?”

The young man shrugs: “Sir, I believe she’s knitting a pullover sweater.”

The prices seemed pretty good! I just had to get dinner for the family tonight, shouldn't be too hard, right?

So I went over to the meat department and I was astounded at the selection of different meats. Simple, run of the mill stuff like beef, pork, or chicken, but also more exotic meats such as bear, turtle, and snake meat were found on the refrigerated shelves. The problem was, upon closer inspection, none of it looked very appetizing. It almost looked like all the meat in the store had been picked up off of roadkill. This meat was by no means 'Grade A.' In fact, I wouldn't even rate it at a 'C' rating!

Gross. I figured if the meat was out, maybe I'll just get some salad for the family. It's not the meat I want, but its healthier. Fine.

So I went to the produce department. There was a fantastic selection of fruits and vegetables. Anything you could ever want! Apples, oranges, melons, grapes, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, arugula, spinach, lettuce, there was no end to the bounty! When I picked up a couple of bags of lettuce, I realized it was already wilted. In fact, everything in the area was overripe and going bad, but the date on the bag wasn't going to arrive for weeks! It must have left the factory this way! It was all made by some off brand called ""Aunt Dee's Produce."" Each item had the logo of this smirking granny that must have been at least 100 years old. It was like she was laughing at me, ""What are you gonna do, let your family starve?""

Shaking my head I continued on to the canned food section. I thought, ""If the fresh stuff was bad, surely at least the canned stuff should be alright."" Boy was I wrong. This isle had hundreds of different soup variants that nobody would ever ask for! The worst offender was a can of alphabet soup. The problem was, it was so cheap that they just used one letter!

Outraged, I go to the front of the store empty handed. I yelled at the cashier at the top of my lungs, ""Why is everything here terrible! I tried getting some good meat but it all looks disgusting, your produce is all wilted and dead, and your soup is the most cheaply made I have ever seen!""

He replied, ""Sir, what store do you think this is?""

""A terrible grocery store!"" I screamed.

During his tenure he managed to take over multiple countries including Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Armenia, Georgia, Iraq and Syria. They were all assimilated and became a part of Iran. The only country he didn’t manage to take over was Turkey. But he didn’t mind since he essentially had control by surrounding the country’s borders.

After many years he had begun to get bored. Though he had gotten older he had maintained his impressive marathon abilities and lightning speed. So one day he decided to sign up for the olympics in order to really test his skill. Yet, despite all of his accomplishments, and much to his dismay, he was denied entrance. During the application, when the recruiters asked him what his greatest accomplishment was, he said “Iran around a Turkey sandwich”

Naturally the Hippie asks, and the Bus Driver tells him that every night at midnight the Nun goes to an old Graveyard to pray for God to forgive her for her past, and that he should dress up like God and tell the Nun she will be forgiven if she has Sex with you.
The Hippie gives his thanks and runs to the nearest Costume Shop.
Later that evening the Hippie gets ready for his big night and drives down to the Graveyard and sees the Nun praying, on her knees.
He says ""Behold, I have heard your prayers and you shall be forgiven if you have Sex with me!""
The Nun agrees but asks if they can have Anal Sex in order to keep her Virginity. The Hippie agrees and once they are finished the Hippie jumps back and pulls off his mask and says

At least twice a week, Stanley went out in the woods with his hunting buddies Cletus and Jimmy. They never shot much, but they always had a few cases handy and always had a good time. They were practically inseparable and were often seen bumbling around town together.

Now, one day Stanley was working out in the shed when his lit cigarette ignited a nearby gas can. The can exploded, Stanley was engulfed in flames and, tragically, died from his injuries. After the police investigation ruled the explosion an accident, his mangled body was sent to the morgue. The entire front side of his body was burned beyond recognition, but everyone in town knew that if anybody could confirm it was Stanley, it'd be Cletus and Jimmy.

The mortician called Cletus in to identify the body. ""Thank you for coming in, Cletus,"" she said gently. ""I know this isn't easy for you and I appreciate you taking the time."" Cletus replied in a somber tone. ""No trouble at all, ma'am."" The mortician lifted the sheet from the body, revealing Stanley's horribly burned frontside. She asked Cletus if this was indeed Stanley.

""Weeeeeeeell,"" said Cletus. ""I don't know. I really can't tell. Why don't you flip him on over?"" The mortician was confused, but obliged, revealing Stanley's relatively unharmed naked backside. Without hesitation, Cletus exclaimed, ""Nope, that ain't Stanley!"" The mortician was surprised, but thanked Cletus again for his time and sent him on his way.

She then called Jimmy to the morgue to see if he could provide a positive identification. As with Cletus, she offered her sympathies and thanked him for coming in. Then she pulled back the sheet and asked Jimmy if he could confirm it was Stanley.

""Weeeeeeell,"" Jimmy said pensively. ""Hard to say. Would it be alright if you flip him over?"" The mortician was even more surprised this time, but again obliged. After only a second, Jimmy said confidently, ""Nope, that ain't Stanley."" The mortician was dumbfounded.

""I have to ask,"" she said. ""Why on earth did you want me to flip the body over? Cletus said the exact same thing!""

Jimmy replied, ""Well you see miss, this man's only got one asshole.""

""One asshole?!"" the mortician cried. ""What's that got to do with anything?!""

""Weeeeell you see,"" said Jimmy, ""Whenever me and Cletus and Stanley walked through town, everybody would point and say, 'There goes Stanley with them two assholes!'""",Stanley was killed in a freak explosion in his garage...,133

Learning of this sage causes this man to start wondering about the meaning of his life, indeed about the meaning of life in general. He eventually becomes so restless and unhappy that he resolves to track down this great sage and find out the meaning of life. His quest takes him to every continent. Disasters befall him. He loses everyone he held dear, but still he seeks. With his money nearly gone, his health shot, and the remnants of his youth becoming a distant glimmer, the man hears rumor of the sage he seeks living on top of a mountain in an obscure area of the Himalayas. He travels all over the Himalayas until, a mere shell of his former self, he finds the mountain the sage lives on top of. With his last strength he manages to climb the mountain and, sure enough, at the top, he finds an ancient sage sitting calmly on top of the wind blown peak.
