y titled the book The Rapes of Grath.

Unfortunately, the book was a marketplace failure, and the research team wound up with hundreds, if not thousands, of unsold copies. They put the boxes of books in the basement of a house in Napa Valley, California, owned by one of their members. Eventually, the house was sold to an order of Monks, boxes of books and all.

The monks bought not only the house, but also the adjacent vineyard; they wanted to grow grapes and make wine, just like the Christian Brothers. They put a big vat in the basement, where they pressed the grapes the old traditional way -- with their feet.

That's right: they're trampling out the vintage where The Rapes of Grath are stored.  ",Jack the Ripper - Found?,3

The guy gets out of his car and is looking around inside the engine wondering what could be the problem.

Out of nowhere a deep voice says, ""it needs water"". The man looks around expecting to see someone standing behind him but sees only the grey horse. Sure enough he puts a bottle of water he had handy into the engine and drives the short distance into town to find a mechanic.

After he finds a mechanic he visits a small pub and orders a beer. He turns to the barman and says ""I just had the weirdest night of my life, I think I horse just helped me fix my car.""

The barman smiles and says: ""you were lucky then, if you had of stopped a mile prior to where you did the horse there knows nothing about cars."" ",A clever horse,1

The sheriff takes the criminals to the town square, handcuffs them posts and sets up shop. He tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin. Since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.

After a while there are two long lines for the criminals. Some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to get their licks in. After a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist’s face is a bloody pulp and thinks “He’s so beat up at this point, he probably can’t even feel anything anymore. I’m not going to waste my money on that.” So the guy walks up and kicks the con artist squarely in the groin.

So they agreed to settle the question of world hegemony once and for all with a good old-fashioned dog fight - the parties had one year to prepare.

The top scientist of both nations worked day and night for a year, and the day of the fight arrived. 

The Soviets put an absolute monster of a dog in to the ring - imagine a cross between a bear, a wolverine and a wolf with the jaws of a great white shark and the size of an average car.

The Americans opened their cage and after some prodding, a 10 meter long dachshund waddled out and looked around sleepily. The Soviet leadership started looking pretty smug at this point.

The Soviet dog growled and attacked, but the dachshund just opened its jaws wide and swallowed it whole. Fight over.

The Soviets conceded defeat and signed over the world to the beaming Americans, who graciously invited the losers to the celebration party in Hollywood. 

At the party, one of the Soviet scientists got to talking with one of his American counterpart and said “I just don’t understand. We toiled day and night to breed the biggest, most vicious animal in the world, and still we lost. 23 of my men went insane from the pressure, the finest minds of my country lost forever.”

One day, while they're working on the project, Harry's running late to the lab and asks both of them to continue on without him. Mark, knowing that he'll be alone with Jane, uses this time to seize any opportunity to get closer to her that comes his way. 

Jane grabs a wrench and tries to tighten a bolt on the machine they're working on. She keeps turning it clockwise with all her might yet she can't seem to tighten it. Mark steps in and offers to help, he grabs his own wrench and tries to tighten it too, but to no avail. Mark then has an idea for both of them to try tightening the bolt at the same time. They both grab their wrenches , stand opposite to each other and turn their wrenches clockwise. 

At this time, Harry finally arrives to the lab, and he manages to catch a peak of Mark and Jane working together on this. He assumes this means that they're finally in a relationship and spreads the news like wildfire around the lab. 

By the end of the day, this news reaches Jane as well and she visibly gets irritated at Mark and vows to never date him. Mark is confused and begs to know why.

On one side, the chicken stood. The other, a lone bar in the middle of nowhere. And yet, at some point, it was once the most bustling bar on the face of the planet. 

“I suppose my time’s finally come.” The chicken walked ahead, looking both ways before doing so despite knowing well that not a single car had used this road since... well, since a long time ago. Once he crossed the road, he looked back, chuckling to himself. He entered the bar, revealing that what looked like a simple building stretched out in an enormous area, tables and chairs littered all throughout as if the bar was intended to be this large. In those tables and chairs were familiar faces to the farm fowl. The mathematician, neutron, Irishman... numerous friends the chicken has made over the years. Though, instead of talking and sharing their stories concerning their jokes, they were all frozen, covered in crystal. If he had to hazard a guess, the chicken would probably think it was infinitely big. “It’d have to be, with how many we are.” He reasoned with a laugh.

“You can say that again.” The chicken looked to his side and smiled, the bar’s tender wiping a glass nonchalantly behind the counter. Hopping up on one of the seats, he looked to his right and found an old friend of his, the horse. He too had been crystallized, stuck drinking from an empty glass for all eternity.

“Yup. My usual.” The chicken asked as he looked back behind him, turning back to grab a bottle of grape juice. He drank, the air going silent until he set down his bottle, sighing. “You know why I’m here, right?”

The bartender set down the glass he was polishing, nodding somberly. “Of course. Fitting that we’d be the last, huh?”

“Eh.” The chicken shrugged. “Maybe we aren’t. But that doesn’t exactly concern us, does it?”

“Nope.” The bartender chuckled. Below them, the same crystallization process began, locking their feet and legs. “I suppose this is goodbye.”

But the chicken smiled knowingly, shaking his head. “Not exactly.”

“Hmm? What do you mean?”

“Ask me.”

“What?”

“Ask me what we’re doing.”

The bartender was suspicious, but as the crystallization reached their torsos, he sighed, rolling his eyes. “Might as well then... what are we doing, you old bastard?”

The chicken went silent, letting their prison slowly crawl up to their necks before he chuckled, his head becoming stiff as he said his final words.

Well, all the same he paid it and then the plumber said to him:

"" I understand your position as a professor. Why don't you come to our company and apply for a plumber position? You will earn three times as much as a professor. But remember, when you apply, tell them that you completed only seven elementary classes. They don't like educated people . ""

One day, the board of the plumbing company decided that every plumber has to go to evening classes to complete the eight grade. So, our professor had to go there too. It just happened that the first class was math. The evening teacher, to check students' knowledge, asked for a formula for the area of the circle. The person asked was the professor. He jumped to the board, and then he realized that he had forgotten the formula. He started to reason it, he filled the white board with integrals, differentials and other advanced formulas to conclude the result he forgot. As a result he got
""minus pi r squared"".

He didn't like the minus, so he started all over again. He got the minus again. No matter how many times he tried, he always got a minus. He was frustrated. 

He looked a bit scared at the class and saw all the plumbers whisper:

When i was about to give up, i saw fingers hanging on the balcony... Haha that bastard almost got away... I went there and started to hit his finger, and he felt down. When i thought i killed him, i realized that the bastard was alive... He felt into some trees, and didn't die. I was so angry, that i pulled the fridge through the balcony... Finally, then, the cheater was dead. I was so happy, that had a heart attack, and died instantly.

I felt down and was going to die... But i was lucky again... I felt into some trees, so i survived... At least for the moment! When i looked up, the bastard thrown the fridge from up there, and hit me on the face. I've died at the same moment!

They're 8 and 6, and they get into trouble every day.  Kicking cats, firecrackers in mailboxes, the works.  If something is broken or missing in their neighborhood, it's these kids' fault.  

Their parents are at their wits end; they've tried grounding them, they've tried spanking them, and nothing works, so they go talk to their priest.  

""Father, you need to help us, we don't know what to do!"" they tell the priest, and he agrees to talk to the boys, but only if he can meet with them one at a time, and alone (I know what you're thinking, but it's not that kind of joke).

So the 6 year old goes into the priest's office, and the priest, wanting to impress on the youngster that God is always watching, asks him ""Son...where do you think God is?"".

The little boy, now really knowing a lot about religion, and distrustful of grown-ups, doesn't answer.

The priest asks again ""Son, can you tell me where God is"", and again, the little boy says nothing.  

The priest, growing increasingly frustrated, looks the boy straight in the face and says ""I'll ask once more son, Where is God?"".

Well, on that, the little boy jumps up from the chair, runs out the door into the waiting room and grabs his brother's hand and they run and they run and they run until they get home, here they hide in a closet.  

Out of breath and super confused, his brother asks ""What is going on?""

This church was old (the only church the city had for sale, really), but the friars didn't care. They put on some of that good ol' elbow grease and got it looking good again. Once their church was as ready as can be, people started going to their church. Now, the friars were very kind to everyone they met, in and out of the church, and everyone knew them well. The friary was loved by all.

Then came summer. During summertime, the people of this city loved to travel around, so the number of weekly visitors of the friary grew dim - so dim, in fact, that they foretell having to shut down the friary by the end of the summer due to a lack of donations. So the friars put their heads together to brainstorm ideas that could start raking in some money so they wouldn't have to declare bankruptcy. One friar spoke up and suggested they do a yard sale of the untouched junk they found in the abandoned church. His idea was quickly shut down; who'd want to buy a dozen chalices? Another friar suggested they use the yard behind the friary to start growing flowers, and open up a flower shop. The others loved the idea, and within weeks the friars' flower shop, dubbed ""The Green Cross"", was quite successful.

In fact, it was becoming too successful. Since the friars were so well-loved, they started stealing other florists' customers. Quickly running out of business, a few florists got together to discuss how they'd get their customers back. The topic of every suggestion was attacking the friars in some way or another: one florist suggested they egg the friary and their flower shop - which was a flop, since the eggs were gone within hours and the two buildings looked even cleaner than before the incident thanks to the friars. Another florist suggested they trample the friary's flowers - but the friars' customers donated so many of their own home's flowers that it didn't make a difference. Another florist yet suggested they hire Hugh.

Who's Hugh, you ask? Only the baddest eleven-year-old this city's ever seen. He's bullied every kid you've met, vandalized every building at least twice, and rumor has it that he actually pranked someone to death. He's exactly the guy the florists need.

They hire him with the only mission to ""shut down The Green Cross"". Sure enough, come the next day, the flower shop was completely ruined, with all the flowers burning in a pile. The friary, too, was reduced to a pile of stone and dust, and the flower beds behind it were nowhere to be seen. With no chance of recovery, the friars were forced to leave the city with nothing.

The moral of the story: only Hugh can prevent florist friars.","In a city, not so long ago, there was a collective of friars.",3

His soul arrives in Heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.  ""Welcome to Heaven"", says St. Peter. ""Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem.  We seldom see a high official around these parts you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.""

""No problem.  Just let me in,"" says the politician.

""Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from the higher ups.  What we'll do is have you spend one day in Hell and one in Heaven.  Then you can choose where to spend eternity.""

""Really?  I've made up my mind.  I want to be in Heaven,"" says the politician.

""I'm sorry, but we have our rules."" And with that St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down to Hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a golf course.  In the distance a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him.  Everyone is very happy and in evening dress.  They run to greet him, shake his hands and reminisce about the good times they had while getting both exalted and rich .  They played a friendly round of golf and then dine on lobster, maliputo, caviar, and Macallan 1926.  Also present is the devil who really is a very friendly guy and who is having a good time and telling jokes.  They are all having such a good time that before the politician realizes it, it is time to go.

Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises.

The elevator goes up, up and the door reopens in Heaven while St. Peter is waiting for him

""Now it's time to visit Heaven.""  So, 24 hours passed with the politician joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud,  playing the harp, Cebu guitar and singing.  They have a good time and before he realizes it the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.  ""Well then you've spent a day in Hell and another in Heaven.  Now choose your eternity.

""The minister reflects for a minute before he answers: ""Well, I would never have said it before, I mean Heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in Hell.""  So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down to Hell.

Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage.  He sees all his friends, dressed in rags picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above.  The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulders.

""I don't understand,"" stammers the politician.

""The other day I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse and we ate lobster, maliputo, and caviar, drank $10,000 Macallan and we flirted, danced and had a great time.  Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable.  What happened?"",

The devil smiles at him and says, ""Yesterday we were campaigning.  Today you voted"".

I’ve always just assumed a prison wallet was for men in prison only.

But I was thinking the other day, women inmates actually have two prison wallets.   Well, actually, they have a prison wallet and a prison purse.

When using them, I guess they need to make the decision to store their valuables in the purse or the wallet.

Unlike a normal, non-prison wallet &amp; purse, you can’t put the wallet inside the purse.  Well maybe you can, I've never been to prison.

“Really?” he said. “And what kind of myths are there?”
“Well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that African-American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Mexican descent who are the best.

The warden saw that deep down, Andy was a good person and made arrangements for Andy to learn a trade while doing his time.

After three years, Andy was recognized as one of the best carpenters in the local area.

Often he would be given a weekend pass to do odd jobs for the citizens of the community and he always reported back to prison before Sunday night was over.

The warden was thinking of remodeling his kitchen and in fact had done much of the work himself.

But he lacked the skills to build a set of kitchen cupboards and a large counter top, which he had promised his wife.

So he called Andy into his office and asked him to complete the job for him.

But, alas, Andy refused.

He told the warden, ""Gosh, I'd really like to help you but counter fitting is what got me into prison in the first place.""","Several years ago, Andy was sentenced to prison. During his stay, he got along well with the guards and all his fellow inmates…",66

I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

Here's the joke I told:

""What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.""

One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said ""I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?""

""No,"" replied the guy. ""He choked on a sock.""",[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive.,50

""It's the Loch Ness Monster!"" they scream. Panicking, the men frantically swim toward shore — and then they hear another rumbling beneath them. They can feel the reverberations of the powerful growl travel through their bodies. The monster is close.

They're paddling for their lives when the creature's massive head rises with a splash from the lake, facing the other direction. The Loch Ness Monster turns to take a look at its prey and stops abruptly, a flash of recognition in its eyes. Then, it speaks.

One day his friend found a tractor convention and he thought of Dan, so he bought two tickets for the following day. 

When Dan got to the convention with his friend he was amazed. They had tractors of all shapes and sizes, but when looking through the tractors, Dan found a beautiful lime green tractor, with a leather steering wheel and a yellow seat. He decided that he would do anything for this tractor, but is wasn’t for sale. So he hid until night when nobody was about and he snuck up to the tractor and was about to hot wire it when he realised that it had the keys still in. As he was driving out with his prize he crashed into one of the main pillars keeping up the shed that the convention was in and it all fell down.

The police were called and they pulled Dan from the wreckage. Luckily he wasn’t hurt, but the police knew it was him who knocked the building down so they gave him a choice. Go to jail for 10 years, or he wasn’t allowed to own anything to do with tractors ever again.

Dan was weighing up his choices, he loved his tractors, but he was terrified of jail. After spending the night thinking about it, he decided to get rid of all his tractor possessions.

Months passed and Dan was incredible lonely, so he downloaded a dating app on hi phone. Some of the girls he met were nice and others were horrible but one day, he met a girl who he really connected with. After texting for a few days they decided to go on a date.

At the restaurant they had picked out, he met her in person. When they went in, she asked if they could go to the smoking area of the restaurant. Dan didn’t like smokers, but he let it slide as he was really lonely without his tractors so they went to the smoking area.

After a few minutes, Dan was coughing due to the thickness of the smoke, so he took in one big breath, breathed in all the smoke and went outside to breathe it out. When he came back, his date was starting at him in disbelief and she asked “how did you do that?” Dan smiled and responded “I’m an ex-tractor fan”.",The tractor joke,4

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was a man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,60

Please join me in remembering a great icon of the entertainment community.

The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection and complications from repeated pokes in the belly.

He was 71.

Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin.
Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies and Captain Crunch.

The grave site was piled high with flours.
Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded.

Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes.

Despite being a little flaky at times, he still, as a crusty old man, was considered a roll model for millions.

Doughboy is survived by his wife, Play Dough; two children John Dough and Jane Dough; plus they had one in the oven.

He is also survived by his elderly father Pop Tart.

The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Everyone knows good ol' Dave,337

For the third and last wish, Mike and Dave both ask for immortality.

They all decide to go back to their country, because they have a lot to do, however they all agree to meet again in 10 years, to figure out who had made the best choices.

They meet in a bar 10 years later, and Mike starts

""My life is fantastic, I have many Nobel prices, I am the best in 13 different fields, my work got me insanely rich and I won many sports competitions thanks to my insane strength and good shape, and I can enjoy all of that for eternity""

Then Dave says 
""My life is wonderful too, my wife is amazing, I still love her like the day we met, my money lets me do whatever I want, I came here in my own private jet, I don't know if my choices are better than Mike's, but they sure are good enough for me, and I can enjoy all of that for eternity.

They enter the cabin, and it’s a disaster... 

Everything is overturned, animals had clearly screwed the place. 

But the storm was intense, and they were beginning to get sick, so they decided to stay in the cabin. 

They wanted to set up camp in the living room, but only one person could fit, so they drew straws for who would sleep were, shortest straw for basement, and longest for attic.

Eventually they drew straws, and had dinner of some MRE’s. They were tired, and one of them had a cold, so they decided to call it a night. 

The sick officer got the short straw, so he went to the basement, which was a concrete room, with a boiler at one end.

Meanwhile the other officer goes to the attic, it’s a mess, and water is dripping through the ceiling, theres also a coffin... 

The officers like “okay that weird.” But brushes it off and goes asleep. 

A few hours later, everyone’s passed out, and then the guy in the attic hears something.

Dunk dunk dunk! 

“It’s probably nothing” but when he looks around the attic he notices the coffin is no longer in its original spot, he turns around and screams in horror as the coffin falls on him. 

Killing him. 

“What was that!” The officer in the living room yells, and runs to the basement, to wake up his friend. 

He attempts to wake him but fails. As he is A. Tired and B. Sick. 

So he goes upstairs to investigate. 

Everything is in order, his friends sleeping bag, and backpack are undisturbed, but his friend is not there.

Suddenly he hears... 

DUNK DUNK DUNK! 

And turns around to see the coffin coming at him.

He takes out his sidearm and shoots it, nothing happens and the coffin kills him. 

Finally, the basement guy wakes up. He heard gunshots and runs up stairs.

When he gets there his sees his friends sidearm on the floor. Then... 

DUNK DUNK DUNK

The coffin is coming right at his, he freaks out and takes out his knife and slashes the coffin, nothing.

In a last, desperate attempt he takes out a cough drop and throws it at the coffin. And it falls flat....

Cause the only way to stop a coffin is a cough drop.
