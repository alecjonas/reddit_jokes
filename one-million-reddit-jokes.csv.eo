The man replies, ""Yes I am. I'm trying to escape a robbery I got involved in."" 

The cop gives him a skeptical look and says, ""Were you the one being robbed?"" 

The man casually replies, ""No, I committed the robbery."" 

The cop looks shocked that the man admitted this. ""So you're telling me you were speeding...AND committed a robbery?"" 

""Yes,"" the man calmly says. ""I have the loot in the back."" 

The cop begins to get angry. ""Sir, I'm afraid you have to come with me."" The cop reaches in the window to subdue the man. 

""Don't do that!"" the man yells fearfully. ""I'm scared you will find the gun in my glove compartment!"" The cop pulls his hand out. ""Wait here,"" he says. 

The cop calls for backup. Soon cops, cars, and helicopters are flooding the area. The man is cuffed quickly and taken towards a car. However, before he gets in, a cop walks up to him and says, while gesturing to the cop that pulled him over, ""Sir, this officer informed us that you had committed a robbery, had stolen loot in the trunk of your car, and had a loaded gun in your glove compartment. However, we found none of these things in your car.""

The owner replied, “Well I do have a fabulous parrot that can say many things and has beautiful plumage.” 

“No he’ll just make fun of the birds mispronunciations and point out the colors it doesn’t have.” said the optimist.

“You know I think I have the perfect pet for you. I have a dog that can walk on water.”

“Seriously?” said the optimist, “I’ll take him! My friend won’t be able to say anything negative about that dog!”

So the optimist took his new dog out on a walk by a small lake with his pessimist friend. As they were casually talking the optimist started playing fetch with the dog. Then the optimist threw the ball out on the lake and the dog ran out on the lake, grabbed the ball and ran back to the men.

There was some construction to be done, however, so she called one of her friends who had a background in architecture to point her in the right direction.

He arrived early one morning, surveying the house. Thankful for his presence, the young woman guided her friend to the room that she was thinking of customizing. It was fairly small and had five walls, the fifth of which held the doorway.

“I’m thinking of tearing down some walls in here to make more room,” she said. “Can you help?”

Her friend looked around the perimeter of the room, putting his knowledge of architecture to the test. Finally, pointing at one section of the structure, he gave a single warning. “This fourth one’s a load-bearing wall, You’ll have to leave it alone, or else this whole place’s integrity will be at risk.”

The woman nodded, but was clearly still perplexed. Leading her friend to the door, she thanked him for the help as he left.

A week later, he and the woman bumped into each other at a restaurant.

“Hey! Did I end up helping you out with our house problem at all?”

“You were a bit confusing, but I eventually found someone who could help.” 

 Curious, he asked “Well... who did you ask?”

A smile occupying her face, she answered “It took a bit of looking, but I found that the Redditors reading this joke were quite helpful!”

A look of panic crossed her friend’s face. 

Concerned as to what possibly could be the problem, she asked, “What’s wrong...?” A few moments passed before he answered:

A man walks into a bar, notices a very large jar on the counter,and sees that it's filled to the brim with $10 bills. He guesses there must be at least ten thousand dollars in it.

He approaches the bartender and asks, ""What's with the money in the jar?""

""Well..., you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Lexus.""

The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, “What are the three tests?""

""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules.""

So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10 which he stuffs into the jar.

""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do:

First - You have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less,  
and you can't make a face while doing it.""

""Second - There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth. You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.""

""Third - There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. You have to take care of that problem.""

The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my $10 -- but I'm not an idiot! I won't do it!

You'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila and then do all those other things!""

""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is.""

As time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says, “Where's the damn tequila?!""

He grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can.Tears stream  
down both cheeks -- but he doesn't make a face -- and he drinks it in 58 seconds!

Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole.

Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a terrible fight -then, nothing but silence!

Just when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar.

His clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over his body.

He drunkenly says, ""Now..., where's that old woman with the bad tooth?""",A Man Walks Into A Bar...,32

She thinks of how to respond, gently. “Well, my love, some new babies are born with missing fingers or toes, and some are born with missing arms or legs.”

“Okay” he thinks, feeling sad for the babies. 

His mom continues “this new baby was born without ears. But I don’t want you to talk about it in the hospital, okay? His mommy is very tired.”

The boy agrees, packs his little backpack with a new blanket for the baby, and off they go to visit his mom’s friend. 

When they get there, the mother’s friend is sitting up in bed with her new baby. “Do you want to have a hold?” She asks the boy. 

“Sure!” The boy replies, remembering what his mom told him. 

Trying not to draw attention to the baby’s deformity, he points out his cute little button nose instead. “It’s so little!” The boy says to his mom as he gently pokes it. “Ahh and his hands and feet are so tiny!” 

The mom reminds him that he was once that small. 

“His eyes are so sparkly, mom!” The boy exclaims, full of wonder. “I hope he has really good vision!”

And as the woman lies in bed, little more than a heap of panting, twitching flesh, Thor feels guilty.

The husband cringed, 'I warned you to be careful! Now we'll have to go up there, find the owner, apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us.'

So the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. A warm voice said, 'Come on in.'

When they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the pieces of window glass.

A man reclining on the couch asked, 'Are you the people that broke my window?'

'Uh...yeah! , sir. We're sure sorry about that,' the husband replied.

'Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you.. You see, I'm a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for my self.'

Wow, that's great!' the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, 'I'd like a million dollars a year for the rest of my life.'

'No problem,' said the genie 'You've got it, it's the least I can do.. And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!'

'And now you, young lady, what do you want?' the genie asked.

'I'd like to own a gorgeous home in every country in the world complete with servants,' she said.

'Consider it done,' the genie said. 'And your homes will always be safe from fire, burglary and natural disasters!'

'And now,' the couple asked in unison, 'what's your wish, genie?'

'Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle, and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have sex with your wife.'

The husband looked at his wife and said, 'Gee, honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?'

She mulled it over for a few moments and said, 'You know, you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?'

You know I love you sweetheart,' said the husband. I'd do the same for you!'

So the genie and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying each other.

The genie was insatiable. After about three hours of non-stop sex, the genie rolled over and looked directly into her eyes and asked, How old are you and your husband?'

'Why, we're both 35,' she responded breathlessly.

'No Kidding,' he said.

Johnny: Don't worry about that, I got it all figured out. I want a girl with diseases.

The jury announces the last competition: There must be a quatrain that ends in Timbuktu. Whoever speaks first, will win. Both opponents go in for themselves. But after only a few minutes the pastor steps forward and says:

""All my living, all my life,

i had no women, i had no wife.

I read the bible trough and trough,

on my way to Timbuktu.""

post,blzgin,2qh72,jokes,false,1557280628,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/blzgin/the_pink_ping_pong_balls/,self.jokes,,"A wealthy man had a little boy. For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.

So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.

A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-' 

Then he died.",The Pink Ping Pong Balls,0

""Please my friend, we all forgive you. You may go in peace"" says Misha.

His friends are visibly touched by his words. Finally, he gathers his last strength and says.

""And in honor of our deep friendship I want you to fulfill my last wish. See that cactus plant on the windowsill? As soon as I die, I want you to take it and shove it up my ass.""

After some thought, he concludes that the posts at the top of r/all contain mostly hydrogen atoms, because hydrogen is the lightest element, so these posts naturally rise to the top. He decides to name these posts ""H posts"" (short for hydrogen posts).

Then, he concludes that posts at the bottom of r/all contain mostly uranium atoms, because uranium is the heaviest natural element, so these posts are naturally dragged to the bottom. He refers to these posts as ""U posts"".

The chemist then decides to walk into r/jokes. He quickly discovers that most of the top posts don't contain mostly hydrogen atoms, like in r/all. After some more research, he finds that many of the posts in r/jokes, not just the top ones, contain mostly rhenium atoms. So, he concludes that r/jokes is full of ""Re posts"".
