post,3nafwc,2qh72,jokes,false,1443830687,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3nafwc/four_mafia_members_rob_a_bank/,self.jokes,,"Tom was a member of the mafia, along with Dick, Harry, and John. One day, they decided to rob a bank. They ended up deciding that Tom was the main robber, Dick the getaway driver, Harry backup muscle, and John the lookout.

The day came and Dick drove them all to the bank. Tom got out first, followed by Harry then John. John entered a nearby building to watch the streets from the roof, where he had previously set up a sniper rifle, Harry went into the bank, with a gun in his pocket, and Tom went up to the till, also with a gun. Dick, of course, being the getaway driver, remained in the car.

Tom went up to the till and requested to withdraw £250 from his own account. Not having been threatened at all, the teller obligingly did so, but had to turn away to get a few spare £50 notes.

While the teller was doing this, Tom planted a small, powerful explosive near the corner of the glass barrier. Tom then walked away after putting the £250 in his wallet, pretending to exit the bank, when he detonated the explosive.

In the confusion caused by said explosive (the staff having secretly pressed the alarm button to silently alert the police), Harry and Tom broke down the ""Employees Only"" door and threatened the staff to show them to the vaults. The staff obviously complied, and opened the vaults for them, allowing them to abscond with £200,000 in total.

The police arrived and John was doing an excellent job keeping them at bay with the sniper rifle. Tom and Harry both ran out the bank, with Tom first entering the car while Harry joined the crossfire. John, seeing this, saw that it was time for him to get into the car, so he ran down the steps, and entered the car too. Harry then made it in and they sped off back to their base near the Thames, somehow losing the police in the process.

Having made it off the radar, they now had the problem of dividing the pickings. Tom, of course, argued that since he had planted the bomb, he should deserve the most share, since the operation could not have gone well without that critical step. John argued that had he not been there, the police would have arrested the other three, and that they should show some respect. Dick argued that he had done everyone the favour of shaking off the cops, and Harry merely said that everyone should all get equal amounts for doing the same amount of work.

Tom then said that Harry didn't really do anything. Harry argued that John had abandoned his post. John said that any competent driver would have stopped the cops from following them, and Dick said that anyone could have done Tom's work.
The argument in this manner escalated, and eventually it turned into a physical brawl. Over the course of the brawl, Tom grabbed the £200,000, but was then pushed by Harry into the Thames! Tom unfortunately never learned how to swim, and so promptly drowned.

When the other three noticed that their earnings had been waterlogged, they all jumped into the water to retrieve it. Thankfully, they were able to recover the full £200,000, as well as the £250 in Tom's wallet.

However, the notes were all slimy and dirty from the sewage in the Thames, and so rendered nigh-unusable.

A silence was heard between the three. It was soon broken by Harry, though.

The fisherman was taken back but didn't want to say no. He wasn't a religious man but he was scared that his rejection of the holy man would spread throughout the town, and possible would cause bad luck.

They sailed out and found a patch of ocean; wild and isolated, they couldn't see land, only the red sky of the raising sun over the swelling waves gave the priest any bearings. That combined with the sea sickness had his knuckles white holding on to the side of the boat.

The fisherman whistled and hummed as he threw lines into the sea, he would normally softly sing, but the lyrics wouldn't suit the Priest, he thought.

The Priest looked on suspiciously as the tune he did recognise, it took him to a time many generations ago, when his Father would come home drunk, and the neighbours would awake. He had the burns and scars to prove it.

The swell continued rocking and it's rhythm was only disturbed by a soft tugging. The fisherman, whose mind had wandered to the soft thighs of the local farmhouse daughter, the girl he had spoken to last night, the girl he had promised to see soon, suddenly looked up and grabbed his rod.

The priest looked up and was shocked to see him struggle. A man so accustomed to his trade, and a man of his size should not struggle with this task, he thought.

The fisherman grunted, his muscles swelled. Sweat dripped down his forehead. ""Father,"" he gasped, ""help me.""

The Priest took turns, and in shifts they dragged in this 7 foot Marlin. His scaled shone under the new sun and the azure blue.

The rest of the morning they pulled in over 40 fish.

It's a sign of God thought the Fisherman.

As they sailed into port a crowd had gathered around. The fisherman was a popular man and he was normally due back hours ago. People worried about his fate, especially considering the local farmer's daughter had last seen him with the Priest.

People gasped as the Fisherman stood at the bow and the Priest steered the boat home. The Fisherman threw the rope on the jetty clambered up, tying her securely.

The farmer remarked: ""That's a big fucker!""

The Fisherman's eyes grew wide, several people gasped, swearing in front of a servant of God was an incredible sin.

""I beg your pardon?"" Said the Priest.

The fisherman had to act quickly. He couldn't let the farmer be disgraced, he couldn't let the father of his future wife be spat upon and scorned. ""No your grace,"" he intervened, ""it's not what you think! It's what we call them in this province. Our dialect, you see? We call them fucker-fish.""

The Priest apologised, ""I am sorry, my son. I thought you had disrespected me, and therefore directly disrespected God. A thousand apologies, go now, in peace.""

The fisherman held up the Priest before he was about to leave. ""Monseigneur, please. Take the fucker-fish. It's too good for us, and I've heard the Cardinal is in town. Your grace brought God onto my boat, and he blessed me, and this town. Take this fish, for us.""

The charity smote the Priests heart. Tears welled in his eyes as he loaded the fish and took it back to his parish. 

The birds were awoken and sang beautiful, personal symphonies for him and his fish.

The cardinal was waiting for him. He walked from the stoop of the church, his shoes crunching on soft gravel, his blue eyes rivalled only by the sea. His wrinkled face matched the topography of the basque hillside just south west of this parish.

""Father,"" he started ""I have news fo- is that a Marlin?""

""It's a big fucker!"" Claimed the Priest!

""I beg your pardon, Monseigneur? How dare you speak to an agent of the Vatican in such a foul way?""

""No! Your grace, you don't understand,"" he explained, ""that's what we call it here, a fucker fish!""

""A thousand apologies. I was too hasty to condemn you. This is a great sign, and it foreshadows what I have to tell you! The pope! He is coming to feast tonight! This fucker will be perfect, I will have it prepared by the sister Magdalen.""

The fish was brought in by the servants, the cardinal following behind proudly. Sister Magdalen had come from the kitchen to see what the commotion was.

""That's a majestic marlin, Cardinal.""

""More than a marlin, sister! A huge fucker!""

She spat on him.

""I am a nun. A servant of God. I am married to him. How dare you?""

The cardinal wiped the spit off his face. ""You don't understand, sister. This is what the fish is called. A fucker-fish.""

""A thousand apologies, your grace. I will have it prepared immediately for tonight. May you help me scale it and prepare it?""

The pope arrived without fanfare. He had just been from Montpellier and the count had layed out a fanfare outside of the cathedral, and one hundred virgins inside of it. He looked forward to the country charms of his next visit.

He was welcomed by three nervous quaint people. The Priest, a small stout man, his hands scarred, and one eye permanently half closed. The Cardinal, tall, proud, his back ram-rod straight. The twinkle behind his blue eyes warmed even the coldest rooms. The Sister hid behind her face, slightly swollen now with age, there was a beauty hidden deep down there. It wasn't hard to imagine she had been beautiful decades ago.

""A wonderful parish,"" the Pope began, ""a wonderful people, a wonderful clergy and church. But what is that wonderful smell?""

The welcome party smiled at once.

""Please, follow us to the dining room.""

As they entered together the smell hit them at once. The larger fucker was laid out on the mahogany finish table, cooked in lemon butter sauce, served on asparagus and mashed potatoes. Cherry tomatoes still on the vine had been roasted and garnished the titanic plate.

""God is great,"" the pope remarked. His stomach churned and his mouth watered. He had never felt so hungry in his life. ""Tell me the story of this fish,"" he said as he say down.

The Priest said: ""I caught the fucker!""

The Cardinal: ""I scaled the fucker!""

The Nun: ""and I cooked the fucker!""

The Pope's eyes widened, and the three suddenly froze. Their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouth. Then the pope smiled, he leaned back and placed his feet on the table. A cigarette was fetched from his robe and placed in his mouth and lit as he smiled.

He chuckled and spoke, ""Yeah nah, you cunts are alright.""",A local priest was doing his rounds when he came upon an angler about to head off for his dawn fish.,5

The flight attendant goes up to the blonde and politely tells her that she does not have a first class ticket and must go back to coach. The blonde refuses and says , ""I'm blonde, I'm beautiful, I am going to Chicago, and I am staying right here."" 

After repeated attempts and no success at convincing the woman to move, the flight attendant goes into the cockpit and informs the pilot and co-pilot that there's a blonde bimbo sitting in first class who refuses to go back to her proper seat. The co-pilot goes back to the woman and explains why she needs to move, but once again the woman replies by saying, ""I'm blonde, I'm beautiful, I'm going to Chicago and I'm staying right here."" 

The co-pilot returns to the cockpit and suggests that perhaps they should have the arrival gate call the police and have the woman arrested when they land. The pilot says, ""you say she's blonde? I'll handle this. I'm married to a blonde. I speak blonde."" He goes back to the woman and whispers quietly in her ear, and she says, ""Oh, I'm sorry,"" then quickly moves back to her seat in coach.

The flight attendant and co-pilot are amazed and ask him what he said to get her to move back to economy without causing any fuss. 

""I told her first class isn't going to Chicago.""

edit: Consistency. Apparently, just typing out this joke gives you 'dumb blonde syndrome'.

Let's say a guy named Fred is attracted to a woman named Martha. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves. They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else.

And then, one evening when they're driving home, a thought occurs to Martha, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: ""Do you realize that, as of tonight, we've been seeing each other for exactly six months?""

And then, there is silence in the car.

To Martha, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he's been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I'm trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn't want, or isn't sure of.

And Fred is thinking: Gosh. Six months.

And Martha is thinking: But, hey, I'm not so sure I want this kind of relationship either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I'd have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily towards, I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person?

And Fred is thinking: ...so that means it was...let's see...February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer's, which means...lemme check the odometer...Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here.

And Martha is thinking: He's upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I'm reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed - even before I sensed it - that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that's it. That's why he's so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He's afraid of being rejected.

And Fred is thinking: And I'm gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don't care what those morons say, it's still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It's 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600.

And Martha is thinking: He's angry. And I don't blame him. I'd be angry, too. I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can't help the way I feel. I'm just not sure.

And Fred is thinking: They'll probably say it's only a 90-day warranty...scumballs.

And Martha is thinking: Maybe I'm just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I'm sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy.

And Fred is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I'll give them a warranty. I'll take their warranty and stick it right up their...

""Fred,"" Martha says aloud.

""What?"" says Fred, startled.

""Please don't torture yourself like this,"" she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. ""Maybe I should never have...oh dear, I feel so...""(She breaks down, sobbing.)

""What?"" says Fred.

""I'm such a fool,"" Martha sobs. ""I mean, I know there's no knight. I really know that. It's silly. There's no knight, and there's no horse.""

""There's no horse?"" says Fred.

""You think I'm a fool, don't you?"" Martha says.

""No!"" says Fred, glad to finally know the correct answer.

""It's just that...it's that I...I need some time,"" Martha says.

(There is a 15-second pause while Fred, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work.)

""Yes,"" he says. (Martha, deeply moved, touches his hand.)

""Oh, Fred, do you really feel that way?"" she says.

""What way?"" says Fred.

""That way about time,"" says Martha.

""Oh,"" says Fred. ""Yes."" (Martha turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.)

""Thank you, Fred,"" she says.

""Thank you,"" says Fred.

Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Fred gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a college basketball game between two South Dakota junior colleges that he has never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it's better if he doesn't think about it.

The next day Martha will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification.

They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it either.

Meanwhile, Fred, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Martha's, will pause just before serving, frown, and say: ""Norm, did Martha ever own a horse?""

And that's the difference between men and women.",The difference between Men and Women.,17

“My mother told me that the secret to a happy marriage was to never argue,” she explained. “Instead, I should keep quiet and crochet a doll.”
