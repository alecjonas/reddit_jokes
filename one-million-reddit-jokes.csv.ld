We’re going to settle this right now. Whoever can fill up an Excel spreadsheet with the most souls within 24 hours will officially be considered THE BEST.” They both say “Deal!” and go about their competition.

So Jesus gets on his computer and starts meticulously typing in the names of each soul, one-by-one, line-by-line, at his own slow and steady pace. Satan on the other hand is using macros and going on the dark web and illegally downloading thousands of lists of souls and is just filling out his spreadsheet with all these different names. He’s feeling all cocky and arrogant. “There’s no way Jesus can ever get more souls than me!”

But then, with only 5 minutes to spare, the power in Heaven goes out and comes back on. When Satan looks at his computer screen, everything is empty! He quickly tries to type everything back in as best as possible, but time runs out and Jesus still has all the souls he had slowly typed in over the past 24 hours. God announces “Jesus wins!” At this point, Satan is fuming with anger and cursing after every breath. “It’s not fair, it’s not fair! I had so many souls! How could he have won?!”

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

She fainted.”",First time with a condom,71

“Go ahead and do the same thing,”
The students hesitated for several minutes, but eventually took turns sticking a finger in the anus of the corpse and sucking on it. When everyone finished, the professor looked at them and told them;

The husband wants nothing to do with such business and leaves her to it. So, once a month, she boards the train, but not see her fictional great aunt, but her lover.

There comes a time when the lover tells her that he can't keep seeing her, and it's over. He gives her a box and instructs her not to open it until she is on the train. They say their last goodbyes, and she leaves with the gift. As promised, she waits until she is on the train to open the box. In it is the most exquisite pair of large diamond and emerald earrings. They are just her taste, she runs to the train bathroom to try them on and they are indeed gorgeous -- the most beautiful and expensive thing she has ever owned, and they look perfect on her. She is thinking of all the places she will wear them when she suddenly realizes that she *can't* wear them. What will her husband say? These earrings are clearly new and nothing her supposedly impoverished aunt would ever give her.

She comes up with a plan. After she gets off the train she takes the earring to pawn shop. When she gets home she tells her husband, ""and look what I found in the cab, a pawn ticket!"" He looks at the tickets and says it must be something really valuable to been pawned for so much as it says in the receipt. He tells her he will look into it the next day.

The following day, he calls his wife from work, ""darling, I went to the pawn shop and I took the item, I think it's something you'll really like."" She is excited, it worked! She says she'll come down right away a pick up the ""surprise.""

So they’re back at his place, and sure enough, they go at it. After a long while… He climaxes loudly. 

Then he rolls over, lights up a cigarette and asks her, “So…. you finish?” After a slight pause. 

She replies, “No.” 
Surprised, but pleasantly, he puts out his cigarette, rolls back on top of her, and has his way with her again, this time lasting even longer than the first… and this time completing the deed with even louder shouts. 

Again he rolls over, lights a cigarette, and asks, “So…. you finish?” And again, after a short pause, she simply says “No.” 

Stunned, but still acting reflexively on his macho pride, he once again puts out the cigarette, and mounts his companion du jour. This time, with all the strength he could muster up, he barely manages to end the task, but he does, after quite some time and energy is spent. 

Barely able to roll over, he reaches for his cigarette … lights it again, and then asks tiredly, “So… you finish?” 

“No. I’m Swedish.”",An Italian guy is out picking up chicks in Roma.,44

Quickly, the new ""gorilla"" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo. People from all over are coming to see the ""Human-like"" gorilla.

About a month in, the craze has started to wear off. So, to get peoples' attention back, he decides to climb over his enclosure and hang from the net ceiling above the lions den next to him. A large crowd of people gather watching the spectacle in awe and terror. Suddenly the man loses his grip and falls to the floor of the lion's den. The man starts screaming ""HELP!! HELP!!!""

Wednesday comes and the actor arrives at the audition. He marches on stage and shouts, ""Hark, I hear the cannons roar!""

""Brilliant!"" says the director, ""you've got the job! The first show is at 9 o'clock, Saturday night.""

The actor is so excited that he goes on a major bender. He wakes up 8:30 Saturday evening and runs to the theater, continually repeating his line, ""Hark, I hear the cannons roar! Hark, I hear the cannons roar!"" He arrives and is stopped by the bouncer.

""Who the heck are you?""

""I'm Hark, I hear the cannons roar"" says the actor.

""You're Hark, I hear the cannons roar?"" says the bouncer. ""You're late! Get up to makeup right now!""

So, the actor runs up to makeup.

""Who the heck are you?"" asks the makeup girl.

""I'm Hark, I hear the cannons roar!"" he says.

""You're late! Sit down."" So she applies the makeup. ""Now, quick, get down to the stage, it's almost time to say your line!""

They have a few drinks and Melania becomes less guarded. Janet asks Melania about the hand slap incident on the tarmac.

Melania: Donald can be such a pig sometimes. He goes around grabbing women by the pussy but he wants me to be the perfect wife. Sometimes it's too much and I can't take it any more.

Janet: Yeah, I know what you mean.

Melania (getting angrier): Sometimes when I'm really mad and he comes to bed and touches me with those hands... It's all I can do not to scream.

Janet: Yeah, I know what you mean.

Melania (looking a little suspicious): Sorry Janet, I don't mean to be discrespectful but I don't think you really know how uncomfortable unwanted male attention can be.

Janet: Melania, when you look at me, I know all you see is a short frumpy, overweight woman with white hair. But let me tell you-- in my day, I was quite the looker and had many men pawing at me, grabbing me. And men are just pigs.

Melania (with eyes starting to open wide): Yeah... So what did you do?

Janet (in a matter of fact tone): I've found that one of the most effective things to do is something completely unlady-like. You know, let loose a big fart.

Melania (giggling): That funny!

Janet: Try it and see if it doesn't stop them in their tracks.

Melania: Well, I guess I have nothing to lose.

So Melania starts eating beans to get ready to fend off unwanted advances. A few days later, Melania is in bed and the Donald comes to join her. After a few minutes, she can feel him inching closer. His hands start wandering and Melania doesn't want any part of it. She pretends to be sleeping but Donald keeps going.

Not far after that, the first guy still coughing and sneezing, another guy walks in shaking his arms randomly. He walks up to the receptionist and says, “As you can see I have an arm spasm, I need to see the doctor.” “Ok,” the receptionist replies, “Go sit down the doctor will see you soon.” So he goes and sits next the the coughing and sneezing guy. Not a moment later the guy with the arm spasms stops moving his arms, and the poor soul with the cough and the sneeze starts moving his arms. So the guy who once had arm spasms gets up and leaves.

A few minutes later a woman walks in, and she is quite obviously pregnant, she goes up to the receptionist and says, “I think this thing is ready to pop!” So the guy with a cough, a sneeze, and arm spasms gets up and says, “That’s it!”

The guy goes into the backyard and sees a nice looking Labrador retriever sitting there.
 
'You talk?' he asks.

'Yep,' the Lab replies. 

After the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog talk, he says 'So, what's your story?' 

The Lab looks up and says, 'Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young.  I wanted to help the government, so... I told the CIA.  In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping.' 

'I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running...

But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.'

'I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.' 

The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog. 

'Ten dollars,' the guy says.

'Ten dollars? This dog is amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheap?'

'Because he's a bullshitter.  He's never been out of the yard'.",Dog for sale.,83

One time I got a call from a woman trying to put together a concert for some big fundraiser or something. It was immediately apparent that she didn't really know what to ask for. Even so, I could sense a big deal in the making. Their budget was sky high, and the venue they had booked was known for great sound in local circles. All she needed me to do was to tell her who to get.

As it happened, I knew that 50 Cent was gonna be in the area at around that time and was looking to pick up more tour dates in the area. With the amount of money they were prepared to spend, I was sure I could book the show. I told the woman that I could probably get 50 Cent for the event, but she wasn't impressed.

I don't know if she thought Fitty was old news or if she just didn't know who he was, but she told me ""This is going to be the biggest show my organization has ever put on! I need someone HUGE to headline it.""

I was, understandably, a little annoyed at this. ""How much bigger can you get than 50 Cent?!"" I asked her. ""Do you want like two of him or something?""

She told me, ""I need about three Fitty.""

The two guys reply, ""Well, you know, we're from ~~Michigan~~ Ohio, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy for a chance to warm up a bit, you know.""

The devil decides that these two aren't miserable enough and turns up the heat. The next morning, he stops by again and there they are, still dressed in their parkas, mittens and hats. The devil asks them again, ""It's awfully hot down here, can't you guys feel that?""

Again, the guys reply, ""Well, like we told you yesterday, we're from ~~Michigan~~ Ohio, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy to warm up a little bit, you know.""

The two ~~Michiganders~~ Ohioans reply, ""Well, ya know, we don't get too much warm weather up there in ~~Michigan~~ Ohio, we've just got to have a cookout when the weather is this nice.""

The devil is absolutely furious, he can hardly see straight. Finally, he comes up with an answer. These two love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. He decides to turn all the heat in hell off.

The next morning, the temperature is below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere, the people are shivering so bad, they are unable to wail, moan or gnash their teeth. The devil smiles and heads for the room with the 2 ~~Michiganders~~ Ohioans. He finds them back in their parkas, mittens and hats. They are jumping up and down and cheering.

The black guy said ""I'm pretty sure it was the male considering how big it was.""

So the group headed back into the woods to save the Czechoslovakian. 

They found the male grizzly, shot him dead and cut open his stomach and to everyones surprise it was empty.

So they looks for the female and gave it the same fate as the male but shooting it dead and cutting open its stomach, except this time the fallen Czechoslovakian was inside its belly.

They decide to have a bet to see who can get the child to stop crying. They would each in turn drop a care package full of goodies to cheer the child up.

The first man flies the plane over and drops a box of food. Pizza, cookies, ice cream. A child's dream! Or so he thought. Upon inspection the child was still crying.

The second man decides to up the ante. He loads the plane with a truckload of toys and drops this in front of the child. The child continued to cry.

The third man laughed at his aquaintences. ""You fools! That's not a good way to stop a child from crying! I shall drop a bomb on him. Surely that will stop this pointless wailing!""

Realising the third man was about to murder an innocent child, the second man tried divert the plane. They wrestled for control, swerving left and right, causing the bomb to drop on a house next to where the boy was standing, leaving nothing but a wreckage and the child behind.

Much to their shock the child was now laughing hysterically.

""We give you all these gifts and you kept crying, but this house gets destroyed and now you are laughing. Whatever for?!"" Said the men in shock.

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Trump,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Trump spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Everybody knows Dave!,87

post,7nl5z9,2qh72,jokes,false,1514881044,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/7nl5z9/nate_the_snake/,self.jokes,,"Tim was an adventurous man, and he had quite a bit of money. One afternoon during work, Tim decided that he wanted to go driving on the dunes in egypt. So that weekend, he booked tickets to Cairo and took a few extra days off work. When he arrived in Cairo he took a bus to a smaller village with less people and laxer laws and rented a car to drive on the dunes. He went out the first time at night around 11:30 because his flight came in late. 

Tim had a marvelous time on the dunes: driving up and down them, going far too fast, and of course, drifting. He was at it all night and was having fun but the sky was getting brighter and he decided it was time to head home. As he started off towards the village the car suddenly sputtered and died and try as he might, Tim could not start it up again. Tim kept trying to start the car, he had extra gas so it wasn't that, what could it be? 

Eventually Tim figured out the battery had died. This worried Tim slightly but he remembered the village was to the east so he figured he could walk. The car compass said the nose was pointing east so he took his water bottle from the car and started walking off in that direction. What Tim didn't know was that the compass wasn't accurate because the car had died so he ended up walking west instead of east. He walked for a few hours at which point he climbed to the top of a large dune to see if he could see the village. From the summit he looked and could only see the car several miles back where he came from and then nothing but desert for miles and miles around.

Tim decided it would be best to head back to the car and around mid day he made it back. He then decided it would be best to follow the car tracks. He followed and followed them along but ended up back at the car. Confused and frustrated, he thought how that could happen. He concluded that because he was doing donuts, he ended up following the wrong trail. He set out again determined to find the right one; an hour later he was back at the car. He tried one last time but the wind was covering the tire tracks with sand making traveling not possible and he was forced to return to the vehicle. Tim by this point was desperate. He decided his only option was to just pick a direction and hope for the best. He collected what little remained of his water and a bottle of wiper fluid he had in his car in case he needed fluids and picked a direction and started walking.

By the time Tim left the car it was pushing 6 o'clock. He walked and walked for several hours and ended up at the foot of a large sand dune. Tim decided that his best chance of survival was to climb the dune so he set out. About 45 feet up he was feeling the burn and pretty soon it became too steep to climb. Tim got on his hands and knees determined to climb the dune. About half way up he chugged the last of his water and continued to forge on. About 3/4ths of the way up he felt like he was dying of dehydration and decided that having some fluids in him was better than none and he could be cured of the poison back in the town, so Tim drank the wiper fluid. The fluids in him again had him feeling rejuvenated and he pushed to the top of the dune.

When he reached the top his head was spinning from the wiper fluid but he had made it! He crested the peak and looked out into the falling sun expecting to see the village. Unfortunately all he saw around him was desert. Disheartened he looked to going back down the dune when he noticed something, a smallish wooden and straw structure half buried in the sand. He started crawling down the dune toward the structure, now fully feeling the effects of the poison. He crawled into an opening in the structure and by this time he was barely conscious. Inside the structure was a golden colored lever. This confused Tim, and when he stood up to try and push it, his head started spinning something bad and he collapsed into unconsciousness. 

Tim woke up to light coming through the cracks in the building and felt rejuvenated. He felt healthy. ""How is this possible?"" Tim thought to himself, ""am I dead?"" Tim started to sit up, those questions floating through his head when all of a sudden he was face to face with a snake. And much to Tim's astonishment, the snake began to speak. ""Hello I am nate the snake"" The snake said. Tim was confused and scared but he worked up the nerve to sputter out a few ""whats"" and ""hows."" The snake interrupted Tim's unintelligible babbling to say ""Travelers usually don't find this place, and the ones that do get 2 wishes. I saw that you were poisoned, dehydrated, and dying so I granted a wish on your behalf allowing you to survive and stay healthy without a need for food and water."" This made about as much sense as any explanation that Tim thought of so he accepted it. The next question that came to Tim's mind concerned the lever. Nate the Snake began to explain: ""The lever is a doomsday lever, in fact, this area used to be what you know as the garden of eden. This lever was supposed to destroy the world and all its inhabitants if the animals became corrupt or evil, since then humanity has spread all across the planet and we can't have the world ending now can we?"" 

Tim didn't quite buy it but the snake continued his story: ""I am descendant of a generation of serpents supposed to guard this lever and make sure no travelers, such as yourself, wander across this lever and push it killing everybody."" By this point Tim was so confident he was hallucinating that he just went along with it. The snake asked if Tim had any questions: ""Ya so do you know where the village is?"" Tim asked. Nate the Snake replied with a short ""no"" and continued to talk on about how Tim is the first person he'd seen in many many years, as it became more apparent that Tim didn't really care, Nate the Snake pointed out that Tim still had one wish. ""Oh right!"" Tim exclaimed and proceeded to ask Nate for an internal compass so that Tim would always know where he wanted to go. Suddenly, Tim knew the way to the village, it was about a days walk southeast of where the structure was. With that in mind, Tim thanked Nate and promised to visit again (still thinking he's hallucinating but at least he has a direction to go now) and he set out southeast to where he hoped the town was.

Tim stumbled into town later in the day convinced that he was just lucky and that the Nate the Snake encounter was a fever dream on account of the poison. He checked into a hospital and was given drugs to flush out the toxins but he was fine. He decided to cut his trip short on account of his odd adventure in the desert and he took a bus back to Cairo the next day then flew home. Tim continued his life where he left off, and he told all his friends about his ordeal in the desert, and he went on with his normal life for about 5 years.

Then one day Tim was going to go out to eat with is friends and something occurred to him: he hadn't eaten or drank anything in over a week, he'd just been too busy and didn't think of it. This puzzled Tim as he racked his brain to figure out why then suddenly the whole Nate the Snake encounter came flooding back to him. If he didn't need to eat or drink, that means the whole encounter much had actually happened! Tim became terrified then excited as he considered the possibilities of it then he remembered the promise he made to Nate to come back and visit him. He hastily bought a ticket to Cairo for the weekend and took a couple days off work. The flight was uneventful and he ended up in Cairo where he took a bus to the small village.

Tim didn't have the money to rent a car this time but since he didn't need to eat or drink he figured he could just walk to Nate's domain. With his internal map pointing the way, Tim set off into the desert to the Northwest and walked for the rest of the afternoon and well into the night. By the time the sun was rising behind him, Tim walked over the final dune and saw the small wood and grass structure that housed the lever. When Tim was approaching the structure, Nate the Snake slithered out in front of him. ""Tim!"" Nate the Snake exclaimed, ""I thought you'd forgot about me"" Tim felt blood rushing into his cheeks as he felt ashamed about forgetting, ""Im sorry Nate, Ive just been so busy living my life and honestly, i chocked our whole meeting up to hallucinations due to the poison"" ""Thats understandable"" nate said ""Thank you for coming back though it really means a lot to me, anyway I have someone to introduce you to."" As if on cue, a smaller snake slithered out. ""Tim"" Nate continued, ""This is my son Joe"" ""Oh hi there"" Tim said ""Now tim,"" Nate said, ""I actually have a huge favor to ask you, my son, Joe, will take over my job when I die and be bound to guard the lever forever. I want you to take Joe with you and show him the world, I know this is a lot to ask but please, I want him to see the world before he's bound to the lever forever""

Tim was hesitant but he figured that Nate had saved his life, so he owed him that favor. So after the meeting, Tim and Joe trekked back across the desert to the village and back to Cairo. Nate quit his job and they spent the remainder of his money traveling the world. Tim and Joe travelled Asia first, then the americas and finally they went to europe. It was around the 5th month of the traveling and Tim and Joe ended up in a bar in Norway. Over some beers they were discussing their plans next and Joe spoke up saying that they had been gone for a while and that it might be time to go back. Tim agreed that it was time and they flew out to Cairo a few days later.

They landed in Cairo and took the bus to the village and started walking the day and a half journey to Nate and Joe's home. After about 6 hours of walking, Tim and Joe came across a car half buried in the sand. Tim brushed off the sand and unburied it from the sand before climbing inside. After checking out the car and briefly looking at the engine, Tim concluded that it was in working order. Tim and Joe searched a little bit for a person to whom the car belonged but found nobody around, so they hot-wired the car and started driving to shave off many hours from their journey. 

After a few hours of driving they were nearing the lever and started the last downhill section toward the lever. The car started picking up speed so Tim applied the break, and nothing happened. Tim started panicking and slamming the break but the car didn't slow down at all. ""Whats wrong?"" Joe asked with a tone of fear in his voice. ""The car's breaks or jammed it isn't working"" Tim and Joe both pushed on the breaks as hard as they could but nothing happened. They turned off the engine in desperation but the car kept sliding toward the structure, suddenly, Nate came out of the structure to the left facing away from the car but he couldn't hear because the engine was off. There was a flat area behind the structure so Tim figured if he just turned right he could roll to a stop.

Tim turned the wheel right but the car didn't shift at all because the tires were stuck in a groove. Tim kept trying to turn it but nothing was happening, he briefly by accident shifted the wheel left and the car moved. The car was going quickly toward the lever building and they had to make a move. Tim kept yelling ""What do I do?"" to Joe, he could either hit the building or move left and hit Nate because the car wouldn’t go right. Joe was rather quiet and then he looked Tim with tears in his and rested his tail upon the wheel and started pushing it to the left. Tim looked confused and scared as joe maneuvered the car so that it would hit Nate. Tim looked at Joe and asked, ""Why?"" and Joe looked back, crying now, and said:

Better Nate than lever.

If you take it to the lodge, you will inherit his position."" 

So the young man went to the Freemason Lodge and presented the ring. ""Come this way,"" said the gatekeeper. He led him down a twisting hallway, to a room lined with velvet curtains. ""Enter..."" the gatekeeper said, pulling a curtain back. The young man passed through, only for an iron door to slam behind him. He heard four dozen locks lock. The young man was trapped.

In front of him was a hole. He peered into it, only to get poked in the eye by a penis! He looked up and saw the gatekeeper squinting down at him. ""Suck..."" said the lugubrious gatekeeper. The young man refused. ""Suck... or DIE!""

The young man, fearing death, was now the official dicksucker of the lodge. At first he protested by using teeth, but the freemasons responded by shooting him with a taser. So he decided that he would be the best damn dicksucker the lodge had ever seen-- after all if you have a job, you might as well do it well.

So the young man sucked the days away, memorizing each Freemason's face so he could one day kick their asses. However, there was one man who came for his dicksucking every day at 3PM, wearing only a black hood. Most masons used his mouth infrequently, but every single day at 3PM the man in the black hood made an appearance. This annoyed the young man-- if this man's dick was in his mouth the most, he deserved an ass-whooping more than anyone.

Eight months later, the gatekeeper came in the young man's mouth and said, ""Congratulations. Your servitude is over, you are free to go."" It was 2:59 PM. ""Please, sir, just one more dick,"" said the young man.

The gatekeeper's cock slid out, to be replaced by the hairy, moley affair that the young man instantly recognized as Black Hood's johnson. It bristled in anticipation. ""Please sir,"" the young man said to Black Hood, ""I've come to love dick suckery over these last eight months, and I've cherished this dick above all others. Please, remove your hood so I can see who it belongs to. I beg of you.""

Black Hood removed his black hood.

""Grandpa?!?"" The young man gasped in shock. ""I thought you were dead!""

""No,"" said Grandpa. ""I just always wanted you to suck my dick.""",Inheriting grandpa's Freemason ring [explicit] [long],0

""Well, now that I'm sitting here, would you mind buying me a drink?"" She asked.
 
""Not at all."" the man said. He bought her a martini and another for himself.

""Well, now that we're drinking together, mind if I ask you your story?"" she asked him. 

""Not at all."" The man said. ""I'm recently divorced. I was really into kinky sex, and my wife wasn't, so we parted ways.""

""Well that's fascinating."" She said. ""That's my story exactly. I was really into kinky sex, and my husband wasn't, so he divorced me.""

""Well that is fascinating."" the man said. 

""Well"" said the woman. ""Since we have so much in common, why don't you come over to my place, and have another drink there?"" She said.

""Wouldn't mind at all"" said the man. 

Twenty minutes later they are at the woman's condominium. She settles him down in her living room with a drink, gives him a wicked grin and says:

""Don't move a muscle. I'll be right out.""

The woman goes into her bedroom. She immediately strips down, inserts a butt plug with a pony-tail. She then puts on her best bondage outfit, thong and bra, and nine inch stiletto heels. She settles a leather cap on her head, grabs a bag of sex toys and a cat o nine tails, and starts to stride out into the living-room.

Destination: Timbuktu.

The crowd bursts into applause. Not to be deterred, the Redneck gets up and says,

Tim and I a-hunting went,

Met three whores in a pick-up tent,

They were three, and we were two,

So I bucked one, and Timbuktu.

And every day at noon, they all sit together on top of whatever structure they are currently working on, and eat their packed lunches together.

One day, they opened their lunch-boxes to see what had gotten packed for them, and were not pleased with what laid inside. 

""Ew,"", the brunette groaned, ""I've got a tuna sandwich. I hate those"".

""Yuck"", the ginger retorted, ""I've got a tuna sandwich as well. I hate those rotten things"".

""Gross!"", the blond shrieked, ""I've got a tuna sandwich, too! I hate tuna!"".

But, they couldn't finish work on an empty stomach, so they sucked it up, ate their revolting sandwiches, and finished their workday. 

Next day at noon, nothing had improved. 

""Jesus Christ!"", the brunette exclaimed, ""I've gotten a tuna sandwich once more! Next time I get one, I swear, I'm gonna jump off of this skyscraper and kill myself!""

""Oh for the love of-"", the ginger hissed, ""I've gotten a tuna sandwich once more, as well! Next time I get one, I swear, I'm gonna jump off of this skyscraper and kill myself, too!""

""Oh, man!"", the blond whined, ""I've gotten a tuna sandwich once more, too! Next time I get one, I swear, I'm gonna jump off of this skyscraper and kill myself with you guys!"".

However, even though the sandwiches were utterly vile in every way, the three workers couldn't finish work on an empty stomach, so they sucked it up, ate their revolting sandwiches, and finished their workday. Also, once they had gotten home, they all told their wives that they hated tuna in all of its entirety.

It was the next day, and of course, there was tuna in all of their sandwiches. So, as promised, they jumped off of the top of the skyscraper they were currently building, and died on impact with the ground below them.

Three days later, it was the three construction workers' funerals. The families of those deceased decided that it would be nice if the three workers had their funerals all in one, to symbolize the friendship that they all held in life. 

Once everything was officially said and done, the brunette's wove cried louder than before, ""Oh! I should have listened to him when he told me that tuna was his least favourite food! I'm the worst wife ever!"".

After the brunette's sorrow-filled cries were heard, the ginger's wife tearfully spoke up. ""He told me,"" she'd sniffle, ""that he'd kill himself if I gave him tuna one more time. I thought he was kidding, I'm the worst wife ever!"".

And then, the blond's wife simply shrugged and said ""Don't look at me, he packed his own lunch"".",There are three men that are all construction workers...,24

Client: Is room 39 empty?

Boss: Yes, sir.

Client: Can I book it?

Boss: Of course you can.

Client: Thank you.


Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.


The boss agreed though he was surprised at the weird things the client asked to have.


The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.


Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.


After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.


The boss didn't slept that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.


In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.


He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.


The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.


The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.


After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.


The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.


This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.


Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.


The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.


The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up.


To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.


The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.


In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.


Client : ''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''

Boss : ''I promise I will never let anyone know''.

Client : ''Swear''

Boss : ''I swear I won't reveal your secret''


So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss.

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Up until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.


When he does, I'll let you know...",A handsome man went into a hotel...,7

Chris consulted with his sister and decided, after careful consideration, that a pair of good quality gloves would strike the right note... not too romantic and not too personal. Off he went with his sister to Harrods and they selected a dainty pair of fur lined quality leather gloves. His sister bought a pair of sexy knickers for herself at the same time. Harrods had a free gift wrap offer but the assistant mixed up the two items, the sister got the gloves and Chris unknowingly got the knickers. Good old Chris sent off his gift wrapped present in a parcel with the following letter:

Dear Maggie, I chose these because I've noticed that you are not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. If it had not been for my sister I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears shorter ones (which are easier to remove). These are a very delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and I hardly noticed any marks. I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little bit tight on her. She also said that they rub against her ring which helps keep it clean. In fact she hasn't needed to wash it since she began wearing them. I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other hands will touch them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off remember to blow into them a little bit because they will be naturally a little damp from wearing. Just imagine how many times my lips will kiss them during the coming year. I hope you will wear them for me on our next date. All my love, Chris

P.S. My mother tells me that the latest style is to wear them folded down with a little bit of fur showing.",A young man called Chris from London wanted to buy a Christmas present for his new girlfriend.,176

Stephen King argued as best he could, but in the end the publishers' desire for more money won out, and Richard Bachman was not chosen to be the name under which the horror story about the gorilla would be written.

My mom was never really into the add on features so I was a little surprised that morning. Here she was, eating some sugar slugs and watching the newest red-filtered movie when she started talking ""You know, I remember the old movies, before they had to edit red faces to blue for movies... Back when I birthed you..."" She stopped talking then and as she began to panic, her face turned blue. She didn't tell me she had a blue mod so I was a little confused. Imagine my face when it started turning purple? She reached out to me in horror, I assumed at what she said. But no, when the autopsy report was provided to me, it stated that she had simply been choking on the sugar slugs and turned blue due to lack of oxygen... Well... Color me surprised!

*************



Four rabbis had a tradition of spending a day each week golfing and discussing theology between holes.  Very often they would argue, with three of them taking one side and eventually arguing the fourth one down.



One day, though, the fourth rabbi simply would not budge on his point - he swore he was right and that the other three were misguided.  Exasperated by the stubbornness of the others, he fell to his knees.



""Oh, Lord, give me a sign to show that I am right and that these other three are wrong.""



Just as he finished, four storm clouds blew in over the golf course.  Three all merged into a single larger cloud, but the fourth blasted through the larger cloud, dissipating it.



As smug as the fourth rabbi was, the other three insisted that this was nothing that couldn't be explained by natural phenomena and that he was still wrong.  Again, he fell to his knees.



""Oh, Lord, please give *another* sign to show that I am right on this.""



As he was finishing his prayer, a single storm cloud blew in and sent a fork of lightning down on four trees standing on a nearby hill.  Three of the trees were destroyed and the fourth remained intact.  Again, though, the three rabbis argued that it was a hot summer day and the occasional freak lightning storm didn't signify anything.



""Oh, Lord,"" he began again before being cut off by a billowing voice from the clouds.



""HE'S RIGHT!"" the voice boomed.



One of the three rabbis simply shrugged at this.  ""Alright.  So now it's three to two.""",Four rabbis were golfing,1739

A few days later the preacher saw the little girl again.

""And how are your little Christian kittens doing today?"" asked the man of God.
""Oh, they aren't Christian kittens, they're Pagan kittens,"" replied the girl.

The little 10-year-old girl does not eat and has her nose in her plate….

After a few moments, she says, “I’ve something to tell you people”

Silence around the table.
“I’m no longer virgin”, and she begins to cry. A long silence again. 

And then… 
The father screams at his wife, 
“It’s your fault! 
Always dressed and made up like a whore! 
Do you think you are setting a good example for your daughter?
Wallowing the whole day on the sofa, exposing your pussy… 
it’s disgusting! 
That’s how problems arrive”

The wife, in turn yells at her husband: 
“What about you ?
Are YOU setting a good example ?
Wasting your salary on sluts who sometimes even accompany you to your doorstep!
Are YOU setting a good example for your 10-year-old daughter?”

The father continues”
“And her elder sister, this good-for-nothing, 
With her hairy junkie of a boyfriend, 
Who is always groping her in all the corners of the house, 
Do you believe she is setting a good example for her younger sister?”

And the recriminations go on, and on, and on….

The grandmother touches the shoulder of the little granddaughter to console her 
And asks her :
“Well, my little girl, how did it happen?”

And the little girl replies while stifling her sobs :
“it’s the priest”

The grandmother asks : 
“What do you mean, the priest ?”

“The priest has chosen another girl to be Virgin Mary in the Christmas play…

As he's investigating the scene in the outskirts of town, he notices a Toyota in a ditch. He notes this down and writes on his pad.

**October 16, 1:30 PM. There is a Toyota Corolla in the ditch. D-I-T-C-H. Ditch.**

After jotting this down, the officer walks down the road. He notices another car down the lane, also in a ditch. The officer takes note of this and writes it on his pad.

**October 16, 1:32 PM. There is a Honda Civic in the ditch. D-I-T-C-H. Ditch.**

And after jotting this down, he walks further down the road, only to find something rather unusual: The severed head of an unfortunate victim. Noting that it is near an intersection, the officer begins to write.

**October 16, 1:37 PM. There is a severed head at the intersection of Route 412 and Point Way Buolev-**

**Bole-**

**Boolevar-**

*kicks head*

**In the ditch. D-I-T-C-H. Ditch.**
