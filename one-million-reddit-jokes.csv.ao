There was a large gum tree on one of the highest points in her property.

She wanted a good view of the natural splendour of her land, so she started to climb the big gum.

As she neared the top, she encountered a koala that attacked her. In her haste to escape, the woman slid down the tree to the ground and got many splinters in her crotch.

In considerable pain, she hurried to a local ER to see a doctor. She told him she was an environmentalist, vegetarian, and an anti-hunter and how she came to get all the splinters.

The doctor listened to her story with great patience and then told her to go wait in the examining room and he would see if he could help her.

She sat and waited three hours before the doctor re-appeared. The angry woman demanded, ""What took you so long?""

He smiled and then told her, ""Well, I had to get permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, Native Vegetation, Parks and Wildlife service, and the Bureau of Land Management before I could remove old-growth timber from a 'recreational area' so close to a Waste Treatment Facility. And I'm sorry, they turned you down.”",The Greenie,34

With that as his mission he began searching for the perfect woman.

Shortly there after he met a farmer who had three stunning, gorgeous daughters that positively took his breath away. So he explained his mission to the farmer, asking for permission to marry one of them.

The farmer simply replied, ""They're lookin' to get married, so you came to the right place. Look 'em over and pick the one you want.""

The man dated the first daughter.

The next day the farmer asked for the man's opinion.

""Well,"" said the man, ""she's just a weeeeee bit, not that you can hardly notice...pigeon-toed.""

The farmer nodded and suggested the man date one of the other girls; so the man went out with the second daughter.

The next day, the farmer again asked how things went.

""Well, the man replied, ""she's just a weeeee bit, not that you can hardly tell...cross-eyed.""

The farmer nodded and suggested he date the third girl to see if things might be better. So he did.

The next morning the man rushed in exclaiming,

""She's perfect, just perfect. She's the one I want to marry.""

So they were wed right away. Months later the baby was born.

When the man visited the nursery he was horrified: the baby was the ugliest, most pathetic human you can imagine. He rushed to his father-in-law asking how such a thing could happen considering the beauty of the parents.

""Well,"" explained the farmer, ""She was just a weeeee bit, not that you could hardly tell... pregnant when you met her.""",The perfect woman,127

When posted on a person's cake day, however, they become the anti anti cake day cake day posts, a breed that only appeals to a very selective, 'cultured' group, and seems like a shitpost to innocent passers-by. This also sucks, and must be made a mockery of, using the anti anti anti cake day posts, and anti anti anti cake day cake day posts. Now most of the audience is lost, and an inside joke is formed, like a Phoenix from the ashes. Like all good inside jokes, the first time uttered is seldom the funniest, thus the anti anti anti anti cake day posts and anti anti anti anti cake day posts are born. After this the target group gets a good laugh out of the anti anti anti anti anti cake day posts and anti anti anti anti anti cake day posts. After this reincarnation of the worst joke in Reddit history, it only goes downhill. The anti anti anti anti anti anti cake day posts and anti anti anti anti anti anti cake day cake day posts are little more than filler on a page, rotting mounds of the dead slugs that the ancient 'cake day posts' were.

'Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past. For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.'

The dog said: 'That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?'

So God agreed.

On the second day, God created the monkey and said:

'Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.'

The monkey said: 'Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the Dog did?'

And God agreed.

On the third day, God created the cow and said:

'You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.'

The cow said: 'That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?'

And God agreed again.

On the fourth day, God created man and said:

'Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.'

But man said: 'Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?'

'Okay,' said God, 'You asked for it.'

So that is why for our first twenty years we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves. For the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next ten years we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. And for the last ten years we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.

He led John to a corridor with four, ordinary-looking doors. Walking over to the first, he laid a hand gently on the doorknob.

""You must choose one of these doors. However, there are a few conditions: once you skip a room, you cannot go back to it. If you do not choose by the third room, you will automatically be assigned to the fourth room. Believe me, you really don't want that. Shall we begin?""

Death opened the first door and John peered inside. His jaw dropped as he saw demons ripping chunks of flesh from humans chained to cold, stone slabs. Screams filled the air and John thought he might be sick. He did not choose this door.

The next room Death led him to radiated heat. As Death opened the door and John looked inside, the smell of burnt flesh filled John's nose. Demons were roasting humans slowly over fire pits, pierced through the ribs on giant spits and turned head over heels. John did not choose this room.

""Now remember,"" said Death. ""If you do not choose this door, you will have no choice but door number four.""

He opened the door slowly. A foul stench of rot and feces hung in the air. Inside was a pool. It was filled with human waste and entrails. However, John noticed three men sitting by the side...they were drinking beer!

""This one!"" said John. ""I want to spend eternity in this one.""

""Very well,"" Death said with a bow. ""Please enjoy your stay.""

A small demon invited John into the room and instructed him to strip off his clothing. He was then handed an ice cold beer and told to join the others in the pool. John sunk into the refuse, reminding himself of the horrors he had escaped. This wouldn't be so bad.

Suddenly, a large, red demon burst through a set of doors.

post,fa06es,2qh72,jokes,false,1582750877,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fa06es/texas_chili_cookoff_long/,self.jokes,,"My dad sent me this from like 14 years ago and it cracks me up every time I read it 

""TEXAS CHILI COOKOFF"" 
   *Note: Please take time to read this slowly. If you pay attention to the first two judges, the reaction of the third judge is even better! 
  
The notes are from an inexperienced Chili taster named ""FRANK"", who was 
visiting Texas from the East Coast: 
  
Frank: ""Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The Judge #3 called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the Budweiser truck, when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I 
accepted."" 
  
Here are the scorecards from the event: 
  
Chili # 1 Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili: 
Judge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick. 
Judge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild. 
Judge # 3 -- (Frank) Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy. 
  
Chili # 2 Arthur's Afterburner Chili 
Judge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang. 
Judge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken 
seriously. 
Judge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer 
when they saw the look on my face. 
  
Chili # 3 Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili 
Judge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick. Needs more beans. 
Judge # 2 -- A bean less chili, a bit salty, good use of peppers.
Judge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all of the beer. 
  
Chili # 4 Bubba's Black Magic 
Judge # 1 -- Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing. 
Judge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or 
other mild foods, not much of a chili. 
Judge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. That 300-LB. bitch is starting to look HOT ... . . just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac? 
  
Chili # 5 Linda's Legal Lip Remover 
Judge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive. 
Judge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. 
Judge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks! 
  
Chili # 6 Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety 
Judge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers. 
Judge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb! 
Judge #3-- I shit myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally. She must be kinkier than I thought. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone. 
  
Chili # 7 Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili 
Judge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers. 
Judge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should take note that I am worried about Judge #3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably. 
Judge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava like poop to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it; I'm not 
getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach. 
  
Chili # 8 Tommy's Toe-Nail Curling Chili 
Judge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence. 
Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge # 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor dude, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?",Texas Chili Cook-off (long),2

He went to a really great primary school, the teachers and headteacher were really easygoing and he had a group of amazing friends that he loved spending time with. 
Something had been playing on Luke’s mind and, during play time, he asked his best friend; “What is the Purple Hand?”
His friend, normally extremely laid back and even misbehaved at times, looked at him with the most mortified expression Luke had ever seen. 
“What the hell Luke?! I’m sorry but I don’t think we can be friends any more. I’m going to tell Mrs Smith.”
With that, Luke’s friend ran off and left him feeling embarrassed and upset. 

When Luke got back to class, the teacher smiled at him softly, took him aside and said, “Luke, I understand that you and your best friend Yola have had a bit of a falling out.”
“We did, Miss, and I don’t really understand. We were playing football and I asked Yola, ‘What is the Purple Hand?’”
Well, Mrs Smith, normally a kind and understanding teacher, scowled. 
“Luke Fitzpatrick! This behaviour is absolutely unacceptable and I am shocked! I have no choice but to send you to the headteacher!”
Luke, again, was very sad and confused about what had happened. Mrs Smith sat him outside the headteacher’s office. “Now you sit there and think about what you have done!”

And think Luke did. He thought hard about how he might have been misunderstood or misheard, but he had no idea what was going on. About 20 minutes passed and the headteacher, Mr Bowdidge, found Luke sitting and crying outside of his office.
“Oh Luke, what’s wrong?!” Mr Bowdidge asked sympathetically, “has someone in your class upset you?”
Luke moved to Mr Bowdidge’s office and took a good long moment to think very carefully about what he was going to say. 
“Mr Bowdidge,” Luke sobbed, “my friend Yola and Mrs Smith are really upset with me because of something I said. I didn’t mean to upset anyone and I really just want to know what’s going on.”
Mr Bowdidge knew that Luke was normally very well behaved and never caused any problems, so he assumed there had been a misunderstanding.
“Oh Luke, I’m ever so sorry to hear about this. What on earth can you possibly have said to cause so much upset?”
Luke took another long moment to think.
“Sir, if I tell you, can you please understand that I don’t want to upset anyone and I really don’t want to get in trouble?”
“Absolutely, Luke.” Mr Bowdidge listened intently.
“Well... all I asked was...
“Yes, Luke?”
“All I asked was... what is the Purple Hand?”

Mr Bowdidge nearly fell off his chair. His face turned scarlet red and slammed his hands on his desk, outraged. “Utterly horrific! You nasty little boy! I have absolutely no option other than to expel you! You are no longer welcome at this school!”

At this point, Luke was confused, depressed and frustrated. He still had no idea what was going on. Luke’s mother, Steph, picked him up from school. In Luke’s mother’s state of disappointment and Luke’s shame, barely a word was uttered between them until they were nearly home. 
“Mummy, I’m really, truly sorry, but I don’t know what’s happening. I’m scared, sad and confused and I want all of this to stop.”
Steph saw Luke’s genuine anxiety and started to feel guilty for not speaking to him. 
“Oh sweetheart, what’s happened? Maybe if you explain to me I can speak to Mr Bowdidge and sort all of this out.”
Despite trusting his mother with his life, at this point Luke didn’t know if he could tell the truth. 
“Mummy, I tried to say the same to Mr Bowdidge but it didn’t work. I will only tell you what has happened if you ABSOLUTELY PROMISE that you won’t hate me, I won’t get in any more trouble, and everything can just go back to the way it was.”
“Darling I could never hate you! You’re my son and I love you very much. I promise.”
Luke was finally at ease. 
“It all seems silly really. I asked Yola, and she told on me to Mrs Smith. I tried to explain to Mrs Smith what I asked Yola, but then Mrs Smith sent me to Mr Bowdidge. Mr Bowdidge seemed very understanding but then he expelled me!”
“What did you ask, darling?”
“I just asked... what is the Purple Hand?”

Luke’s mother lost it. She stamped her foot on the gas pedal and sped home quickly and angrily while Luke sat, again, scared and worried. Steph gripped Luke by the ear and dragged him into their house, up the stairs and into his bedroom. She slammed the door closed and sobbed a sob of her own, frustrated, ashamed and angry. Luke heard his mum pick up the phone and tell his dad, Ben, to tell him that Luke had been expelled having crossed the line with his behaviour and ordered him home as quickly as possible.

Luke’s dad worked quite a way away, so he had a solid couple of hours to sit on his bed, wracking his brain for answers and trying to figure out what he’s going to say to his dad when he gets home. 

Before he knew it, he heard the dreaded key in the door, then a grumpy series of steps walking up the stairs. He opened Luke’s bedroom door. 
“Daddy, please let me try to explain before you tell me off. I’m sure this is all a big misunderstanding and if you just listen to me, PLEASE, I think this can all get sorted out.”
Without a word, Luke’s father pulled up a chair, sat in front of Luke and eyed him expectantly. 
“Dad, if anyone is going to be able to understand, it’s you. Can you please, PLEASE just tell me, what the blinking hell is the Purple Hand?!?!”
Luke’s dad’s eyes widened at the sound of this question. A vein sprouted on his forehead that looked like it was about to explode.
“Steph, get the police on the phone. Now.”

Luke was taken to the police station, sat in an interrogation room and ordered to sit silently while the police spoke to his parents.
In walks PC Woolcott. 
“Well, well, well, Mr Fitzpatrick. We’ve spoken to your friend, your teacher, your headteacher and your parents, and I’m afraid this all seems to have gotten a touch out of hand. What have you got to say for yourself?”
“Sir, I’m really sorry, I love my parents, Yola is my best friend, and I would never purposely misbehave at school. Something has gone dreadfully wrong!”
PC Woolcott felt for the little guy. 
“Mr Fitzpatrick, we have been told that you may have asked a certain question to start this particular palaver. In order for us to proceed, we need you to tell us what that particular question was. No ands, buts or ifs if you don’t mind. What was the question you asked?”
Luke knew there was no hope trying to explain. 
“What is the Purple Hand?”

Luke had been in prison for ten years, now a young adult and rubbing shoulders with people he never thought he would in his life. One day, he found himself with a new cell mate. An old, wisened man who had clearly been in the prison system for decades. “Mornin’ fella. Name’s Buster (I’ve run out of familiar male names at this point). What you in for?”
Luke, now used to being assigned new cell mates because of this forsaken question, had now stopped caring. If anything, he now has nothing to lose and the thought of finding out the answer to his question drove him on. 
“What is the Purple Hand?” Luke asked, waiting for the reaction. 
Buster laughed. “Ahh I see. Well, if you really want to know what the Purple Hand is, I can tell you. Better yet, you can find out for yourself so you know I’m not lying.”
Luke was excited. For years he had asked person after person and was faced with disgust or anger, and this is the first time someone has been willing to help.
“Please, tell me, how do I find out?!”
“Well, when you get out, you go to the prison exit, follow the road on the left until you reach town. When you get to town, go to the high street and wait at the bus stop for the number 362. Jump off the bus at the sixth stop, cross the road and go into the library. On the second floor, third stand from the back, on the top shelf, is a book named The Purple Hand. That book will have all of your answers.”
Luke wrote these instructions down furiously. Luckily, he only had a year left on his sentence and now had something to look forward to. 

A year went by and Luke did not lose his excitement. He was happier than ever and the days flew by, knowing that his question was to be answered. 
He picked up his things, left the prison, followed the road to the prison exit, took a left and walked until he reached town. There, he found the bus stop and waited for the number 362. He boarded the bus, got off at the sixth stop and looked over the road to see the library. He crossed the road and... SPLAT!

He was hit by a lorry.

- There is no way he will be caught unprepared and ask for something that can be twisted and manipulated with him becoming the butt of many reddit jokes to come.

he asks the genie to give him time to think and the genie who has been sitting around for about 10000 years is like... no worries and sits back enjoying the breeze and the scenery (there is only so much xbox you can play inside a bottle before you get a little stir crazy).

The guy cannot figure out  the catch or the trick and wants to see if he can outsmart the genie. 

hey genie, what 3 wishes you would wish for?

the genie replies rather quickly, much quicker than you might imagine a genie replying: the obvious 3 wishes of course: infinite wishes, infinite money and immortality.

the guy is even more confused now because that is exactly what he was going to ask for and now he is even more sure the genie has some ridiculous plan to screw him over or build him a bridge to hawaii or explain how women feel or all the other bad genie jokes on reddit.

the guy is NO ONES FOOL, and says I refuse to be made a fool of,

he tells the genie to F off back to his xbox in the bottle and then the guy walks away into the sunset assured of his extreme wisdom into not being tricked.

A game of truth-telling is being played at court by a Queen and her retinue. A knight is asked by the Queen if he has fathered any children; he is forced to admit that he has not. 

The Queen nods in assent, saying ""you do not have the look of a man who could please his mistress when you hold her naked in your arms. For your beard is little more than the kind of fuzz that ladies have in certain places, and it is easy to tell from the state of the hay whether the pitchfork is any good.""

On his turn, the knight asks ""Lady, answer me without deceit. Is there hair between your legs?"" When she replies, ""none at all"", he comments, ""Indeed I do believe you, for grass does not grow on a well-beaten path.""",A Dirty Joke from the 14th Century,14

However, just as their craft are about to enter lightspeed, a mysterious pulse of energy fries their systems and instead jumps them to a planet they’ve never seen before- an ocean world orbiting a small, dim star.

The two scoured their ship’s built-in database for any mention of the world, but in the end, they couldn’t find anything. It didn’t seem to belong to the Republic, or the CIS, or anyone at all. In fact, there was no mention of the world at all.

Curious to learn where they were and possibly resupply their craft, the two maneuvered their starfighters down to a raised mesa that rose above the rest of the ocean. They couldn’t find any signs of intelligent life on the world, so they resolved to explore until they found something.

After walking through the vibrant coral forests for some time, they stumbled upon a tiny village filled with what appeared to be giant crabs. They attempted several forms of communication, they eventually managed to get their point across by a series of gestures and attempts at miming. They learned that the crabs were happy to meet them, that they could be housed and fed, and that they were expecting an important guest shortly, who would be interested in their company.

The two passed the time exploring the village and attempting to learn more about the crabs’ culture. Eventually, however, they noticed that an elderly humanoid man was walking down to the path to the crab village. As he walked within its borders, every crab in the village turned towards him and saluted them at once. 

Suddenly, Obi-Wan drew his lightsaber and decapitated the old man with a single swing. The crabs swarmed around him, chittering angrily and wielding sharp implements.

“Why would you do that?” asked Anakin, horrified.

“That man was powerful in the ways of the Dark Side,” said Obi-Wan.

“How could you tell?”

“Because,” Obi-Wan said, “Only a Sith deals in crab salutes.”","It was the height of the Clone Wars, and Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin had just finished a heated battle against separatist spacecraft.",8

post,f9jg7u,2qh72,jokes,false,1582673204,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/f9jg7u/youre_not_a_monk/,self.jokes,,"A man was driving in the middle of nowhere down a secluded country road far from any cities. He got a flat tire, and got out to walk for help. After walking for some time, he came to a small stone monastery. He knocked on the door and roused the monks. ""I've got a flat tire. Can I use your phone?"" he asked. 

The monks said they were sorry, but they did not have a phone. ""If you stay tonight, you can get a ride on our wagon into town tomorrow,"" So the man stayed the night, and they put him in a small room in the monastery. 

In the middle of the night, the man was awakened suddenly by a noise. Not just any noise, but the loudest, most wonderful, most beautiful, most hair-raising noise ever. 

He sat there, his heart beating for a few minutes, and he heard it again! Getting out of bed, he went running in the direction of the noise. It came again, making the hair on the back of his neck rise and his skin crawl. Finally, he came to a large door where the head monk was standing. The door was at least 15 feet tall, and made of solid-looking wood and metal. It had chains and bars and locks and a deadbolt on it, and was the most formidable door the man had ever seen. 

""What was that sound?"" he asked. ""What made it? Is it behind that door?"" 

The head monk shook his head. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I can't tell you; you're not a monk."" 

As the man turned away, he heard the noise again. ""You have to tell me what it is."" he begged. 

""I'm sorry, I can't tell you, you're not a monk,"" said the monk. 

The man tried to sleep, but couldn't get the noise out of his head. In the morning, as he was getting ready to leave, he heard the sound again. It made his ears ring and his mind whirl. ""Please tell me what made that sound!"" 

But the monks wouldn't. ""I'm sorry, you're not a monk"" was all they said. 

The man left, and eventually got his car fixed and went back to his life. But he couldn't get the sound out of his mind. After a few months, he got in his car and drove and drove until he found the monastery again. He got out of his car and found the head monk. ""I can't forget that sound from that night I was here. Please, please please tell me what made that sound."" 

The head monk just shook his head. ""I can't tell you; you're not a monk,"" 

""Then tell me how I can become a monk,"" the man said. 

The head monk said ""It's very difficult. Are you sure you want to do this?"" 

The man said ""I've got to. I have to know what made that sound."" 

The head monk said, ""To join us, you have to perform several tasks. Your first task is to count all of the stars visible in the sky."" 

The man thought about how hard that would be, but he had to know what made that sound. He sat up every night for a year, counting the stars over and over until he was sure how many stars were visible in the sky. He went to the head monk and told him, and the monk nodded. 

""Very good. Your next task is to count all of the grains of sand on the beaches around the world."" 

The man knew this would be even harder, but he could not get the noise out of his head. He had to know what kind of being could make that wonderful, beautiful sound. So he left on his journey. He crawled the length and breadth of every beach in the world, counting the grains of sand, and he returned to the monastery years later. The head monk heard his answer and nodded. 

""Excellent. You are almost done. Your final task is to climb to the peak of the highest mountain in the world, and see yourself in relation to the rest of creation."" And the man knew this would be hard, but he outfitted himself, and he went to the highest mountain in the world, and he climbed to the top, and returned months later, older and wiser and more tired than years before when he had first heard the noise, the noise that would not leave his mind and that echoed in his every waking thought. He returned, and the head monk saw that he was wiser, and said ""At last, you are a monk. Come with me."" 

He led the man through the monastery, its twisting and turning halls, and as they went the man heard the noise again, over and over, and he was no longer sure if it was the noise or merely his memory of it. And finally.. Finally! Finally he stood in front of the door and the head monk opened it up, and the man saw what had made the noise. 

But, I can't tell you what it was because you're not a monk.",You’re not a monk,2

It was during this time that the man's fiance began spending less and less time at home, and much more at friend's houses, or so she said. It was also noted that she became much more interested in Joseph, feeling sorry for him.

Weeks went by and the wedding day of the man and his fiance finally came around. He waited at the altar for the entire day, but his fiance did not show up.

Shocked and disappointed, he walked back to his apartment, where he found a note from his fiance. It said that she was leaving him for Joseph, and that this was goodbye forever. He sat glumly on the bed and said to himself:

Theresa replied, ""David, I have to be honest and open with you. Yes, I've been unfaithful three times in the last 50 years, but always for a good reason.

David was obviously upset by his wife's confession, but said, ""I never knew, Can you tell me what you mean by 'good reasons?'""

Theresa said, ""The first time was shortly after we got married, and we were about to lose our house because we couldn't afford the mortgage.

Do you remember that one evening I went to the bank and the next day he notified you that the loan would be extended?""

David remembered the visit to the bank and said, ""I can forgive you for that. You saved our house, but what about the second time?""

Theresa said, ""And do you remember when you were so ill, but we didn't have any money to pay for the heart surgery that you needed? Well, I went to see your doctor one night and, if you remember, he did the surgery for free.""

""I recall that,"" said David. ""And you did it to save my life, so of course I can forgive you for that. Now tell me about the third time.""

Jake's eyes went wide with fear. ""Not the old Johnson house! Didn't anyone tell you the story about that place? Old Man Johnson went insane and murdered five members of his family in that house, then leaped into the river and was never seen again. Some people say he still lives in the woods, waiting for more victims to enter the house. Others say he drowned and his ghost haunts it. But nobody goes to that house any more.""

""Oh, that's silly!"" said Lois. ""We've been in the house for a week and haven't seen or heard anything at all scary. I'll tell you what. Why don't you and some friends from town come to our house for dinner Saturday night? We'd love to show off the house, and you can see for yourself that there's nothing to be afraid of.""

Jake reluctantly agreed, and later convinced three friends to come along. They arrived at the house Saturday evening as it started to rain, and they could hear a storm approaching in the distance.

Henry greeted them at the door and ushered them inside, while Lois called from the kitchen that dinner was ready. They sat around a table already covered with food while she brought out a platter of pork chops. As they ate the storm grew outside, but the couple coaxed the others into friendly conversation to distract them from it. Eventually everyone relaxed when they saw there was nothing to be afraid of. 

As they were finishing dinner there was one pork chop left. Lois offered it to each guest in turn, but no one wanted to be so rude as to accept. Just then a bolt of lightning struck outside the house and the lights went out!

For the first storm of the winter, she tuned in as usual and heard the following message:

""Urgent impending storm update: in order to accommodate snow plows, please park cars on the side of the street with odd-numbered houses. Thank you.""

So she put on her coat, hurried outside, started the car, and moved it to the correct side of the street the radio announcer had instructed.

Three days later, another storm was imminent, so the wife tuned in as usual, this time coat in hand, prepared to learn where her car needed to go.

Then came the moment she was waiting for:

""Update for the incoming snow: for our snow plows to efficiently clear the roads, please make sure to park your cars...""

It was at this moment that static cut through. The wife sat on the edge of her seat, hoping to hear this important news. But the only other words she heard from the announcement were the final two words: ""Thank you.""

She turned to her husband, frantic. ""What should I do? I don't know where to park the car! How do I find out which side of the street to park on?""

To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""

The first guy answers, ""That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!"" The policeman says, ""Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.""

Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""

The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, ""Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!""

The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?""

Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, ""Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.""

The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""the suspect wears contact lenses.""

The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not.

""Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that."" He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.

""Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?""

""That's easy,"" the third guy replied."" He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.""",A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives.,132

The doctor made a physical examination and listened to the symptoms, and concurred with the self-diagnosis.

""I want you to come back tomorrow to start treatment. And bring an apple, and an orange and a Mars Bar"" said the doctor.

Despite the seemingly odd request, he complied and returned the next day with an apple, an orange, and a Mars Bar.

The doctor then said, ""Okay, now drop your pants and bend over. This is going to hurt a bit.""

Although stunned by the turn of events, the patient dropped his pants and bent over. With one deft motion, the Doctor rammed the apple up the guy's arse, swiftly followed by the orange and the Mars Bar. While the doctor consulted his watch, our hero danced around the room shouting at the doctor.

""Okay, I want to see you here at the same time every day for the rest of the week, and bring another orange, apple and Mars Bar."" said the doctor. The now humbled patient, with tears of pain in his eyes, nodded his head.

All week the same routine ensued. First, the doctor rammed up an apple, then an orange, and then a Mars Bar

After one full week of treatment, the doctor finally said, ""Well, tomorrow is the LAST day of treatment. I want you to bring in an apple, and orange and a hammer.""

""No Mars Bar?"" asked the very frightened patient, trying to imagine what a hammer was going to feel like.

""Nope, a hammer."" confirmed the doctor.

On the last day, the doctor said, ""Okay, you know the routine"". So the man dropped his pants and bent over. UP went the apple, and up went the orange.

One minute passed. Then two minutes. Three. Four minutes passed.

Finally, the worm's little head poked out of the patient's arse.

He looks the statues up and down, and with a flick of his wrist, \*POOF!\* he turns the statues into real people.

The man and woman stare at each other in amazement, but their attention soon turns to the angel, who's quite satisfied with himself, grinning from ear to ear.

He says to the couple, ""You guys have been staring at each other while locked in stone for the last 100 years, completely unable to do a thing about your urges for each other."" He pauses, and then adds: ""It's still pretty early, and people don't usually get to the park for another 30 minutes. You two should go into that covered area and…well, just have a good time.""

The man caught the eye of the woman, who had a twinkle in her eye and wore a mischievous grin. She bit her lip seductively, and with that the man grabbed her hand and the two ran off to the bushes.

The next day, the man got an email telling him that unfortunately, he didn't fit the bill.

----------------------------------

A black woman of about 35 sat down in the manager's office, ready for her interview. She was applying for a job as a chemical engineer at the same company, also trying to engineer cleaner catalytic converters for cars.

""So, welcome to Cleaner Industries! We are the most diverse and progressive office in the country!"" said the manager. ""Tell me"", said the manager, his eyes remaining friendly. ""What do you know about catalytic converters?""

The black lady talked for an hour, unloading all her knowledge from her entire career, flexing her knowledge of obscure processes, chemical reactions and patents in the field. She showed her enthusiasm for all the cutting and bleeding edge research, even quoting a recent publication from the company. Years and years of experience, she was advancing the field, and had all the experience and expertise anyone would ever want.

The next day, the woman got an email saying she was being considered for the role.

--------------------------------

Another white man of about 30 sat down in the manager's office, ready for his interview. Same role, same office.

""We are the most diverse and progressive office in the country!"" said the manager. ""Tell me"", said the manager, his eyes remaining friendly. ""What do you know about catalytic converters?""

The white man stumbled over himself for an hour. He was far less knowledgeable than the first two candidates, and a lot younger. With five less years of experience in both the field and interviews, he often got cold feet. In desperation, he'd often try to recall an obscure detail, but often get it wrong.

The next day, the man got an email saying he was being highly considered for the role.

He had disclosed in his application that he was gay.

-------------------------------------

A woman in a hijab, in her late 20s, sat down in the manager's office, ready for her interview. Same role, same office.

""We are the most diverse and progressive office in the country!"" said the manager. ""Tell me"", said the manager, his eyes lighting up. ""What do you know about catalytic converters?""

The lady seemingly had no passion for the field and almost seemed bored during the interview. When asked questions, it quickly became apparent that her knowledge of the field was very limited. Her entire career up to this point had been in a completely different field (oil refinery), and had next to no knowledge of catalytic converters, let alone any of the recent advances in the field. 

The next day, the woman got an email saying she was an outstanding candidate for the job and seriously in the runnings.

-----------------------------

A lady wearing a burqa sat down in the manager's office, ready for her interview. Same role, same office.

""You're hired"", said the manager.","""We are the most diverse and progressive office in the country!""",0

I’ve never seen anyone try and stuff so much shit into one drum before (It was an 8kg for those of us out there that have any idea what that means). I literally came running into the kitchen one night, thinking a fucking helicopter was landing on the worktop, to find that he’d stuffed his entire suitcase and yes I do mean the actual suitcase itself into the machine. That was it for me I stormed straight to his room kicked the door open and said to him straight Cal you’re an inconsiderate piece of shit, a terrible roommate and actually you’re just a bit of an all round dickhead, we would all prefer it if you moved out!!

One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job.  Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home.  One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot.  He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food.  After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store.  In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off.  He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  

  

About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store.  His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving.  An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital.  He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical.  They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  

  

The dentist wakes to a knock on the door.  Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues.  Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door.  When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper.  He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  

  

The grim reaper swears.  ""Oh no!  This always happens with identical twins"".  

  

""What do you mean?""  asks the dentist.

  

""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld.  I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended.  I'll take my leave now.""  

  

The dentist is noticeably upset.  He says ""Wait!  Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life?  After all, YOU made the mistake.  Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""  

  

The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""  

  

The dentist thinks.  ""How about a challenge?  If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""  

  

The grim reaper laughs.  ""I will beat you in any challenge.  What challenge do you propose?""  

  

The dentist smiles.  ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth.  5 minute of brushing each, then we decide.""  

  

""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  

  

Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull.  It's glistening.  He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes.  After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright.  The grim reaper grins.  ""You are foolish human.  But, you are entitled to your chance.""

  

The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman.  When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste.  He smiles.  

  

It's unbelievable.  

  

The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  

  

The winner is obvious.  The grim reaper hangs his head in shame.  ""You win, human.  This time.  Your brother will live.""  He disappears in a puff of smoke.  At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital.  Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy.  Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings.  It's his brother, the dentist.  He picks up.  ""Hey bro.  You'll never believe what happened.  Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car.  They say I almost died.""  

  

The dentist smiles on the phone and says.  ""That's interesting, bro.  Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.""","In celebration of my cake day, here's the worst joke I've ever created.",88
