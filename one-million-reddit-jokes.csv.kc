To his surprise, the Marines accept him enthusiastically. They feed him at the officer's club, they fix his car at the motor pool, and they even allow him to sleep in the VIP quarters. 
But, as the soldier tries to fall asleep that night, he hears a strange sound. All through the night, he hears this sound. 
The next morning, he asks the Marines what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a Marine."" 
The soldier is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. 
Some years later after he has gotten out of the Army, the same man breaks down in front of the same Marine Corps base. Again the Marines accept him enthusiastically, fix his car, and allow him to stay in the VIP quarters. That night, he hears the exact same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. 
The next morning, he asks what it is, but the Marines reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a Marine."" 
The man says, ""All right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound is is to become a Marine, then how do I become one?"" 
The Marines reply, ""You must go to Marine Boot Camp, and there undergo several weeks of torturous training. You will be yelled at, put down, cut down, and physically exhausted. From there you will receive infantry training. You will learn how to fight, survive, and win. You will eat, sleep, and breathe the Corps. The Marine Corps will become your core. IF you finish these trials, you will be a Marine."" 
The man sets about his task. He goes through MCRD, advanced infantry training, and is assigned to a MEU. While with the MEU he is sent to fight in two small wars, and three ""police actions"". 
Three years later, while on leave, he returns to the Marine Corps base where he last heard that strange, strange sound. Standing there in his Dress Blues, he says, ""I have joined the Corps, and I have paid my dues. I have fought for the love of God, Country, and Corps. 
The Marines reply, ""Congratulations. You are now a Marine. We shall now show you the way to the sound."" 
The Marines lead the man to a wooden door, where the Base Commander says, ""The sound is right behind that door."" 
The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. The Base Commander then gives him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The Base Commander hands him the key to the stone door. 
He opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He gets another key from the Commander, and behind that door is yet another door, this one made of sapphire. And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, amethyst... 
Finally, the Commander says, ""This is the last key to the last door."" 
The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

He is generally motionless except for the waggling of his pencil on the notebook he's doing sums in and the occasional pause to take a sip of his Jasmine tea. 

All of a sudden his head shoots up from his equation filled stupor, left eye twitching erratically. Shakily, he rips off the page he's working on and proceeds to scrawls something hastily on the page, as steady as he can. After he finishes, he bangs on his desk to get his Grad Student's attention, and mutters ""S-S-Saaaaaint-l-l-lo-ove! G-g-et. T-tooo...SAINT-L-LOVE!!"" Before collapsing on to the floor. Naturally, the grad student immediately calls for an ambulance, but then, recognizing the name, calls Her professors' colleague, Prof. Craig Saintlove, PhD. the Jr. Astrophysics Chair over at Cornell, telling him what happened. Professor Saintlove, hops on a plane that night and arrives at the hospital just in time to get the bad news: his friend has passed on. The deceased professors grad student is standing outside the ICU when Saintlove walks up. She greets him, and while she is mostly composed, it's obvious that she has been crying.

""It's ok my dear, I completely understand. He and I go all the way back to M.I.T.; He was like my brother.""

The grad student nods solemnly and offers Professor Saintlove the notebook her mentor had written his last message in. ""Here. His last request was for you to have this. I haven't brought myself to look. It didn't seem right.""

Professor Saintlove opens the notebook up and reads what is written. His eyes turn wide as saucers, and takes on the appearance of a man who just won the lottery, the Superbowl, and got married to the hottest supermodel in the world, all in the same day. 

""D-d-do You know w-what this i-s!?"" he finally chokes out, (hardly able to contain himself, do to having to be quiet around patients)

""No, what?"" asks the grad student, interest piqued.

""If this is correct, (and I can't see why it wouldn't be, it all fits so perfectly) it's a dual resolution to the Hawking radiation paradox, and mathematical proof for the existence of Gravitons!!""

""Wait, but that would mean..."" 

""YES!!! It's the unified field theory!!! The old bugger did it!! Right...before...he died...""

At this point, nurses are beginning to motion for the two to contain themselves, but the mood has already become somber once more.

Presently, a doctor clutching a folder comes up to the two and after asking if they are friends or family, and disposing with greetings, announces quietly that he has the test results back from the lab and knows the cause of death. He asks Saintlove and the Grad Student if they would like to know. They indicate that they do indeed. 

""Well, Before I do,"" the doctor explains, ""I couldn't help but over hear your conversation earlier. Now, while I'm not a physicist by any means, I am *still* a man of science, and can recognize an important leap in scientific thought when I hear it.""

The two, the Grad Student and Saintlove, both nod/shrug in acceptance of this truth.

""Now you're friend had a gross sub-cerebellar venous aneurysm of the right motor cortex.""

The Grad and Saintlove both half ask, half state ""Okay?...""

""Well,"" Says the doctor smirking wryly, ""I *was* going to put ""brain aneurysm"" on the death certificate but after hearing your story, I figured that ""Stroke of Genius"" might be a tad more appropriate.""

""Very good, here is a sports car as a reward. Enjoy."" said St. Peter smiling as he hands over his keys. 

St. Peter turns to the second man and asks him the same question. The second man has a bit of shame in his expression as he confesses. ""I may have cheated once or twice, I did always love my wife though."" 

""Well you are telling the truth and even though you haven't been completely faithful your sins have been forgiven. Take this Prius as a way to get around heaven."" St.Peter smiles and hands over the keys. He turns to the last man who is looking quite nervous. Asking the same question once more the man decides to come clean and confess his sins without shame. 

""Yes I cheated on my wife. I took every chance I got and it was fun. I'm sure it happened at least twice a month."" The man proclaimed, his eyes gleaming with a bit of defiance. 

""Well I won't send you to hell because you were brave enough to confess your misgivings. Here, take this Vespa to get around."" St. Peter smiles wryly at the man as he hands over the keys. The three men take their vehicles and drive off.

A week later the three men meet up by chance and decide to have a bit of a chat. The man with the sports car however has a sour expression on his face. The other two ask him what made him so upset.

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open.

Suddenly, a woman eating a sandwich at a nearby table begins to cough. After a minute or so, it becomes apparent that she is in real distress.

One of the hillbillies looks at her and says, ""Kin ya swallar?""

The woman shakes her head no. Then he asks, ""Kin ya breathe?""

The woman begins to turn blue, and shakes her head no.

The hillbilly walks over to the woman, lifts up her dress, yanks down her drawers, and quickly gives her right butt cheek a lick with his tongue.

One morning, the workers come in early to open the zoo like normal and find, to their great sadness, that their famous gorilla has died of old age. The zoo staff are incredibly distressed by this development because they loved that gorilla--it was a really great gorilla--and also because they probably won't have a job in a month after the zoo shuts down due to bankruptcy.

But the zoo's owner, he's got an idea. He calls the gorilla's primary  zookeeper into his office and says, ""Hey, so I could fire you right now since we don't have a gorilla anymore, but I'm not going to! Instead, I want you to dress up in this highly realistic gorilla suit and pretend to be our beloved gorilla--just until we purchase another one, I promise."" And so the zookeeper says, ""Alright, I'll pretend to be a gorilla. After all, no one who works at this zoo knows as much about gorilla behavior as me."" And so he puts on the suit and starts doing his monkey thing.

This dude becomes a sensation overnight. People are absolutely amazed by the humanlike gorilla that this obscure zoo has acquired. Numbers are great, and for the first time in years the zoo is turning a sizable profit.

Now a couple months go by, and the newness is starting to wear off. The zoo is still making plenty of money, but not as much as when the whole monkey thing started. And the zoo owner has gotten a little bit greedy. He calls the monkey man into his office and says, ""Hey dude, numbers are going down, I need you to get them back up again or you'll be out of a job."" The zookeeper us hugely frustrated by this unreasonable demand. He thinks, ""I'm already being a monkey, what the heck else do you want me to do?!"" But instead of venting his spleen on his supervisor, he takes a deep breath and says, ""Alright, I'll see what I can do.""

That night, the monkey man breaks out if the gorilla enclosure, sneaks into the tiger enclosure, and waits for the zoo to open. As people stream by the next morning, he begins his new act: swinging around on the roof of the tiger enclosure, always just a few inches out of reach of the furious felines jaws. This most definitely does catch people's attention, and almost seems like a good idea...all the way up until the moment his hand slips and he falls down into the tiger's territory.

The tiger starts prowling toward him-- splayed helplessly on the ground, breath knocked from his lungs--and so the zookeeper-turned-monkey starts doing what any reasonable person would do. He starts yelling, ""Help! Help!"" at the top of his lungs.

The tiger hears its prey's desperate screams, and growls. It leaps, pins him down, and whispers in his ear, ""You need to shut up, you're gunna get us both fired!""",The Zoo Joke (Long),65

First thing Monday morning, he sets off on his first round and soon catches up to the person in front. He sees that this is a woman and, as he catches up to her on a par 3, that, in fact, she’s very attractive. He’s interested and suggests that they play the rest of the round together. She agrees and a very close match ensues. She turns out also to be a very talented golfer and she wins their little competition on the last hole.

 He congratulates her in the parking lot, then offers to give her a lift when he sees she doesn’t have a car. All in all it’s been a highly enjoyable morning.

 On the way to her place, she thanks him for the morning’s company and competition and says she hasn’t enjoyed herself so much on the course for a long time. “In fact,” she says, “I’d like you to pull over so I can show you how much I appreciated everything.” He pulls over, they kiss and she shows him her appreciation.

 The next morning he spies her at the first tee and suggests they play together again. He’s actually quite competitive and slightly peeved that she beat him the previous day. Again they have a magnificent day, enjoying each other’s company and playing a tight, competitive round of golf. Again she pips him at the last, again he drives her home and again she shows her appreciation.

 This goes on all week, with her beating Fred narrowly every day. This is a sore point for his male ego but, nevertheless, in the car home from their Friday afternoon round, he tells her that he has had such a fine week that he has a surprise planned: dinner for two at a fancy candle-lit restaurant followed by a night of passion in the penthouse apartment of a posh hotel.

 Surprisingly, she bursts into tears and says she can’t agree to this. He can’t work out what the fuss is about but eventually she admits the reason.

“You see,” she tearfully sobs, “I’m a transvestite.”
Fred is aghast. He swerves violently off the road, pulls the car to a screeching halt and curses madly, overcome with emotion. “I’m sorry,” she repeats.

“You bastard,” he screams, red in the face, “You cheating bastard. You’ve been playing off the red tees all week!!” ",Fred has a week off and decides,7

This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico. But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was lost forever. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great that they declared a National Day of Mourning. The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course as:

It's like the oldest joke. But on every other joke that's posted on this sub, it gets referenced, and there's always at least one reply who doesn't get it.  I've explained the reference to like 4 people today and this seems like a better solution.  So here it is. 

Joke:
So a hippie gets on a bus, and he sits down next to a nun. After a minute, he notices that the nun as really hot, and, being a stoned out hippie (make love not war and all that) he asks her if she'll have sex with him. Obviously she says no, and slaps him. The hippie sits in silence for the rest of the ride. After the nun gets off, the bus driver says to the hippie, ""hey, so I know for a fact that nun goes to the graveyard to pray every night, and if you dressed up as God, you could probably command her to sleep with you. I'd have done it ages ago, but I'm gay.""

So the hippie dresses himself up as God and goes to the graveyard, where he finds the nun. He makes a grand appearance, and commands that she prove her loyalty by screwing him. The nun agrees, but insists that it be anal so she can stay a virgin.  She also insists that she be allowed to keep her habit on, so if anyone sees them, they won't see her face. 

They screw, and after it's done, the hippie whips off the robe and yells ""Surprise! I'm the hippie!""

The nun whips off her habit and yells ""Surprise! I'm the bus driver!"" ",For all those who don't get the bus driver comments on every post here,1215

There were a few harumphs of agreement and then the next youngest, in his 80s, said ""Well, I think I'd like to get the old Nitro Express off the wall, trek out into the Kush, and well, maybe this time the tiger will get his lunch""

The third member of the trio, in his 90s, but with a twinkle in his eye, says ""Bloody amateurs, I want to be shot by a jealous husband"".

Their business grew enough that they were eventually the only place in a ten kilometer radius to sell flowers; and gathered a monopoly on the market. 
One day, a couple of Friars opened another greenhouse and flower shop right across the street!  Their products took time to be recognized by the local market, as the Nuns had a tight grip; but gradually the Friars started taking business.
Seeing that they were not going to have a successful business soon, the Nuns decided to push the Friars out of the community.  First they snuck into their shop one night and started a fire. The community volunteer firefighters were able to extinguish it quickly, with little damages. 
Then the Nuns tried to tarnish the Friars reputation by spreading rumours about their Flowers supposedly being GMO abominations. Customers saw through this, and the rumours dissipated quickly.
Finally, the Nuns hired a local thug named Hugh who had a panache for destruction.  He took a weed-whacker to the Friars shop, then drove his truck through the front door,  while spraying herbicide over everything. 
The Friars, of course,  had no option but to pack up and leave town; leaving the Nuns back to their monopoly. 
Leaving us to realize that Hugh, and ONLY Hugh, can prevent Florist Friars. ",A group of Nuns opened a Flower Shop.,21

""I've never done anything to deserve ending up in hell!""

""Relax my friend"" Satan says calmly.

""Everyone can leave and end up in heaven. You just have to do one thing first"". He guides me to a door and says;
""There's a woman in there. Fuck her and you will go to heaven. If you fail to satisfy her, you're doomed to stay here forever"". 

Since I couldn't see anything wrong with this request, I decide to enter the room, where I saw the ugliest woman I've ever seen. She looked like a combination between a hippo, a mole rat and a human. Not wanting to stay in hell for the rest of eternity, I decide to give her the best sex of her life. After about 20 minutes or so, I walk out and greet Satan again.

""Well done, human!"" 
he exclaims loudly, and starts walking me over to the stairway to heaven, through the same corridor as before. On my way, I notice my buddy in another room, and decide to look through the doors window. He's fucking the prettiest, sexiest woman I've ever seen. Angrily, I turn to Satan and yell;

Upon learning this news he decides to go speak with Cardinals around the world about ideas on how to get people to have faith in the Church again.

He tells the Cardinals at the Vatican that hes going to speak to the Cardinal in New York. He tells them he does not want it to be high profile and to not let the media find out. They agree upon the condition that hes back by the next morning to host morning mass, he agrees.

Upon landing in NY his driver takes him to St. Patricks Cathedral where he meets with the Cardinal. After several hours of talking the Pope looks out the window to see its night time, he jumps up and says he must go so he can return to the Vatican in time for morning mass. They say their goodbyes and the Pope runs out to the driver and hops in the car.

The Pope tells the driver he needs to floor it since he has to be at the airport in 30 minutes or else he'll be late to morning mass. The driver tells him he cannot exceed the speed limit cause he can lose his job if ticketed. The Pope understands and tells the driver to switch spots and that he'll drive.

The Pope gets onto the highway and is doing 120mph. A cop sees the limousine and proceeds to pull him over. The Cop says to his partner, ""I'm sick of these rich people in their limos thinking their above the law, I'm really gonna give it to this guy."" The cop walks up to the limo window and sees it the Pope. He turns ghostly white and proceeds to wave the Pope to leave. So the Pope rolls up the windows and pulls off.

The cop gets back in his car and his partner says, ""What happened? Thought you were gonna really give it to him."" The cops says, ""Nah man, it was too big."" Partner says, ""Mayor?"" The cop shakes his head. ""Governor?"" Cop shakes his head again. The President!?"" Cop shakes his head. The partner asks, ""Who the hell his bigger than the President!?"" The cop says, ""I don't know, but the Pope is his chauffeur."" ",The Pope visits New York,21

He was about to dismiss the waiter, when he noticed a string dangling from the waiter's fly. With a grimace of distaste, the critic said, ""You have a string sticking out of your fly.""

""We don't call it a 'fly', sir,"" remarked the waiter drily.

""What the hell do you call it then?"" inquired the critic.

""The 'bus depot',"" said the waiter.

""Bus depot?""

""Yes, sir. It's where we park our bus.""

""You mean your johnson?""

""Yes, sir. We call it our 'bus'.""

""So what's the string for?""

""Well, sir, in this establishment we take great care to never touch our buses with our fingers, lest we God forbid transmit a digestive malady to our guests. So, when nature calls, we use the string to pull our buses out of the depot. Upon completion, we use a special tool to drive our buses back inside.""

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living,329

There be a ship over yonder by the name of ‘Queen Anne’s Revenge!’ If we board it we’ll be the most powerful pirates across the 7 seas!” To that her crew all yelled out “Aye!” So they went out and started to board the ship. They were very successful in their boarding until they got to the captain: Black Beard. They went into his quarters and he sliced apart everyone that come into the room until the captain walked in and jumped back in time, but not fast enough. She got her breasts cut off, but she managed to stab Blackbeard, killing him. She went back to her ship where her remaining crew grabbed a log and carved her two wooden breasts. 

That would be a very weird story if it were real, wooden tit?",Once upon a time there was a story about a female Pirate captain.,2

A man with a stutter (Dave) started his new job on a construction site and was walking around with one of his colleagues (Jim) being given a tour of the site. 
“Th-th-this is a pretty cool p-p-place. I’m so h-happy I got the job” Dave said. 
Jim replies “Yeah man! It is a pretty easy going place to work too.”

Some time went by and Dave had almost finished learning the basics of working on the site.
Jim says to him “there’s one last thing you should know about working on this site, it can land you some easy money if you do it right. 
Jim explains to Dave that the foreman for the site is “very gullible, and if you do something that saves the foreman from danger, he’ll throw an extra $50 onto your pay check for that week, let me show you an example”. Jim then proceeded to. Take Dave to the top floor of the site, directly above where the foreman was standing, and picked up a brick. “Watch this,” Jim says, “I’ll drop this from the top floor, onto the foreman’s head, but before it hits him, I’ll shout down to him to move out of the way!” 
Dave seems worried... “i-i-isn’t that a b-bit dangerous?”
“Of course not! He’s not in any danger, he is used to this happening, after all he does work on a construction site” Jim replies. 
Jim then proceeds to drop the brick down to the foreman, but as soon as he lets go he shouts “FOREMAN LOOK OUT!” 
The foreman jumped away from where he was stood, and he shouts up to Jim -
“Thanks Jim! I owe you one! I’ll add an extra something to your pay check this week!”
Dave looked shocked “I-I can’t believe that w-worked!”
Jim chuckles and says “Of course it worked, I’m a genius!” 

A few weeks passed by and Dave came to work one morning worrying about how he was going to make it through the week without coming short on his bills.
“I-I don’t know what I’m supposed to do! This n-n-never happens to m-me”
Jim thinks for a moment and suggests
“We could do that trick we did a few weeks ago with the brick, you remember?”
Dave gives it thought -
“I s-suppose I could try it...”

Jim takes Dave to the top floor of the site and reminds Dave of what he needs to do

“All you have to do is drop the brick above him, and then immediately shout down telling him to move, got it?”

“Y-yeah I understand” 
Dave replies nervously. 

Dave stepped to the edge and picked up the brick, then after a moment, he drops it. He then begun to shout

She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’




So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.




‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.




Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.




‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.




She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.




I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

They come across a well in the middle of a field. They look over the side but can’t see the bottom of this well. 

“Let’s throw something down there to see how deep it is” one guy says. So they find a small rock and toss it in. They wait and listen but they never hear a splash. 

“We have to throw something bigger in to make a bigger splash” they say. They find a bigger rock and toss it into the well. Still they don’t hear a splash. 

They decide to continue looking for help. They walk down the road for a short distance when they find a car transmission just sitting in the field. They can’t resist. They grab the transmission and carry it to the well. They toss it in and listen carefully. Finally they hear a faint splash. 

“That is a deep well” they both say as they turn to walk again. All of a sudden a goat comes running towards them. They jump out of the way and watch as the goat leaps straight into the well. 

They look at each other and back at the well. Confused. They turn back to start walking again when a farmer runs up to them. 

“Have you seen my goat?” the farmer asks. 

“We hate to tell you this but your goat jumped in that well over there” they respond. 

The farmer looks at the guys and says “That goat couldn’t have jumped in that well. I had him tied to a transmission”",That’s a deep well,66

Images of priests in strange clothing conducting some bizarre ritual had been carved into the surface as well.



Not knowing whether his find was worth a fortune (and curious to know what was said on the tablet), the farmer drove the rock to the nearby university and spoke with a doctoral student in Archaeology.



""Hmm… hmm… how utterly fascinating!"" the scholar mused.  ""This writing bears absolutely no relationship to any of the historical alphabets that I know of from our area.  I have never seen anything even remotely like this before.  Let me ask one of the Assistant Professors, who is a specialist in alphabets, what she thinks about this and if she might be able to identify the origin.""



The Assistant Professor entered, and she was just as flummoxed.  ""I… I couldn't even begin to tell you the region of the world that this came from!  So completely unique!  Let me bring in the Emeritus Professor of Archaeology, whose life work has been spent decoding lost languages.""



The Emeritus Professor arrived and stroked his beard, with a look of utter perplexity on his face.  He then took out his phone, snapped a photo of the rock, and uploaded it to r/jokes.



He then smirked.  ""Ah, yes.  I've seen this a million times…""","One day, a farmer found a strange, ancient-looking stone in his field.",22

Frank says “Hey, you know what? I was having the same problem a few months ago and I went to this Doctor. He is amazing. All I did was tell him my situation and he suggested that I go out and buy a box of donuts and a bag of cherries. He then said that my wife and I should get naked and sit across the room from each other. Then she tries to toss the donuts to land on my hard-on while I toss cherries to try to get into her pussy, and if you ‘score a goal’ you have to eat it off of your partner. And Joe, it was amazing, it worked! It saved my marriage. Here is is number you should go, what have you got to lose? Here’s his number.”

Joe takes the number and decides to go see the Dr. He explains the problems he is having at home. After a few minutes of reviewing his notes the Dr looks up and says, “Well, looking at the information you gave me...my suggestion is to go out and buy a box of donuts and a bag of cherries. Sit naked across the room from your partner and toss them at each other. She will try to get the donuts on your manhood while you try to get it in her crotch.If you or your wife get a goal, you must eat it off your partner”

“Great to hear it!” Says Frank. Then from across the room another guy comes up “Hey...can I get that number too? I’m having some problems at home..” So Frank gives him the number and the guy goes to the Doctor and explains his problems that he’s having in the bedroom.

Sure enough, everything flows like clockwork. The diner is seated shortly after arriving, and a waiter arrives quickly to take his order.

While he's waiting for food, the man kids around the restaurant. The service seems excellent, and the staff move almost like dancers between the tables. He does notice one oddity, as all the servers have a spoon in their shirt pocket, and a string hanging from their trousers.

The man's meal arrives in short order, and he quickly forgets about strings and spoons while dining on a perfectly cooked steak and potatoes.

After finishing up, the waiter promptly arrives with the bill. The man compliments him on the food and service, and then once again notices the string and spoon.

""My good fellow"", he says, ""I'm very pleased with the meal and service, but I must admit to being curious. What is the purpose of the string and spoon?""

The waiter pulls the spoon from his pocket and replies, ""well you see sir, the service and quality of this restaurant used to be quite poor, so the owner hired an expert to identity how we could improve. Among other things, it was found that the spoon was one of the most commonly dropped utensils, so to save time all servers carry one in their pocket to save a trip back to the kitchen""

""Ah,"" said the man, ""I see. And what about the string?""

The waiter leans forward and answers, ""well another inefficiency was the time it takes for bathroom breaks. The string is attached to the *ahem* genitals of the servers, allowing us to withdraw them at the urinals without touching. This in turn saves the need for long hand wash and improves efficiency""

The critic thinks for a moment, and while ur seems an odd thing he can't deny that it would save on efficiency. He's just about to settle the bill when he has another thought.

""Good sir, I understand that the string helps you withdraw, but how do you, er,  put things back in their place?""

After a couple of months, the loneliness and sexual frustration starts reeeeeeally getting to him. He even tries subtly beating off in his bunk while the rest of the room's asleep, but gets sharply hissed at from the guy next to him. Bob internally curses that of course he got stuck next to the light sleeper.
After a bit of hushed scolding, the other guy softens up a bit. ""I understand Bob, I really do. We all got urges, just don't wank around the rest of us dude. It's not right.""
""Well what DO I do then?"" Asks Bob frustratedly, ""How do you survive without beating off this long? There aren't even any brothels nearby to pay for a bit of relief!""
The guy looks carefully at Bob and after a moment goes, ""You know, you seem on the level. And more importantly, I don't want you wanking in here. There's a tree out about half a mile south of here. It's half hollow, but if you slide your dick in the small hole on the south side of it, you'll swear you were fucking the tightest pussy on earth.""
Bob thinks this sounds absolutely ridiculous, but he's desperate. Of course he goes to check it out the very next night. Lo and behold, there's the tree, and yes, he can see a small hole perfectly shaped to slide a dick into. Shrugging his shoulders, he goes ahead - and the other guy was right! Tight as fuck, warm and soft, Bob half wonders if this is a magic tree.
Only takes a few seconds for him to bust a nut, he's so pent up.

He returns again a few days later and this time it’s even better than the last. However after finishing he hears a noise from the other side of the tree. He sees a man bent over inside the hollowed out tree and asks “Who are you?”

My S/O and I had planned to go to the horse races one day just for fun and to check it out. 


The day came and I woke up right at 7:00 am, didn't set an alarm but wasn't to weird because I wake up around that time most days. 


The weird part was that in my dreams that night 7's had appeared everywhere. On signs and billboards. Was just unusual. 


We get up and get ready. 


Call a cab to come pick us up. 


Strangely the fare to get to the track was $7.77. 


Now I have noticed this pattern and decide to play my chances. Maybe today was the day set for me to be lucky and this was some higher-power's way of letting me know. This is superstition, but luck falls into that same category right?


We move up to the ticket gates, purposely pick gate 7. 


Get inside and I head straight for the betting counters and stand in line. I counted over from the left to the seventh one, just to stay aligned. 


Looking up at the race boards and to my astonishment there is a horse named ""Lucky Number Seven"" competing in the seventh race. 


Now at this point I've realized I'm going down a rabbit hole that may just be a huge coincidence, but I've come this far. Something or someone is trying to tell me something. 


My turn to talk with the clerk. I put most of my money on Lucky Number Seven in the 7th race. I put $700 down. This wasn't all my money but I needed a 7 in there to keep the magic going. 


We sit and wait with anticipation. 


First race goes by. 


Now the second. 


A few more and we reach the divine race. The prophesy has led me to this moment. 


The gun fires starting the 7th race. 


Lucky number 7 running with the pack of competitors. My anxiety has hit a high point with all of my money riding on one horse chosen by a gamble of faith. 


The race comes to a close finish and you are not going to believe what happened. 


The horse came in 7th.

They agreed that if anyone shot a deer, he would shoot three times in the air so the others could come help with the carcass.

Some time passed, and one of the hunters finally got a kill. He shot three times in the air, and after a few minutes the second hunter arrived on the scene. They waited a bit, but since the third friend wasn’t showing up, they went on with the work of cleaning and skinning.

Finally, the two started to get worried, since they had finished the cleaning but their friend still hadn’t appeared. So they went looking. They eventually found him, pants around his ankles, seated over a log, and fast asleep. “Wait, I have an idea,” whispered one. Not able to pass up this golden opportunity for a prank, they hurried back to the deer carcass and gathered up the intestines and other innards. Quietly, they deposited the deer guts directly underneath their sleeping friend, then headed back to the truck to wait.

Sure enough, after another 20 minutes or so, their friend appeared, pale and wide eyed, looking like he had seen a ghost. “Guys, guys! You’ll never believe what happened!”

“What, tell us!”

“Well, nature called, so I sat on a log and started taking a dump. I guess I was a bit constipated, had a hard time squeezing it out, and I must have blacked out with the effort. But when I woke up… I had shit my guts out!”

“Dude, that’s awful! What’d you do?”

“Well, with the grace of God and the help of a curved stick, I got it all back in again!”

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires.

The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. 

The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. 

The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a rope tied into a noose, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. It just goes to prove that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",The Legend of the Three Kingdoms on the Lake,641
