He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,46

""My darling! Thank you so much!"" Adam exclaimed. 

""Okay Adam, here you go."" says God.

Adam of course runs over and tries it out right away. While using it, he looks over his right should with a heart warming smile for his darling wife and says, ""Thank you amazing wife of mine.""

""You are most welcome my loving husband."" Eve answers.

God smiles at their interaction, and then looks at Eve and says, ""I guess that means my last gift is for you. Multiple orgasms.""

On their wedding night, the young bride approached her new husband and asked for $20.00 for her virginity. In his highly aroused state, Her husband readily agreed.This scenario was repeated each time they made love, for more than 40 years, with him thinking that it was aCute way for her to afford new clothes and other incidentals that she needed.Arriving home around noon one day, she was surprised to find her husband in a very drunken state.During the next few minutes, he explained that His employer was going through a process of corporate downsizing, and he had been let go. 

It was unlikely that, at the age of 59, he'd be able to find
Another position that paid anywhere near what
He'd been earning, and therefore, they were financially ruined.


Calmly, his wife handed him a bank book which
Showed more than forty years of steady deposits and interest totaling 
Nearly $1 million. Then she showed him certificates of depositsissued
By the bank which were worth over $2 million,
And informed him that they
Were one of the largest depositors in the bank.


She explained that for more than
Three decades she had 'charged' him for sex, 
These holdings had multiplied and these were the 
Results of her savings and investments. 

Faced with evidence of cash and investments
Worth over $3 million, her husband was so astounded he could
Barely speak, but finally he found his voice and blurted out,
'If I'd had any idea what you were doing,
I would have given you all my business!'

That's when she shot him.

Therefore, a review of the literature suggests a minimum of one person is required for lightbulb replacement. Research by authors Smith et. al. have found maximum effectiveness can be achieved when two people replace a bulb, however this effectiveness is further maximized when the same two people have changed a bulb together more than three to five times. Finally, effectiveness is significantly reduced when three or more individuals attempt to change a lightbulb at once.",How many quantitative psychologists does it take to change a lightbulb?,21

The bar tender is curious why all three of them are so sad. So he says ""the drinks are on the house tonight if you tell me what happened."" 

The OBGYN doctor who is still wearing her blood-stained srcubs says, ""Okay fine, I'll go first.""

She proceeds to say how one of her patients was pregnant with twins and it was an incredibly difficult pregnancy, the mom was in labor for over 19 hours. She ended up bleeding to death in the middle of labor because the sutures they use to stop the bleeding were expired. Then we ran out of our usual gloves, so I was using some cheap rubber gloves the first twin slipped out of my hands onto the floor, and ended up with permanent brain damage. Almost on the verge of tears, she says that the other twin became septic from an expired IV and died. 

Mortified, the bar tender says ""I am so sorry"" as he pours her another drink. 

Thinking the stories can't get much worse, he looks at the Pizza Hut driver and asks ""what happened with you?""

Still showing multiple burn marks on his Pizza Hut uniform, he begins to tell the story of how he got a call for an order of 12 large pepperoni pizzas. 

""Right when I drove by the house, I saw it was for a birthday party, with lots of kids in the back yard. Since all the parking spots were filled with all the cars of the parents, I had to park up the street on a hill. The issue was my emergency parking break, it had been broken for a few days and I planned on getting it fixed. But I was in such a hurry I thought I could just park on the hill next to the house at an angle, so my car wouldn't roll off. I thought wrong, as soon as I rang the doorbell, the car slipped out of gear and rolled down the hill. It collided with the propane tank in the back yard, igniting it, causing a massive explosion that killed 6 kids at the birthday party and left the rest hospitalized."" 

Visibly sweating, the bar tender says ""Jesus Christ, I can't imagine how you feel right now, I am so sorry. Here have another drink."" 

His voice now trembling, the bartender looks at the postal worker, and asks ""your story can't possibly top these two."" 

Letting out a deep sigh, the postal worker says ""I was driving my usual route, and I had to drop off two packages.""

""I was feeling tired, and even though I was running late, I figured I could just stop by Starbucks and get some coffee to help me wake up. Anyway, I spilled the coffee on myself and had to go home to change clothes, so I never had enough time to drop off those two packages.""

""What were the packages?"" asked the bartender. 

Looking at the OBGYN doctor, he says ""I was supposed to drop off the first package off at your hospital, it was for the OBGYN department and the package was marked as **medical supplies: sutures, gloves, and IVs**."" 

The doctor's jaw dropped. 

""The second package was from Autozone and was marked **emergency hand brake replacement**"" and it was addressed to a Pizza Hut down the street. 

The Pizza Hut driver is turning red with rage. 

Realizing that the postal worker's laziness is responsible for the deaths of several women and children. He jumps over the bar in a rage. The OBGYN doctor, the Pizza Hut driver, and the bartender all surround the postal worker and tie him to a wooden post in the bar. They proceed to form a single-file line and, one-by-one, take turns just beating the shit out of the postal worker with their fists.

Although the OBGYN doctor, the Pizza Hut driver, and postal worker allowed the end of this this joke to have a punchline, they messed up the delivery.","An OBGYN doctor, a Pizza Hut driver, and a postal worker walk into a bar.",1

No one moved. The preacher continued, ""Do you have the nerve to face me and admit this is a falsehood? Remember, you will be forgiven and in your heart you will feel glory. Now stand and confess your transgression."" Again, all was quiet.

The man brings out the hen from the back room. The innkeep explains that she only speaks Spanish, but he will translate. The man also speaks Spanish so they decide to have the contest in Spanish.

They begin the trivia battle and the chicken wins decisively. The hen speaks perfectly Spanish and answers every question accurately. The man is blown away, a little disappointed not to get his wish but deciding that the novelty of a genius talking chicken was worth the time anyway. He tells in the innkeep about how he didn’t anticipate having such an interesting evening. 

The innkeeper laughs and says 

“No one expects the Spanish Inn quiz wish hen.”",A man is staying at an old fashioned pub/inn,981

A couple has a dog that snores. Annoyed because she can't sleep, the wife
goes to the vet to see if he can help.

The vet tells the woman to tie a ribbon around the dog's testicles, and he
will stop snoring.

'Yeah right!' she says.

A few minutes after going to bed, the dog begins snoring, as usual. The wife
tosses and turns, unable to sleep. Muttering to herself, she goes to the
closet and grabs a piece of red ribbon and ties it carefully around the
dog's testicles..

Sure enough, the dog stops snoring. The woman is amazed...

Later that night, her husband returns home drunk from being out drinking
with his buddies. He climbs into bed, falls asleep and immediately begins
snoring loudly.


The woman decides maybe the ribbon might work on him. So, she goes to the
closet again, grabs a piece of blue ribbon and ties it around her husband's
testicles.
Amazingly, it also works on him!

The woman sleeps soundly. The husband wakes from his drunken stupor and
stumbles into the bathroom. As he stands in front of the toilet, he glances
in the mirror and sees a blue ribbon attached to his privates.

He is very confused, and as he walks back into the bedroom, he sees the red
ribbon attached to his dog's testicles. He shakes his head and looks at the
dog and whispers,

As the couple takes in the latest episode of their favorite program, the man loses concentration for a split second and a peanut goes into his ear.

After a few hours of fruitless rooting, the couple decides to go to the hospital, but on their way out of the front door, they meet their daughter coming in with her boyfriend.

He then sticks two fingers up the man's nose and asks him to blow...... lo &amp; behold, the nut shoots from the ear and out across the room.

As the daughter and her boyfriend go through to the kitchen to get drinks, the man and his wife sit down to discuss their luck.

He's about to lay it up on the fairway when his wife, seeing what he's about to do, calls him a chicken-shit. He explains that the space between the trees is too narrow, and that he's about to make the safe play. She hears none of it, and doubles down.

So the man decides to go for it. He lines up the shot, swings the club, and drills one of the trees. The ball ricochets back and strikes the wife in the head. She is rushed to the hospital, but passes away from her injuries. 

Many years later the man returns to the course. At this point he has remarried. At the hole where his wife died years prior, he hits the same shot and lies behind the trees. The man knows what his move is. Incredibly, his new wife tries to goad him into trying for the green between the trees. With a stunned look in his face he asks her ""Do you know what happened the last time I tried that shot???""

""No, what?""

I had read about the colorful jungle birds, and heard that some, like the parrot, could talk!  After reading so much about birds, I could only imagine what this would sound like in person. The first bird we saw was a toucan.  It was just kind of chirping, not really what I had expected to hear.

There once was a young couple who lived in a town filled with crime. After three neighbors' houses had been robbed, the couple decided to get a guard dog. 
So one day the wife went to the pet store and said, “I need a good guard dog.” 

And the clerk replied, “Sorry, we're all sold out. All we have left is this little Scottie dog. But he knows karate.” 

The wife didn't believe him so he said to the dog, ""Karate that chair.” 

The dog went up to the chair and broke it into pieces, then he said to the dog, “Karate that table.” The dog went up to the table and broke it in half. 

So the wife bought the dog and took it home to her husband who was expecting a big guard dog. But then she told her husband that it knew karate, and he said “Karate my azz",Karate Dog,17

The businessman looks over and says:


“More rice.”


The waiter obliged and returned to the kitchen, bringing back with him a nice cup of rice. The water then asked:


“Is there anything else?”


The businessman - looking surprised, said:


“More rice.”


The waiter waiter said, ‘alright’ and then went back into the kitchen and returned with a large bowl of rice.


“Anything else sir?” The waiter insisted.


The businessman, looking a little irate, said:


“Please, more rice!”


The waiter says ‘ok’ and turned back to the kitchen and returned with a huge bucket of rice and set it next to the business man.

“Here you go!”, stated the waiter with pride.


At this point, the businessman is tired. He grabs his cup and lifts up to the waiter and said:


“Sir, please.. More rice..”


The waiter, stuck in thought for a moment, comes back and said:


“Ohhh! I’m sorry, you wanted more ICE!”",A businessman goes out on lunch,1

People often ask for a simple explanation of ""Marketing.""  Well, OK, here it is:

  * You're a woman and you see a handsome guy at a party. You go up to him and say, ""I'm fantastic in bed."" That's Direct Marketing.

  * You're at a party with a bunch of friends and see a handsome guy.  One of your friends goes up to him and, pointing at you, says, ""She's fantastic in bed."" That's Advertising.

  * You see a handsome guy at a party. You go up to him and get his 
telephone number. The next day you call and say, ""Hi, I'm fantastic in bed."" That's Telemarketing.

  * You see a guy at a party; you straighten your dress. You walk up to him and pour him a drink. You say, ""May I?"" and reach up to straighten his tie, brushing your breast lightly against his arm, and then say, ""By the way, I'm fantastic in bed."" That's Public Relations.

  * You're at a party and see a handsome guy. He walks up to you and says, ""I hear you're fantastic in bed."" That's Brand Recognition.

  * You're at a party and see a handsome guy. He fancies you, but you talk him into going home with your friend. That's a Sales Rep.

  * Your friend can't satisfy him so he calls you. That's Tech Support.

  * You're on your way to a party when you realize that there could be 
handsome men in all these houses you're passing, so you climb onto the roof of one situated towards the center and shout at the top of your lungs, ""I'm fantastic in bed!"" That's Facebook.

Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.  When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.""  He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""

A priest, a minister, and a rabbi want to see who’s best at his job. So they each go into the woods, find a bear, and attempt to convert it. Later they get together. The priest begins: “When I found the bear, I read to him from the Catechism and sprinkled him with holy water. Next week is his First Communion.”

“I found a bear by the stream,” says the minister, “and preached God’s holy word. The bear was so mesmerized that he let me baptize him.”

They both look down at the rabbi, who is lying on a gurney in a body cast. “Looking back,” he says, “maybe I shouldn’t have started with the circumcision.”",Bear's Religion.,20

Well the woman ended up getting 2 daughters and a son. 

When the kids were 5 one of the daughters ran out of the bathroom with a bullet in her hands. and she yelled: ""Mommy! Mommy! I was peeing and this just dropped out.""  
The mom, recalling the incident decided to tell the daughter what had happened who just stood there and nodded.

5 years passed and the second daughter came back with a bullet in her hands with a worried look yelling the same ""Mom! Mom! I was peeing and this just dropped out.""  
The mom told the daughter the same story who just nodded and ran away feeling relieved because she understood what had happened.

One day while they were walking past the hospital swimming pool, Jim suddenly jumped into the deep end. He sank to the bottom of the pool and stayed there. Edna promptly jumped in to save him. She swam to the bottom and pulled Jim out. When the Director of Nursing became aware of Edna's heroic act, she immediately ordered her to be discharged from the hospital, as she now considered her to be mentally stable. When she went to tell Edna the news she said, ""Edna, I have good news and bad news. The good news is you're being discharged; since you were able to rationally respond to a crisis by jumping in and saving the life of another patient, I have concluded that your act displays sound mindedness. The bad news is that Jim, the patient you saved, hung himself in his bathroom with the belt of his robe right after you saved him. I am so sorry, but he's dead.""

So, the man holds out his hand and opens his palm, saying, “These are the keys to my car, which is sitting out front.”

“Here are the documents, as well,” he says as he hands over a tiny stack of papers.

The loan officer peeks out the window and sees a brand new Ferrari parallel parked directly in front of the bank.

“One moment, please.”

The loan officer walks into a back office to consult with the president of the bank. Everything checks out.

So, after sharing a laugh with the president at this man leaving a $750,000 car as security for a $5,000 loan, the loan officer returns and tells the man that they will happily accept the Ferrari.

An employee of the bank then drives the car into the bank’s underground garage and parks it.

Two weeks later, the man returns and pays the $5,000 plus interest, which comes to $15.41.

The loan officer smiles and says, “Sir, we are very happy to have your business. This transaction has worked out very nicely.”

The only thing that was missing was a good quarterback. He had scouted all the colleges and even the Canadian and European Leagues, but he couldn't find a ringer who could ensure a Super Bowl win.

Then one night while watching CNN he saw a war-zone scene in Afghanistan . In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Afghan Muslim soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand-grenade straight into a 15th story window 100 yards away.

KABOOM!

He threw another hand-grenade 75 yards away, right into a chimney.

KA-BLOOEY!

Then he threw another at a passing car going 90 mph.

BULLS-EYE!

""I've got to get this guy!"" Coach said to himself. ""He has the perfect arm!""

So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football. And the Bears go on to win the Super Bowl.

The young Afghan is hailed as the great hero of football, and when the coach asks him what he wants, all the young man wants is to call his mother.

""Mom,"" he says into the phone, ""I just won the Super Bowl!""

""I don't want to talk to you"", the old Muslim woman says.""You are not my son!""

""I don't think you understand, Mother,"" the young man pleads. ""I've won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans.""

""No! Let me tell you!"" his mother retorts. ""At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and I have to keep your sister in the house so she doesn't get raped!""

He tells the homeless guy to play these lovely songs in his restaurant as his customers eat and he gets 50 dollars a night. The only condition is he is not to tell people the names of the songs as they are too rude.

Tedd later looks in the mirror and sees that he looks leaner and more athletic and his face and body look less puffy and more aesthetic.

He squints suspiciously.

He then starts telling his co-workers what's happened. They then start drinking less water and start exercising a little more. Word gets around and the co-workers tell their families and friends. News crosses 7 States and millions start drinking less water. Faces and bodies look less puffy and swelled up and people start to look leaner and better.

Then someone dies. Dehydration, the coroner concludes. Everybody panics.

Tedd starts drinking more water again. So do his friends; so do his co-workers. Faces start to get puffy again; bodies start to bloat and swell; unattractiveness skyrockets.

Suddenly one of Tedd's co-workers collapses. Everybody in the office looks down at his bloated face and body. Too much water, the coroner later concludes.

Tedd sighs. His friends sigh. His co-workers sigh. The entire country sighs.

Tedd sees one of his friends, a sweaty panicking wreck and walks over to him.

""You okay?"" Tedd asks.

""No! If we don't drink enough, we'll be tired and probably die. And if we drink too much, we'll be tired and probably die!"" His friend replies.

Each Friday night after work, he would fire up his outdoor grill and cook a venison steak.

Now, as a point of interest, all of Boudreaux's neighbors were Catholic and as such were forbidden to eat meat on Fridays.

The delicious aroma from the grilled venison steaks was causing such a problem for the Catholic faithful that they finally talked to their priest. The priest came to visit Boudreaux and suggested that Boudreaux convert to Catholicism. Boudreaux agreed. After several classes and much study, Boudreaux attended Mass to be confirmed. As the priest sprinkled holy water over Boudreaux he said, ""You were born a Baptist and raised a Baptist, but now you are a Catholic.""

Boudreaux's neighbors were greatly relieved until the next Friday night arrived and the wonderful aroma of grilled venison again filled the air. The priest was called by some of his angry parishioners and told of Boudreaux'’s actions . The priest assured the callers that he would be there immediately. When he got there he rushed into Boudreaux's yard clutching a rosary. He was prepared to scold Boudreaux for what he was doing but what he saw and heard made him stop in amazement. There at the grill stood Boudreaux. He was clutching a small bottle of water, which he carefully sprinkled over the sizzling meat as he chanted: ""You wuz born a deer, and you wuz raised a deer, but now you are a catfish.""",Boudreaux the Baptist,44

When he gets there, the devil comes over to welcome him. The devil then says, “Sometimes it gets pretty uncomfortable down here.”

The man says, “No problem. I’m from Toronto.”

So the devil goes over to the thermostat, turns the temperature up to 100, and the humidity up to 80. He then goes back to the Toronto man to see how he’s doing. To the devil’s surprise, the man is doing just fine.

“No problem…just like Toronto in June,” the man says.

So the devil goes back over to the thermostat, and turns the temperature up to 150, and the humidity up to 90. He then goes back over to see how the Toronto man is doing. The man is sweating a little, but overall looks comfortable.

“No problem. Just like Toronto in July,” the man says.

So now the devil goes over to the thermostat, turns the temperature up to 200, and the humidity up to 100. When he goes back to see how the man is doing, the man is sweating profusely, and has taken his shirt off. Otherwise, he seems OK.

He says, “No problem. Just like Toronto in August.”

Now the devil is really perplexed. So he goes back to the thermostat, and turns the temperature down to MINUS 150 DEGREES. Immediately, all the humidity in the air freezes up, and the whole place (meaning Hell) becomes a frigid, barren, frozen, deathly cold wasteland.

When he goes back now to see how the Toronto man is doing, he is shocked to discover the man is jumping up and down, and cheering in obvious delight. The devil immediately asks the man what’s going on. To which the Toronto man replies…..

“THE LEAFS WON THE STANLEY CUP!!!”
