Armageddon arrives and the battle begins.  Jesus and Satan are both tasked with the most complicated programming task ever given.  This is the type of task even Linus Torvalds would declare impossible.  Jesus and Satan are put in a room with two computers, the doors are locked, and they are given 8 hours.

The hours go by and Jesus and Satan are both programming at a pace never witnessed in human history.  Satan is typing so fast the computer isn't keeping up and Jesus has already created two new programming languages complete with documentation just to make the rest of the task easier.  After 7 hours go by, there's a loud POP and the power goes.  The room goes completely dark and both computers go to black.

Satan is fuming, breathing fire, doing all sorts of angry devil-like stuff.  He's curing and screaming ""I've lost all my work!  This is terrible!  Neither of us can possibly win now.""  Then he looks over at Jesus and he's just sitting calmly in his chair, reclining a little bit, and has his eyes closed catching a rest.  Satan can't stand it, ""What are you doing over there?  How can't this upset you!""  Just then the power comes back on, Jesus types for a few more seconds, submits his code, looks at Satan and says ""It's over, I've won.""

Now Satan is really furious ""How is that possible! How can you have re-written everything that took even you hours to complete in a few seconds""

Jesus shakes his head, looks at Satan, and says, ""Haven't you heard?  Jesus Saves!""",The Final Battle of Jesus and Satan,101

The first one, his mouth covered in blood, answers: 'You see that house over there? I drank the blood of all of the people that were inside.'

As he was in the middle of the mountains, the man found himself stranded. He began walking down the road and to his surprise, just around the bend, was a monastery in the distance. The man approached the monastery and knocked on the front door. A monk answered the door and said ""Hello traveler, what brings you to our monastery?"". 
""Hello sir"", said the man, ""I have crashed my car just down the road and it has a flat tire. I was hoping you might have the supplies I need to fix it and be on my way"". 
""Of course."" replied the monk, ""But I must insist that you stay for a hot meal and rest in our monastery for the night."" 
""Oh no I can't. I don't want to intrude."" said the man.
""Please."" says the monk, ""It's customary for our people to be kind to all travellers that come our way.""
""Fair enough"" says the man. And so he stays for a delicious meal with the monks. The monks and the man eat, drink, and have a great night together. After the meal the man is shown to his room, where he lays in the most comfortable bed he has ever laid in. He's about to go to sleep when he realizes there's a quiet ticking noise coming from the next room over. At first it doesn't bug him, but after a few hours of tossing and turning trying to get to sleep, the man becomes extremely annoyed with the ticking. The next morning the monks fix the man's car and ask him how he slept and he tells them, ""The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever laid in! But that constant ticking sound from the next room kept me up all night! What is causing that ticking?"" 
""Oh that."" the head monk says, ""Only monks can know about that. It is our biggest secret and unfortunately, an outsider cannot know."" This angers the man a little, but he doesn't say anything since the monks have been very kind to him. He thanks the monks for their hospitality and for fixing his car, and he continues on his way. Years later, the man is traveling down the very same road in the mountains and lo and behold, his car breaks down again. Remembering the monastery from before, the man makes his way to the temple and once again knocks on the door. Again the monks show him the same generous hospitality and show him to the same room he slept in before. And once again, the man cannot sleep because of the constant ticking sound from the next room over. The next morning, the man asks the head monk ""Years ago, I was here and I also heard that constant ticking noise! What is that noise?"" To which the head monk tells him, ""That ticking noise is one of our most closely guarded secrets. Only other monks can know about our secret."" The man is overcome with curiosity and demands to know what it would take for him to become a monk. 
""You must travel the world and enlighten yourself."" says the head monk. ""Once you have traveled the entire world and you can tell me the exact number of grains of sand on the planet, and the exact number of blades of grass, then you can become a monk.""
So the man sets out on his journey to become a monk. 10 years go by, and the man still has not completed his task. 20 years pass and the man still travels the globe. 30 years and there still remains sand that the man has not counted. Finally after 40 years, the man, worn and tired, returns to the monastery. He goes right up to the head monk and tells him ""There are exactly 23,432,673,390,212 grains of sand and 898,231,546,770 blades of grass on the planet.""
""You are correct. You may become a monk."" says the head monk. 
""Finally!"" exclaims the man. ""Now that I'm a monk, I want to know what is the cause of that constant ticking!"" 
""Are you sure?"" asks the head monk, ""It is a great secret kept hidden for centuries. Not everybody who becomes a monk has the strength and fortitude to know our secret.""
""Yes I'm sure!"" declares the man, ""I've traveled the globe and dedicated 40 years of my life to become a monk and now I want to learn what causes the ticking!"" So the head monk leads the man to a large locked door. He takes out a key and opens the door to reveal another locked door. ""Are you certain you want to know our secret?"" asks the monk. But the man is sure. He is practically bursting with anticipation and demands to continue through the next door. The monk takes out another key, this one even larger than the first, and unlocks the second door. Behind the second door is a THIRD door. The monk stops and pauses and asks the man ""This is your last chance. Are you ABSOLUTELY SURE you want to know what causes the ticking? This is the last door. Behind it is the greatest secret of the monks."" At this point, the man is practically DYING to know what's behind the door making the ticking noise. He insists over and over again he wants to know the monk's secret. Finally the head monk takes out another key and opens the door. The door creaks open, and the man's jaw drops. It was nothing like nothing he had seen before.  
What was inside the door causing the ticking noise? I'd tell you, but I can't since you're not a monk. ",A man was traveling in the mountains when he crashes his car...,21

He had finally been granted R&amp;R and was on a train bound for London. The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat.

The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog. The war weary soldier asked, “Please, ma’am, may I sit in that seat?”

The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, “You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can’t you see my Little Fifi is using that seat?”

The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.

Again he asked, “Please, lady. May I sit there? I’m very tired.”

The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, “You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!”

The soldier didn’t say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.

The woman shrieked, railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, “You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road.

The shopkeeper opens the cage door, then gives the monkey some coloured pencils and a piece of paper. The monkey looks at the father, then in a flurry starts colouring the paper. After a few minutes it hands the father the piece of paper. On it is a crude but distinguishable portrait of the father.

""Remarkable!"" He stands in amazement, but as he goes to put the paper down, he notices beside it another monkey in a cage with the price tag, $20000. ""... if this one draws pictures, what does that monkey do?""

The shopkeeper opens the cage, and fetches a keyboard from out the back. The monkey then jumps up and starts playing Beethoven with perfect timing. The shopkeeper asks it to play Bach, Mozart and Chopin, and each time it does perfectly. The shopkeeper says he can play over a thousand songs from memory. The father stands in disbelief. 

But then he notices another monkey in a cage, this time the price tag is $100000.

""Whoa!! What on earth does that monkey do for a hundred grand!""

The shopkeeper pauses. Sighs, then says
""Well, sir... I've never actually seen him do anything, but he tells me he's a politician""",A man walks into a pet store,61

Please, sell me this donkey!"" The peddler replies, ""I would be happy to, but we call them asses around here, not donkeys. Additionally, this one is a little tricky. He has a habit of sitting during traveling, and will only respond if you give him a little tickle."" The man makes another mental note of the details, and continues on his way.

After another 45 minutes, the ass sits down in the middle of the road. Remembering the advice about tickling him, the man looks for a way to secure the rooster and hen while he does the job, but struggles to find a solution. He sees a young woman walking adjacent to his position, and calls to her.

The bartender pours him a glass, which the man immediately drinks, slams the empty glass on the bar and jumps out the window.

The guy witnessing the scene sits there in shock, but realizes there's not much he can do.

A few minutes later, the same man comes storming in again, walks up to the bar and yells ""WHISKY!"". Same thing happens again - the bartender pours him a glass, he drinks it and jumps out the window.

The same scene repeats itself again and again, until the man who had been sitting there the whole time can't help it anymore:

""Excuse me, I've been watching you come in here again and again, drinking whisky and jumping out the window. There's not a scratch on you, how do you do that?""

""It's easy,"" says the jumper, ""all you have to do is order a shot of whisky, throw it back real fast and jump. That way you'll land soft as a feather on the street below!""

Convinced, the man orders a whisky, drinks it up, takes a running start and jumps out the window. And falls to his death.

The bartender turns to the jumper: ""You can be a real asshole when you're drunk, Superman!""",The jumper,0

Through great difficulty and exhaustion, they make their way to a nearby island and end up falling asleep upon the shore.

 

They awake to a group of men from an aboriginal tribe staring at them, decorated in jewelry made of the bones. The men take James, Jacob, and Peter deeper into the island jungle and tie them up in their village.

 

After some time, the leader of the tribe approaches them and says, ""We are cannibals and we plan on eating you, but, because you are from a foreign land, we have a special ritual which will determine your fate. You must go search the jungle for fruit, and if you are able to bring 10 pieces of one kind of fruit back to us, then we will set you free.""

 

So, the three friends go their separate ways to search for fruit. After some time, James returns to the tribe with 10 tangerines in the basket that they lent to him.

 

The leader approaches him and says, ""Before we set you free, you must pass a second test. If you are able to stick all 10 of your fruit through your anus *without* laughing or screaming, you will be set free.""

 

So, James fearfully begins his task. One... two... three up... on the fourth tangerine, he yells aloud and they kill him and eat him.

 

Later, Jacob returns with 10 blueberries in his basket. They explain to him his task and he begins, one by one, to stick the blueberries up his butt. On the eighth blueberry, he breaks into laughter, so they kill him and eat him.

 

In the heaven, James and Jacob are talking with each other about their final days on earth:

 

James: ""What a terrible way to die, huh? I had tangerines and it was way too difficult. By the way what fruit did you find?""

 

Jacob: ""Blueberries. Ten blueberries.""

 

James: ""What!? Ten blueberries, how did you even fail that...?""

 

Jacob: ""Well I was sticking them up my butt, one by one, and it tickled a little bit, but it wasn't so hard. At the eighth one, I was pretty confident that I'd finish well and be free. But, I looked up for a moment and saw Peter running to the village, carrying in his basket 10 pineapples!""",The Uncomfortable Last Days of Three Friends,19

I bought it and put it on the back bumper of my car and I'm really glad I did. What an uplifting experience followed. 

I was stopped at the light of a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord, and didn't notice the light had changed. That bumper sticker really worked. I found lots of people who love Jesus.

Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must really love the Lord, because pretty soon he leaned out the window and yelled, ""Jesus Christ!"" as loud as he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, ""Go, Jesus Christ, Go!!"". Everyone else started honking too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all those loving people. There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach, and I saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I had recently asked my two kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed, looked at each other, giggled and told me that was the Hawaiian Good Luck sign. So I leaned out the window and gave the good luck sign back.

A couple of people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking toward me. I bet they wanted to pray, but then I noticed that the light had changed, and I stepped on the gas. It's a good thing I did, because I was the only car to get across the intersection. I looked back at them standing there. I leaned out the window, gave them a big smile, and held up the Hawaiian Good Luck sign as I drove away.

Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks!!",The other day I went to a religious book store...,17

This is in the 90s where MTV actually had music on it. Anyway, the horse sees a segment on Jimi Hendrix, and decides there and then he wants to become an internationally-acclaimed guitar player (because, as we all know, all horses are left-handed).

So this horse works at this shitty job for a couple of months, earning enough money to buy himself a low-end Strat. He starts playing Hendrix songs in his spare time, trying to recreate the sound he fell in love with. Eventually, he records a few covers and gets on YouTube with them.

Now, this horse thinks he's doing pretty well, and decides to start a band with the other guys from the nearby farm. So he goes up to his friend, that just happens to be a chicken, and tries to get him to be the bass player, as the chicken was a sweet-ass bass player in college. Chicken agrees and decides to bust out his old bass from the attic; they learn the rest of Hendrix's first album.

Now the horse and chicken think they can go pretty far, and decide to ask their friend, that happens to be a cow, if she can play the drums for the band. She agrees, and they all decide to pool their money together to get this awesome fucking set of drums for Cow. So Cow learns the drum parts for all the Hendrix songs, and they reckon they can go really fucking far with this.

But guess the fuck what? They need a fucking singer to complete the set. So Cow goes up to her friend, who knows can sing like a fucking legend, and asks him to join the band. For the purposes of the joke, the singer is a pig. So Pig learns all the parts for Hendrix's first album and they eventually decide to branch off and make a load of different songs.

This horse, as the band frontman, gets the band to go global - they start performing at gigs across Europe, Asia and the Americas, with the help of the farmer himself (who was slightly bemused at his animals talking, let alone being a fucking band), and eventually get noticed by none other than Jay Leno himself. Leno invites them to California to perform at his show, which coincided with the kick-off for their cross-US tour.

So the horse, as the frontman, flies over to California first to set up and make sure the gig runs smoothly. Everything's good, and the rest of the band, a week later, board a plane to California as well.

However, the plane ditches into the ocean, sadly killing all the passengers, including the band and the farmer as manager. A couple of days later, Horse hears about this and becomes distraught at the deaths he basically caused.

Horse hits a full-on depression, and decides to kill himself so as to be reunited with his friends. He roams the seedy back-alleys of California, trying to find the shittiest club so as to drown his troubles away. Eventually, he finds one, takes 15 Ketamine pills and walks in. He orders the most alcoholic thing the club can offer, and sits in a corner of the bar, waiting for Death.

The owner of the club sees this obviously distraught horse, and walks over to him to try and help.

""Hey,"" he says, ""why the long face?""",So a horse is watching MTV...,11

The husband comes home one day and finds his mother-in-law in the living room with a couple of suitcases. It becomes immediately clear that she has come to stay for a while. After awkward pleasantries he finds his wife in the bedroom and asks what's going on. 

""Oh my mom will be staying with us for a few weeks"". 

When asked where, he is informed that the sofa-bed in his game room has been set up for that very purpose. He tries to protest, but his wife responds ""Honey, its only for a few weeks and besides you're not using it at the moment"". Defeated, he endures the next couple of weeks and is glad afterwards once its over.

A few more weeks go by and the husband comes home one day to find his brother-in-law in the living room with a couple of suitcases. ""What's up bro?"" the brother-in-law asks and after another awkward encounter the husband goes upstairs asks his wife what's going on. ""He only needs a place to sleep for a couple of days"", his wife responds. The husband tries to protest but his wife says. ""Come on, he's family and besides, you're not using the sofa-bed in your game room"". Defeated again, he endures the next couple of days in silence.

Determined to stop this from happening again and to teach his wife a lesson, the husband invites his good friend Ricky to stay for a few days without consulting his wife. She comes home to find Ricky and her husband in the living room drinking beers and watching football. With a grin, he informs her that Ricky will be staying for a few days and that was that. He watches with satisfaction as she helplessly agrees and goes upstairs. Couple of days later, while Ricky is still staying over, the husband makes a quick run to the grocery store to pick up some eggs and a loaf of bread. He returns home and there's no one downstairs. He looks for his wife upstairs and she's not there either. He goes down into the basement to his game room and finds Ricky on top of his wife, pants down and pumping hard. Shocked and astonished, he shouts ""what the hell is going on?!"" 

His wife turns and calmly says ""Oh hey honey. Don't worry, its not what it looks like. We're not having sex. It's only Anal. And besides, you weren't using it!""","[Long] ""But you're not using it!""",0

A few minutes later, a drunkard on his way from a bar, passed near the cemetery gate &amp; heard a voice saying: ""One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you.""

He immediately sobered up &amp; ran as fast as he could to a church nearby, for the priest.

""Father, please come with me . Come &amp; witness God &amp; Satan sharing corpses at the cemetery""

They both ran back to the cemetery gate &amp; the voice continued: ""One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you.""

The man then reaches into a third pocket and pulls out a squirrel. 
The frog continues to play the piano and the squirrel starts singing. Again, the other bloke is impressed.

""Wow! How much for the singing squirrel, my friend?""

""I'll give him to you for $200.""

""That's a deal!""

The bloke pays the man his $200, takes the squirrel and leaves the bar.

So I met a hooker on craigslist who happens to have a fetish for oysters like I do. We had been meeting up several times a week and would do things with the oysters, things I dare say are hard to describe. She would put them in her vagina before I would come over and I would eat them out of her. This had been going on for about two weeks when I started getting ill quite a bit. Was not anything new, as oysters tended to do that when your eating massive amounts of them. She called me and asked if we could schedule an appointment for tomorrow.

Me: No I am sorry hooker, been feeling under the weather lately. I would love to eat some more oysters but i think the amount of mercury in my system is taking its toll.

Hooker: But my oysters are getting real bad. Your the only guy I know that has a fetish for chlamydia oysters and I cant afford to go to the doctor!

The first hobo knocks on the door, which is soon answered by an ugly old woman. “Ma’am, I spotted those pies on the window sill and was wondering if I could get one of them from you? I’ll work for it, if need be.” The old woman responded with “Follow me into the kitchen.”

Once they were both in the kitchen, the old woman said “I haven’t had a man in many years, since my husband passed away. I’ll give you both of those pies if you’ll have sex with me right here, right now.” The hobo thought about it while looking around. He spotted some ears of corn on the counter near the window and had an idea.

“Well, if you’ll just turn around and bend over across the kitchen table, I’ll take care of you,” said the hobo. The old woman, excited as she was, complied instantly by pulling off her clothes and doing exactly as the hobo said.

The hobo reached behind his back, grabbed an ear of corn, shoved it in and serviced the old woman with it for at least 5 minutes. When he saw that the kernels were all soft and wet, he tossed it out the window. The old woman screamed “More, more!”

The hobo grabbed another ear and another for the next 30 minutes. When the old woman indicated she was satisfied, she turned around and said “Okay, I promised the pies to you. Go ahead and take them. Thank you for the pleasure of your company.”

The hobo grabbed the pies and headed out the door and found his friend near the window sill. “Hey,” he said, “here are the pies. Let’s go eat.” The other hobo looked at him and said

So the butcher goes into the cooler and comes out w/ a duck, he plops it on the scale and the lady says ""Let me see that duck""

So the butcher hands it to her over the counter.

The lady takes her index and middle fingers and sticks them up the duck's butt, then pulls her fingers out, puts her fingers to her nose and smells them. She gets a look of disgust on her face, looks at the butcher and says ""This is a Boston Teal. I want a Long Island Duck. Take this back and get me a Long Island Duck.""

So the butcher returns the duck to the cooler and comes back w/ another duck. The butcher puts it on the scale, then the lady says ""Let me see that duck"".

The lady once again sticks her fingers up the duck's butt and then smells her fingers. 

""This is a Canadian Mallard. Take it back. What's wrong with you, I said I want a Long Island Duck... go get me a Long Island Duck before I call the manager"".

So the butcher takes it back to the cooler and comes out with another. This time he hands the duck to the lady instead of putting it on the scale.

Again the lady sticks her fingers up the duck's butt and then smells her fingers. ""Ahhh, now this is a Long Island Duck"".

Then the lady looks at the butcher and says ""You must be new here.""

The butcher says ""Yes ma'am, I started Tuesday. ""

The lady asks the butcher ""Well, where are you from?""

The butcher turns around, drops his pants, bends over, looks at the lady and says ""Why don't you tell me lady! """,A Long Island duck,11

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.

It's crowded &amp; dirty and full of Italians. You're crazy to go to Rome. 
So, how are you getting there?"" 

""We're taking Delta,"" was the reply. ""We got a great rate!""
""Delta?"" exclaimed the barber. ""That's a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late. So, where are you staying in Rome?""

""We'll be at the downtown International Marriott."" 
""That dump! That's the worst hotel in the city. The rooms are small, the service is surly and they're overpriced. So, whatcha doing when you get there?"" 

""We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope."" 
""That's rich,"" laughed the barber. ""You and a million other people trying to see him. He'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it."" 

A month later, the man again came in for his regular haircut. The barber asked him about his trip to Rome. ""It was wonderful,"" explained the man, 
""not only were we on time in one of TWA's brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. 
The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful 28-year-old stewardess who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel-it was great! They'd just finished a $25 million remodeling job and now it's the finest hotel in the city. 
They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge!"" 

""Well,"" muttered the barber, ""I know you didn't get to see the pope."" 
""Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait the pope would personally greet me. 
Sure enough, five minutes later the pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down as he spoke a few words to me.""

He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",A man wakes up in a dingy slum,560

Mr. Patel pressed his nose against the glass and let his eyes widen as the golden stuff fell off in jagged shards and a pair of wrinkled, ancient hands appeared.

""Get...the hell... out!""

Mr. Patel smiled at the voice of his father. The bastard really was too ornery to die.

""Can't a man take a nap without some kind of interruption!"" The hands grabbed the sides of the thing and a torso soon appeared, ""I told Raj that I was NOT to be disturbed by... oh damnl! There's a lot of you bastards. Get the hell out! Shoo!""

""Mr. Patel,"" Dr. Arelkas approached the chrysalis and dodged a half-hearted blow from the old man, ""You've been in that thing for forty-eight days now.""

""Woulda been ninety if I'd been left in peace!"" The old man kicked his legs free of the shell, sending shards flying into the nearby scientists, ""Outa my way! I need to piss!""

""Sir, you're exhibiting behavior unheard of-""

""I'm pretty sure I've had to piss before. Now scoot!"" Patel swung his legs out of the chrysalis and hopped down onto the floor.

Suddenly, there was a lot of space around him. He frowned, glared, and smacked a smaller doctor with one of his newly-formed wings.

""If'n you're not gonna move, I'll piss on this guy here."" Patel shook a finger at the doctor he'd knocked over, ""Now git!""

""But sir!"" Came at him in a couple variation, ""You have wings!""

""Why do you think I have to piss so bad?"" The old man grumbled and shoved the two nearest people out of his way, ""Goddamn Redbull.""

The telephone repairman proceeded to the scene, curious to see this psychic dog or senile lady.

He climbed a telephone pole, hooked in his test set, and dialed the subscriber's house. The phone didn't ring right away, but then the dog moaned and the telephone began to ring.

Climbing down from the pole, the telephone repairman found:

The dog was tied to the telephone system's ground wire with a steel chain and collar.
The wire connection to the ground rod was loose.
The dog was receiving 90 volts of signaling current when the number was called.
After a couple of jolts, the dog would start moaning and then urinate.
The wet ground would complete the circuit, thus causing the phone to ring.

The funeral was to be held at a new cemetery way back in the country, and this man would be the first to be laid to rest there.

As I was not familiar with the backwoods area, I became lost; and being a typical man, I did not stop for directions. I finally arrived an hour late. I saw the crew, eating lunch, but the hearse was nowhere in sight. I apologized to the workers for my tardiness, and stepped to the side of the open grave, where I saw the vault lid already in place. I assured the workers I would not hold them long, but this was the proper thing to do.

The workers gathered around, still eating their lunch. I poured out my heart and soul. As I preached, the workers began to say ""Amen,"" ""Praise the Lord,"" and ""Glory."" I preached and I preached, like I'd never preached before: from Genesis all the way to Revelations.

I closed the lengthy service with a prayer and walked to my car. I felt I had done my duty for the homeless man and that the crew would leave with a renewed sense of purpose and dedication, in spite of my tardiness.

""Whew!"" he sighed.

He ordered the tallest vanilla ice cream he could hold between his vestigial wings... those miserable fins could barely manage the scoops upon scoops of creamy goodness. The cone was so tall that more of it ended up on the penguin than in him!

""Yummy! That was very very good!"" the penguin said, smacking his lips.

He waddled back to the mechanic who was ready to give the little fellow an update. The mechanic looked at the penguin sternly. The gaskets and seals on the engine were severely damaged after years of driving without a routine check, and it was certainly going to be expensive.
