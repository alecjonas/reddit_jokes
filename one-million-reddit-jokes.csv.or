Gasping for air as the tides pushed them onto the sand, they all helped each other find their bearings and ventured inland. Days went by without an ounce of sustenance, moisture dripping from the leaves was their only source of water. There were no clouds in sight for as far as the eye could see, more days had passed. On their last legs, and seven days on the island with no food and barely any water the three men stumbled across a little hut hidden behind some trees and bushes.

They knocked on the door and the most disgusting, bloated, wart infested, scabby looking, stinky, slimy and just outright vile woman answered the door. One of the three men fainted straight away just from the smell of her, waking up a moment later. She opened the door wide, revealing an entire table covered in every food imaginable and it was all fresh. ""I'll let you have any and all the food you want, but you need to have sex with me, and get me to climax"", she said. The first man who fainted earlier, fainted again. The second man said he'd rather starve, and gnaw at his own wrist. The third man stepped up and said, ""All right, I'll do it so we can survive"".

The man who volunteered and the horribly vile woman walked inside, closing the door behind them. With what little energy he had left he tried with all his heart to 'get up in there' and get her to climax. He realized though that the inside of this woman was covered in gigantic scabs that kept her dry, so he tore them from out of her and threw them out the window. Finally she was able to get wet, and he made her climax. Half dead from the experience, he went to the door and exclaimed: ""You guys can come in, the deed is done!"". To which the other 2 replied ""What? It's all good man, we ate the pizzas you threw out the window"".","[NSFW][NSFL] Three men survive a plane crash and drift ashore a small, remote island",0

She gave him a blank, confused stare and he immediately thought to himself, ""Nope, not Delta.""

A moment later, another slogan popped into his head. He leaned towards her again, ""Something special in the air?"" She gave him the same confused look.

He mentally kicked himself, and scratched American Airlines off the list. Next he tried the Southwest slogan, ""Low fares, nothing to hide?""

Tonight, I thought my husband was acting weird. We had made plans to meet at a nice restaurant for dinner. I was shopping with my friends all day long, so I thought he was upset at the fact that I was a bit late, but he made no comment on it. Conversation wasn't flowing, so I suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we could talk. He agreed, but he didn't say much. I asked him what was wrong; He said, 'Nothing.' I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. He said he wasn't upset, that it had nothing to do with me, and not to worry about it. On the way home, I told him that I loved him. He smiled slightly, and kept driving. I can't explain his behavior I don't know why he didn't say, 'I love you, too.' When we got home, I felt as if I had lost him completely, as if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore. He just sat there quietly, and watched TV. He continued to seem distant and absent. Finally, with silence all around us, I decided to go to bed. About 15 minutes later, he came to bed. But I still felt that he was distracted, and his thoughts were somewhere else. He fell asleep - I cried. I don't know what to do. I'm almost sure that his thoughts are with someone else. My life is a disaster.

A man walks into his neighborhood bar and sits down. The bartender comes over and says, “John, what happened to you? You have a black eye!”

John replied, “It was the craziest thing. I was in church yesterday, and the priest asks us all to stand. When we do, I notice that the woman in the pew in front of me is wearing a sundress, and she has a pretty bad wedgie. I thought, that can’t be comfortable, so I reached down and pulled it out for her, and she turned around and hit me! Can you believe that?” The bartender just shakes his head and walks away.

The following Monday, John comes back into the bar. The bartender exclaims, “John, what happened now? Your other eye is black!”

John shakes his head… “I’ll never understand women. I’m back in church yesterday, and the priest asks us all to stand. When I stand up, the same woman is in the pew in front of me, again wearing a sundress. I looked down, and this time, she doesn’t have a wedgie… but I know she doesn’t like it that way, so I pushed it back in there!""

A man walks into a drug store with his 8-year old son. They happen to walk by the condom display, and the boy asks, “What are these, Dad?”

“Oh, I see,” replied the boy pensively. “I’ve heard of that in health class at school.” He looks over the display and picks up a package of 3 and asks, “Why are there 3 in this package?”

The dad replies, “Those are for high school boys, one for Friday, one for Saturday, and one for Sunday.”

“Cool” says the boy. He notices a 6 pack and asks, “Then, who are these for?”

“Those are for college men,” the dad answers. “TWO for Friday, TWO for Saturday, and TWO for Sunday.”

“WOW!” exclaimed the boy, “Then, who uses THESE?” he asks, picking up a 12-pack.

With a sigh and a tear in his eye, the dad replied, “Those are for married men. One for January, one for February, one for March……. ”","Why Condoms comes in 3,6 and 12 Pack?",3126

An newly annointed angel, filling in for St. Peter, checked his dossier and grimly said, ""Ah, you're an engineer; you're in the wrong place.""

 So the engineer was cast down to the gates of hell and was let in. Pretty soon, the engineer became gravely dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and began designing and building improvements.
After a while, the underworld had air conditioning, flush toilets, and escalators, and the engineer was becoming a pretty popular guy among the demons.

 One day, God called Satan up on the telephone and asked with a sneer, ""So, how's it going down there in hell?"" Satan laughed and replied, ""Hey, things are going great. We've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next."" God's face clouded over and he exploded, ""What? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake; he should never have gotten down there; send him up here."" Satan shook his head, ""No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and I'm keeping him."" 

God was as mad as he had ever been, ""This is not the way things are supposed to work and you know it. Send him back up here or I'll sue."" Satan laughed uproariously, ""Yeah, right. And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?""

""Hello there. You know, we see you come out here every day to visit your wife's grave and we just think that so sweet. We were all wondering if the dog is something that was special to your wife since you always bring it out here with you.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Dave was bragging to his boss one day.,95

The boy, distraught, yet hopeful went outside and asked the janitor about the pacific ocean. The janitor replied, ""Damned if I know. Best ask the people at the bus stand."" 

The boy collected all his pocket money and went to the bus stand. He asked the bus conductor if he could take him to the pacific ocean. The conductor said ""Look son, I'm not aware of it's location. I can point you to the bus to the airport. The people there might be aware of it.""

The boy reached the airport and asked for a ticket to the pacific ocean. The air hostess playfully told him, ""You won't be able to afford it. Come back when you have money and you've grown up.""

The boy worked hard for 9 years, saving up money so he could travel to the pacific ocean. When he had collected all the money, he brought a ticket to Hawaii and went with a friend. He politely asked the air hostess to let him know when the pacific ocean was there. As the plane flew over the pacific ocean, the air hostess told him to look out the window and look at the pacific ocean. The boy looking at his childhood dream couldn't believe his eyes.

When they landed in Hawaii, his friend asked him about his fascination with the pacific ocean. As they were going towards the taxi stand, the young boy, now an adult told hi friend, ""Well 9 years ago, when The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plumm..."" and the boy was run over by a car and he died.

We went on hiking again, but the little donkey had a bad day. After some time, it stumbled again and the bottles of water fell off its back, down the mountain. My wife said: 'two', being more tensioned than previously. I told her that we would find a river where we could drink water and wash ourselves, if needed.


We continued our journey... but of course, the donkey  stumbled again and the tent fell off its back. The only thing that we still had was the gun. My wife said: 'three', took the gun and killed the donkey. I told her we would find shelter in a cave. But I was taken aback by her killing the donkey: 'Poor animal! Why did you do that?'

You also might be right to suspect something with light speed, but that’s Star Wars, and you need to add “warp speed” to your lexicon, you pleb. But it’s not warp speed anyway. You ever try to engage warp speed? If you’re just trying to get from Earth to Mars, you risk smashing into the red planet before you even achieve warp speed, let alone come out of it. How you tryna cross the street with all that power?   
  
Oh, a transporter, you say? Uh,huh. Flynt, MI can’t get clean drinking water and somehow our broke-ass municipalities are going to give us a device that would completely take the danger out of crossing the street? No, that extra money is currently supporting an army of former city workers who have retired careers longer than their actual work careers were.  
  
So now here come the “I’m giving it all she’s got” comments. Nice try, but just no. That’s already a punchline in itself. And don’t go into some bullshit about how he was stuck to a bumper and had to “klingon” to something. Just nope.  
  
A cloaking device? Seriously, what in the fucking-fuckity-fuck-fuckverse are you thinking? He/she might be invisible, but our star trek fan (don’t make me say “trekker,” because I don’t DGAF) would be smashed to bits whilst crossing the road by the string of UPS trucks, Chevy Suburbans and pot-bellied men in too-tight biking shorts on bikes so skinny they could slip up their hairy asses.  
  
So now comes the tractor beam explanation.  Maybe in Russia, where tractor beam gets caught in you, but not here, you truly amateur-hour ass-wipe. I don’t even know how a tractor beam would work across a road. I can’t even get past level 2 in crossy road, and somehow this tractor beam is supposed to be able to beam across the street and pull some random across it.  
  
Hello, did you not read in the riddle that he’s a fucking kleptomaniac? That’s important. Why, because across the street, there was a house with a kooky middle aged lady that likes to collect silly home depot grade front yard decorations. So on her lawn, she’s got a few pink flamingos, fucking gnomes and even a frog and a turtle. And because in 1982, she went to the movies to see Wrath of Khan with some guy named Jimmy Casillas, with whom she made out with in the mall parking lot, all the while  laughing and yelling “Khan!” while she put her tongue in his ear... yes they lost their virginity together that night, right after Wrath of Khan. And it means something special to them.  And they would later marry. And she’s somehow managed to find some ceramic Khan figure and it’s on her lawn too, right between a flamingo and gnome. It makes her feel special. After all, Khan was the catalyst to her suburban story: Jimmy, their three kids, the house, the dream.    
  
And now here comes this klepto-trekker strolling along the street and he’s crossing it now and you know exactly how this ends: A feeling of indignation, a stolen ceramic stature and the beginning of the end for someone’s suburban dream.  
  
TL;DR: he was in it for the lawn Khan",Why did the kleptomaniac Star Trek fan cross the road? (nsfw),0

An American, an Italian, and a German have made it to the final round of interviews. 

The three are sitting together in a barren room, when an agent walks in.

""Congratulation, each of you have made it to the final round of interviews. To your right there are three rooms. In each room, there is a woman, blindfolded. There is also a loaded revolver. You must kill her. The woman is your mother.""

The American stands up, and with great disgust simply walks out of the room. 

The Italian stands up, with conviction, and heads to his door and walks in. In a matter of seconds, he could be heard sobbing. He opens the doors, tears running down his face, and walks out.

The German, looking a bit perplexed, gets up and walks through the door, shutting it behind him. Almost as soon as the door shuts... ""Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!""

Then silence...

After a moment, some commotion can be heard, and the sound of wood breaking, followed by... ""Slam! Slam! Slam!""

The German walks out of the room, a bit sweaty, but collected. He takes his seat and calmly explains, ""The gun was loaded with blanks... so I used the chair. It is done.""

""Excuse me sir, would you happen to have the time?""

The Egyptian looked at him, reached up, and took the camel by the balls and moved them slightly to the left.

""Its ten after two."" he pronounced.

The American was amazed, he couldn't believe what he had just seen and he ran off to find his friends and tell them about the man who could tell time from a camel's balls.

After a short time he found them and of course they didn't believe him so he insisted that they go back and he'd prove it, so they agreed and returned.

The American once again asked. ""Excuse sir, I'm sorry to bother you again, but would you have the time?""

The Egyptian looked at him and once again reached out and grabbed the camels balls and once again slightly moved them to the left and said. ""It's twenty after two.""

The group was amazed and they left to go about their business, but the original discoverer of the miracle time teller remained behind.

""Listen my friend, I would love to know how you do that. If I give you one hundred American dollars would you show me how you do it?""

The Egyptian thought for a moment and nodded ok and pocketed the hundred dollars and then motioned to the American to kneel where he was.

The American knelt and then the Egyptian said. ""All right grab the camels balls and gently pick them up and slightly move them to the left.""

The American followed the Egyptian's orders to the tee and then asked. ""Now what?""
The Egyptian said. ""OK crouch down a little more, now do you see that clock on the wall over there?""",American tourists,3

This took a lot of time, so he bought some tiny bells and attached them to his roosters. Each bell had a different tone, so he could tell from a distance, which rooster was performing. Now, he could sit on the porch, and fill out an efficiency report by just listening to the bells.

John's favorite rooster, old Butch, was a very fine specimen, but this morning he noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all!

When he went to investigate, he saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing, but the pullets, hearing the roosters coming, could run for cover.

To John's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring. He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job and walk on to the next one.

John was so proud of old Butch, he entered him in the county fair, and he became an overnight sensation among the judges.
The result was the judges not only awarded old Butch the No Bell Piece Prize but they also awarded him the Pullet Surprise as well.",John was in the fertilized egg business.,29

The husband urged Charlie to stay over. There was no spare bed in the house; there wasn't even a sofa. 
So Charlie would have to sleep with the husband and wife. 
No sooner had the husband fallen asleep when the wife taped Charlie on the shoulder and motioned for him to come over to her. 
""I couldn't do that,"" he whispered. 
""Your husband is my best friend!"" 
""Listen, sugar,"" she whispered back, ""there ain't nothing in the whole wide world could wake hime up now."" 
""I can't believe that,"" 
Charlie said. 
""Certainly if I get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up won't he? 
""Sugar, he certainly won't. If you don't believe me, 
pluck a hair out of his asshole and see if that wakes him."" 
Charlie did just that. 
He was amazed when the husband remained asleep. 
So he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her.
When he finished, he climbed back to his own side. 
It wasn't long before she tapped him on the shoulder and beckoned him over again. 
Again he pulled a hair to determine if his old friend was asleep. 
This went on eight times during the night. Each time Charlie screwed the woman, he first pulled out one of the husband's asshole hairs.
The ninth time he pulled a hair, the husband awoke 
and muttered:
