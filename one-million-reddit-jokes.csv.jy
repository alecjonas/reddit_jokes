About an hour later, the man let out a louder sneeze. Once again, he took a napkin from his pocket and maneuvered it into his pants. The woman, now feeling uncomfortable, began squirming in her seat.


About halfway through their journey, the man let out the most powerful sneeze of the trip.  This time, he stood up out of his seat and removed several napkins to clean himself up.


At this point the woman decided enough was enough and exclaimed, ""Sir, what is the matter with you?!  Whatever is going on below your waist, it's making me uncomfortable seeing you openly touch yourself down there.""


The man responded, ""I'm so sorry.  I have a rare condition that causes me to orgasm every time I sneeze.  I try as hard as I can to be discreet in public but the stronger the sneeze, the more of an effect it has on me.""

As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.

 Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. 

Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! 

So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. 

With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.

About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. 

Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, ""How dare you touch my body!! I don't even know who you are!""

At this, the Texan drawled, ""Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.""","In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus.

""Well, you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, then you get all of that money.""

""What are the three tests?"" asks the man

""You've got to pay first.""

Some chuckles from the regulars are heard around the bar.

So the guy gives the bartender a $10 bill, and the bartender adds it to the jar.

""Okay, here's what you have to do: first, you have to drink a whole bottle of vodka. You get five minutes tops to down the whole thing. Second, there's a mean bulldog chained up out back with a sore tooth. You have to remove the tooth with your bare hands. Third, there is a 90-year-old woman upstairs who's never had an orgasm in her life. You've got to show her the night of her life.""

""Well, I've paid my $10 bucks,"" says the man, ""but I'm not an idiot. No wonder you've collected so much money; that's impossible!""

The guy goes back to sipping his beer. He can't stop thinking about the jar full of cash. An hour (and a few beers) later, he gets up his nerve.

""ALRIGHT. I'LL DO IT.""

The bartender smirks, twists the cap off of the bottle and plonks it down in front of him. The guy downs the whole thing in four minutes, lets out a big belch, and winces. He gets up and staggers out the back door. Everyone in the bar hears a huge scuffle outside: barking, yelping and growling, for a good twenty minutes, then silence.

Just when they think the man must be dead, he stumbles back into the bar with his shirt ripped and bloodied, gashes all over.

In walks a duck, wearing a hi-vis vest, a hard hat and a scowl that says he's having a bad day. 

Before the barman can say a word, the duck exclaims, ""WANKERS!!!! CUNTS!!!! FUCKING BULLYING ARSEHOLES!!!!!""

He arrives at the bar and asks the barman for a pint, a bag of crisps, a cigar, and a pen for the crossword.

As the barman pulls his pint, he enquires about the bad day that the duck is apparently having. The duck explains that he has started work on the building site across the road that morning, and some of the labourers have christened him 'Bill'. 

The duck then sits and drinks his pint, finishes the crossword, thanks the landlord, lights up his cigar and head back to work. 

The next day at 12 o'clock, the front door nearly gets kicked off it's hinges.

In walks the duck. ""WANKERS!!!! CUNTS!!!! FUCKING ARSEHOLES!!!!!""

He arrives at the bar and asks the barman for a pint, a bag of crisps, a cigar, and a pen for the crossword. The barman obliges him, the duck drinks his pint and visibly calms down. He thanks the landlord and leaves. 

That afternoon an eccentric looking gentleman comes into the pub and asks whether he can display a poster in the window of the establishment advertising his circus. 

Sensing an opportunity, the landlord offers the circus-master a pint.

The landlord opens, ""how about if I was the agent of a walking, talking, pint drinking, front-kicking, smoking, crossword-capable duck? Would you be interested in having something like that in your circus?"" 

""Fuck me,"" said the circus master. ""If this duck can do half of what you claim, I'll give you 15% of everything. This sounds to me like a show I can take on the road...Asia, America, Europe....a lot of people will pay good money for this....as his agent, I can guarantee you'll be a millionaire within 3 years, if you make the introduction.""

They shake hands, and the circus master leaves. Both men spend the rest of the day dreaming of potential riches to come. 

Next day, 12 o'clock on the dot, the front door nearly gets kicked off it's hinges.

In walks the duck. Before the barman can say a word, the duck exclaims, ""WANKERS!!!! Ive had enough of this. I'm moving on. Fucking 'Bill'. Dickheads!""

He arrives at the bar and asks the barman for a pint, a bag of crisps, a cigar, and a pen for the crossword.

The barman points out that the duck has stolen two pens already that week, but still obliges him his request. 

As the ducks pint settles, the landlord drops that he might have a business opportunity for the duck, and as the duck was so unhappy in his current job, it could work out well....

The duck is a little apprehensive, but presses the barman. 

""Where's the job boss? Is it local?"" asks the duck. 

""Have you seen the circus in town?"" asks the landlord, ""the circus master has got some work to put your way. Could be lucrative.""

""Yeah I've seen the circus. It's just a big tent - big top - whatever you call it. I don't understand?"" says the duck.

""He's got some work for you,"" said the landlord. ""Multi-million pound contract, you need to go and see him. No shit!""

The husband cringed, 'I warned you to be careful! Now we'll have to go up there, find the owner, apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us.'

So the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. A warm voice said, 'Come on in.'

When they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the pieces of window glass.

A man reclining on the couch asked, 'Are you the people that broke my window?'

'Uh...yeah! , sir. We're sure sorry about that,' the husband replied.

'Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you.. You see, I'm a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for my self.'

Wow, that's great!' the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, 'I'd like a million dollars a year for the rest of my life.'

'No problem,' said the genie 'You've got it, it's the least I can do.. And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!'

'And now you, young lady, what do you want?' the genie asked.

'I'd like to own a gorgeous home in every country in the world complete with servants,' she said.

'Consider it done,' the genie said. 'And your homes will always be safe from fire, burglary and natural disasters!'

'And now,' the couple asked in unison, 'what's your wish, genie?'

'Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle, and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have sex with your wife.'

The husband looked at his wife and said, 'Gee, honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?'

She mulled it over for a few moments and said, 'You know, you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?'

You know I love you sweetheart,' said the husband. I'd do the same for you!'

So the genie and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying each other.

The genie was insatiable. After about three hours of non-stop sex, the genie rolled over and looked directly into her eyes and asked, How old are you and your husband?'

'Why, we're both 35,' she responded breathlessly.

'No Kidding,' he said.

He was, however, very sensitive about his appearance. One day the General was interviewing three servicemen who were candidates for his headquarters staff.

The first was a Squadron Leader pilot from Air Force , and it was a great interview. At the end of the interview the General asked him, 'Do you notice anything different about me?' The young officer answered, 'Why, yes, Sir, I couldn't help but notice that you have no ears.' The general was displeased with his lack of tact and threw him out.

The second interview was with a Naval Lieutenant Commander, and he was even better. The General then asked him the same question, 'Do you notice anything different about me?' He replied sheepishly, 'Well, sir, you have no ears.' The General threw him out also.

The third interview was with an Infantryman and a commando qualified Major.

The General liked this guy, and went ahead with the same question, 'Do you notice anything different about me?' To his surprise the Major said, 'Yes, sir, you wear contact lenses.'

The General was very impressed and thought, 'What an incredibly observant officer, and he didn't mention my ears.'

The Manager says, ""Do you have any sales experience?""

The kid says ""Yeah. I was a vacuum salesman back in North Dakota .""

Well, the boss was unsure, but he liked the kid and figured he'd give him a shot, so he gave him the job. ""You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did.""

His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor. ""How many customers bought something from you today?""

The kid frowns and looks at the floor and mutters, ""One"".

The boss says ""Just one?!!? Our sales people average sales to 20 to 30 customers a day. That will have to change, and soon, if you'd like to continue your employment here. We have very strict standards for our sales force here in Florida . One sale a day might have been acceptable in North Dakota , but you're not on the farm anymore, son.""

The kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing him out on his first day. He asked (semi-sarcastically), ""So, how much was your one sale for?""

The kid looks up at his boss and says ""$101,237.65"".

The boss, astonished, says $101,237.65?!? What the heck did you sell?""

The kid says, ""Well, first, I sold him some new fish hooks. Then I sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 Expedition.""

The boss said ""A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and a TRUCK!?""

The kid said ""No, the guy came in here to buy tampons for his wife, and I said, 'Dude, your weekend's shot, you should go fishing.’",A young guy from North Dakota moves to Florida,6096

That night, they went into the bedroom and started caressing each other.

""Should I moan?"" asked the wife.

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Mother Theresa!,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known her for years for years.""  Dave picks up his phone makes a call to find out where Mother Theresa is.  ""Rome?, Cool, thanks!"" says Dave as they they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. It's too crowded and I can't catch the Mother Theresa's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the her."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with Mother Theresa on the balcony.

The boss is perplexed! As he slowly shakes his head in disbelief, the guy standing next to him asks ""Who the fuck is that with Dave?""

The boss says ""I know, right?  I too am wondering how the bus driver got on the balcony with Dave!""

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :

""Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.""

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. 

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!
With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

Unfortunately for lions, however, they are rather limited in their mobility. When it comes to such places as ice, water, and air, the lion frame is generally unsuited to the catching and eating of things. And so we find the hero of our story, a majestic lion of the Serengiti, on the ground staring longingly at the skies above.

Every day, the eagles took to the winds. Twirling, spiraling, carefree as they glide above the treacherous world below. Healthy, plump, looking like a mighty fine meal to a lion, and yet so unattainable.

""I've had many things in life,"" said the lion to no one in particular. ""Gazelle, hyena, the occasional tourist. But what I wouldn't give for a taste of eagle.""

Yet as he raced towards the nests on the rocks, time and time again, the eagles took flight and the lion remained hungry.

Until this day.

Flipping through the channels on TV, as lions are known to do, he discovered a remarkable tale of a wolf which dressed as a sheep.

""Perhaps,"" he said, ""if I made myself look like an eagle, they would spot me too late and I can finally claim my prize.""

And so the lion, scavenging from some leftover ostrich, fashioned himself a suit of feathers.

He donned his suit and raced towards the nests, but the eagles took notice. ""That's a very nice feather suit,"" said the eagles from above. ""But we notice these things.""

""I'm on the right track,"" said the lion. ""Perhaps some wings?""

And so the lion, using some sticks and the skin of a gazelle, built some wings to accompany his feathers.

And once again, the eagles fled. ""Transparent,"" they said. ""An easy catch.""

Frustrated yet determined, the lion set to work on the final piece of his costume. Tearing the fenders from a broken-down truck in his mighty jaws, he gathered the materials he needed for a shining eagle beak.

As he made his final charge to the nest, the eagles spotted the ruse and took flight.

Enraged, the lion stripped away his costume and screamed to the skies.

""I have my eagle feathers. I have my eagle wings. I have my eagle beak. What's left?""


And the eagles said,


""You can't hide your lion eyes.""",The majestic lion,4
post,89vhre,2qh72,jokes,false,1522890916,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/89vhre/hp_lovecraft_walks_into_a_bar/,self.jokes,,"He looks around and spies a disheveled, haunted-looking figure, a man with hollow eyes and a long, scraggly beard. Sitting on the bar next to the man is a cadaverous cat with patchy fur and cloudy eyes, which hisses at the bartender whenever he passes by.

Lovecraft sits down next to the man. “Hello friend,” he says, “I’m a writer of horror and the uncanny, and I’m always on the lookout for inspiration. You must have a bizarre tale to tell!”

“Salutations, friend,” says the bearded man with a southern drawl, a rarity in Lovecraft’s town of Providence. “The name’s Nathaniel Peaslee. I have a bizarre tale indeed, one that so beggars belief that I’d think it a nightmare, had it not occupied the last year of my life. Or rather, had my body not been occupied for the last year by the mind of an alien, while my mind occupied his, a hundred years hence!”

“Oh, this is good,” says Lovecraft, pulling out a pencil and a notebook. “An alien from the future, you say?”

“Indeed,” says Nathaniel. “He walked around in my body to study the history of humanity, while I crawled around in his massive, tentacled, cone-shaped form, mingling with other refugees from their home planets and eras.”

“Fascinating,” says Lovecraft, scribbling away. “What did you learn of the future?” 

“I became privy to the most wondrous advanced technology,” says Nathaniel, a tremble entering his voice. “Though much of what I learned has fled my mind like a dream in the daylight, upon my return to Earth I was able to use my knowledge to construct a device that breathes life back into the dead!”

“Impossible!” says Lovecraft.

“The only rational reaction,” says Nathaniel, “but Hulu here is living proof, pardon the pun!” He gestures at the sickly feline, which coughs up a hairy blob of phlegm. “When I realized the machine only instills a foul state of un-death, I destroyed it straight away.”

“That cat does indeed look dead, but for its animation,” concedes Lovecraft. “And such a strange name!”

“I named him after another wondrous technology I learned of in my jaunt beyond the stars,” says the man. “An invention called ’streaming video,’ by which a limitless variety of films of incomparable fidelity can be viewed in one’s own home at one’s own leisure.” The man’s eyes grew wide and unfocused, as if he were once again gazing into the future. “If I could recreate this marvelous technology, it could inspire a cultural renaissance the likes of which mankind has never known!”

“The very prospect fills me with awe and wonder!” says Lovecraft, transcribing furiously.

“In the morning I shall return to my home town of Raleigh in North Carolina,” says Nathaniel, “and set to work to invent ‘streaming’ as best I can with our limited tools.” 

“You must keep me informed of your progress,” says Lovecraft. “Say, do you mind if I seek to publish a fictionalized account of your mind-boggling experience?”

Nathaniel gulps down the last of his beer, stands up, and scoops the lifeless Hulu up in one arm. “Feel free, friend,” he says, “though do it fast. If my work bears fruit, there will be no call to read a book ever again!” He walks out the door, wisps of cat fur trailing in his wake. 

Lovecraft writes up Nathaniel’s story and publishes it as a novella called “The Shadow Out of Time,” which is met with moderate acclaim. Soon after, he finds himself bereft of inspiration once again, and returns to the bar. 

“Hey Lovecraft,” says the bartender, holding up an envelope. “I’ve got a letter for you. I think it’s from that crazy southerner with the ugly cat.”

“Excellent!” says Lovecraft, snatching the envelope from his fingers and tearing it open. He pulls out the letter and finds it written in a crabbed, frantic hand, as if by someone no longer sane.

“Dear friend,” begins the letter. “I promised to report my progress to you, but I’m afraid I must report the opposite. I had indeed made progress, yes! I had constructed a form of electronic brain, that could communicate an inhuman caricature of thought with other electronic brains over a system of copper wires. I had translated a selection of films and plays into a numerical language readable by these soulless automatons. And I built a device connected to a cathode ray tube and a loudspeaker, through which these translated and transmitted films and plays could be viewed. I was ready to throw the electrical breaker that would have brought the whole apparatus to humming life, but I made the grave mistake of feeling celebratory!

“It pains me to recount it. I went to market to acquire a bottle of whiskey, so that I may toast this new era in human achievement for which I had paid such personal cost. But when I returned home, I found that Hulu, that infernal beast, had destroyed and devoured every important element of my streaming prototype! Inspired by some devilish urge, he had even consumed my written notes! And now streaming shall never be, at least not in our lifetime, for every memory I have of its workings has long since fled my ill-used consciousness.

“My utmost apology for letting you down, and all of humanity. I should have known that disinterring Hulu from his odorous grave would have dire repercussions.

“Yours, Nathaniel.”

Lovecrafts gasps “dear God,” and lets the letter fall from his nerveless grasp.

“What is it?” asks the bartender. “What did he say?”

Lovecraft answers, “In his house at Raleigh, dead cat Hulu ate streaming.”",H.P. Lovecraft walks into a bar.,4

'What time of night to be getting home is this? Where have you been? Dinner is cold and I'm not reheating it'.
And on and on and on. 
Too shattered to play his usual role in this familiar ritual, he poured himself a shot of whiskey and headed off for a long hot soak in the bathtub, pursued by the predictable sarcastic remarks as he dragged himself up the stairs. 
While he was in the bath, the phone rang.
The wife answered and was told that her husband's client, James Wright, had been granted a stay of execution after all.
Wright would not be hanged tonight. 
Finally realizing what a terrible day he must have had, she decided to go up stairs and give him the good news. 
As she opened the bathroom door, she was greeted by the sight of her husband, bent over naked, drying his legs and feet. 
'They're not hanging Wright tonight,' she said.

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly. Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant. ","In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Louisiana state university.",1

Over the past six months, your husband, Royse Samples has been causing quite a commotion in our Lawton store. We cannot tolerate this type of behavior and, as a result, will ban your entire family from shopping in any of our stores if even one more incident occurs. We have documented all incidents on our video surveillance equipment.

Three of our clerks are currently attending counseling from the trouble your husband has caused. All complaints against Mr. Samples have been compiled and are listed below.

2. November 23, 2005: Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5-minute intervals.

3. December 10, 2005: Made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the rest rooms.

9. March 26, 2006: Looked right into the security camera; used it as a mirror, and picked his nose.

""Excuse me, sir, is there anything I can help you find?"" said one of the store clerks from behind him.

""Oh, uh, yeah,"" the customer said, startled. He looked around him quickly and picked up one of the newer-looking tricks. ""What does this do?"" he asked.

The store clerk replied, ""Oh, that?"" She picked it up and spun it around her finger - or attempted to. ""It's a Fidget Spinner Joke. You can try as hard as you want, but it will never spin.""

He laughed. ""That sounds hilarious! What does this one do?""

""That's our Padlock Joke - it will never open with any key ever, even the one that's provided with it.""

""Cool! Can you tell me about these?"" And so it went on and on as he asked the poor shopkeeper about what seemed like every new item in the store, until he came back to the wall of sweets.

""What about these Chirp Chocolates?"" he asks.

""Well,"" says the worker, somehow still keeping her energy up, ""If you eat one, it'll make you chirp like a bird for a whole minute.""

""That's hilarious!"" laughs the boy. ""Do these Hoot Gummies make you hoot like an owl?"" She nodded. ""And these Squeaking Marshmallows? And- hey, what's this?"" He reached into the large container of wrapped mints and pulled out a brightly-colored fishing reel that had a very tiny handle.

Nelson is a little taken aback but calmy explains the cars cant be for him and he wont be signing. The delivery driver looks a bit unhappy but gets in his truck and drives off. 

The next day the exact same thing happens, the same Japanese guy, the same truck and the same performance.  ""Delivery for you.  You sign, you sign""  Nelson is a bit annoyed and again explains that the cars arent for him and that he wont sign.  The delivery driver once again gets in his car transporter and drives off.

post,89pe5i,2qh72,jokes,false,1522848129,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/89pe5i/im_never_going_grocery_shopping_again/,self.jokes,,"I was at the grocery store yesterday picking up some ingredients to make breakfast for the week. I already had a few essentials picked out like milk, eggs, and bacon. Yes, bacon is an essential. I moved to the cereal aisle but got stuck deciding between Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Fruity Pebbles, which has always been a tough decision for me. From the corner of my eye I see an older woman peering at me. She was probably in her 60's or 70's, wrinkles, very ... grandma-looking. 

Anyways, I didn't think much of it and grabbed the Fruity Pebbles. I started making my way to the next aisle, which required me to go past her. When I got close, she turned to me and asked me to get a box of cereal (some specialty diabetic kind) from the top shelf. I grabbed the box and handed it to her. She used that moment of kindness to start up a conversation with me. I'm all about ""respecting your elders"" but I have no idea who this woman is and I didn't really care. Still, I figured she probably doesn't have anybody to talk to and I wasn't in much of a rush so I avoided being rude.

The conversation started out pretty normal. She was talking about the weather and her daughter (maybe she was trying to set me up?) but then it got pretty personal. She started telling me about her son who died fighting in Iraq, how I look just like him, and that I remind her of him. She started telling me a story about him as a young boy and I had to feign sadness. The whole thing was a bit much for a Monday night so I figured once we get out of the aisle, I can break away. 

We finally got to the front by the registers. She got into one of the lines, I went to get some fresh ~~muffins~~ bread. When I got back to the register, the line she was in happened to be the shortest so I decided to take my chances. Wrong move. Literally the moment I got within proximity, she turned around and picked up the conversation exactly where it left off, telling me how much she misses her son. She then asked if I could do her a huge favor that would really make her holiday season. ""When I walk out, can you wave and say 'Goodbye Mom' to me?"" Apparently she never got closure and hearing those words would mean the world to her. I said sure but it's not like I jumped at the request, I was actually very sketched out by the whole thing. However, I claim to be a good person and just to be clear on the situation, Monday night grocery shopping, 70 y/o granny asks you to make her holiday season by saying 2 words. What kind of an asshole would I be to say no? 

As we got to the cash register, I had a change of heart in my cereal decision. I decided to go with the Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Retrospectively, I think my subconscious wanted to get away and was hoping she would be gone by the time I got back. The aisle was pretty close and when I got back she just got done bagging the groceries. I'm looking down, fidgeting with my wallet, hoping she forgets the whole situation and just walks out the door. Sure enough, as I look up there she is, just waving at me by the exit. Very awkwardly, I wave and shout ""Goodbye mom"". She walked out and I sighed, so happy that she was gone and that whole ordeal was over with. The cashier rings up my items and I proceeded to bag them. I take out my credit card as the cashier looks at me and says ""That'll be $124.37"". I looked at my bag that held something like six items and then back at the cashier. ""There must be some mix-up, there's no way my groceries came out to a hundred dollars"". She looked back at me puzzled ""Oh, your mom said you were paying for her"".

**THAT FCKING BTCH.** 

I normally don't curse in public but I screamed. I was BOILING with rage. I dropped my bag, ran outside, and saw this old little conniving shit scurrying to close the trunk. I bolted in her direction. She opened the front door of her car and got in, but before she could close it, I grabbed it and flung it open. I yelled ""ARE YOU FCKING KIDDING ME?"". She, probably scared for her life, started screaming and kicking me. This got me SOOO mad because to any bystander, it probably looked like I was trying to rob this poor old grandma. I tried to grab a hold of the foot she was using to kick me and finally I did. So there I was, pulling her leg, just like I'm pulling yours.",I'm never going grocery shopping again!,9

However, if he makes dinner for Jesus and his 12 disciples *AND* they happen to like it, he'll be revived back on earth. 

He enters a huge kitchen, packed with every kind of ingredient imaginable. Dave couldn't cook for shit, but he's gotta try and get back to his wife.

He spots a huge turkey, gobbling around, so he grabs it by the neck and breaks it. He plucks out the feathers, cuts it open and pulls out the giblets. He starts grabbing whatever food he can find in the kitchen, cramming it into the bird with his fist until there's no more room. He grabs a chocolate bar from his back pocket and melts it over the turkey for a glaze. Then he throws it in the oven and waits for it to cook. 

It smells like putrid crap, but he has no choice and calls the waiter to come and take it in to Jesus and his mates. 

After a few minutes he can hear them in the other room... Jesus and his disciples are chanting his name! ""^^dave... ^Dave... DAVE!!"" they must really love his food! ""DAVE... DAVE!... **DAAAVEE!!**"" 

**THWACK** He's hit by a blurry piercing light and suddenly finds himself back on his kitchen floor where he first passed out. 

""Dave... What the hell is going on?"" shouts his wife

He picks himself up off the floor and shouts, ""I'm back! I'm alive!! I've had the most incredible journey. I died and went to heaven, but I'm back!!"" 

""DAVE..."" begins his wife ... ""WHAT IN THE BLAZING FUCK HAVE YOU DONE TO THE CAT!!?""",Dave's wife is out for the night and he decides to eat some shrooms. He passes out and wakes up at the pearly gates of heaven.,2922

Finally someone calls in and says his word is, “goan, G-O-A-N.” The DJs look it up and can’t find it in the dictionary. So they ask for the word in a sentence. The caller replies back with, “goan fuck yourself!”

The DJs scramble to get the caller off the line and apologize to their listeners that sometimes those things get through. They take more calls with no winners, until someone else calls in. They say their word is “schmee, S-C-H-M-E-E, schmee.” The DJs look it up and don’t find it in the dictionary, they ask for the word in a sentence.
