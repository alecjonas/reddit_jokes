The father asked, 'Why did you say good-bye Grandpa?'

The little girl said, ""I don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do.""

The next day grandpa died. 
The father thought it was a strange coincidence.

A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this, 
""God bless Mommy, God Bless Daddy and good-bye Grandma.""

The next day the grandmother died.

""Holy crap"" thought the father, ""this kid is in contact with the other side.""

Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say, ""God bless Mommy and good-bye Daddy.""

He practically went into shock. He couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office. 

He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay. 
He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

When he got home his wife said, 
""I've never seen you work so late. What's the matter?""

He said, ""I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of my life.""

The teacher said, ""Let's begin by reviewing some American History. Who said 'Give me Liberty , or give me Death'?""

She saw a sea of blank faces, except for Chandrasekhar, who had his hand up:?'Patrick Henry, 1775'he said.

'Very good! Who said 'Government of the People, by the People, for the People, shall not perish from the Earth?''

Again, no response except from Chandrasekhar. 'Abraham Lincoln, 1863' said Chandrasekhar.

The teacher snapped at the class, 'Class, you should be ashamed. Chandrasekhar, who is new to our country, knows more about our history than you do.'

She heard a loud whisper: 'F ___ the Indians,'

'Who said that?' she demanded. Chandrasekhar put his hand up. 'General Custer, 1862.'

At that point, a student in the back said, 'I'm gonna puke.'

The teacher glares around and asks 'All right! Now, who said that?' Again, Chandrasekhar says, 'George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.'

Now furious, another student yells, 'Oh yeah? Suck this!'

Chandrasekhar jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, 'Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky,1997'

Now with almost mob hysteria someone said 'You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll kill you.' Chandrasekhar frantically yells at the top of his voice, ' Michael Jackson to the child witnesses testifying against him, 2004.'

The teacher fainted. And as the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said, 'Oh shit, we're screwed!' And Chandrasekhar said quietly, 'I think it was Lehmann Brothers, September 15th, 2008'.",Kids first day at school!,10

""Ok,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. 

Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy. 

He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" 

""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" 

In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. 

As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.""","A young man was lost wandering in a forest, when he came upon a small house.",240

post,5g1235,2qh72,jokes,false,1480649242,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5g1235/the_muff_puff/,self.jokes,,"So there was this married couple and the husband was a drunk. He would constantly drink and end up get abusive towards his wife. 

So one day the wife gets fed up and decides she is going to go to the pet store and get something that will help defend herself. When she gets to the store an employee asks her what she is looking for.

The wife says ""My husband is a drunk and every night when he comes home he is abusive toward me. I'm looking for something that can help protect me. I don't care how much it is I just need something.""

The employee takes her over to the dogs and shows her a German Shepard, a Rottweiler, and a Pitbull.

The wife says ""No I'm not looking for a dog it won't do anything, dogs are man's best friend. There has to be something else here that can defend me.""

The employee tells her ""Well I may have something in the back that can help but it is very expensive I'm not sure you can afford it.""

The wife tells him ""I already told you that I don't care how much it costs. I am sick of my husband.""

So the employee takes her into the back of the store and brings her over to a small cage in the corner. Inside the cage is a tiny pure white fluffy fur ball. The man explains that it is called a Muff Puff and that it will be more than capable of helping her with the problem she is having with her husband. 

The wife looks at him and laughs as she says ""There is no way that little thing could do anything to anyone. Prove to me it is actually going to do anything.""

The employee asks for her sweater and she gives it to him. The employee takes the sweater and makes it into a ball and places it inside the cage. 

The employee says to the Muff Puff ""Muff Puff Sweater."" All of a sudden the little fur ball goes crazy and attacks the sweater. After only a few seconds the swear is gone and all that is left is a small pile of torn up cloth. 

The employee asks if she's interested and she replies ""That proves nothing, it was just a sweater. If I'm going to buy something to protect myself it needs to do more than that."" The employee understands and agrees to give her one more example. He goes and grabs a 2x4 and places it inside the cage. 

The employee then backs away and says ""Muff Puff 2x4"" and once again the Muff Puff attacks the 2x4 and after a few seconds there is nothing left but a pile of sawdust. After seeing this the wife is impressed and agrees that she will take it.

So the wife is sitting at home reading a book later that day with her brand new pet sitting on the coffee table next to her. The husband comes home from the bar and is once again getting ready to take his built up anger out on his wife.

The husbands yells ""I have had it with your shit."" and begins to approach her. 

The wife calmly puts down the book and looks at him saying. ""I don't think so. You see I got a new pet today and he is going to protect me and I won't need to deal with you.""

The husband looks at the Muff Puff and laughs saying ""You think that little thing is gonna protect you from me? That thing is the size of a softball.""

The wife smiles and replies ""That is exactly what my Muff Puff is going to do.""

The husband laughing even harder says ""Yeah right, Muff Puff my ass."" Trust me that Muff Puff tore that ass up",The Muff Puff,7

post,5g1118,2qh72,jokes,false,1480648881,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5g1118/pink_ping_pong_balls/,self.jokes,,"A wealthy man had a little boy. For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.

So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.

A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, ""Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?""
The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.

Finally, the son said, ""Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.""

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, ""If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. ""

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls.
The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.
""Father,"" replied the son, ""I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.""

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, ""If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.""

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.
The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.
""Father,"" said the son to this, ""I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.""

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. ""A carton of pink ping pong balls?""
""A carton of pink ping pong balls,"" the boy confirmed.

""I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,"" said the father. ""But if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.""

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.
The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.

""Dear son,"" said the father, ""I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?""
The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. ""Please humor me, dear father.""
The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday.

""Dearest father,"" the son started, ""I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.""

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory.

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.

""Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.""
It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country.
The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.

""Father,"" the son said, ""You've made me very happy yet again.""
That night, the son spent on board the tanker.

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.
A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.
His father visited the young man in hospital. ""My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?""
Weakly, the son sat up in bed. ""Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.""

The father held his son's hand tightly. ""Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.""

""Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.""

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.

""Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.""

The son nodded weakly.

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.
""Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,"" the father requested.

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.

""I-"" the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.

""I- I-""

Then he died.",Pink Ping Pong Balls,16

On the 4th day, Jesus called for Judas again.


""Judas, Judas, come to me, I must tell you something."" And Judas started crawling up the stairs towards his master, but this time the guards felt sorry for the fellow trying to approach the cross, so they tossed him up there next to his master.

He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay. 
He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

When he got home his wife said, 
""I've never seen you work so late. What's the matter?""

He said, ""I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of my life.""

She said, ""You think you had a bad day, you'll never believe what happened to me. This morning my boss died in the middle of a meeting.",The daughter that sees the future!,1153

post,5g0okf,2qh72,jokes,false,1480644665,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5g0okf/the_whistler/,self.jokes,,"One day in a well known university, a senior professor started his class on a very serious topic. The moment he turned towards the blackboard, one of the students whistled. He turned, looked at the class and asked the whistler's name ............. As usual and as expected no one answered.

The professor peacefully kept the pen in his pocket and picked up his bag. Saying that, the lecture ends here and that was enough for the day, he started moving towards the gate of the class ........... Students were overjoyed to be free.

Then, he suddenly stopped and turned towards the class, kept his bag on the table and said, ""I'll tell you a story to utilise the remaining time"". Everyone became interested.

Yesterday night I tried hard to sleep, but it was miles away from my eyes, so I thought I'd better get petrol in my car, which will save my time next morning and might induce sleep. After having my tank full, I started roaming in that area, enjoying the peace of a traffic free ride.

Suddenly, on the corner I saw a girl who was as young and beautiful as the clothes she was wearing. Must have been returning from a party. Out of courtesy, I turned my car towards her and asked if I may be of any help. She asked me if I could drop her to her home, she'll be very obliged, to which I agreed. (Who would deny a beautiful young company instead of a dry non sleepy need)

She sat in the front seat with me. We started talking, and to my amazement she was very intelligent, had control on many topics which many youngsters don't.

When we reached her address, she admitted my courteous nature and behavior and accepted that she had fallen in love with me.

I also admitted her intelligence and beauty and that I've also started liking her. I told her about my job as a professor in the university.

The girl asked my number, which I gave her willingly. Then she asked me a favor, to which i couldn't have denied naturally.

She said that her brother is a student in the same university, and asked me to take care of him, since we'll be in a long relationship now.

I asked the name of the student.She said that I'll recognise him with one of his very prominent quality.

He whistles a lot.

The moment the professor said this, all eyes in the classroom turned towards the boy who had whistled.",The whistler,3

tl/dr: My uncle's cat froze to death and a local veterinarian brought him back from the fucking grave.

About six years ago I was visiting my uncle who lives up at Mt Charleston in Nevada. It was the middle of winter and was freezing out but it hadn't snowed at all so my uncle and I decided to head down to Las Vegas for the day to check out the sights (Mt Charleston is a mountain on the outskirts of Las Vegas about an hour away from the strip). We were heading out of the door when his cat bolted out the door and ran off into the woods. I was kinda worried about it but my uncle reassured me that he does that sometimes and that it would be alright.

So we head into town and had a pretty cool day in Las Vegas. We didn't get back to Mt. Charleston until about 2 in the morning and while we were gone it fucking snowed. It was a god damned blizzard. As someone who grew up in Las Vegas you have to understand that my standards of what constitutes a ""blizzard"" may be a bit overstated, but there was snow everywhere and the temperature was well below freezing.

My uncle was pretty lit from spending all day drinking and gambling in Vegas but I don't drink that often so I stayed sober and volunteered to drive us home. We got out of the car and I was following my uncle up the stairs to his front door when he stopped dead on the stairs and started cussing up a storm. While we were out, his cat came back, got its foot stuck between two of the boards on my uncle's porch, and fucking froze to fucking death.

My uncle loved that cat like a child and was completely out of it, so I got him inside and went back outside to get the cat unstuck. After much cursing and pulling and chipping away at the ice on the porch I managed to get the cat unstuck and was deciding what to do with the poor thing when headlights pull up the driveway and a guy I've never met gets out of his car. It turns out to be the local vet. A veterinarian. While I was outside, my grieving, mostly drunk uncle called the fucking veterinarian. I tried to explain the situation and tell the guy he was wasting his time, but he wouldn't listen to me so we wound up bringing the cat back inside the house.

The vet takes the cat from me and brings it over to the coffee table in the middle of the room. This is when things got weird. The vet told my uncle to go out to his shed and grab a can of gasoline. Now I'm no vet or doctor of any type but the fucking cat is frozen stiff as a board. I'm thinking there's no way this is going to end with a live cat walking around, gasoline or no gasoline. Joke's on me because I was about to be proven wrong.

My uncle stumbled back inside with a can of gas and handed it over to the vet who promptly pried open the cat's mouth and starts pouring fucking gasoline down the cat's throat. Then he stood back and we all just stared at the cat. I wanted to say something, ask the vet how in the fuck gasoline was supposed to do *anything*, and I was just opening my mouth to end this fucking idiocy when I saw the damned cat fucking move.

It started slowly at first, twitching, shivering, and becoming more pronounced by the second. Within ten seconds the cat was shaking like a leaf in a hurricane, and without any warning whatso-fucking-ever the cat got to it's feet and shot off across the room. Over the couch, under the dining room table, and halfway up the fucking wall on the far side off the room where it suddenly stopped. I just stood there staring for a few moments, waiting for the cat to keep moving, before turning to the vet and asking, ""Why'd he stop? Is he dead?"" Cool as a fucking cucumber, the vet turned to me and said, ""He's fine. He just ran out of gas.""",My uncle's cat froze to death.,3

The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the bird’s mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity.

John tried and tried to change the bird’s attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to ‘clean up’ the bird’s vocabulary. Finally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even more rude. John, in desperation, threw up his hand, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer.

For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute. Fearing that he’d hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John’s outstretched arms and said “I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I’m sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior.”

John was stunned at the change in the bird’s attitude. As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird spoke-up, very softly, “May I ask what the turkey did?”

The Manager says, ""Do you have any sales experience?""

The kid says ""Yeah. I was a vacuum salesman back in Texas .""

Well, the boss was unsure, but he liked the kid and figured he'd give him a shot, so he gave him the job. ""You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did.""

His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor. ""How many customers bought something from you today?""

The kid frowns and looks at the floor and mutters, ""One"".

The boss says ""Just one?!!? Our sales people average sales to 20 to 30 customers a day. That will have to change, and soon, if you'd like to continue your employment here. We have very strict standards for our sales force here in Florida . One sale a day might have been acceptable in Texas , but you're not on the farm anymore, son.""

The kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing him out on his first day. He asked (semi-sarcastically), ""So, how much was your one sale for?""

The kid looks up at his boss and says ""$101,237.65"".

The boss, astonished, says $101,237.65?!? What the heck did you sell?""

The kid says, ""Well, first, I sold him some new fish hooks. Then I sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 Expedition.""

The boss said ""A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and a TRUCK!?""

The kid said ""No, the guy came in here to buy tampons for his wife, and I said, 'Dude, your weekend's shot, you should go fishing.’","A young guy from Texas moves to Florida and goes to a big ""everything under one roof"" department store looking for a job.",186

""Hello there, Mr. Farmer, I was just passing by and I was wondering if I might speak to your dog."" The farmer replied, ""Well, you know, dogs don't talk."" The ventriloquist said, ""You'd be surprised what a dog might tell you. Can I speak with him?"" 

dogThe farmer, eyeing the ventriloquist suspiciously, called his dog. ""Hi there, Mr. dog,"" said the ventriloquist. ""How does the farmer treat you?"" To which the dog replied, ""Oh, he's great! He throws a stick for me, scratches my belly, and I just love him!!"" Needless to say, the farmer was dumbfounded. 
 
Wanting to see if he could fool the farmer again, the ventriloquist asked if he could
speak with the farmer's horse. ""Well, you know, horses don't talk."" Again the ventriloquist said, ""You'd be surprised what a horse might tell you."" 


So the farmer brought out his horse. ""Say, Mr. Horse, how does the farmer treat you?"" asked the ventriloquist.
 
The horse then replied, ""Oh, I think he's great. He feeds me oats, he puts a blanket over me at night, and I just love him!"" Again the farmer was amazed. 

 
Wanting to try his luck a third time, the ventriloquist said, ""Mr. Farmer, would you like to hear what the sheep has to say about you?

Joe laughed, ""That's right, how did you know?"" ""I've been doing this all my life!"" the tailor said. Joe tried on the suit. It fit perfectly.

He sees a couple in a car, with the interior light brightly glowing.

 The cop carefully approaches the car to get a closer look.

 Then he sees a young man behind the wheel, reading a computer magazine. He immediately notices a buxom young woman in the rear seat, knitting. 

Puzzled by this surprising situation, the cop walks to the car and gently raps on the driver’s window.
The young man lowers his window “Uh, yes, officer?”
“What are you doing?”
“Well, isn’t it obvious? I’m reading a magazine, sir “

Pointing towards the young woman in the back seat the cop says: “And her, what is she doing?”
The young man shrugs: “Sir, I believe she’s knitting a pullover sweater.”

Now, the cop is totally confused. A young couple. Alone, in a car, at night in a lovers’ lane. And nothing obscene is happening! “What’s your age, young man?”

“I’m 25, sir.”

“And her ... what’s her age?”

""Oh yeah?"", the guy asks, ""Then answer this -- how do you hang onto your perch without any feet?""

""Actually, I speak both Spanish and English and I can converse with reasonable competence on almost any topic: politics, religion, sports, physics, philosophy. I'm especially good at ornithology. You really ought to buy me. I'd be a great companion.""

I see your face when I am dreaming.      
That’s why I always wake up screaming

My love, you take my breath away.     
What have you stepped in to smell this way

Since a wife is entitled to sweet karma, they decide to consult a professional reposter. 

The professional reposter listens to their story, strokes his keyboard, and makes the following suggestion: Steal the same fucking jokes you see on the sub and repost until one blows up. 

While the two of you are karma whoring, have the young man repost the classic man waving a towel joke. 

That will help your wife and should bring sweet karma.' They go home and follow the reposter's advice. 

They find a joke that has been constantly reposted for years and he clicks submit. It does not help and the wife is still unsatisfied. Perplexed, they go back to the reposter. 'Okay,' he says to the husband, 'Try using the top comment on the repost.

Have the comment ready to use and your wife will be achieve maximum karma'. Once again, they follow the reposter's advice. They go home and find an original, funny comment. 

The young man clicks submit and the wife refreshes the page.

The post takes off and soon she has enormous, room-shaking, ear-splitting screaming karma. The husband smiles, looks at the computer screen and says to him triumphantly, 'You see, THAT'S how you ruin a sub and still get karma!'

They are both attracted to each other, looking athletic in cycling gear, and getting a buzz out of the sexual tension, the sensation of speed, and the liberating feeling of being out in the open. 

The girl, being the experienced cyclist, is riding more slowly, and the guy is doing his best not to show off. He follows his date at an equally sedate pace. 

They just finished climbing a hill and are starting to coast downhill when the girl suddenly yelps, and starts hawking violently, coughing and spitting, almost falling off her bike. The guy, startled by the sudden transformation of his date from a cool, sexy girl into a spittle spewing monster, asks, ""Hey, are you OK? What happened?""

Still coughing and spitting, with tears rolling down her cheeks now, the girl replies, ""I swallowed a fly! It flew right in my mouth!""

Surprised by her overreaction, the guy starts to suggest that the girl drink some water, when all of a sudden she gets back on her bike, and sprints off at top speed. He quickly follows but is amazed at how fast she is going and actually has a hard time catching up. 

He finally is neck and neck with her, and starts yelling about how swallowing a fly never hurt anybody, when all of a sudden she veers off into a gas station, dumps her bike, runs into the store, and starts stuffing hot dogs and chicken wings into her mouth, before even paying for them. 

Inwardly freaked out by this bizarre behavior, the guy tries hard to maintain composure, and asks her what she is doing. 

In between mouthfuls of hot dog, the girl says: ""I realized I was no longer vegan. Get me some ketchup.""

What's sad about 4 black people in a Cadillac going over a cliff? 
They were my friends. 

Why did the chicken cross the road? 
Earlier that morning the farmers daughter had inadvertently left the gate to the yard open as she was preoccupied by her worry over a maths test set for that day. She hadn't studied for the test as she was still deeply distressed over her fathers recent heart attack. This, coupled with the added burden of household chores now delegated to her because her mother was out trying to get the west field prepared for sowing, had made her quite forgetful and distracted of late.
Whilst several chickens escaped, only one strayed so far that it actually encountered the road facing the farm. After crossing the road and gorging itself in a soybean crop, the chicken was struck by a furniture removers van as it attempted to make its way home. 
Several hours later the dead chicken was spotted by a Community Mental Health Worker who was doing his bi-weekly rural clinic run. The chicken, being a bantam caught the eye of the Mental Health worker, who was a keen trout fisherman. 
""Cool"" thought the mental health worker- ""those feathers will make for excellent trout flies"". He stopped and plucked a handful of the most iridescent blue, green and orange feathers and placed them in an envelope. He rolled himself a cigarette, sat on the trunk of his car and admired the clouds. ""God, I love this job"", he muttered to no one in particular.

Satan takes the form of Jesus and appears to three priests saying that if they do something evil, he'll let them drink of the holy water. 
The three priests discuss the offer and come to the conclusion that Satan must be tricking them into committing sin. When confronted with this accusation, Satan reveals his dastardly plot and salutes the priests on their cunning and steadfast faith. 

Why couldn't Helen Keller drive? 
Because she was blind and deaf. 

Otto and Beata give birth to a young child. 
This is impossible, because a baby cannot be born as a young child, therefore the previous sentence is rendered void and should be corrected. I apologise on behalf of myself, and myself only, for this major yet forgivable mistake.

The Pope walks into a bar. The bartender says, what'll ya have, Pope? But the Pope's grasp of English is tenuous at best, so he mumbles something in Latin. The bartender doesn't know any Latin. The Pope gets frustrated and leaves. 

Have you seen Stevie Wonder's new house? 
No. 
Well, it's really nice. 

Where did Hitler keep his armies? 
The brunt of his forces were applied to the Eastern front, but throughout different periods of the war, a sizable chunk were used to protect the Atlantic Wall and a handful of divisions were used in Africa, to secure shipping routes. 

A kid is riding down the street when his chain pops off his bicycle. The kid yells ""God damn!"" as he begins to fix it. A priest walking nearby overhears the boy taking god's name in vein and says ""Don't say 'God damn' say 'God help us'"". 
The kid says, ""I am an atheist, get away from me"". 

What's the difference between a Jew and a pizza? 
A Jew is a person adhering to the Jewish faith and a pizza is an oven-baked, flat, usually circular bread covered with tomato sauce and cheese with optional garnishes. 

What do you get when you turn 3 blondes upside-down?
An embarrassing situation 

Why did the blonde tattoo her zip code on her stomach?
She was a schizophrenic. 

How do you confuse a blonde?
Paint yourself green and throw forks at her. 

What's the deal with airline peanuts?
The packaging is generally poorly designed and cheaply made, as a method of cutting distribution costs. After all, most passengers wouldn't want a ""Peanut Fee"" attached to their already costly ticket prices in order to cover the expenses of higher quality wrappers. What are you complaining about, anyway? It's free food, and it's a nice snack. If you're really that bent on not enjoying the peanuts the airline so graciously provided you with, just save them and give them to the next homeless person you see. People these days are really selfish. 

How do you make a Swiss roll? 
Generally it involves a thin layer of sponge cake and a layer of either jam or cream. The resulting flat sheet of cake and cream is then rolled into a cylinder. It's quite delicious, actually. 

What's the difference between Michael Jackson and a shopping bag.
One is a famous singer songwriter facing charges of child molestation and the other's a thin plastic sheet formed into a shape most fitting to carrying large amounts of shopping so that its easier to carry. 

How many mice does it take to screw in a lightbulb? 
I imagine it would take a great many. Mice would find it difficult to reach a ceiling light fitting, and would individually lack the strength or dexterity required to turn a bulb in such a socket. Even if you had enough mice to lend their strength to such an endeavor, the chances of them having the intelligence and wherewithal to perform such a complex activity is really quite low. 

A blonde girl walks into the local dry cleaners. She places a garment on the counter. ""I'll be back tomorrow afternoon to pick up my dress."" she says. 
""Come again?"" says the clerk, cupping his ear. 
""I said 'I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW AFTERNOON TO PICK UP MY DRESS',"" says the girl, this time louder. 

A man walks past a bar and sees a sign which says ""PERFORM THE THREE FEATS AND WIN A MILLION DOLLARS!"" Thinking that a million dollars sounds like a great idea, he goes inside and asks the bartender what the deal is. 
""First,"" says the bartender, ""you have to chug this entire bottle of vodka. Second, there's a crocodile in the back room with a bad tooth. You have to pull it. Third, there's an eighty-five year old woman in the back who's never had sex. You have to have sex with her."" 
The guy think it over and says ""okay, sure. You have a deal!"" He grabs the bottle of vodka and, with little effort due to the fact that he's basically a professional alcoholic anyway, downs it. Then he slams the empty bottle down and goes into the back room. There's a lot of screaming, some growling, and various crashing sounds. Finally a silence falls upon the bar. Minutes pass, then an hour. Finally the bartender sends a barmaid back to see what's going on. A few minutes later, she comes back out. 
""What's he doing?"" asks the bartender. 
""What's left of him is back there in the croc pen,"" she says, her horrified face pale with shock. ""His clothes are tossed in the corner. I think he tried to fuck the croc. The croc...the croc ate him."" 
""Oh, Jesus,"" whispers the bartender. ""Jesus."" 
Nobody says a word. 

A man has been trapped on a desert island for 8 years. One day, he sees a boat on the horizon and lights a fire to let it know he is there. 
The boat comes towards the shore. On board there is a beautiful woman in a body hugging wetsuit. 
""Thank God"", he says, ""I've been trapped on this island for eight years. Thank god someone has come at last."" 
""Eight years?"" she says, ""So it's eight years since you last smoked a Cuban cigar?"" 
She unzips a pocket on her wetsuit and pulls out a cigar. She passes it to him, pulls out a Zippo, and lights it for him. He enjoys the first cigar he has had in eight years. 
""So is it also eight years since you had a drink?"" 
She unzips a pocket on her wetsuit and pulls out a hip flask, tossing it to him. He takes a swig, and it's 25 year old single malt whisky. It's smooth and mellow and utterly delicious. 
""So,"" she says, beginning to unzip the long zipper on the front of her costume, ""Is it eight years since you played around?"" 
""Oh no,"" he says, ""This is all a dream, isn't it? A beautiful woman with whiskey and cigars wanting to have sex with me? I must be dreaming."" 
Suddenly he is woken up by a flash of lightning. It's the middle of the night, and he is all alone in his primitive shelter on his desert island. So alone... so terribly alone. 

An Illinois man left the snowballed streets of Chicago for a vacation in Florida. His wife was on a business trip and was planning to meet him there the next day. When he reached his hotel, he decided to send his wife a quick e-mail. 
Unable to find the spool of paper on which he had written her e-mail address, he did his best to type it in from memory. Unfortunately, he missed one letter, and his note was directed instead to an elderly preacher's wife whose husband had passed away only the day before. When the grieving widow checked her e-mail, she took one look at the monitor, did not recognize the sender's name, and rightly deduced that she was not the intended recipient. She replied, pointing out the man's mistake, who then resent the e-mail to the proper address. 

What's the difference between a duck? 
I'm sorry, I was typing too quickly and missed off the end of my sentence. I meant to say ""What's the difference between a duck and a goose?"" and the answer is that they are entirely different species of waterfowl. 

What do you call 5 Mexicans in quicksand?
A dangerous situation that could soon turn tragic. 

Four blondes are driving to Disneyworld. They finally get to Florida and they see a sign that says ""Disneyworld: left"" so they take the left and have a wonderful time at what many people believe to be the most magical place on Earth. 

A Mexican, a Texan, a Brit, and a Frenchman are flying on a plane when one of the engines goes out. The pilot comes out and says ""we're too heavy, one of you will have to jump!"" The Mexican looks at the Texan, the Brit looks at the Frenchmen, but they all decide that they don't want to jump out of the plane. The pilot attempts an emergency landing but without a runway and only 3 engines the plane hits at too harsh an angle and explodes. 

How do you make a blonde's eyes light up? 
Do something really nice for her, like buy her the piece of jewelry she looks at every time you go into the mall, or bake her a cake. If you have the time and effort, make her something. People appreciate thought and effort in a present more than money. 

Why don't Polish girls swim in the sea? 
The only sea that Poland borders on is the Baltic. Throughout most of the year this sea is too cold to comfortably swim in. 

There once was a man from Nantucket. He owned a sailboat. I haven't seen him in years. 

As their plane spirals towards the ground, a young man asks the pretty girl next to him if she would have sex with him, as he does not want to die a virgin. Surprised by this request, she declines, stating that in addition to the sheer inappropriateness of the idea, the mechanics of copulating in a crashing aircraft seem very difficult if not impossible. He agrees and admits that he was only trying to lighten the mood. However, she was busy putting on her oxygen mask and didn't hear this last bit. They both spend the last moments of their lives in anxious reflection.

A man walks into a bar. 
He orders a couple of drinks, pays for them, and then proceeds to leave the premises, as his wife had told him that he must not be too late home.

A horse walks into a bar.
The barman immediately calls the local stable to report the missing stallion, and his owner promptly arrives to take him home. He thanks the landlord and offers a small reward, but it is respectfully declined.

What's eighteen inches long, stiff, and makes women scream at night?
A twelve inch long penis that is erect, thus adding approximately one half of its flaccid size, and involved in the act of fornication with the female partner of the man whose penis I am describing. (Of course, it is ignorant and juvenile to assume that the man in question is heterosexual. He may be a homosexual, which is perfectly acceptable in these liberal times we live in, or he may in fact be single and not inclined towards a sexual preference of any kind. This is understandable due to the myriad complications of long-term relationships, a result of the infinite differences between the masculine and feminine psyches.)

PATIENT: Doctor doctor, I feel like a pair of curtains!
DOCTOR: I shall prescribe you some anti-depressant tablets, probably 20 miligrams to start with, and I shall book you an appointment with a psychiatrist. You will not be charged for his or her services, but you may have to wait up to seven weeks for your first meeting. I shall give you two prescriptions just in case, so that you don't run the risk of running out of medication and thus relapsing. You will have to return in two months as your counseller is unable to provide you with drugs. Have a nice day.
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. My mother will be pleased and relieved that I have finally sought your advice after many years of this inner personal anguish and turmoil.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Could you please send my next patient in? He should have a large beard, unless he recently has shaved it, which I consider unlikely.
PATIENT: Certainly, doctor. And thank you again.

What's the difference between Smarties and sleeping pills?
Smarties are a popular chocolate-based confectionary product from England, which were the inspiration for the arguably more successful M&amp;M's produced by Mars. Sleeping pills are flavourless narcotics that are used primarily by people suffering from afflictions such as insomnia. Another difference between the two is the repurcussions of ingestion. In a large dose, Smarties can have a minor contribution to obesity, whereas a large dose - often referred to as an 'overdose' - of sleeping pills runs the risk of much more dangerous consequences such as immediate and fatal liver damage. It is generally accepted that sleeping pills should only be used when recommended or prescribed by a qualified doctor or chemist, but Smarties can be purchased at the majority of reputable supermarkets or corner shops.

How can you tell that your girlfriend's too young for you?
Often the level of rapport enduced from conversations and activities is dependant on sharing mutual interests and beliefs. A significant age gap can compromise this, although it is not a concrete determiner of a relationship's potential success. Another thing to take into account is that the legal age for consentual sex is 16, although it is often (wrongly) considered a taboo for a man of 20 years or older to date a lady who is less than 18, the minimum legal age for drinking in the United Kingdom. However, when the roles are reversed it can be considered a positive trait for a younger man to have a mature partner.

What do you call a man with a tray on his head?
If you are aware of his given name, you may address him with this. If he had adopted a nickname by which he is comfortable to be known, using this would also be deemed acceptable. If, however, you do not already know what his name is, ask him to kindly inform you so that you may become acquainted. You may then ask him why he has a tray on his head, and he will quite likely answer you with humility and direct earnest.

An Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotsman walk into a bar. They have a few drinks, then go to a club, where they amuse each other and those around them by completely slurring their words in their already very strong regional accents. Then they get a taxi back to the house of the Englishman as he lives nearest, and stay the night. The next morning, the Scotsman and the Irishmen walk home as they are still hungover and do not wish to risk driving.

What do Madeleine McCann's parents have in common with Rhys Jones's parents?
Both sets of parents outlived their infant children. (It is assumed, due to the substantial period of time since McCann went missing, that she is now deceased. However, this has yet to be confirmed by any official source.)

Due to fewer intrinsic external differences between the facial structures of african people when compared to those of caucasians, Barack Obama is sometimes confused with Lewis Hamilton and Theo Walcott. Similarly, the current Israeli/Palestinian crisis is occasionally mistaken for that of footballer Paul Gascoigne. This is because Gascoigne was often endearingly known as 'Gazza', while the area of land most prominent in the Middle Eastern conflict is called Gaza - one letter away from the aforementioned 'Gazza', hence the confusion.

A man walks into a pub and orders three pints. He sits down with them and drinks them all to himself, then goes back to the bar and orders another three pints. Once again, he drinks them all to himself and returns for three more pints. 
The barman, understandably rattled, asks him why he keeps ordering three at a time. The man explains that he has two riplet brothers, both in other countries, and they always have three pints at a time to pretend that they're together. The barman is touched by this.
This continues for several months until one day the man comes in and only asks for two pints. The barman offers his condolences.
The man thanks him, and somberly finishes his drinks, in the knowledge that he will never again see his beloved brother.

What do you get if you cross a gooseberry with a stereo?
A sticky green residue that is difficult to remove from the electrical unit.

A man dies and goes to heaven.
This is an assumption based on religious faith.

Why can't Stephen Hawking dance?
He has Motor Neurone syndrome.

What's black, white, and hungry?
The population of Zimbabwe.

A man is walking through the desert, searching desperately for water. Suddenly, he stumbles across a stall.
""Do you have any water, please?"" he asks the merchant.
""Sorry mate, I only sell ties here"" is the reply.
The man continues his increasingly futile bid for quenched thirst, and finally reaches another merchant.
""How can I help you, mate?""
""Water! I need water!""
""Well, you've come to the right place.""
So the merchant gives the man some water, they shake hands, and have a long and hearty laugh over the redundancy of a tie shop in the desert.",JOKES...as told by a German perspective,7

In court, the people are mixed about what his punishment should be. Some see him as a valuable ally while others see him as a dangerous threat. The kind and generous King however decides to give him one chance to favour the people and gain his freedom. He tells the scientist, ""My jester has died recently and we have been without laughter. If you can tell me something that will make me really laugh, something I have never heard before, I will grant you your independence, your weight in gold, and a seat by my side. If not, you will be stoned and killed.""

The people of the court await curiously as to what the strange man would say. He thinks for a moment and then clicks his fingers as an idea formulates in his head, sparking interest from the crowd. He recalls a joke which he has seen a while back on the Internet. He was sure it would please the King, and certain that he has never heard it before.

The people stand quietly listening attentively to the man as he executes the joke in a skillful and humorous manner. He finally concludes and looks around the great hall. The room is incredibly quiet, as if something sacred lay in the center, and the faces of the crowd are stagnant. However, almost simultaneously, everyone turns to the King who is masking a neutral expression. The King turns to his guards and shakes his head as they proceed to drag the scientist away, kicking and screaming. 

The crowd begins chattering about the whole ordeal sharing their thoughts, but are suddenly interrupted by the King who is loudly chuckling, grabbing the attention of his loyal people. ""Number 463, such a classic.""",A scientist travels back in time to ancient Babylonia to see the beauty of the Hanging gardens...,6

The man was just about to give up as night time fell upon him when he discovered a small pub. He decided to stop in and see if anyone could help him.

The man asked the bartender if he could use the phone to call a tow truck. The man was dissapointed to hear that a tow truck couldnt make it out to him for hours.

He decided to have a few drinks while he waited. While having his first drink, he noticed a large jar of cash sitting behind the counter. He asked the bartender about all the cash. The bartender replied, 

""We have kind of a competition around here. It'll cost you $20 bucks. There is a 90 year old virgin upstairs and a pitbull outside with a toothache. If you can fix both of those things, you get all that money.""

The man did not intend on entering this strange competition, but after a few more drinks decided to enter anyway.

He went straight outside to the pitbull and got to work. For about a half hour, there was a lot of yipping and yapping and barking.

 Finally the man comes back in and in a very obviously intoxicated voice says, ""ALRIGHT! NOW WHERE IS THIS GRANNY WITH A TOOTHACHE?""

He decides he’ll charge money to let the townspeople punish the crooks and use the money to keep them in jail for as long as he can. The sheriff figures even a short stay in jail will be plenty after a little “justice” from the townspeople.
The sheriff takes the criminals to the town square, handcuffs them posts and sets up shop. He tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin. Since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.
After a while there are two long lines for the criminals. Some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to get their licks in. After a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist’s face is a bloody pulp and thinks “He’s so beat up at this point, he probably can’t even feel anything anymore. I’m not going to waste my money on that.” So the guy walks up and kicks the con artist squarely in the groin.
The sheriff sees this and hurries over and says, “Hey son, you can’t do that here.”

One day, as the man and his dog are walking, they find a small flock of sheep grazing.

Now, he isn't the kind of guy who gets into animals, but he is LONELY. 

So he finds a female sheep, drops his pants, and is about to do the deed when all of the sudden the dog starts barking like crazy, jumping at him. He finally gives up and takes the dog back to camp.


He tries it a few more times and each time the dog is crazier than the last, so he begins to give up on the idea. 


One morning, though, he and the dog were walking down the beach they find debris, and then an unconscious, beautiful, naked woman washed up with the tide.


He revives her. She is weak, but appreciative. 

She reaches up says: ""You saved me! I don't know how I can repay you!”

The guy looks deeply into her eyes and says...


""Well, if you wouldn't mind holding my dog for about 15 minutes I would be really grateful...""
