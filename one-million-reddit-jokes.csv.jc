He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria...,67

""One rule,"" the angel says, ""you must *never* sit on the pink puffy cloud.""  The three men agree, since they obviously want to go to heaven.

On the first day, one of the men find themselves to be very uncomfortable on the stone slab.  He looks at the pink puffy cloud and decides to sit on that instead, since it is obviously more comfortable.  He sits on it, and disappears.  A few hours later, the man returns with the ugliest woman any of them had ever seen.  ""Dude,"" says the second man, ""What happened to you?""  The first man responds, ""I sat on the pink puffy cloud.  *Never* sit on the pink puffy cloud.""

On the second day, the second man gets very uncomfortable and decides to sit on the pink puffy cloud, sure that it would be far more comfortable than the stone.  Much like the first, he disappears and returns many hours later with an even uglier woman.  ""Dude,"" says the third man, ""what happened to you?""  The second man sighed and said, ""I sat on the pink puffy cloud.  *Never* sit on the pink puffy cloud.""

On the third day, the third man mysteriously vanished.  The other two assumed he had sat on the pink puffy cloud while they had slept.  As they predicted, the man soon reappeared.  However, the third man came with the most beautiful woman any of them had ever seen.  ""Dude,"" the two men said, ""What happened to you?""

On the one-month anniversary of their first dinner on the cruise ship, Ed took Linda to a fine restaurant.  While having cocktails and waiting for their salad, Ed said, ""I guess you can tell I'm very much in love with you. I'd like a little serious talk before our relationship continues.  So, before I get a box out of my jacket and ask you a life-changing question, it's only fair to warn you, I'm a total golf nut.  I play golf, I read about golf, I watch golf on TV. In short, I eat, sleep, and breathe golf.  If that's going to be a problem for us, you'd better say so now!""

Linda paused, then responded, ""Ed, that certainly won't be a problem. I love you as you are and I love golf too; but, since we're being totally honest with each other, you need to know that for the last five years I've been a hooker.""

Ed paused for a while then said, ""It's probably because you're not keeping your wrists straight when you hit the ball.""",Ed and Linda met on a singles cruise and Ed fell head over heels for her.,382

So Bill went to hell. It was a beautiful clean sandy beach with clear waters. There were thousands of beautiful women running around playing in the water laughing and frolicking about. The Sun was shining and the temperature was perfect. "" This is great!"" He told God.   Bill then went to heaven. Heaven was a high place in the clouds, with angels drifting about playing Harps and singing. It was nice but not as enticing as hell. Bill thought for a moment and then said, ""I think I prefer hell."" 'Fine', replied God, 'as you desire"". So Bill Gates went to hell. Two weeks later God decided to check up on him.

He notices an attractive lady sitting by herself a couple tables away. Too attractive for someone of his own league, he thinks to himself.

Halfway through too many drinks though, he ends up plucking up enough courage and approaches her. ""May I sit down"", he asks.

""Sure"", she responds, and they start chatting. Apparently she was as witty and good in conversation as she was attractive, and you know this is no blonde joke. Casual chat turns into drunken flirtation. It gets late and the lady asks if he would like to walk her home.

He does, and they head back to her place. They didn't waste a single moment once they were in and started going ferociously and passionately tearing each others' clothes off. She stopped him halfway and said ""I have a strange request, but I promise to make it worth your while.""

""You have to fuck me only with your big toe""

Now that indeed was a strange request, but the man was by now horny as a teenager without wifi and anyway what's there to lose? He agreed.

And make it worth his while she did. Hands down she pleasured him in ways he never imagined and he went home a happy man.

Later that week he goes for a medical checkup with his doctor at the usual clinic. The doctor does his usual mmms and uhuhs and finally hesitates and goes ""well that's unusual"".

""What? Don't leave me in suspense, Doc!""

""You have Syphilis on your big toe."" said the doctor. ""but don't worry, nothing we can't treat with antibiotics""

*No wonder* the lady made me fuck her with my big toe, thought the man. That's pretty decent of her actually. ""Damn right that's strange"", laughed the man, ""I bet that's the weirdest thing you've come across in a while"".

Someone else yelled out ""84"" and again there were laughs.

This continued for a while, different numbers were yelled out, and some numbers gave very much laughter, some numbers less.

My friend, the new one there, was very confused, so they encouraged him to choose a random number and say it.
Without thinking he said some random number: ""4018"".

Everyone around the table burst out in wild laughter, some were rolling on the tables, some on the floor, some couldn't breathe and others' faces turned red. After a good while they had mostly calmed down and explained what it was all about.

""We have heard every joke so many times that every joke has been given a number. Throughout the time we have learned to remember what joke is behind each number.""

He’d been keeping all of his catch in a 5 gallon bucket at the edge of the water, by his feet. A young state game warden, fresh out of the academy, walked up and asked to see the old man’s fishing license and inspect his fish. The young warden knew he’d hit a jack pot when he saw the contents of the bucket. Not bad for his first week on the job!

The old man said, “Now sir, I can already imagine what you must be thinking- but I didn’t catch these fish. These here fish are my pets. It’s taken me some time, but I’ve trained my fish to swim out to the middle of the pond, splash around some and then, on my whistle, they come back here and jump back in the bucket!

Of course the game warden thought he was lying, but thought he’d have a little laugh at the old man’s expense.  He agreed to let the old man “prove his innocence”.  

So the old man leaned down and carefully tipped over the bucket and poured all the fish out into the water, talking softly to them as they swam off towards the middle of the pond. He stood back up and stared intently of into the distance for a few minutes with a look of concentration. After a while the game warden jeered, “Well- c’mon now- ain’t you going to whistle for them fish?!?!”

The old man turned his eyes from the horizon, looked at the young game warden and said, “Whistle for what?”",An old man was out fishing one day...,3

Having a lot of time to kill, the man initiates a conversation with the woman, asking her about her religion and how God created the universe, etc.

""Well, first I’ve got a question for you"", said the woman.

""Cows eats grass, and their manure comes out pasty"", she said.

""But horses also eats grass, and *their* manure is drier"", she continued.

The man wasn’t sure where she was going with this, but he agreed with her statements.

""Finally, sheeps eat grass aswell, but their manure comes out as small pebbles.""

""So my question is this; they all eat the same thing, but their feces look completely different, why is this?""

""I honestly don’t know"", he answered.

To which she replied;
""So you’re expecting me to discuss some of the greatest mysteries of the universe, with someone who doesn’t know shit?""

one day, while playing near the swamp, horse gets too rambunctious  and falls in the swamp up to his neck.  Slowly he starts to sink, and as he sinks, he starts yelling to chicken.  ""chicken! chicken! quick, go get the farmer to come and save me!
hurry!!!""
Chicken runs to the farmhouse as fast as his little chicken legs could carry him and starts pounding on the door clucking for the farmer to come out and save his friend horse.

But the farmer and his wife are not home, so chicken runs around the house looking for something to save his friend with.
behind the house he finds the farmers wife's old Mercedes and a length of rope.
chicken jumps in the Mercedes and hauls chicken ass to the swamp.
chicken ties the rope to the bumper of the Mercedes and throws the other end to horse, who grabs it with his teeth and holds on tight.  Chicken then backs up the Mercedes and pulls horse out of the swamp.

Horse is forever thankful and now bonded more than ever, he and chicken continue to frolic on the farm until one day they find themselves next to the swamp again.

This time chicken falls in and immediately begins to sink.
""Help! Help! horse!  quick, go get the farmer's mercedes and pull me out!!!""   But horse doesn't run away and instead begins to walk toward the swamp.  Chicken yells, ""horse what are you doing?!  go get the mercedes and pull me out!!!""
By this time, horse has his two front hoofs in the swamp and chicken is underneath him.
Horse says to chicken, ""look up and grab on!""
Chicken looks up and sees his only choice of something to grab, so he does.
Horse backs up and pulls chicken out of the swamp successfully.

Now, do you want to know the moral of this story?

It's gone by many names, such as ""The Country of Tar,"" and still lacks an official title. According to the few documents that exist for it, the tar covering the country could conceal countless amounts of undiscovered prehistoric fossils once the bubbling black liquid is dug up. Scientists are well aware of this vast expanse of possible scientific advancements, but they've kept it hidden from the public, as they feel aspiring millionaires would flock to the ""Land of Ooze"" for a profit and possibly ruin the land.

Scientists have kept very quiet about this country, but that's very difficult to do for multiple reasons. Researchers are sent out to this untouched land occasionally, but they very quickly found that there's something else in the country. Whatever this disturbance is, it's halted progress of colonization and/or research and has killed off many adventurers. Documents found at the deserted camp sites talk about how ""it"" was there, and kept preying on them. No matter what the scientists did in terms of searching, they could not discover what ""it"" was.

Most researchers have given up on trying to colonize the ""Black Country"" as they consider it too dangerous to explore, and that it's simply been draining money away from more important projects. It has been assumed that any attempts to revive the plans for colonization have failed, so the few researchers still curious about the country are left with only one question:

What’s in Tar Nation?",There is a country that is still mostly undocumented,6

an obviously impossible leap of logic, absurd to even attempt to conceive or contemplate.

One day, as he is reading the news, he stumbles across an article that immediately catches his attention. The headline of the article says:

# 1 in 100 flights have an active bomb onboard.

The pilot, obviously shocked by these figures, decides that he has to find a solution to this problem. He informs the security guards about this issue, asking them to double-check every luggage until he has found a solution. The guards assure him that no bomb could ever make it on his plane, but the pilot is unwavering. The rest of his day, the man spends in fear, thinking: “There might be a bomb on this plane. What do I do?” 

When he finally gets home from work, he immediately starts plotting for a solution that will make his job safe again. A lot of possible fixes come to his mind, yet he is still unsatisfied. When after 4 hours of pondering, he thinks to have found the ultimate solution, he can finally go to sleep.

The next day, as he is walking over to his plane again, he gets stopped by a security guard. The guard asks the pilot: “Are you aware that there is an active bomb inside your baggage?”

The pilot calmly responds: “Yes, I know that. In fact, I put it there myself.”

The guard, infuriated by his respons, screams:“What were you thinking?! Do you have any idea how dangerous that is? What could possibly be the reason you did something this stupid?”

“Well, remember how yesterday I told you about this news-article which stated that 1 in 100 planes carry a live bomb? This is obviously a risk I am not willing to take, so I decided that from now on I am going to bring my own bomb,” the pilot answers.

“How does that solve anything?” asks the guard, even more confused than before.

“Isn’t it obvious?” the pilot replies. “The article stated that there is a 1% chance for *one* bomb on a plane. But, what are the odds that there are *two* bombs on the *same* flight?”",A pilot finds a solution,7

She was lucky to have secured a spot, year after year, at a very popular farmer's market, but rather than feeling excited, she was bummed out in anticipation of having to endure, yet again, the obnoxious antics of two almond growers in the stall next to hers.  The twins, Jerry and Gary, were loud, rude, and talked badly about other vendors at the farmer's market.  

After arriving to her stall, the farmer was surprised to find that the twins were not there.  She walked over and asked her friend, ""What happened to those jerks, the almond guys?""  The friend replied, ""Remember that petition we circulated last year to get them kicked out?  Well, it actually worked!""  

The farmer was overjoyed, but before she could even reply, the farmer's market event manager ran up to the two, clearly upset.  ""Can you believe this?"" the manager said.  ""First market of the year and I actually have CARLOS SANTANA lined up to play.""  

""Yeah, we know... Everybody knows that,"" the farmer replied, confused.

The event manager replied, ""Well, Santana's agent just called to cancel.  I'm screwed!  Tons of people are gonna show up here expecting to see Carlos Santana.""

After a brief, uncomfortable silence, the farmer replied, ""Well, at least we got the Almond Brothers banned.""",First farmer's market of the year,4

post,8pqzkw,2qh72,jokes,false,1528526015,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8pqzkw/a_politician_dies/,self.jokes,,"So a politician dies and ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.

""So, you're a politician..."" ""Well, yes, is that a problem?"" ""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician. ""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears...

And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!"" ""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..."" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...

And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?"" ""No sir!"" says the man. ""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"". ""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician. ""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

""Ah"", says Satan. ""You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...""","A politician dies,",11

So Mick packs the picnic basket with beer and sandwiches. The trouble is the picnic site is ten miles away so it takes them ten days to get there.

When they get there Mick unpacks the food and beer. ""Ok Les Give me the bottle opener.""

""I didn't bring it,"" says Les. ""I thought you packed it.""

Mick gets worried, He turns to Alan, ""Did you bring the bottle opener??""

Naturally Alan didn't bring it. So they're stuck ten miles from Home without a bottle opener. Mick and Alan beg Les to go back for It, but he refuses as he says they will eat all the sandwiches.

After two hours, and after they have sworn on their tortoise Lives that they will not eat the sandwiches, he finally agrees. So Les sets off down the road at a steady pace.

Twenty days pass and he still isn't back and Mick and Alan are starving, but a promise is a promise.

Another five days and he still isn't back, but a promise is a promise. Finally they can't take it any longer so they take out a Sandwich each, and just as they are about to eat it, Les pops up from behind a rock and shouts........

Drawing on his experience, the gambler immediately thinks of a way to get ahead of everyone else. He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder...

""Want to make a bet while we wait?"" The Gambler asks. ""If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.""

The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins ""reading"" him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.

""Don't be silly, it's just indigestion."" the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line.

Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts.

""This one's easy!"" the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. ""Hold my beer!""

Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line.

Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made.

""Okay, let's see..."" The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes.

The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. ""You ain't taking me alive!""

The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.

The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, ""Fuck the police!""

Wrong again. The gambler's getting frustrated, now. He's never been unable to read someone before.

Finally, the gambler throws his hands in the air. ""I'VE GOT NOTHING!"" He shouts. ""I GIVE UP!""

The man steps aside.",The professional gambler,113

She doesn’t know which one to get, so she just grabs one and goes over to the counter.

The clerk was standing behind the counter wearing dark glasses. She says to him, “Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me anything about this rod and reel?” He says, “Ma’am, I’m completely blind; but if you’ll drop it on the counter, I can tell you everything from the sound it makes.”

She doesn’t believe him but drops it on the counter anyway. He says, “That’s a 6-foot Shakespeare graphite rod with a Zebco 404 reel and 10-pound test line. It’s a good all-around combination, and it’s on sale this week for only $20.”

She says, “It’s amazing that you can tell all that just by the sound of it dropping on the counter. I’ll take it!”

As she opens her purse, her credit card drops on the floor. “Oh, that sounds like a MasterCard,” he says.

She bends down to pick it up and accidentally farts. At first she is really embarrassed, but then realizes there is no way the blind clerk could tell it was her who tooted. Being blind, he wouldn’t know that she was the only person around?

The man rings up the sale and says, “That’ll be $34.50 please.”

The woman is totally confused by this and asks, “Didn’t you tell me the rod and reel were on sale for $20? How did you get $34.50?”

He replies, “Yes, ma’am. The rod and reel is $20, but the Duck Call is $11, and the Catfish Bait is $3.50.”

She paid it and left without saying a word.

On that day, every year, the chief rabbi would walk his way into the Vatican, all the way to where the Pope sits on his throne.

He always has a linen bag with him. When he walked in front of the Pope, he would raise both of his hand, politely waiting for the Pope to take it.

The Pope would then gently take the linen bag, take a piece of paper out of the bag, it cannot be more tinted with stains, and crumpled.

The Pope would then hold the piece of paper in his hand, raise it up high so that the sunlight would shine on it, his head will be up lifted up, with his eyes squirming at it.

Next, he would always slowly shake his head, showing disapproval.

He would put the piece of paper into the linen bag and gave it back to the Chief Rabbi.

A young Priest saw all of this, and he wondered what was on that sacred piece of paper. He asked everyone in the Vatican. But nobody knows.

He had so many questions, why would the rabbi be so humble when giving the Pope the bag? Why would the Pope shake his head every time? What is on it that is so inappropriate?

So he made a promise to himself, he swear to God, he would become the Pope and find out what’s on that piece of paper.

Years later, the young priest’s dream has came true. He became the Pope.

Finally the day came. As always, the chief rabbi walked slowly and quietly to where the Pope was sitting.

The new Pope was exceedingly nervous, clenching his fist, scratching his face.

At last, the rabbi lifted his hands, and handed him the ancient rusty linen bag. The Pope, who was once the young man staring at it from the corner far away, took the bag with caution.

He careful
