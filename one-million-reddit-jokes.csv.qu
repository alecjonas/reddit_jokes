The husband is not very receptive to this idea since he's clueless about farm work and his father-in-law often embarasses him in front of others about this fact. Nevertheless, he eventually relents so they drive down to the farm early morning.

Upon arriving, the father immediately picks on him. This continues throughout the day as they get to meet the rest of the staff and neighbors. Furious, the husband decides he's had enough and secretly vows to prove to them that he's not as inept at farm work as he looks.

When they're all asleep, he gets up very early in the morning, and heads down to the barn. He spots the animal, puts a bucket underneath, and sits down right beside it. Not knowing quite well how to initiate things, he goes gently at first but nothing comes out. He starts squeezing harder and faster until finally the stuff comes out. Delighted having accomplished this, he sets out to fill the bucket completey.

Many hours later, he returns to the house and sees the family sitting round the dinner table. The wife has a worried look in her face. The father yells, ""Where the hell you been boy? You had my daughter worried sick that you got lost out there!"" The husband, unphased, sweating profusely and his clothes all stained, puts his boot in one of the chairs, places the bucket hard on the table, picks up a glass, scoops the stuff out in one motion, and drinks it all in one gulp. Afterwards, he confidently proclaims, ""I'll have you know I worked the farm this morning! Right here I got a bucket of the good stuff that I alone got from your cow. Yeah, that's right, this city dweller can handle farm work just fine. What do you have to say about that old man?""

Maybe there was a reason for that, I always loved to look at myself as the mysterious type of person.
During my years of highschool, i never had a girlfriend, dont really know how to talk to girls. Never really had a lot of friends neither. I spent mostly my time in front of a screen or building trebuchets in my room. The one who introduced me to my passion for building trebuchets was
no other than my old man, Steve.

 I always felt that my father Steve was the opposite of me, outgoing, bright but non less, romanticly sucessful. 
Currently he's the father of three, including me. Everyone knew Steve and everyone loved him. There was this one time, he told me something which has stucked with me till this day.
Listen son, if there is ever a girl you like, remember to take the lead. Thats the only way you will ever be romanticly sucessfull. 

A girl that i liked? Yeah maybe, there was this 8/10 grill in my class which i always thought was a cute. 
The next day after my old man told me those word, something amazing happend. I was chilling in the school basement looking at youtube videos of building trebuchets. 
Suddenly i heard a voice, it was the 8/10 grill. My heart starts beating really fast. I could see her beutifull shadow holding a pencil case and some books.

Maybe she's gonna study in the school basement? Who knows. Right at the moment she slips her foot at the end of the stairs, she fell towards the ground.
Luckily there was just a 25cm gap between the end of the stair and the floor, no big deal. I stand up and starts to walk to her. The words of my old man kept
reapiting itself in my head, "" take the lead, take the lead"". I look at her, she looks absolutely stunning. I look at her and lift the pencil case while my eyes is still at her,
her face is blushing, probably of embaresment. My hands slips slowly into the pencil case, smooth and slow. I pull out some of her pencils and whispers in her ear

"" Sorry, but i think im gonna take the lead from you""

My old man always told me to take the lead if there's a girl i liked.

EDIT: Formating",My old man always told me to take the lead,8

The lifeboat departs, and everyone is gone but this man. Minutes later, a fishing boat approaches the nearly capsized ship.
""Come on, get down from there! I can help!"" the fisherman yells. 
""No thank you sir, God will save me."" The man replies. 
Several minutes later, when the ship is on the verge of being completely underwater, a helicopter arises above it. A ladder is flung down.
""Grab the ladder and climb up!"" say the people on the helicopter. 
""No thank you, God will save me!"" he yells.
""This is your last chance, grab the ladder and climb up!""
The man does not respond, and simply stands there. The helicopter leaves, the ship sinks, and the man dies. He arrives in heaven shortly thereafter. He goes to God and says
""God, I put my faith in you, trusting that you would help me but you simply left me to die!"" 
God responds:
""My child, on three separate occasions did I give you help, and not once did you take it!""

At home he demands his dinner, and then reads the paper. Every night his loving wife nags him that his temper will get him in trouble.

Sure enough one day on his way home he bumps into a witch and they both fall down. Since he was already angry, he boils over and chews her out. Naturally the witch reacts to this by turning the poor man into a frog. 

He hops home where his wife, shocked by his appearance, orders him to go find the witch and apologize hoping she'd change him back.

Reluctantly the potter, who hates apologizing, leaves his house to look for the witch. Unfortunately for him its witch season and there were quite a few about. He runs into a different witch who turns him into an ogre, then another who turns him into a troll. 

When he runs into a third witch the man, now quite worked up over the whole situation snaps at her and says ""What the hell are you gonna turn me in to?!"" Much to his surprise the witch turns him into a handsome prince! 

Thinking his luck had finally changed the man thanks the witch and begins to head home. However, the witch who had just turned him into a troll had seen all this and comes running up, furious.

""WHEN I TURN EM INTO TROLLS THEY STAY TROLLS!"" she screamed as she turned the man back into a troll!

Oh yeah?!"" replies the third witch, ""Well I say he's a prince!"" and with that she turns him back into a prince.

This goes back and fourth a few times, prince, troll, prince, troll, until finally the man decides the next time he's a prince he's gonna make a break for it. Which he does.

Now running home as fast as he could, the potter relaxes a bit as he gets close. He rounds a corner and suddenly runs into the same witch that had turned him into a frog in the first place.

Before he could stop himself he starts to yell, by the time he catches himself its too late and the witch has turned him into a frog again.

Defeated he hops home where he resigns himself to live out life as a frog. Thankfully, just as there are witches, there are good fairies, and one such good fairy appears for the man and his wife then. 

She looks upon the potter and tells him that it was his temper that got him into all this trouble, but she thinks he has learned his lesson and turns him back to normal.

Then she turns to his wife and tells her that it is her responsibility to watch her husband and make sure he keeps his temper under control.

So his wife did just that, she watched him every day while he worked, she watched him while he ate, she even watched him while he slept. For the rest of their days she watched him and he never got angry again.

After all, a watched Potter never boils. ",An angry man makes pots for a living.,6

Here's to friends who are sincere and friends who will endear. When others appear we give them a leer, but not so severe that they leave out of fear. We send pioneers to explore the frontier, and they return bearing a spear as a souvenir, taken from those who'd dare interfere. For we are the ones who domineer this northern hemisphere, and their land is ours to commandeer. So we send buccaneers to make them disappear, for we are austere only in veneer. Rather than cohere with these people we should revere, we choose to be insincere, and to besmear. When these people of yesteryear tire of us being cavalier, they shall reappear at our belvedere, decked out to the nines like a musketeer, and protest how they do detest our choice to be a racketeer, and demand that we give them their arrears. And when they shed a tear, they think we will lend an ear, knowing not the ways of a profiteer. Now let me be clear, that if this makes you feel queer, then we'll all sneer and have a jeer that you, my friend, like it in the rear. I'm not a seer, but I will take a peer, into the future of all of you here, and though the image is blear, I can see that you all will have success in your career. To my friends, I ask of you, if this eve you choose to drink, please try to adhere to keep it mere, for I'd hate to see you forget how to steer, and have your car start to veer, and go straight off the edge of a sheer.

post,5eqwc6,2qh72,jokes,false,1480035127,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5eqwc6/loong_big_red_trike/,self.jokes,,"A young boy named Jimmy, 5 years old, is looking through the Sears catalog. His birthday is coming up and he wants something great this year. Something *awesome*.  So he's flipping through the catalog, going through all the Lego bricks, toy sets, whatever right? Well on the very last page of the section, Jimmy spots his heart's greatest desire. A big red metal trike. You know it. He just can't stop thinking about it. Day in day out, big red trike. Nap time? Big red trike. He asks everyone. He asks his mom, his dad, his brother, his sister, his aunts and uncles, big red trike. Big. Red. Trike. *BIG RED TRIKE*. and eventually his birthday comes around... his parents bring him a big box.. sure enough it has a big red trike in it!! Jimmy is so excited! He rides up the street, down the street, uptown, downtown, EVERY where. Eventually he gets to this big hill. He looks up at this monsterous hill and thinks to himself, ""I have a big red trike! I can go anywhere!"" So he backs up and gets a little bit of speed, and strains and strains to produce the necessary torque to get going on the hill. He gets about quarter the way up sweating like he's hungover, and the trike snaps into a million pieces flying down the hill with him. Being 5, he obviously is a little hurt. Eventually he gathers himself and remembers his sister lives just down the street from this hill.

*knock knock*

Jimmy's sister answers the door. She is so surprised to see him, wondering why he's on this side of town so late, and asks what's the matter. ""My trike broke! I cant get home or anything!"" and Jimmy's sister decides, being a nun, to help her little brother out and have him stay for the night since she hasn't seen him in *ages!* So she cooks him supper and prepares the guest room, and tells him his trike will be fixed in the morning. After supper, Jimmy's awfully tired so his sister reads him a bedtime story. ""Sister, can you do me another favour?"" Jimmy asks, just after the story. ""Yes of course Jimmy, what ever you need!"" his sister replies. ""Well.. i need a big red apple and a piece of strig about a foot long."" Jimmy's sister is a reserved type, being in the church she's found no reason to ponder upon other people's business, so she doesn't ask him why, but obliges with his request, and he's off to sleep.

He leaves in the morning on his big red trike.

Lets fast forward a few years. Jimmy's birthday is coming up once more. The big 13. he wants something beefy and powerful. He's looking through the Sears catalog again, and sorts through the usual video games and consoles, eventually coming upon the recreation section. At the end of the section he finds a big red dirtbike. 250cc 4 stroke red dirtbike with flames on the exhaust. Absolutely beautiful. He becomes obsessed with the dirtbike and can't stop thinking about it! Big red dirtbike! Day in, day out. He asks his mother, father, sister, brother, aunts, uncles, he even considered asking God but he knows it doesn't work like that. So Jimmy's excited for this big red dirtbike. He wants to be cool and fit in with his friends. 

Well tell ya what, his birthday comes around and he comes home from school to see his parents standing there with that very big red dirtbike he wanted. He's absolutely stunned. He drives it up the trails, down the trails, up town, down town, left and right and center. Eventually, he's at the same spot he remembers from age 5. ""I've got a fricken dirtbike, of course I can get up there now!"" He thinks, and he revs up, looking fiercely at the hill. He launches off and starts going up the hill, but about halfway up the bike starts vibrating and shaking as he slows down, and the more he hits the throttle the more the bike shakes. Well, it broke into a ton of pieces, and slid down the hill with him. Jimmy's pretty damn upset, but he decides his sister, a pretty handy woman indeed, could be helpful to him. He brings all the pieces and greets her again, gets inside and she tells him ""oh why don't you spend two nights this time, I haven't seen you in a few years. And I won't be able to have your dirtbike fixed up until then either. It'd be good to catch up."" So Jimmy decides to stay while his sister fixes his dirtbike. Every night, Jimmy asks her for a big red apple, and a piece of string about a foot long. His sister, beginning to be a bit curious, gets a little curious at this strange request. She wonders why he's asking for these items every time he's there. Being a Christian woman, she decides she will not ask him. It's not her place nor her business to ask. She brings him the items, fixes his bike, and two days later he's off on his way riding into the rising sun.

Lets take a look at a few years in the future. Jimmy's 17 and got his license. He wants a nice sweet sports car to cruise around in. Several of his friends have cars and such, he should be able to have something a little better. So he's on the bus one day, and passes the Audi dealership. He spies with his little eye an Audi R8 coupe in all red. Brembo calipers (an aftermarket upgrade, meaning it's a trade in) V10 engine rated at 542 bhp, 400 ft lbs of torque, Audi ventilated discs, the works. He loves this car. He asks everyone to help, his mother, his father, his brother, his sister, he wants this Audi R8. Red audi r8. Red audi r8. Red. Audi. R8. 

Well, Jimmy comes home on his birthday, and sitting in the driveway is none other than the red audi r8. He's absolutely stellar. He hops in and goes for a drive. He drives up town, down town, left, right, center, free way, roadway, side streets, he is absolutely amazed at the car. Eventually he winds up at the same hill. ""My r8 can handle this. 400 foot pounds of torque! Of course!"" So he goes down the road and accellerates with all his might. He gets up to 70 mph and gets headed up the hill. He gets to the top, and finds out he finally did it. He looks towards the bottom of the hill with a feeling of accomplishment. Then bolt by bolt, his Audi R8 falls apart into pieces right before him. Absolutely shocked he rushes all the pieces down the hill to his sister's once again and asks if she could help. Well, she can, but it'll take some time. He hasn't been there for many years and it would be good to catch up! It will take about a week for her to fix it. So he decides to stay there while she works on it. Once again, every night he asks for a big red apple and a piece of string about a foot long. Every night, his sister's curiosity gets stronger and stronger.. until the last night when she finally cracks. 

""Jimmy?.."" 

""Yeah, what is it sister?"" 

""Well... ive just noticed that youve been asking for the two same strange items.. and I know it's not my place to be nosy, but I'm just curious what you do with the apple and string?.."" his sister asks...

Jimmy looks up at her straight in the eye, and answers....

While there, he finds a Canadian Tire and heads in. A little overwhelmed at the sheer size of it, he slowly walks up and down the aisles. He doesn't really recognize anything and stops to ask an employee a question. 

""What's this?"" he says, pointing at an item on a shelf.

""That's a Thermos,"" the employee says.

""Okay, but what does it do?"" asks the Newfie.

""It keeps hot things hot,"" says the employee, ""and cold things cold.""

Suitably impressed, the Newfie buys it and heads home. He places the Thermos on the kitchen table and excitedly waits for his family to get home so he can tell them about his adventures.

When his wife walks in, she notices a strange object on the kitchen table and asks what it is.

""It's a Thermos!"" he says proudly.

""Okay, but what does it do?"" she asks.

Remembering how the employee described it, he says, ""It keeps hot things hot, and cold things cold.""

The chief of the tribe offers them an opportunity for escape. He says, ""If the three of you can find 10 pieces of the same fruit and stick them up your butt without making a sound, I will release you. If you make a noise, however, that will be the end of your days. ""

So, the adventurers set out on their hunt, carefully supervised by the tribesmen. Greg finds some mangos. He doesn't see any other fruit in sight, so he decides to give them a shot. He gets to about 4 mangos, but on the 4th, he cries out in pain. They kill him. On another part of the island, Bill, the second guy, finds some cherries. ""This should be a breeze!"" he thinks. He gets to 9 cherries easily, but then he makes a loud noise, so they kill him too. 

Greg and Bill find each other outside of the pearly gates shortly after their passing, so they approach each other to talk about their deaths.

Now the man further announced that he would buy monkeys for $ 200. This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys again. Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to work on their farms.

To keep the parrot busy while the captain was working, he left him in the ballroom where the magician performed his act.  The parrot would watch the magician at work, and over time, the parrot learned the secrets of all of the magician's tricks.  And since he was so talkative, he would shout out the secrets during the show.  

For instance - the magician would put a rabbit in hat and make it disappear.  The rabbit would shout ""there's a secret compartment in the hat!""   Or the magician would make a coin disappear into thin air, and the parrot would yell ""it's in his other hand!""

Well, this was making the magician very angry of course, but he couldn't harm the parrot since it belonged to his employer, the captain.  

One day, the ship hit an iceberg and sank.  Before it could sink, everyone headed to the lifeboats, including the magician and the parrot.  And as fate would have it, the parrot and the magician ended up in the same lifeboat alone together.  

The magician seethed at the parrot.  After about an hour, the parrot says ""ok, you got me.  Where the ship?""

The plumber tells him, ""Hey, we are looking for more plumbers. You could become a plumber and triple your salary. Just make sure you say you only made it to 6th grade, they don't like educated people.""

The professor takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But the company makes an announcement that all of their plumbers must get a 7th grade education. So they all go to night school.

On the first day of night school they all attend math class. The teacher wants to gauge the class so he asks John, ""What is the formula for the area of a circle?""

John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is negative pi times radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong so he starts over, but again he comes up with the same equation.

post,5em8ta,2qh72,jokes,false,1479967322,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5em8ta/dont_fart_in_the_bed/,self.jokes,,"This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years. The only friction in their marriage was the husband's habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke.  
The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.  
Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor. She was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.  
The years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her.  
She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts.  
Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom.  
The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good.  
About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face.

On the day of the assassination arti and the man meet up behind the building and arti says, ""You got the dough?""

""Oh no!"" Exclaimed the man, ""I left the cash on the table!""

Not wanting to lose this job arti sighed and said, ""listen just give me whatever money you have on you and you can pay me the rest afterwards.""

Relieved, the man searched his pockets and produced the only money he had, a single dollar bill. 

With an even greater sigh arti took the bill and made his way into the Albertsons to search for the man's wife. After a short while he spots her by the deli counter looking at steaks with no one around. Stealthily, arti made his way behind the poor woman and strangled her. After standing up he saw the deli worker staring in shock. With the greatest sigh that arti ever gave he jumped over the counter and strangled the worker too. 

TL;DR

During the course of the meal, his mother couldn't help but notice how pretty his roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship between the two, and this had only made her more curious.

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and his roommate than met the eye.

Reading his mom's thoughts, the son volunteered, “I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, we are just roommates.""

About a week later, his roommate came to him saying, “Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?""

He said ,""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure.""

He sat down and wrote :

Dear Mother:

I'm not saying that you ‘did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you ‘did not' take the silver plate .. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.

Love,

your son

Several days later, he received an email from his Mother which read:

Dear Son:

I'm not saying that you ‘do' sleep with your roommate, and I'm not saying that you ‘do not' sleep with her. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver plate by now, under the pillow…

Love,

Mom.﻿",A mom comes into town to visit her son.,162

So this guy buys a new truck and drives it home and parks it in the driveway.  Later that night an old man walks by and see's the truck.  He goes up to the back of the truck where it says 4x4 and next to that the old man scratches ' = 16'

The next day when the owner goes out side he's absent to see someone scratched = 16 on his truck.  So he took it in to get repaired and painted.  The cost was $100.  When he got truck back he parked it in his driveway again.  Later that night the old man walks by and does the same thing.  He see's 4x4 and scratches = 16.

The next day the owner gets really mad to see same thing happened.  So he takes it to the shop again.  This time the workers tell him ""instead of trying to fix this over and over again why not just let us add in a nice font next to the 4x4 and make it say'=16'.  That way the answer will already be there as a nice design rather then it being scratched in.""

This time it cost him $200 but the owner agreed.  So when it was done the owner took the truck back home and parked it in the driveway.  Later that night the old man walked by again and see's now that the truck says '4x4=16'.  The old man looked at it for a little bit and then said ""that is correct"" and scratched on a check mark next to the 16.   - THE END hahaha",Truck 4x4 problem,0

A week into his journey a massive hurricane collided with Daniels boat and things went haywire! Daniel fought and fought but the storm overtook his boat and Daniel was knocked unconscious.

When he awoke he was on an island and was surrounded by indigenous people. 

Daniel was terrified, the people looked as though they had never been touched by the modern world. 

Eventually after a rough first meeting, Daniel began to understand and talk to the people. They were called the Scorpion tribe because of the many scorpions on the island. They had never met a stranger from the outside world and were curious to learn about the world past their waters. 

After days of conversing Daniel had assimilated to their culture well, and then he saw her. From across the village he spotted the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen and approached her. 

He learned the girl was the chief of the villages daughter. She told him her name was Rock since she was born on the rocky hills of the island. 

Daniel was in love, so in love in fact that he wanted to marry her. He learned that in the village you had to do three tasks in order to marry a woman. 

The first task was to climb the tallest hill and eat a king scorpion. So Daniel did this. 

The second was to learn everything there was to know about the woman. So Daniel talked to Rock for 3 days and learned everything about her. He learned she hated the heat, loved nature, despised scorpion stings, and liked hurricanes. 

Once Daniel had completed the second trial he was prepared to do the third and most difficult trial. He was required to swim 100 meters out into the ocean, then swim back, and profess a fact about his one true love in front of the village. While he was swimming, Rock would be put on a pile of logs and the logs set on fire. He would have to get back in time to save her. 

So he began the trial. He swam all the way out, and when he turned back he noticed the fires were getting close to Rock. He wasn't going to lose her. He was determined. 

He swam as hard as he could back and arrived on the beach head. 

He ran past the tribe of scorpions and arrived in front of his bride to be and stated his fact:

""Here I am! Rock, you like a hurricane!""","Daniel was determined to be the greatest fisherman in the world, so he packed up his boat, and set sail!",2

Her 9-year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them and hides in the bedroom closet to watch. 
The woman's husband also comes home. She puts her lover in the closet, not realizing that the little boy is in there already. 

The little boy says, 'Dark in here.'
 
The man says, 'Yes, it is.'

Boy: 'I have a baseball.'

Man: 'That's nice'

Boy: 'Want to buy it?'

Man: 'No, thanks.'

Boy: 'My Dad's outside.'

Man: 'OK, how much?'

Boy: '$250' 
In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the lover are in the closet together. 
Boy: 'Dark in here.'
Man: 'Yes, it is.'
Boy: 'I have a baseball glove.'
The lover, remembering the last time , asks the boy, 'How much?' 
Boy: '$750'
Man: 'Sold.' 
A few days later, the Dad says to the boy, 'Grab your glove, let's go outside and have a game of catch.' 
The boy says, 'I can't, I sold my baseball and my glove.' 
The Dad asks, 'How much did you sell them for?' 
Boy: '$1,000' 
The Dad says, 'That's terrible to over charge your friends like that...that is way more than those two things cost. I'm taking you to church, to confession.' 
They go to the church and the Dad makes the little boy sit in the confessional booth and closes the door. 
The boy says, 'Dark in here.'

The trucker figured he was in the middle of nowhere and was feeling generous so he pulled over and told the black guy, ""You can have a ride, but I don't have any room in the cab, so you will have to ride in the back with the bowling balls. I'm in a hurry, so hop in.""


The black man, happy to have a ride, hops in the back.
A half hour passes before the truck driver is pulled over for speeding. The officer asks for his license and registration before saying he needs to take a look in the back. Eager to get back on the road, the trucker obliges. The officer opens the back, sees the black man, the bike, and the bowling balls before slamming the doors closed and telling the trucker to get the hell out of his state as fast as he can.

The truck speeds off and the cop gets back in his cruiser to find a confused partner.

His partner asks, ""What was that all about?""

The cop replies, ""You'll never believe it, but that lunatic was hauling a whole batch of nigger eggs and one had already hatched and stolen a bike!""",Truck driver just passing through,1

The man lands safely and takes a few strolls before leaving the pool with a relieved but also somewhat disappointed look on his face.

Man#2, still taking no chances, steps on the board and just as he leaps forward, whether out of disbelief about the situation or simply because he likes his potassium, shouts ""BANANAS!"". For a moment the world turns yellow-brown and the man safely lands in a pool full of soft, ripe bananas. Leaving the pool, he sees that everything around is covered with mushy bananas almost as a reminder to his stupid decision. 

Man#3, having observed all this, can't believe how stupid his comerades are. With a determined look on his face, he climbs up the ladder. He is a man that knows what he wants out of life and with the confidence of a man that deems himself superior to his peers, he approaches the edge, preparing his words. He is not going to ask for world peace, how would that even look in a pool? No, he is a pragmatic. Cold, hard cash is what he is after. He looks down to the empty pool, which magically is entirely clean unlike the surrounding area, which is still wet from the water and covered in destroyed fruit.

God labors for a week as only a being of such incredible omnipotence can labor, and after much exhausting work, he returns to Adam after a week has passed and reveals to him his creation.

Adam is speechless. After much gaping, he finally finds the words to say ""God, she is beautiful, she is truly your most perfect creation. I must ask though, what will this cost me, for surely this cannot be free.""

God says soberly ""My son. I confess, to have a being of such beauty and grace, you must give me an arm and a leg. I can accept no other payment.""

Adam weighs this for a moment, and then says, ""How much can I get for a rib?""
