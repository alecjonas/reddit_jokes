As they were running off campus towards the swamp, he instructed his players to do he did. As he stripped all his clothes, he shouted, ""This is to make you fearless!""

""This,"" he exclaimed, ""is how you show to your opponents you aren't afraid."" He landed a hard-swift blow on the alligator's nostrils and the alligator released him immediately scampering away. 

He pointed out Jake, the new quarterback. ""Now, you try!""

The villagers, who to the man's surprise are still alive and well, lavish him with praise. They think he must be a god! But he must first be tested, just to be sure.

So the chief of the village takes him to a row of three tents. Here, he explains, ""Oh Great One, to prove your status as a god and receive the wealth, ladies, and power you deserve, you must go into each tent and perform a challenge.

""In the first tent, you will find a keg of our strongest alcohol. You must drink the keg in its entirety!

""In the second tent, you will find a lioness. You must wrestle her to the ground and steal one of her fangs!

""In the third tent is a beautiful woman. You must sleep with her and prove your manliness!""

The man agrees. ""I mean, sure,"" the man thinks. ""Wrestling a lion will be tough. But if I can manage it, he'll have the three challenges in the bag, I'll make a ton of money off of whatever the villagers give me as tribute, and come back a hero! A *really* rich hero.""

So the chief and a crowd of curious villagers watch as the man enters the first tent.

After about an hour, the explorer steps out of the tent, weaving about as he walks, reeking of strong alcohol and sweat. With a drunken yell and a big, manly toss, he throws the empty keg to the ground, where it shatters, and the man immediately hiccups and falls over.

The chief runs over and helps the man to his feet. The man manages to stay upright on his own after a few wobbles, and says he was just testing the chief's compassion. The chief is skeptical, but lets it slide.

With another yell, and a confidence that can only come with too much drinking, the man runs into the second tent!!

Horrible sounds of roaring, shouting and snarling can be heard from outside the tent, the onlookers wide-eyed. The chief is sure the man won't make it out. On and on the yells and roars and grunts of pain continue, until everything falls into silence.

After a few minutes, the chief shakes his head as he looks at the other villagers. He sighs. ""The second challenge always gets them...""

But the flap covering the tent is pulled open. The man slowly walks out of the tent. He's covered in scratches, but still very much alive, and if possible, even more drunk than he was before. 

He's also completely naked.

It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."" The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50
The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.

First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.
Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.
First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.

Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""
Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

Now the next day he got a call that the grandmother had infact died. 

He was deeply troubled by this so the next night he listened in on his daughters prayers again. ""Dear lord I pray for mommy and daddy but aunt Jenny's gonna die"" so the dad called up aunt Jenny but she didn't pick up. Later it was found that she had also died.

The very disturbed dad went to listen to his daughter prayers again ""dear lord I pray for mommy but daddy's gonna die"" He was now utterly terrified. The next day at work he went about paranoid of everything around him trying to avoid anything that could possibly be harmful.

The exhausted dad gets home and tells his wife ""oh honey I had the worst day"" 

She replies ""you think you had a bad day, today the mailman dropped dead in the living room""

They had talked about everything. They had kept no secrets from each other except that the little old woman had a shoe box in the top of her closet that she had cautioned her husband never to open or ask her about. 

For all of these years, he had never thought about the box, 

But one day the little old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would not recover. 

In trying to sort out their affairs, the little old man took down the shoe box and took it to his wife's bedside. 

She agreed that it was time that he should know what was in the box. 

When he opened it, he found two crocheted dolls and a stack of money totaling $95,000. 

He asked her about the contents. 

'When we were to be married,' she said, 'my grandmother told me the secret of a happy marriage was to never argue. She told me that if I ever got angry with you, I should just keep quiet and crochet a doll.' 

The little old man was so moved; he had to fight back tears. Only two precious dolls were in the box. She had only been angry with him two times in all those years of living and loving. He almost burst with happiness. 

'Honey,' he said, 'that explains the dolls, but what about all of this money? Where did it come from?' 

'Oh,' she said, 'that's the money I made from selling the dolls.' ",The Shoe Box,3

He collected tractors for many years and had gotten quite the collection, a total of about 50+ tractors.

One day Bill was looking online at some tractors when he saw one that really caught his eye. A tractor made of solid gold! Bill knew he had to have it so he picked his best tractor and drove it all the way to the owners house in hopes of buying the magnificent golden tractor.

He arrives and speaks to the owner, offering him £100,000 for the tractor. The man refused, he said the tractor meant far too much to him. Bill then offered the man his entire collection of tractors in exchange for his golden tractor. The man said ""a very good offer, but no thank you""

Bill was furious, he needed that tractor! So he came back in the middle of the night and stole it and drove it back to his farm.

The next morning Bill was awoken by a loud knock at the door. He was greeted by 3 policemen standing with the owner of the golden tractor. Bill was sent to court and sentenced to 3 years in prison for the theft of the tractor and had his whole tractor collection taken away from him.

While in prison Bill had major withdrawal symptoms from his tractors, but as time went on, he learned to live without them. 

After 3 years he was released and he decided to go to his local pub. The bartender was complaining that it was too hot in the pub. Bill told the bartender that he could help him with his problem. The bartender said ""really? How?"" Bill told the bartender ""I'm a big extractor fan""",(LONG). There once was a farmer named Bill,2

Heck, no one thought he was even going to show up, considering how he didn’t show up to his 7th birthday party. He told us at school the next day that he was worried we were going to laugh at him for wearing some stupid birthday cone hat because it wasn’t shaped like a regular hat. Walter was always weird like that; he worried constantly that people judged every move he made, so he always stayed seated and started his homework while the rest of us were letting hell lose whenever the teacher turned his back. He was so boring that even his middle name was “Meh”.  
 
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I mean, he wasn’t a total loser- he was just blander than overcooked chicken. Mr. “meh” never made any jokes cause we might think they were a bust, he never dated anyone because he thought he might be disliked and he never walked out of his house unless it was to get to school or Sunday mass. I remember how we first met: it was back in Sister Adonit’s Kindergarten class and we had to come up and make up a sentence with a word provided by the teacher. For example, I started off the class with the word minor: “I fell and got a minor cut”  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The next person, Ralph Petrucio had the word girl, so he said “Walter identifies as a girl”. Although he got hit with Sister’s sweet meter stick of justice, everyone thought that he was hilarious because he actually did look like a girl. The next person up was Janet, with bicycle. Wanting to follow up Ralph’s joke, ends up saying:  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Walter is a bisexual”  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At this point we might as well have called Kindergarten “The Roast of Walter Lynn” because he was getting redder than the disgusting glop that the lunch ladies kept on insisting was meatloaf. I personally would have done the same if Ralph had came up with the idea before I went up. By the 7th sentence Walter had ran out of the room in tears, leaving behind him a trail that confused our Native American students from the actual one. The day after Sister had forced the class to apologize for acting like “heathens and pagans”, but the damage was already done: he never said another word in class for the next 9 years. We surprisingly became acquaintances because I didn’t think of making fun of him, which I believe was the smartest life choice I’ve ever made. Mr. “meh” always sent me his homework and test answers, resulting in me becoming the salutatorian. After our graduation, Walter claimed he was moving to Britain although someone spotted him hiding in his closet.  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Fastforwarding 20 years, he sent me a message on Facebook asking for the details about the Reunion. I was more surprised by the fact he wanted to come rather than the fact we haven’t spoken in forever. I assumed he was still hiding in his closet.  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So that brings us to the party, where he walked proudly in that fruit suit, catching the hearts of all the single ladies by the punch bar. He mouths towards me a thank you as he goes up and faces his archnemesis Ralph Petrucio.  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ralph chuckles “What are you supposed to be, a fruit?”  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Walter smirks “Ralph, I have grown up since kindergarten, and I won’t let you dictate who I am. From now on, I’m not going to identify as a girl or a bisexual. I wear this suit as I come out of the closet to pronounce that I identify as a Walter Meh Lynn!”

Standing in the bus line he runs into his friend Marty. Marty says, ""Jesus Bob, rough night? You look awful."" 
Bob replies, ""You know it's weird Marty, I know I look awful but I feel great.""
Bob gets on the bus, the bus driver gives him a look and shudders.
Bob gets off the bus, and goes into work. Macy the receptionist asks him if he is feeling alright. Bob says ""Don't worry about it I feel great!""
Bob drops his stuff off at his desk, turns his computer on and goes off to the coffee room to get a drink. There he runs into his co-worker Ahmed. ""Hey Bob, are we gonna have that.. holy Bob you look awful, you're not sick are you? Stay away from me I don't want to get sick!""
Bob says ""Ya ya don't worry about, I know I look awful but I feel great!""
Bob is now beginning to be get concerned. Maybe something is wrong. So he heads off to see his boss. ""Hey Mary, I think I might need to take the afternoon off to go see a doctor."" Mary, clearly looking concerned, say ""Don't wait until the afternoon, get yourself down to the clinic right away, you look awful!""
Bob finally gets into the walk-in to see the walk-in clinic doctor.
Doctor, ""Hello Bob, what seems to be the problem?""
Bob replies "" Well Doc I don't really know, it's really strange. I feel great, but everyone keeps telling me I look awful.""
The Dr. looks at him, does some tests, you know the regular check-up and looks stumped.
""Hmmm, I don't know it's a strange one, you clearly don't look good."" Pulls out a medical book and starts scanning through it muttering to himself ""Feels great, looks awful.

""Excuse me sir, would you like to have the bill?""
Stone faced the panda draws a gun and points it at the waiter who immediately puts his hands in the air with a terrified look on his face.
""Woah woah woah, relax man there is no need for the gun."" Another waiter approaches also in shock. ""Jesus man, please don't do anything stupid. We have some money in the back, you are free to take it all just put that gun away. Please just ..

""BANG!""

The first waiter stands in shock, he can hardly believe what has just happened. He reaches for the right side of his chest where the entry wound is starting to bleed profusely. The second waiter rushes to catch him as he collapses to the ground. ""Andy!""

The waiter, we now know to be named Andy finds that his hands have started shaking. One minute ago he was going about his day as usual but now suddenly he realizes these might be his final moments. His mind wanders to his girlfriend who is at home probably watching TV or looking at Facebook. His 5 year old son who has probably just gone to bed. Lying there thinking of all the things 5 year old's think of. What if he never makes it back to them.
Andy turn his head to the other waiter.

""Steve, you have to do something for me."" 
""Of course Andy, anything you want what is it?""
""My son, Danny. He's been talking about that he wants to go to Disney world since I can remember. I was going to take him, but I thought I had more time. Can you take him for me? To Disney world?""
""Andy of course I would but you are going to be OK, you are going to take him there yourself"".

Andy is looking back at Steve but his eyes start to wander and his pupils start to dilate. He's not moving anymore. He is dead, there is nothing that can be done now.

The Panda has lowered his gun and looks upon as Andy takes his last breaths. Steve looks up at the Panda, tears in his eyes and with a shaky voice he asks:
""Why?""

The Panda stands wide eyed and hesitates for a moment but then gathers his thoughts to speak.
""Well, ugh. A dictionary, you should look at a dictionary.""
A tear rolls down Steve's cheek as he gives the Panda a sad bewildered frown.
""What the hell are you talking about? There is no dictionary here, why would I go look at a dictionary?""

The Panda looks around at the people who had been eating dinner but now they stare at him with frightened looks. He looks at the two waiters on the floor. One of them dead, the other holding his dead friend with a sorrowful look.

""Well i'm a panda and in the dictionary it says about pandas: eats shoots and leaves.""
The panda hesitates as he feels all eye's are on him but nobody is laughing.

""Ugh, never mind. This sounded a lot funnier in my head as I was driving over here.""",[OC] A panda walks into a restaurant.,1
