After I retired, my wife insisted that I accompany her on her trips to Sainsbury's.
Unfortunately, like most men, I found shopping boring and preferred to get in and get out. Equally unfortunate, my wife is like most women - she loves to browse.
Yesterday my dear wife received the following letter from the local Sainsbury's...

Dear Mrs. Harris,
Over the past six months, your husband has caused quite a commotion in our store. We cannot tolerate this behaviour and have been forced to ban both of you from the store. Our complaints against your husband, Mr. Harris, are listed below and are documented by our video surveillance cameras:

1. June 15: He took 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in other people's carts when they weren't looking.

2. July 2: Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5- minute intervals.

3. July 7: He made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the women's restroom.

4. July 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an official voice, 'Code 3 in Housewares. Get on it right away'. This caused the employee to leave her assigned station and receive a reprimand from her Supervisor that in turn resulted with a union grievance, causing management to lose time and costing the company money.

5. August 4: Went to the Service Desk and tried to reserve a bag of Maltesers.

6. August 14: Moved a 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area.

7. August 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told the children shoppers they could come in if they would bring pillows and blankets from the bedding department - to which twenty children obliged.

8. August 23: When a clerk asked if they could help him he began crying and screamed, 'Why can't you people just leave me alone?' Emergency Medics were called.

9. September 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose.

10. September 10: While handling guns in the Sports department, he asked the clerk where the antidepressants were.

11. October 3: Darted around the Store suspiciously while loudly humming the 'Mission Impossible' theme.

12. October 6: In the auto department, he practiced his 'Madonna look' by using different sizes of funnels.

13. October 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed through, yelled 'PICK ME! PICK ME!'

14. October 22: When an announcement came over the loud speaker, he assumed the fetal position and screamed 'OH NO! IT'S THOSE VOICES AGAIN!

15. Took a box of condoms to the checkout clerk and asked where the fitting room was.

And last, but not least:
16. October 23: Went into a fitting room, shut the door, waited awhile, and then yelled very loudly, 'Hey! There's no toilet paper in here.' One of the Staff passed out.",Shopping with Wife,47

'Yes. But that doesn't matter. What matters is that both my parents were on it at the time,' he said, glumly.

'I'm so sorry, lad. What were their names?'

'Robert and Dorothy. Do you mind if we slow down the ship for a while when I say so that I can have a prayer for them? I want to apologise for how I neglected them.'

'Of course, son. I'll join you as well.'

So the captain and the wealthy man went to the side of the ship and looked down into the sea.

'Mom and Dad, I'm so sorry for neglecting you. You brought me up, helped me get to where I am but I failed to show any appreciation. I thought so much of myself when buying a 12 million pound yacht, but never did I consider your roll in-'

Then she tells me she has a room at the Sheraton less than 50 steps from our table. She suggested we get some privacy while pulling me by the hand. Now I'm in her room....clothes are flying ...... the talking stopped....and we proceeded to have sex in every way imaginable. It must have gone on for hours, because before I know it the clock says 5:30. ...... I jumped up, threw my clothes on, ran to the car, and here I am. ............ There. You wanted the truth....you got it.

She looked down... and saw her husband was holding a battery-operated pleasure device... a vibrator!

Soft, wonderful and larger than a real one.

She went completely ballistic.

The little girl said, ""I don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do.""

The next day grandpa died. 
The father thought it was a strange coincidence.

A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this, ""God bless Mommy, God Bless Daddy and good-bye Grandma.""

The next day the grandmother died.

""Holy crap"" thought the father, ""this kid is in contact with the other side.""

Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say, ""God bless Mommy and good-bye Daddy.""

He practically went into shock. He couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office. 

He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay. 

He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

When he got home his wife said, ""I've never seen you work so late. What's the matter?""

He said, ""I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of my life.""

During the tour they pass a corridor with a strange sound coming from the far end. The guy asks the monk what the sound is.

""I'm afraid I can't tell you that because you're not a monk"", the monk replies.

So they continue their tour and after it's finished the guy decides he will become a monk and is initiated into the monastery. After a few weeks he walks past the corridor again and hears the sound. So he goes to the head monk and says

""I'm a monk now, can you tell me what the sound is""

""I won't tell you what it is"", says the monk, ""but you can go and see""

So the guy sets off down the corridor. After a while he comes to a locked door so he goes to the monk and says

""There's a door, can I have the key?""

So the monk gives him the key and he sets off back down the corridor. He gets to the door and unlocks it and continues down the corridor. However he come to a second door, also locked, so he goes back to the monk and gets the key to the second door. And he goes down the corridor but he's forgotten the key to the first door, so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the first door but he's forgotten the key to the second door. So he gets the key to the second door and he opens the second door and he continues down the corridor. However he soon comes to yet another door so he goes back to the monk and gets the key to the third door.

And he goes down the corridor but he's forgotten the key to the first door so he gets the key to the first door but he's forgotten the key to the second door so he gets the key to the second door but he's forgotten the key to the third door so he gets the key to third door and he opens the third door and he continues down the corridor. However, he comes to a pool and he realises he will have to swim underwater to get across. Not knowing how far it is he goes back to the monk who gives him an aqualung.

And he goes back down the corridor but he's forgotten the key to the first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the first door but he's forgotten the key to the second door so he gets the key to the second door and he opens the second door but he's forgotten the key to the third door so he gets the key to the third door and he opens the third door but he's forgotten the aqualung so he gets the aqualung and he swims across the pool and when he surfaces on the other side he is faced with a fourth door. So he goes back to the monk and gets the key to the fourth door.

And he goes down the corridor but he's forgotten the key to the first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the first door but he's forgotten the key to the second door so he gets the key to the second door and he opens the second door but he's forgotten the key to third door so he gets the key to the third door and he opens the third door but he's forgotten the aqualung so he gets the aqualung and he swims across the pool but he's forgotten the key to the fourth door so he gets the key to fourth door and he opens the fourth door and he finds himself in a pitch black room. He can tell this is where the noise is coming from but he can't see what it is so he goes back to the monk and gets a torch.

And he goes down the corridor but he's forgotten the key to the first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the first door but he's forgotten the key to the second door so he gets the key to the second door and he opens the second door but he's forgotten the key to the third door so he gets the key to the third door and he opens the third door but he's forgotten the aqualung so he gets the aqualung and he swims across the pool but he's forgotten the key to the fourth door so he gets the key to the fourth door and he opens the fourth door but he's forgotten the torch so he gets the torch and he goes into the room and flicks on the torch. But he doesn't see anything because the torch has no flame. So he goes to the monk and he gets some matches.

And he goes down the corridor but he's forgotten the key to the first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the first door but he's forgotten the key to the second door so he gets the key to the second door and he opens the second door but he's forgotten the key to the third door so he gets the key to the third door and he opens the third door but he's forgotten the aqualung so he gets the aqualung and he swims across the pool (having crossed the pool so many times he decides he probably didn't actually need the aqualung in the first place) but he's forgotten the key to the fourth door so he gets the key to the fourth door and right before he opens the fourth door, he drops all his keys, matches, and his torch down the drain.

So he gets the key to the first door and he opens the first door but he's forgotten the key to the second door. So he gets the key to the second door and he opens the second door and he continues down the corridor. However he soon comes to yet another door so he goes back to the monk and gets the key to the third door.

And he goes down the corridor but he's forgotten the key to the first door so he gets the key to the first door but he's forgotten the key to the second door so he gets the key to the second door but he's forgotten the key to the third door so he gets the key to third door and he opens the third door and he continues down the corridor. Now that he made it to the pool again he decides he doesn't need the aqualung.

He ponders on the idea of going back for the aqualung for a few days, but then finally decides he would ponder more, and leaves to go get food because he hasn't eaten in a week. He goes to his favorite local burger joint, and orders a McChicken. But he realizes he forgot his money at the other side of the pool, so he goes back, asks for the aqualung, swims to the other side, grabs his money, swims back, and gives back the aqualung. He then goes back to his favorite local burger joint and orders a McChicken. ""Oh, we don't have that sir,"" says the cashier. ""Would you like fries with that?"" No thank you, says the budding monk. Five minutes later he grabs the philly cheese steak with fries he ordered, and goes back to the pool to ponder more. When he gets there, he drops his philly cheese steak and fries down the drain.

He then goes back to his favorite local burger joint, and orders a McChicken. But he realizes he forgot his money at the other side of the pool, so he goes back, asks for the aqualung, swims to the other side, grabs his money, swims back, and gives back the aqualung. He then goes back to his favorite local burger joint and orders a McChicken. ""Oh, we don't have that sir,"" says the cashier. ""Would you like fries with that?"" No thank you, says the budding monk. Five minutes later he grabs the philly cheese steak with fries he ordered, and goes back to the pool to ponder more. He then decides he will go back for the aqualung, and heads back to ask for it.

But on his way back to the pool he's forgotten the key to the first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the first door but he's forgotten the key to the second door so he gets the key to the second door and he opens the second door but he's forgotten the key to the third door so he gets the key to the third door and he opens the third door but he's forgotten to ever even ask for the aqualung so he gets the aqualung and he swims across the pool and when he surfaces on the other side he gets to the fourth door again. So he goes back to the monk and gets the key to the fourth door but he's forgotten the torch so he gets the torch and he goes into the room and flicks on the torch. But he doesn't see anything because the torch has no flame. So he goes to the monk and he gets some matches.

And he goes down the corridor but he's forgotten the key to the first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the first door but he's forgotten the key to the second door so he gets the key to the second door and he opens the second door but he's forgotten the key to the third door so he gets the key to the third door and he opens the third door but he's forgotten the aqualung so he gets the aqualung and he swims across the pool (having crossed the pool so many times he decides he probably didn't actually need the aqualung in the first place) but he's forgotten the key to the fourth door so he gets the key to the fourth door and he's forgotten the torch so he gets the torch and he goes into the room and he lights up the torch and he sees ...

well, I'm afraid I can't tell you that because you're not a monk. But I can tell you that that McChicken was good.

They grill him about where he has been and he tells them he has been to every single country already except the US.

The US agents are suspicious of him so they ask him to call someone from each country to verify his claims.  Jesus tells them they are being foolish and stressed the importance of letting him into the US.  However, the agents insist he will be deported if he does not comply.

The agents seize his phone and start looking through it.  After looking at all of Jesus' pictures of cute cats, they scan through his contact list, which is full of the names of every country in the world.  Feeling ever more suspicious of this Middle Easterner, they call the first number.  No response at all.  Then they call the second, and third, still no response.  As they prepare to call the fourth, another agent bursts into the room shouting for the other agents to stop making calls because the phone is setting off explosions.

They hang up abruptly and look around and see a giant ball of fire outside.  The agents rush into Jesus' cell and wrangle him to the ground, placing him under arrest.  Jesus asks what is wrong.

""You terrorist bastard! You think you will get away with this?!  You tricked us into setting off these explosions!""

""Those are not explosions from bombs.  It is The Rapture.""  All of the agents' faces turned pale white.  ""I told you guys this was urgent.""

""Why didn't you just tell us instead of giving us a fake phone?"" One of the agents shouted.

""You took my phone without asking.  Those were real numbers of all the world leaders.  I exchanged my information with every leader in case my instructions regarding the Rapture weren't clear and they needed to reach me.""

""But then why did no one answer when we called?""

""Because everyone else simply followed my instructions and have already left.""",Jesus returns to Earth but is stopped in the US by the immigration ban.,0

""Father, may I borrow this horse?""

""Yes, you may, but you must know this...""

""What, Father?""

""The horse only goes when you say Hallelujah, and stops when you say Praise the Lord.""

The priest lets the man borrow the horse, but he didn't pay attention to what he said. Despite that, he makes his trip to the apple orchard.

While he knew how to make the horse go, he didn't know how to make it stop. He flies past all the trees in the orchard and doesn't know how to stop the seemingly crazed horse. He panics quickly.

""What did that priest say to do?""

He quickly remembers. 

""Oh, right!""

""PRAISE THE LORD!""

He comes to a close stop to the Clift at the end of the orchard, relieved.

You see, we grew up in the poor part of town, although his dad worked hard and provided, where mine was not around much and when he was my mom always yelled at him to find a permanent job. As a child I remember showing up to his house every day before school and would get fed, breakfast wasn't a regular thing at my house. We would eat cereal, fruit loops was his favorite, honey nut cheerios mine. Things all changed when we entered high school though. Sam started hanging around with a different crowd of kids, using drugs, and shoplifting from local convenience stores. He never got caught until one day when he was convinced to break into a warehouse.

Sam decided to bring two large cans (barrels really) with him to this heist. He broke in through the roof (ironically, it was a cereal factory they targetted) and he scooped up everything he could find (office supplies, work equipment, expensive looking small machinery) and stuffed into the cans. In case someone caught him leaving (and for a snack later), he threw a bunch of fruit loops on top of the stolen goods. Well all did not go as planned and when he exited through a back door alarms went off, police arrived, and Sam was arrested on site, with two cans full of stolen fruit loops. And that is why we now call him, two-can-Sam.

Her mother replies: ""Don´t worry hunny. It runs in the family. All you have to do is go to the butcher´s tomorrow. Buy some liver and place it in your vagina before you make love. It worked for me and I´ve been married for 50 years.""
The daughter figured she had nothing to lose so she went to the butcher, bought the liver and delicately placed it inside her.

That night they make love for 8 hours. Amazing, incredible sex. The next morning the woman awakes to find a note from her new husband. It read:

""My darling, last night was the most trascendental, incredible, amazing experience of my life. I can´t believe I didn´t wake you with the sound of my heartbeat. I adore you so. I am gone to work to make money for you so I can buy you a big house. A picket fence. All the roses in the world. All the diamonds you desire. I want to grow old with you. Kids. Grandkids. I want to thank god for this gift to me. I don´t deserve you. You are an angel sent to make me happy and I never want to spend a day without looking into your beautiful eyes.
Your loving husband, always.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President trump,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, trump spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'

The man quickly run to the telephone and called the police. He whispered in to the Telephone ”You have to come as fast as possible. Three guys are stealing all the things out of my carport. I live in at 123 Joke Drive.“ The Officer answered.:” I’m sorry but all Officers in the whole city are out of order. We are sending a patrol to your house as fast as possible.”

The man was upset about this. Then he decided to count till 50. After he finished he takes the telephone and called the Police again and said:” You don’t have to send a Patrol anymore. I shoot the Robbers. Except of one but I will get him.” And hung up. After 5 minutes the whole house is surrounded with Policeman’s and they caught the Robbers at the moment they wanted to leave.

As the squad leader went to the man he asked him: “don’t you said you shot two of them?” as the man replied “don’t you said all Officers are out of order?”

He took a sip of the drink, his wife took a sip and then set the cup down between them. As he began to eat his few bites of hamburger, the people around them were looking over and whispering.

Obviously they were thinking, 'That poor old couple - all they can afford is one meal for the two of them.'

People closer to the table noticed the little old lady hadn't eaten a bite. She
sat there watching her husband eat and occasionally taking turns sipping the drink..

Again, the young man came over and begged them to let him buy another meal for them. This time the old woman said 'No, thank you, we are used to sharing everything.'

While he was standing in front of the gorilla's enclosure, he noticed the gorilla watching him intently. The man waved at the gorilla, the gorilla waved back. He patted his stomach and the gorilla copied him. He jumped up and down, the gorilla started jumping. He made faces, pulled his hair, hopped on one foot, spun in a circle, and beat on his chest. His antics were copied exactly by the gorilla in the cage.

All of a sudden the wind gusted and he got some grit in his eye. Mr. Goldberg rubbed his eye, trying to make it better. While doing so he stepped closer and closer to the cage. As he pulled his eyelid down to dislodge the particle, the gorilla went crazy, banged against the bars, reached out, grabbed the nearly blinded Goldberg and beat him senseless. When the zoo keeper came to Mr. Goldberg, he told the keeper what had happened. The zoo keeper nodded and explained that in gorilla language pulling down your eyelid means ""fuck you.""

The explanation didn't make the gorilla's victim feel any better but he accepted it. As he left he became madder and madder. He plotted his revenge. The next day he purchased two large knives, two party hats, two party horns, and a large sausage. Putting the sausage in his pants, he hurried to the zoo and over to the gorilla's cage, into which he tossed a hat, a knife, and a party horn.

Knowing that the big ape liked to mimic people, he put on a party hat. The gorilla looked at him, and looked at the hat, and put it on. Next he picked up his horn and blew on it. The gorilla picked up his horn and did the same. He twirled in a circle blowing the horn. The gorilla did the same. Then Goldberg picked up his knife and waved it over his head. Again the gorilla copied it. Next he whipped the sausage out of his pants, and sliced it neatly in two. The gorilla looked at the knife in his big hairy hand, looked at his own crotch, and pulled down his eyelid.",Mr Goldberg and the Gorilla,4

Sure, they said, you’re welcome.

So they started playing and enjoyed the game and the company of the newcomer. Part way around the course, one of the friends asked the newcomer,

""What do you do for a living?""

I’m a hit man,"" was the reply.

""You're joking!” was the response.

""No, I'm not,"" he said, reaching into his golf bag, and pulling out a beautiful Martini sniper's rifle with a large telescopic sight. ""Here are my tools.""

That's a beautiful telescopic sight,” said the other friend, ""Can I take a look? I think I might be able to see my house from here"".

So he picked up the rifle and looked through the sight in the direction of his house.

""Yeah, I can see my house all right. ""This sight is fantastic. I can see right in the window. Wow, I can see my wife in the bedroom"".

""Ha Ha, I can see she's naked!! Wait a minute, that's my neighbor in there with her......He's naked, too!!! The bitch!""

He turned to the hit man. “How much do you charge for a hit?""

""I'll do a flat rate, for you: One thousand dollars every time I pull the trigger.""

""Can you do two for me now?""

“Sure, what do you want?”

""First, shoot my wife; she's always been mouthy, so shoot her in the mouth. Then the neighbor, he's supposed to be a friend of mine, so just shoot his dick off to teach him a lesson.""

The hit man took the rifle and took aim, standing perfectly still for a few minutes.

“Are you gonna do it or not?"" asked the friend impatiently.

""Just be patient,"" said the hit man calmly . . . . . ""I think I can save ya a grand here.""

It has sex with all 150 of the farmer's hens and the farmer is impressed with how virile it seems to be.  
The next day, the farmer heads into the barn to see the rooster having sex with all the hens again, madly going at it. He's taken aback by this behaviour but figures it'll help ensure more fertilised eggs, so he lets the rooster keep at it.
He isn't worried until the following day when he catches the rooster having sex with all his ducks and geese and any other bird on the farm.
On the 3rd day of owning the rooster, the farmer walks out into the yard to find the rooster lying dead on the ground with vultures circling high above.
""Can't say that you don't deserve it, you horny little bastard,"" the farmer laments, as he goes to pick up the rooster's corpse.  
Just then, the rooster opens an eye and says: ""Go away! They're about to land!""",A chicken farmer buys a new rooster. . .,137

A long read, but worth the journey if you can spare the time...


There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

/ till the ocean grew dim...

and the earth itself...

began to shrink...

past our moon...

and on...

and Mars...

and on...

higher, and higher...

through the asteroid belt...

and on and on towards the diving board...

past the outer planets, until...

on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...

he reached the board.

He climbed on top and radioed the captain...

and then...

.' '. . . . . he jumped. . . . . : Slowly at first, : but speeding up, : : : faster, and faster, : speeding past Pluto, : and the other outer planets, . . . . .

.

.

.

.

through the asteroid belt,

past Mars,

and the moon,

faster,

and faster,

faster - ever faster,

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster,

past the albatross,

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

DOWN!

THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!

THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL.........

SMASH!

Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping...

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most STUPENDOUS piece of diving I have ever seen.""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...

I'm a just poor tramp...

so you must understand...

I've been through many a hard ship in my life.""",Tramps holiday,362

A large group of Isis fighters in Iraq are moving down a road when they hear a voice call from behind a sand dune: ""One British Para is better than ten Isis fighters"". The Isis commander quickly orders 10 of best men over the dune where a gun battle breaks out and continues for a few minutes, then silence.

The voice once again calls out: ""One Para is better than one hundred Isis 'S.O.B.'s'"". Furious, the Isis commander sends his next best 100 troops over the dune and instantly a huge gun fight commences. After 10 minutes of battle, again silence.

The voice calls out again: ""One Para is better than a thousand Isis fighters."" The enraged Isis commander musters 1,000 fighters and sends them to the other side of the dune. Rifle fire, machine guns, grenades, rockets and cannon fire ring out as a terrible battle is fought ..... then silence.

Eventually, one badly wounded Isis fighter crawls back over the dune and with his dying words tells his commander, ""Don't send any more men ... it's a trap. There's two of them.""

Thought this was good.

Tonight, I thought Bob was acting weird. We had made plans to
meet at a nice restaurant for dinner.

I was shopping with my friends all day long; and I was a little late
for our ""date.""

Conversation wasn't flowing, so I thought he was upset at the fact that
I was a bit late; but he made no comment on it.So I suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we could talk. He agreed,but he didn't say much. I asked him what was wrong;

He said, 'Nothing.' I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset.

He said he wasn't upset, that it had nothing to do with me, and not to
worry about it.

On the way home, I told him that I loved him. He smiled slightly, and
kept driving.

I can't explain his behavior I don't know why he didn't say, 'I loveyou, too.'

When we got home, I felt as if I had lost him completely, as if he
wanted nothing to do with me anymore.

He just sat there quietly, and watched TV.

He continued to seem distant and absent.Finally, with silence all around us, I decided to go to bed. 

About 15 minutes later, he came to bed.But I still felt that he was distracted, and his thoughts were somewhere else.

He fell asleep - I cried. I don't know what to do. I'm almost sure that
his thoughts are with someone else. My life is a disaster.

Yes, she says, “I remember it well.”

OK, he says, “How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time’s sake?”

“Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!”

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle, he thinks to himself, I’ve got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I’ll just keep an eye on them so there’s no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn’t know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I’ve got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, “Excuse me, but that was something else. You must’ve had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?”

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,”Fifty years ago that wasn’t an electric fence.”",Sex like you are 50 years younger!,568

They come to the last house on the last street in a little neighborhood. A beautiful blonde woman answers the door wearing nothing but a towel. The first man pleas with the woman for some food. ""We have been walking for days looking for food, please let us have something to eat! We will do anything."" The blonde woman looks them both up and down and finally says, ""Fine, I will let you have all the food in my fridge if one of you comes in and fucks me."" And she turns slowly and walks up stairs. The two guys stare at each other in disbelief. They argue about who is going to get to have all the fun but finally decide to ""rock-paper-scissors"". The first guy wins and promises to the other guy that he will bring all the food out after wards and we will eat like kings! Then he sprints inside and scrambles up the stairs after the gorgeous woman. 

When he enters the bedroom, she is laying on the bed with the towel still on. ""Are you ready?"", she purrs. The guy starts drooling and nods while starting to get undressed. The woman rips off the towel and spreads her legs. The guy freezes, and stares. Her pussy was covered in in a huge scab covered in pustules that were cracking and bleeding flowing with puss. The musty, putrid smell hit him a few seconds later and and almost made him gag. He composed himself and thought, ""Man, I haven't had sex in 15 years, it can't be that bad, I mean it at least has to be warm."" So he rips off the scab and throws it out the window and goes to pound town. 

*3 hours later*

The first guy comes stumbling out of the house with his arms laden with food. There's a full ham and turkey and sandwiches and bread and everything that he can carry. And he runs stumbling over to the other guy who is resting in the shade of a nearby tree and exclaims, ""We can eat like kings!"" The second guy responds, ""Nah, I am pretty full,"" he said with a happy face, ""I ate that pizza you threw out the window.""

After many referrals, it was concluded that castration would be the only way to cure him.  After his surgery, he was frustrated and depressed.  While cured of his problem, he no longer felt whole.  In his depressed state, he wandered by a store with a large sign in front: ""Our suits will fit you perfectly or it's free!""  Figuring he had nothing to lose, maybe a new suit would be the thing to perk him back up.

The owner and tailor, an older gentleman named Fabricio, welcomed him into the store.

""I'd like a new suit, please."" Tom said. ""And is it true if it doesn't fit perfectly it will be free?

""Of course, sir, guaranteed!""  Fabricio gleefully exclaimed.  ""I'll start with your jacket.  Let's see... I'm thinking that you are a 42 long.""

Surprised, Tom said, ""That's right!""  Fabricio handed him a brand new jacket and what do you know, it fit perfectly.  His confidence growing, Tom asked for a new shirt to go with it.

Fabricio stepped back and looked at him carefully.  ""Let's see... 34 sleeves and...16 and a half neck.""  Fabricio opened a cabinet and pulled out a beautiful shirt with those exact specifications and handed it to Tom.  Eagerly, Tom put the shirt on and felt his pride swell.  Not only fit perfectly, but it was the most flattering thing he had ever worn.

""Wow!"" Tom exclaimed.  ""This is fantastic!  How about some new shoes?""

""Very good, sir!  And you are..."" Fabricio stepped back, focus on his face, ""A size 10, wide width.""  Fabricio left but returned as quickly as he had gone, bringing back a shiny and beautiful pair of dress shoes.

Tom stepped in them and felt like he was standing on a cloud.  ""I am blown away with how talented you are!  How about some new underwear?""

""Right away sir!"" Fabricio stepped back, took a moment, and then said, ""Size 36!""

This was Tom's chance. ""Actually, I'm a size 32.  Looks like you owe me a free suit!""

Fabricio was stunned.  ""Oh, no, no, no, sir.  Not for you.  If you wore underwear that size, it would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache."" ",[Long] Tom was having increasingly bad headaches as he got older...,20

When he came out, she was naked under a thin bedsheet. He approached her with the caution of a timid yet distrustful rodent. She trembled with excitement and anticipation. They locked eyes. He studied her face with growing tenderness. She closed her eyes and leaned closer. His lips were inches from hers.

He is promptly judged as worthy and let in. John is led to his old childhood home and sees his wife waiting for him on the front porch, looking as beautiful as the day he met her. He's delighted to see her and they embrace. 

So they spend the next few weeks frolicking though heaven, meeting the many other residents, and exploring. Then, John notices something weird. Other people seem to see things differently. For instance, his wife sees all the flowers he gives her as roses, her favorites. Or how a new vegan friend commented on how happy he was that there was no meat in heaven, while John had a burger the night before. 

John eventually figures out that heaven would shift to suit the individual. Things they like would appear and things they didn't would appear differently. He shares the hypothesis with his wife, who tells him she'd figured the same thing.

Soon after this discovery, John and his wife are walking and they get separated. He sets off to find her and stumbles upon a massive wall. He tries to find an opening but it's just a big circle with no entrance. He's so curious that he decides to scale it. When he gets to the top, John sees what looks to be just another part of heaven. As he's about to go over, a hand grabs him by the ankle and pulls him back outside the wall.

The man explains, ""Today has just been the worst.  I got fired from my job, and since i came home early, I found my wife cheating on me with my brother.  While we were arguing, he said he came over to tell me our father had died, and it just happened.  I was so furious I stormed out and came here.  Give me a beer.""

The bartender gives the man a beer and he takes it and walks to the jukebox.  He was surprised, however, when he noticed next to the jukebox was a glass box, locked and chained up, containing $1 Million dollars.

""Bartender,"" the man asked, ""What's this $1 million dollars for?""

""Oh, that's for whoever can complete our three impossible bar challenges."" the bartender said while cleaning a glass.

""What are the challenges?""

""Well,"" the bartender set the glass down, ""First, you gotta hop in the ring with Mike Tyson and survive for 10 rounds.  Second, you gotta go in that back room there, and pull the decaying tooth out of the mouth of a rabid honey badger.  Third, you gotta go upstairs and have sex with my 90 year old grandmother because she's on her deathbed and, frankly, she could use it.""

The man thinks about it for a minute, downs his beer, and says, ""I'll do it, let's go.""

They go out back and waiting in a boxing ring is Mike Tyson throwing thunderous lefts and rights.  The man takes a deep gulp and starts to second guess himself, but before he realizes it, he's got gloves on and he's in the ring.  Tyson is just toying with him early, but in the third round, the man gets an idea.

""Mike, your shoe is untied.""

""Huh?"" Tyson looks down at his boots and WHAM!  The man hits him with an uppercut and knocks him out cold.

The bartender clapped loudly.  ""Congratulations!  You're the first person to past the first test!  Now, on to the Honey Badger!""

The bartender leads the man to a room off to the side of the bar and opens the door.  Strapped to the bench is a honey badgers flailing and screeching and foaming at the mouth.  The bartender slaps the man on the shoulder and says, ""Good luck."" as he shuts the door behind him and returns to his bar.  

From the room, the bartender hears the man screaming and yelling in pain, and the honey badger howling and screeching for a good 10 minutes before finally there's silence.  The man emerges from the room covered in scratches and bleeding, but with a huge smile on his face.

""Dear Ronald J. Kse,

This year we have chosen you to be the host of this year's harvest reap! All you need to do is provide your humble farm as the place of the party, and we will all provide.

Thanks, your neighbors""

Now, Ronald had really enjoyed last year's party, so he was delighted to be the host for this year.

After a grand day of eating, drinking, and merrymaking, All of Ronald's neighbors left - without helping clean up.

""That's fine, its just one party, and I've done the same other years"" said Ron.

Fast forward the next year, Ron was looking forward to this year's harvest, and the celebration that would follow.

After attending this year's anonymous vote, he gets another letter in the mail.

""Dear Mr. Kse,
 After the amazing time everyone had last year, the vote was decided again for you to be the host! We look forward to seeing you again, and thank you.""

Ron sighs, but thinks ""Yeah, last year's party was pretty great. I guess the cleanup wasn't too bad. No worries.""

Again, he gathered with his neighbors, and they feasted and drank themselves silly... but there were twice as many people this year. Friends, family, friends of family were all invited...

The cleanup was far worse this year. ""But,"" Ron thought, ""there's no way I'll get it three years in a row.""

Next year, Ron's sister was visiting, and went with him to check the mail. She handed him a very lavish envelope, garnished with golden filigree and laden with caligraphy.

She exclaimed ""Wow! This is beautiful! It must be something very wonderful and important!""

""No... I've seen this before... It's another fucking reap host..."" said R. Joe Kse

Yes, she says, “I remember it well.”

“Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!”

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle, he thinks to himself, I’ve got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I’ll just keep an eye on them so there’s no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn’t know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I’ve got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, “Excuse me, but that was something else. You must’ve had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?”

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,”Fifty years ago that wasn’t an electric fence.”",An elderly couple is sitting in a diner...,139
