""Can you build an airplane out of concrete?""  
""That's going to be very difficult.""  
""I don't care how difficult. Can you?""  
""That will cost $3 bln. and will take 3 years"".   
""OK, fine"".

3 years and $3 bln later, on time and money, he comes to inspect the work. There is a stock 737, all aluminum, titanium and steel, sitting on the runway, with ""concrete airlines"" written on the side.

""What's this?""  
""That's a concrete airplane, sir""  
""Where is the concrete, then?""  
""Well, you see, regulations, safety, standards, all this... We made some knobs and economy cabin toilet out of concrete... Our lawyer says we can reasonably claim this is a concrete airplane.""  
""Nonsense!"" - replies the billionaire and storms off.

Next, he goes to a Russian company.  
""Can you build me an airplane out of concrete?""  
""Hors'sheet, vat kind of idiot bilts planes out of conkrit?""  
""So you can't?""  
""Me can't? Pfft. There is nothing Russia can't. 100 million american dollars and two years. Come see me after zat"".

$150M and 2 years, 6 months, 2 weeks and 3 days later they are finally ready for the demo. There is a concrete highway, 10 miles long, with rails on top of it, and a train outfitted with jet engines.

""What's this? Where is my airplane?!""  
""Kome down, this is like airplain but without vings and better! Our great inginir, Boris, kom viz a greit idea! Knokrit havy, konkrit stay on ze graund, see? Our invention uses magnetik levitacion and djet trust to fly over konkirt very low. It go as fast as air plane, it iz very eekonomik,very reliabl', very indistructibl', and u vil make a lot of dollars selling konkrit for the tracks.""  
""Well, that's fascinating, guys, but it is not an airplane"" - replies the billionaire and goes home.

Finally, he decides to call an Indian company.  
""Can you build me an airplane out of concrete?""  
""Congratulations! You are very lucky to call us! We are the world leader in building concrete airplanes!""  
""WTF, really? Can I see one?""  
""We build a lot of them! But they are all sold! We can show you one after we build it for you!""  
""Uh, I see. How much?""  
""10 million dollars and one year precisely!""

Two years and twenty millions later, they are finally ready. There is an airplane indeed. All concrete. There are wooden studs holding wings, some workers a caulking cracks frantically.

""Whoa! What's this?""  
""Your airplane sir! All solid concrete! Are you happy?""  
""Wait, what? Solid? How do people and pilots get in?""  
""No people or pilots needed, because it is solid concrete!""  
""Uhm... How does it fly then?""  
""Fly?.."" (sags)   
""Yes, airplanes usually fly. Does this one fly?""  
""Most definitely!"" (bobs the head)   
""Does this mean ""Yes"" or ""No""?""   
""Uhm... Our senior concrete airplane specialist Rama will answer this question!""   
""We are aware of the issue, and working to resolve it""

Week passes.

""So?""  
""I am so sorry, but Rama is out sick.""  
""Who gives! Did you make it fly or not?""  
""... Most definitely! But I have great news for you! We found a solution! We mounted a big steel ring on the nose!""  
""Sorry, I don't follow...""  
""You see, our American partner now sells Russian flying concrete trains. You can buy one, tie it to the ring and haul your airplane with it!""",An extravagant billionaire made his fortunes selling concrete. Life got lavish and boring. One day he gets in an argument with another bored gentleman about the possibility of creating a flying airplane out of concrete.

He announce: ""I just discovered a magic spell that can prevent every suffering from any fall damage, but to prove it, I need someone to fall from this building saying very, very, quickly *I am a ball*"".

At this point everyone is intrigued by the boy, but nobody wants to risk his life for a spell that maybe doesn't work either, so the young Wizard decides to jump off himself.

So he jumps from the top of the skyscraper and starts repeating *I'm a ball I'm a ball I'm a ball I'm a ball I'm a ball I'm a ball I'm a ball*, and as soon as he reaches the ground he bounces back to the top of the skyscraper.

Now everyone believes him and one of the oldest Wizards immediately says: ""Can I try it too?"" ""Sure!"" responds the boy.

Without hesitation the old man jumps off the building and starts saying: ""*I'm a ball I'm a ball I'm a ball I'm a ball I'm a ball I'm a ball, wait, what if I am a tomato?""

The Daltons were a typical suburban, white, upper-middle-class family. Mr. Dalton was the owner of a succesfull engineering firm downtown. He had a beautiful wife, two lovely children, and a sweet Mercedes in his two-door garage. The second family, the Millers, were not as financially well-off, coming from Detroit a few years earlier. They didn't have the nicest home on the block, but they were a happy family nonetheless, and Mr. Miller enjoyed his job of running the liquor store downtown.

One day, after spending some time with the Miller's son, Timmy, Mr. Daltons son, asked his father why the Millers didn't have as big as house as they did.

Mr. Dalton sighed, and decided to relay to his son, the difficulties of financial inequality.

""You see, Timmy.. Some people,"" He started, ""because of their background, education, criminal records, or anything else really, they may find it difficult to find work in order to earn money. It's just how the world is now, but that doesn't mean the Millers are any worse than we are. No, and remember don't go telling anybody either. These topics are generally not talked about with others. Understand?""

Timmy was confused. ""Not really Dad, at my age I have yet to truly grasp the complexities of financial inequality between citizens regardless of occupation. Although I understand the importance of demand in the workplace, I have yet to reach the age, or brain maturity to understand the inner-working of the corporate and economic world.""

""Excellent, my boy."" Mr. Dalton praised. ""Now run along and have an excellent Saturday afternoon!""

So Timmy went back outside and played with the Millers boy, Tiresias.

After the day had ended, and supper was brought to each families tables, the boys departed to see each other again perhaps the next day. The Daltons feasted on fine steaks, seafood, and mashed potatoes. The Millers, on the other hand, had fried chicken from the oven.

""Daddy,"" Tiresias asked with a mouthful of chicken, ""Why is it that the Millers have TWO cars? And such a lot of room in their house for activities?""

Mr. Miller sighed quietly, and prepared himself to answer the tricky questions of financial inequality that the young man had on his mind.

""Well, Tiresias,"" began the older man. ""Some people are born, they learn, they work, they start a family, everything like that. Some of us may have difficulties in life, some of us get along just fine. Some of us are critisized and unfairly keptfrom ever succeeding in the corporate world. Some of us are born lucky, to doctors, senators, many that go on to have high-paying, but stressful jobs. You see son, The Daltons are more of the latter category. Mr. Dalton is a chief engineer, and he has a lot to do at work.""

""I don't really get it."" Tiresias lamented. ""But I'll dwell on it and I think I'll get it sooner or later.""

The next day, Sunday, the Millers were preparing to go to church; meanwhile, the Daltons prepared to go to their church.

""Mom?"" Timmy pondered as they drove to church, ""Why is it that the Millers go to a different church than we do?""

Mrs. Dalton quietly sighed, and began to relate to her son what she believed. ""Well son, when we read the bible, does God tell us to go to others homes to have gathering?""

Timmy thought about it for a minute. ""I suppose not mother, in fact, the bible does say that The Lord dwelleth not in buildings of man, but that the church is Jesus inside our hearts as we listen to the word of our lord.""

""Very good,"" chimed Timmy's mother. ""Some people, however, may not read that part of the bible, and their congregations take place in others homes, because they think church buildings are not Godly do you understand?""

Timmy was confused. ""But mother, doesn't that go against the bible?""

""Yes,"" his mother said. ""But that remains between the Millers and God.""

""Okay,"" said Timmy, his head swimming with confusing information about the Millers.

--------------------------------------------


""Hey, mom,"" started Tiresias as his dad drove the family to church. ""So, the Daltons go to a church building in town. Didn't worker Dennis say that we must have church in the houses of our congregation?""

Tiresias's mom sighed, as she knew the difficulties in explaining religious concepts.

""Well Tiresias, some people don't follow the word of God, and they don't have the spirit in their hearts. This can lead them down the path of Satan where they care more of the world than of God.""

Tiresias was puzzled, but accepted his mom's answer.

The next day, Monday, both boys had school to attend, and they arrived home later in the day, before supper. When Timmy came home, he did some of his homework, and had delicious mac and cheese for dinner. Tiresias, however, recieved not so warm a welcome.

Mrs. Miller sat on the lving room couch. Her eyes were red. 

""What's the matter ma?"" Tiresias asked, concerned.

""Tiresias,"" his mom wept. ""your father's in prison.""

""What!?"" Screamed Tiresias. ""No that can't be true, that can't be. W-w-w-hat? w-why would they do this?""

Mrs. Miller sniffled and tried to explain to Tiresias the concept of driving under the influence, resisting arrest, and corruption in the police force.

The next day, The Daltons heard the news. Mr. and Mrs. Dalton heard it from Mrs. Miller herself, Timmy on the other hand, heard it from Tiresias at school during recess.

""Dad?"" Began Timmy, ""please don't confuse me like you always do. I'm just a kid, I don't have a lot of big words to use, and I can't keep track of too much information. Just please, why, why did they bring Mr. Miller to prison Dad? I've heard you talk about financial inequality, I heard Mom tell me about religious Christian values, but I don't understand any of it. Why Dad? Why did they take Mr. Miller to prison?""

Mr. Dalton sighed, he knew the difficulties in what he'd have to explain to Timmy. All the work he'd put in to making him understand all about the world. Timmy was young. And there were plenty of complicated things to explain in the world.

""Well boy,"" the older man started. ""Because the Millers are a bunch of fuckin' niggers.""",A joke my father used to tell me.,0

And the *djinn*, bound under the Seal, bowed low and said: Wise and mighty king, it shall be as you desire.

When the thrones were finished they were of a value surpassing all the treasures of the earth, and there are no words remaining in the tongues of men fit to describe their glory. Some may speak of the rare woods carved and shaped by the inhuman skill of the *djinn*, some of the gold inlay and some of the gems beyond price that studded their every curve, and some even of the glorious needlework to be seen in the very upholstery. What is certain is that the King himself, and the Queen who was his royal guest, were seated in majesty fit to honour the noblest royalty that ever were or shall be.

At last the audience was over and the Queen returned to her own country, and Solomon the Wise took thought. For, he reasoned, though such thrones as these may have been fitting for such an affair of state as the visit of the great Queen of Sheba, yet they were not such as even the King of Israel might rightfully sit upon every day, lest overweening pride consume him and he forget the very wisdom that he had sought as a blessing from the Lord of Hosts. Therefore by the power of the Seal of Solomon the King summoned the mightiest guardian that it lay within his power to call upon, a prince of the *ifrit*, and to this one the King said: By the power of the Seal I charge you, take these thrones away with you to the City of Brass and place them forever beyond mortal reach, until I or another who wields the Seal shall call you again.

And the *ifriti*'s jet-black eyes glimmered within his flame-red visage, but being constrained by the Seal he only answered: Wise and mighty king, it shall be as you desire. And he conveyed the twin thrones in that instant to his own dwelling in the City of Brass, forever beyond mortal reach.

Years later as King Solomon the Wise felt the approach of old age, it came upon him that he would see the two thrones once again and recall for the last time the glory of his youth, and by the power of the Seal of Solomon he summoned the *ifriti* and said: Bring forth from the City of Brass the thrones that I charged you to keep. And the *ifriti*'s jet-black eyes glimmered within his flame-red visage, but being constrained by the Seal he only answered: Wise and mighty king, it shall be as you desire. In that instant he vanished from King Solomon's throne-hall only to reappear moments later with the two thrones. But lo! both thrones blazed with fire, and in the instant they reappeared they collapsed into the ashes of many rare and precious woods, and the gold itself melted and the gems beyond price calcined to worthless powder.

And the King said, Faithless *ifriti*, by the power of the Seal, what hast thou done?

And the *ifriti*'s jet-black eyes glimmered within his flame-red visage, and he answered: Being constrained by the Seal, thy servant did as he was commanded, and took thy thrones to his own dwelling in the City of Brass. But lo! in that City the fire eternal rages, and thou, O King, neglected to command thy servant to make thy possessions fireproof. And while in the City of Brass the flame rages eternal but does not consume, the instant thy thrones returned to the mortal realms, they were burned as all things mortal must burn in fire.

And the King knew that he had no claim upon the *ifriti*, who had done as he was bid and, being a proud and vengeful spirit, not one whit the more, and in a hollow voice declared the last piece of Wisdom of his long life:

""People who live in brass houses shouldn't stow thrones.""","When Solomon the Wise received the Queen of Sheba at his palace, he needed grand new thrones for him and for her.",3

The man, who has been staying at a hotel, comes by one afternoon to check out the progress, and he hates the way it looks. He can’t stand the aesthetic and immediately demands the contractor replace the tile with wood flooring or something that goes better with the columns.

In order to do so he had to first take on a suitable corporal form adhering to local biological esthetics and so he chose to manifest as a large hairy man based on one of his favorite characters from  a popular young adult series  about wizards that he had read in its entirety while waiting at the DMV (dimensional motor vehicle) department to renew his operators license the previous week. 

So he stumbles into the bar, still getting used to the poorly designed bipedal body, and  a bit woozy from the trans-corporation which always left him feeling a bit off balance until he acclimated to local gravity strength and EM fields. Anywho, he makes his way up to the bar, taking the one available stool, in the process jostling an unpleasant looking middle age woman name Karen with a face only a mother could tolerate and a hairdo that screamed to speak to the manager. 

So Karen, turns to our unnamed protagonist, and with a scowl that converts her RBF into a truly unpleasant visage begins to berate him for bumping into her, causing her to spill her mango-kiwi-appletini. Next she calls out angrily to the bar-tender demanding a free refill of her spilt drink (never mind the fact that only a sips worth had sloshed over the rim and she had quickly downed the rest).

The bartender rolls his eyes, but prepares the drink without fuss, not wanting to engage with Karen. It doesn’t go over well though, because Karen loudly complains that the replacement beverage is “too weak” and grumbling that she is being gypped. 

The monster takes a look at the menu and decides to try the “world famous” sliders to go along with a pint of a rotating IPA on tap described as “hoppy with a burst of apricot”, something he had never tried before.

Karen, in the meantime, had finished her drink and was starting to complain about the “poor service” griping that the fish logs she ordered weren’t hot, there wasn’t enough dipping sauce, and the music was too loud. She tried to catch the bartenders attention, but he had had just about enough of her and pointedly avoided making eye contact with her as he brought over the IPA for our unnamed protagonist, before hurrying away to the far end of the bar to attend to another patron.

Karen, enraged, turned to the pan dimensional creature inhabiting the body seated next to her and made a derogatory remark regarding the hypothetical sexual preference of the bartender for not giving her the level of attention she believed she merited.

Completely fed up with her comportment and for being the complete killbuzz tainting his cross dimensional experience, the monster violated code A-72 of the inter-dimensional travel accords by scooping up Karen and feeding her into his digestive system, downing her in a single swallow.

Shortly thereafter he began to feel sluggish and quite sleepy and commented on this to his bar tending friend who replied: “I am not surprised that you feel that way, that was a bar bitch you ate”.",Put to sleep,6

post,ch99lx,2qh72,jokes,false,1563980375,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ch99lx/george_is_broke/,self.jokes,,"Providing for a family of six had proven to be challenging enough with a job, and now that George found himself without one, he was desperate. He drove down to his local insurance agency, and went in to find his agent. “How much would it cost to buy life insurance for my wife?” He asked. The agent replied: “Sixty dollars, sir.” George pulled a fifty and a ten out of his wallet, leaving his final dollar nestled in the leather. He purchased the life insurance, and made his way to a local bar. 
Once inside, he went to the bartender. The bartender, Micheal, knows George, and knows of his situation. He gives George a few drinks on the house, and asks George how he can help. George replies: “Do you know anyone who could-“ he looked around the room, making sure no-one was eavesdropping, “-take care of someone, and cheaply?” Micheal shook his head, eyes wide. “No, and I don’t want you mixing up with those types.” But, George was determined. He begged and begged, and little by little, he wore Micheal down. Defeated, he pointed to a man sitting in a small booth, puffing on a cigar. “Artie over there can probably help you.” George thanked Micheal, and walked over to Artie. “I hear you can take care of people, and for a low price too.” George said, looking at Artie expectantly. “One thousand dollars.” Artie said, taking a drag on his cigar. George felt a stab of panic, but didn’t falter. He talked to Artie, explaining his situation, until Artie gave in. “I’ll cut you a deal, one hundred dollars for the job.” Now, this still wouldn’t do. So, George kept talking. Much like how he did Micheal, he begged and begged, until finally Artie caved. “Alright, alright, I’ll do it for a buck.” Ecstatic, George handed him his last dollar bill. 
The next day, Artie quietly followed George’s wife around town as she ran errands. Around noon, she entered a convenience store. When Artie followed her in, he noticed that there weren’t many people in the building. He determined that here would be the best place to do the job. He waited for George’s wife to enter the produce isle (which was empty) and quickly grabbed her by the neck, and choked her out. Dropping her body to the floor, he turned to leave, and saw a cashier at the register, gaping at Artie in horror. Artie rushed over to the cashier, and choked him out too, but not quickly enough. As Artie fled the store, he saw several policemen in place, ready to arrest him, which they did.

He tapes several forks together to make a bridge and lays it down, allowing the two of them to get across.

When they get back to Yoda’s hovel, they find that some creature has chewed a hole in the fence around Yoda’s garden.

“Something I have for this,” Yoda says again. Once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole.

Yoda and Luke return to Yoda’s home, where Yoda looks through his bag. He’s used all his forks but one, he discovers!

“That’s ok Master,” Luke says, wanting to be helpful. “I’ll write us a note reminding us to buy more.”

So he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board.

post,ch5tb6,2qh72,jokes,false,1563959569,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ch5tb6/a_string_walks_into_a_bar/,self.jokes,,"One fine fall day, a String is walking down Spruce street.

The string walks this route all the time home from his factory job. See, the String works at Sanchez Aluminum over in Harleysville. He's actually part of the safety team and spends most of his time is the windowed office overseeing the factory floor - keeping an eye on safety for the other workers who work the smelter. Oddly enough Sanchez Aluminum does not have an OSHA representative on site, but the String has not had any major accidents in his entire 15 year tenure as on the Safety Team. This has earned him multiple ""Employee of the Month"" accolades - each of which gets noted in his Human Resources file. Apparently being a String gives him the ability to lean in ways that gives him extra visibility that other's don't. To be entirely honest, it is probably one of the best employees Sanches Aluminum has ever had. He's been in this role for a while, and really seems to enjoy it. Pay is good, and the benefits are surprisingly good for him and his family.

The String is married to another string (he's Cotton and his wife is a woven Nylon) and they have two kids - both blends, and a Black Labrador puppy. Most people who have 3yo dogs no longer call them puppies, but if you have ever owned a Lab, you know they are puppies until 5 years - at least. Great dogs. Really great temperament. Great with kids. Eat anything they can get in their mouths. Pretty useless as a guard dog. I'm sure if their String-home was broken in to, the dog would just show up with a tennis ball in his mouth, wagging his tail. But, they got the puppy as a member of the family, and not as a guard dog after all. So, it all works out.

Anyway, He's minding his own business - as always - staying on the sidewalk, keeping aware not to bump in to anyone. Given the political climate in Harleysville as of late have been a little strained. Not that it is unsafe to raise kids - but people keep to themselves and everyone is happy. As he rounds the corner and turns off of Spruce on to Connecticut Avenue and heads North, he passes ""Raising the Bar"". That's the new place opposite of the local hardware store, and next to Phillip's Diner. Raising the Bar has done a nice job of providing both a place for the factory workers to gather after a hard day, and a place to stop by with friends and just talk. It really isn't your typical dive bar and the owner, Mike? (or Marty, or Matty? Matt... maybe?) Honestly I can't remember which, but it is definitely a ""M"" name. Anyway, Matt has done a great job of keeping the place well lit and he's put a few high top tables near the front. His wife June opted to put in a little kitchen for your standard bar fare. Wings, Nachos, and things of that level. So, June and Matt (It is definitely Matt) have this nice little place and business is pretty good. They have a few sidewalk tables they put out in the Spring and Summer where people can grab a bite to eat and a drink or two. In fact, the String and his family have brought their pup along when it was almost brand new.

So, the String is walking past ""Raising the Bar"" after turning off Spruce and thinks to himself, ""you know, it's been a hard week, I'm going to grab myself a drink and just soak in the world. I deserve it."" He decided to sit down on one of the sidewalk tables. Fall has already begun and there were a few leaves on the chair - but he just brushes them off and makes himself comfortable while reading the ""On Tap"" table card. For whatever reason, he's started to be fond of Hefeweizen / Wheat beers recently. Perhaps it is the cool weather, or maybe just time for a change, but he decided on a nice Widmer Hefe. He sits patiently, looking over the menu card - contemplating the Chicken Nachos or perhaps a plate of fried cheese. I think most of us enjoy the occasional fried cheese - but lets be honest, about halfway in to the second one you realize - you have have just had too much cheese and wish you would have opted for the other choice.

The wind picks up a little, blowing down Connecticut as it does, and the String gets a little chill. Half excited by the onset of full Fall, he decides to go inside. Don't want to catch a cold or anything this early in the Fall. His job has great benefits as I mentioned before, but you don't get to the Supervisor role by spending your time at home sick. So, he heads towards the entrance. On the way in, he sees a sign on the door, that he can just barely read, when the door opens and a man and woman start coming out. He, like any good String would do, steps aside and holds the door for the exiting patrons. The woman starts to say ""Thank You"", and then quickly breaks off and looks away rather abruptly. The man, steps in front of the woman and glares back at the String. The String, taken back a bit by the exchange lets go of the door and eases back a little. The Man says, rather rudely, ""We got it!"" and continues to exit ""Raising the Bar"" and turns right on Connecticut towards Spruce. The String, thrown a little, watches them leave and just assume it was a bad day, or perhaps they were mid-argument. Either way, he was starting to get hungry for those Chicken Nachos. Turning back around, reaching for the handle of the door, which is now almost fully closed, he reads the handwritten paper sign no the door, ""No Strings Inside"".

""What!??"", the String thinks. How could this be? Since when did Harleysville start acting this way. Yea, politic have gotten a little ugly recently, by how is this the String fault? How is this at all related to String-kind? Perhaps it is just a goof, and the sign was placed there by some smart-assed kids. It looks like it was hastily written with a Sharpie on the back of another flyer. He grabs it with his right hand and tears it down as he walks in - crumpling it as he goes.

Raising the Bar is rather crowded for this time of day, but he supposed it is 6pm and people are probably thinking the same thing on their way home from work. A few guys at the door give him a look as he comes in, and the murmuring dulls noticeably. ""Hey everyone... how's it going?"" says the String. Almost everyone turns away. Honestly the String has never felt this kind of response... ever. He sees June behind the counter pulling a beer for a patron, and he starts to head over to the counter. A few others part and give him some room as he approaches and he says, ""Hey, can I get an order of Chicken Nachos and a Heff, please? I was going to sit out on your lovely sidewalk tables, but the night is starting to chill a little and figured I'd just enjoy it in here."" As always, he does this with a kind smile. June won't make eye contact, and seems to be rather nervous. Matt comes over, and taps her on the shoulder gently and takes the beer mug from her hands to finish the pour. June seems to be a little misty-eyed and getting a red in the face as she walks towards the other end of the counter.

""Hey man, you can wait outside if you want, but we can't have you in here."", says Matt.

Taken back a bit, the String says ""What? I can't be in here? I'm just looking for beer and some nachos. What's going on?"".

Matt says, this time, with a little more force in his voice, ""Look, we put the sign up - we don't want to make anybody uncomfortable in here - head on out, and I'll be there in a few minutes, ok Bud?""

Now the String is getting a little agitated - he's heard about this kind of thing, but never expected to have to deal with it in Harleysville... especially at Raising the Bar. Hell, he and his family been here a few months ago and they were treated fine. Granted, he's never been inside - but who cares - it's a free country right? ""Matt, I'm not sure what you are talking about here... but I really don't like how I'm being treated here. I'm not really in the mood to argue with anybody... I just want a beer and and a bite. Is that going to be a problem?!""

""Listen, String, this doesn't have to be a big deal. Just sit outside and I'll be out in a bit."" Matt says in a very condescending tone, ""Just take it easy and we will get to you when we can.""

""No, you know what, I don't think I will. I'm going to go over to Phillip's and get something there. I'm not sure what's happening here, but I really don't appreciate they way I'm being treated!"", says the String.

""Hit the bricks, String"", from some un-named patron far down at the other end of the bar. The String looks over quickly to see who would dare say such an offensive thing, but the lights are low and it is hard to see with the ""Miller High Life"" neon sign changing the colors a bit - it is too hard to tell.

""Whatever, I'm out."", barks the String as he turns to the door and walks out. Halfway out he realizes he still holding the crumpled up paper sign, and turns that throws it at the floor near the counter in disgust. ""This is your garbage!"", and he closes the door a little harder than needed.

Standing on the sidewalk the String has adrenaline pumping through his body as a result of the tensions. Taking a breath, trying to calm down a little as he decides wha to do next. He's lost his appetite, and is in no mood to enjoy the cool Fall nigh, he decided to head home. All the way down Connecticut he's replaying the conversation in his head. Of course now he's got ton's of things to say. Retorts are popping up left and right. ""You take it easy!"" and ""I'll hit you with a brick, jerk!"". The String walks the rest of the way home - by the time he makes it to his street, he's feeling better. Cool Fall air does relax him, and when he sees his pup wagging his tail in the front window anticipating his arrival - he has pretty much pushed that mess out of his mind.

A few weeks later, on a surprisingly and unseasonably warm day, the String finds himself walking past ""Raising the Bar"" again after a really hard day and decides to give it another go. Tough days call for a cool glass of beer, right? Let bye-gones be bye-gones, and he crosses Connecticut and reaches for the door handle. He makes note that there are no rude and offensive signs on the door, and pops right in. This time, he proudly walks up to the bar and says to Matt, who is tending this end, while June is sitting on a stool at the other end chatting away with friends.

""Gimme a pint of your finest, sir."", says the String in a comically British accent. Why not start the evening out with a bit of humor, right?

Matt glances up from his work and stares directly into the String's eyes and says ""Listen... STRING... I told you once, don't come in here. We don't want you in here.""

""Are you kidding me? What the hell is wrong with you, man? I thought you were just having a bad time last week... but now, you are acting like a real ass!"" responds the String. He can feel himself turning red with anger. 0-60, but what are you supposed to do when confronted with this kind of thing.

""I'm not going to tell you again... No String!"", barks Matt. Making a quarter turn to point to a blue metal sign with ""NO STRING"" printed in bold, white lettering 4 inches high - mounted above the cash register. ""No string, see, N. O. S. T. R. I. N. G. Or can't you Strings read?"" responds, Matt in an incredibly rude tone.

""What the hell is wrong with you Dude? This is such a dick move! I don't understand what the hell is going on here!"" says the String, almost at full boil.

""I really don't care what you understand or don't understand, STRING! This is a private establishment, and I can decide who or what I will allow in to my place of business. If I don't want Strings in here, the there are no Strings allowed in here. So take your stringy-ass out of my place of business and don't come back again. Show up again, and I'm calling the cops! We clear?"" Matt yells. By this time, Matt is leaning over the bar jabbing his finger into the String in a really aggressive way.

""Screw this, screw you, and everyone in here. This is offensive an I might just call the ACLU and file a complaint! Doesn't look so clean in here either, maybe a call to the Health Department, huh? How about that?! Why don't I get the Health Inspector down here and have them do little surprise inspection on this rat-hole of a bar? Up to code?"", responds the String. Grasping at something to threaten with. Truth is, this place is pretty nice and it is an idle thread, but Matt doesn't have to know that. The String is so pissed, anything to get back at this place that is within his reach - he's going to do it. ""I don't want a beer, I don't even want to be here!"", screams the String.

The String turns, and swipes his arm across the counter top, pushing a bowl of peanuts to the floor, making a mess.

""To hell with you, and your stupid bar!"", yells the String. ""I hope everyone in here gets sick from your stupid peanuts!""

One more sweep across the counter top and the String pushes over the bar set containing Maraschino cherries, sliced lemons, limes and straws for making drinks. The juices spill all over the counter top and on to the floor. Red juice dribbles down the bar on to some patrons laps causing people to stand up and step back. Clearly this has escalated too far, and the String recognizes that he's acted really poorly and made a bad situation worse than it needed to be. He grabs a messy handful of bar napkins and stops the red juice stream from getting everywhere.

""STOP! Leave it be! Just get out!"", yells June who is now along side of Matt. ""Just leave! We don't want your kind in here!"".

""Fine!"", retorts the String, throwing the sticky, messy handful of napkins into Matt's chest, leaving a pink, sticky mess on his white shirt. He turns and hustles out of the bar. Clearly he's gone over the line, and getting out now would be the best course of action. He slams in to the door with his hip, sending the door all the way open until the metal automatic door closing arm catches it right before it slams in to the back wall. The door hits with such force, the String is surprised (and actually quite thankful) that it didn't shatter. He turns and just heads out on to the street. He's unable to really make out the yelling of insults from the bar as the door slowly closes - but it is clearly more rude comments.

Both hurt and angry, the String turns towards home and begins his walk. Two doors down the String passed an old, abandoned store front, catches his own reflection in the window, and stops in his tracks. An idea races into his mind and he gets an idea.

""I'm not going to get run our of a bar like that... what would my family think of me if I just turned tail and ran! I'm better than that. And I'm going to have myself a god-damned beer - who cares what those idiots think!"", says the String. Realizing that he's talking to his own reflection, he blushes a little, but feels a sense of accomplishment and determination and the idea takes hold.

The string takes off his light Jacket, folds it in thirds, and places it on the top step to the abandoned store's entrance area. Then, he takes off his necktie, and dress shirt - folding them gently just as he did with his jacket. He places his work bag on top of the pile and faces the semi-reflective store window.

Seeing his own reflection, he stretches and nimbly bends himself down and and around. Bending him self in a 360º loop at the middle. Then, ever so nimbly he works his head into the loop and twists himself around and tries to straighten himself. A little giggle passes the String's lips and his plan begins to take shape.

Then, rather awkwardly, the String reaches into his right front pocket and takes out a pocket knife. One that he uses primarily as a money clip that he got from his kids the previous Father's day. You may be familiar with the style, a small Swiss Army knife with a pair of (poor) folding scissors, a nail file, and a small pen-knife blade all with a metal clip on one side. On the reverse side, his family etched a nice ""We love you, Dad!"". Seeing the engraved statement makes him feel a little better. Opening the pen knife's blade, he proceeds to repeatedly poke the blade through the top of his head, just above the forehead and starts shredding the top end of his String head. Over and over he works apart the tightly woven threads, loosening them substantially. Each time he frees up 4-6 inches of threads they flop back down into his eyes. Small pieces fall to the ground around his feet as he continues. Gusts of cool Fall breeze scatter these loose threads with the leaves that are gently blowing by.

Once complete, he folds back his pen knife / money clip and walks over to his work bag. Opening the leather strip and buckle, he pulls back the flap and places the money clip into the front right pouch along with his work ID and a few old and no longer sticky Post-It notes. Then, digging though layers old manilla folders, loose papers and printed safety regulations, the String finds his old black plastic comb. It is missing a few teeth on one side, but is more or less completely adequate for his intended purpose. Of course, he has to clean off some grime and gunk that has accumulated over the years. Thinking to himself that he really needs to clean out this bag at some point.

Then, in a move which reminds him of the old Vidal Sassoon commercials he saw as a kid, he proceeds to comb his now-loose threads. This way, and that. Frontwards and backwards. Over and over. Teasing his threads until it is pretty much a tangled up mess. Absent mindedly he tosses the comb back in to the large pouch of his work bag. Using his left foot, he kicks the flap closed, and then stands in front of the shop window to admire his work. Then, he turns back towards the bar and starts to walk. Playing the upcoming situation over and over in his head, he reached down and grabs his pair of lightly scratched mirrored sunglasses he keeps in the outer pocket of his bag, and places them on the bridge of his nose. They are a little bent and more that a little scratched than he'd like - but what could he expect - they are kept loose in a work bag. Not really how you treat glasses you want to keep nice and sharp looking.

He then makes a direct path to the bar. Wearing the sunglasses may have been a mistake given the fact that it was already getting dark out, but he decides to keep them on to help with his plan. Then, taking a few seconds to center himself with a few deep breaths, the String, reaches up with his right hand, and yanks open the door and proudly walks in. Walking deliberately to stand in exactly where he stood during the previous confrontation. Standing there, twisted around, strands at the top of his head gently wafting back and forth under the large ceiling fan above him. His mirrored sunglasses reflecting the ceiling lights just over head.

Every single patron stops talking, and heads turn to face the String.

Matt, who was facing the bottles on the back wall turns around with a look of bewilderment, and says, ""Uh, hey Mac... weren't you just here? Didn't I tell you that we don't serve String in this bar?""

""Nope..."", says the String knowingly lying to the bartender.

""I'm pretty sure that was you. You are definitely a String."" interrupts, June, who is now standing directly next to her husband, Matt. ""You sure you're not a String?""

""Nope..."", says the String. ""...frayed knot"".",A string walks into a bar,4

     Luckily for him, he was a avid watcher of all those “survival” shows and managed to situate himself comfortably.  After scouring the island, he had noticed that also stranded with him was a lonely sheep and a feral dog. 
     A couple months pass and he was already getting tired of the monotony of  surviving and the occasional  
self pleasuring “rituals” before bed. 
     The following morning, he spotted the sheep near his campsite. It may have been from the heat, but he started fantasizing about “getting it on” with the sheep. He thought to himself for a minute and decided to go for it. Already excited with a raging boner he slowly approached the sheep. As he was about to grab the sheep, the dog came charging out of the brush and chased the sheep away.   
     This continued for a week. Whenever he got close to the sheep the dog repeatedly chased the sheep away. 
     One morning, a faint moaning woke him. He jumped up, looked around, and saw a naked, gorgeous woman washed up on the beach. He helped her recover and settle in. Grateful for his help, she told him in a seductive voice, “I’ll do anything for you, I’ll do anything with you, just ask and it will be yours.”

Eventually, after she had grown up and was married, she realized that the teasing actually made her stronger, and that having a unique name was actually a good thing.

So, when her first child was born, she talked her husband into naming their daughter 'Love,' knowing that while the child might be teased, she would grow up stronger and thank her one day.

As expected, when Love started school, she endured much of the same teasing that Darling did, all because of her strange name.

One day, Love simply had had enough. She came home from school very angry and screamed at her dad, asking why her parents gave her such a stupid name.

The husband, being a good man, took the blame of naming her to protect his wife and apologized.

In a fit of rage, Love shot him with her dart gun and ran away.

Minutes later, Darling came home and saw her husband lying on the ground.

""Omg, what happened?!"" she asked, running to him.

He waved her closer, and whispered, ""Shot with the dart, and you're to blame. Darling, you gave Love a bad name.""",A girl named Darling had a particularly rough childhood because of her uncommon name.,3

There was no one around, but he saw a light up ahead. He walked towards it and soon figured out that it was a farmhouse.

The man knocked on the door, and a farmer answered. ""Sir,"" he said to the farmer, ""my car broke down on the road about a mile away, and I was wondering if I could use your phone.""

The farmer told the man that he didn't have a phone, but in the morning, he would drive him into town. He would give him a place to stay during the night, ""but you must promise that you won't touch the white ape.""

""The white ape?"" asked the man. ""What's the white ape?""

""Promise you won't touch it!""

""OK, OK, I won't!""

The farmer showed the man to his room, and the man went to bed.

But as the night wore on, the man couldn't get to sleep. He kept wondering, ""What in the world is the white ape? And why can't I touch it?""

The man couldn't get back to sleep, so he got up and went down to the kitchen to find some milk or something to help him creep to dreamland.

Upon arriving at the bottom of the stairs, he found that the old farmer was sitting in the kitchen, also apparently not able to sleep.

""Sir,"" said the man, ""I've been tossing and turning all night--I just want to know: What *is* the white ape?""

The farmer sighed and said, ""Come on. I'll show him to you. But you *can't* touch him.""

The man agreed.

The farmer led him outside, to the backyard. They went through eight cement doors, each one thicker than the last. Finally, they came to a huge room with a gigantic cage sitting in the middle of it. In the cage was a tremendously large white ape, snoring away.

""Ahhhhh ..."" said the man. ""Now I understand.""

The two went inside.

And yet, the man was not satisfied. He lay in bed thinking, ""That was the white ape ... but why can't I touch it? Just one, tiny touch can't hurt ... can it?""

So he climbed out of bed, stealthily made his way down the stairs, sneaked out the back door, continued through the gate, and crept to the side of the cage where the ape was sleeping. Slowly, quietly, he reached his hand through the bars and touched the ape ...

Its humongous eyes immediately jerked open. It roared.

Frightened, the man backed up, nearly tripping over himself.

The ape jumped to its feet, shook the cage doors, and broke them easily. Panicked, the man turned around and ran for his life.

The ape came after him, breaking the cement walls as he came. Faster, and faster, he was gaining on the man.

The man spotted the old farmer's truck. He jumped in, spotted the keys on the seat, threw them in the ignition, and revved the engine to life. He peeled out of the driveway as quickly as he could, but the ape didn't relent. It continued after him.

Faster and faster, he pressed on the accelerator, but he couldn't outrun the ape--it was gaining on him. Finally, the man lost control of the truck and ran it into the ditch.

The ape ran up to the car, roared, and ripped the door off the vehicle. It reached inside, slapped the man on the arm and screamed, ""TAG!!! YOU'RE IT!!!""",The White Ape,47

He told me about the night he crossed into the states – he was soaking wet, tired, hungry, but he made it. He was at the start of his American dream. Miguel worked hard, started doing odd jobs at first, anywhere that would take him, he’d work hard. He worked long hours – farm jobs, restaurant jobs, you name it, he did it. Whatever job he had, he never complained, he just did his 10, or 12, hours a day (sometimes more), came home slept, and went back to work. Slowly he saved up his money, and whenever he could he’d store a little away for the big dream he had: Miguel loved to read and it was his dream to one day own a book store. After 20 years of scrimping and saving by golly he was able to put together enough for a down payment on his own book store. El Paso books he called it. Miguel was proud of himself. 

One day a customer came into Miguel’s book store – big guy, named Jack. Jack had a MAGA hat on. He had a mustache. He had a Hillary for Prison T-shirt and his gut busted out just a little bit over his 'Remember the Alamo' belt buckle. Jack said to Miguel, “hey boy, come over here gimme that Trump book he wrote – the new one”. Miguel knew his books. He knew there was no new Trump book. “Sir, there is no new trump book, we do not have it”. Jack says, “Listen you wetback now I told ya, gimme Trump’s book!” Miguel was getting agitated, but he kept his cool. “We do not have his book. He doesn’t have any new books, we don’t keep his book in this store”.  Jack says “You got dang beaner! Now when I tell ya to git me Trump’s book I ‘spect ya to get me his got dang book!” Miguel could take no more, he lost his cool and finally said – “Fuck you! I don’t want you here! Get the fuck out of here! LEAVE. ” And ol’ Jack says, “If you don't have his book, how'd you know the title?”",Miguel's story.,1

Darling always got a lot of teasing and abuse at school. Eventually, after she had grown up and was married, she realized that the teasing actually made her stronger, and that having a unique name was actually a good thing.

So, when her first child was born, she talked her husband into naming their daughter 'Love,' knowing that while the child might be teased, she would grow up stronger and thank her one day. 

As expected, when Love started school, she endured much of the same teasing that Darling did, all because of her strange name.

One day, Love simply had had enough. She came home from school very angry and screamed at her dad, asking why her parents gave her such a stupid name.

The husband, being a good man, took the blame of naming her to protect his wife and apologized.

In a fit of rage, Love shot him with her dart gun and ran away.

Minutes later, Darling came home and saw her husband lying on the ground.

""Omg, what happened?!"" she asked, running to him.

He waved her closer, and whispered, ""Shot with the dart, and you're to blame. Darling, you gave Love a bad name.",OC: A girl named darling,4

The bartender then goes out and sees the gorilla sitting on the barstool in front of the register. He walks up to the gorilla and asks “Good evening, what can I get started for you?”

“I’ll have a gin and tonic,” says the beast.

The bartender, confused by the gorilla speaking fluent English goes back to the manager’s office.

“Sir, he’s requesting for a gin and tonic, charge him $9” says the bartender.

*nine dollars?* thought the bartender. Without speaking, the bartender returns to the bar and pours the drink. 

“That’ll be $9,” he said.

The gorilla pulls out a wallet and lays out a $10 bill. 

The bartender goes back and gets his change.

When he returns back to the gorilla, the gorilla pulls out another ten. “Another one,” he says. 

The bartender goes back grabs the change and drink then hands it to the gorilla.

The barmaid says, *""Well, it looks like you don't have quite enough for one of our gals. Here's what I can do though. There's a room upstairs that has a chicken in it.

The cowboys walks into his room, sees this chicken clucking around and decides to take a pull of whiskey.

A girl named Darling had a particularly rough childhood because of her uncommon name. She always got a lot of teasing and abuse at school. Eventually, though, she got over it and found a husband. 


When their first child was born, her husband let her name the baby. 

She named the baby girl ""Love,"" inspired in the same spirit as her own unique name.

Unfortunately, Love grew up and endured much of the same teasing that her mother did, because of her strange name.

She came home from school one day and screamed at her dad, asking why he gave her such a stupid name.

The husband took the blame to protect his wife and apologized.

In a fit of rage, Love shot him with her dart gun and ran away.

Minutes later, Darling came home and saw him lying on the ground.

He got in and luckily the keys were in the ignition. He revved the pickup and raced up the freeway. He drove for half an hour. He saw a sign to exit the freeway.

He was too young to drive, he hadnt taken his test and he had no insurance. He saw an arm out of the police car pointing to the freeway exit. The boy took the exit. He slowed down and parked the car at the side of the road. He got out and then the police car slowed down and parked just behind.
Surprisingly Michael Jackson leapt out, he grabbed the boy and handcuffed him. He dragged him in to the back of the police car. Michael got in the drivers seat, he started to drive, but then he turned back and said:

She always got a lot of teasing and abuse at school and hated her parents for the pain they inflicted on her. By the time she graduated school, however, she overcame her anger and embraced her unusual name finding it brought her some fame as a competitive soccer player. 

Darling met and married a handsome veterinarian named Chorus who worked at an African wildlife reserve and, in time, they had a baby boy. Despite the hardships she endured, she demanded that the child also have a unique name but she didn’t want the boy to know it was her idea. She told the father that the boy’s name would be “Love” and that he had to pretend that it was his idea. He reluctantly agreed.

Darling’s soccer career flourished and Chorus became head of pachyderm health at the wildlife reserve. As Love grew, he endured the same ridicule and taunting that his mother did. Love’s father continued to cover for his wife's decision and argued that in time he would learn to appreciate his unique name. 

One day, Chorus was at work preparing a tranquilizer gun to work on an elephant when Love burst into his office. Love raged about the misery his name had caused him but Chorus kept up the pretense that the name was his own idea. Love grabbed the tranquilizer gun and shot his father with one of the potent darts before fleeing.

Chorus struggled for life aware that the elephant tranquilizer would kill him in a few short minutes. Darling, returning from a soccer practice found her husband struggling on the floor in his last moments of consciousness. Rushing to him, she held him in her arms and asked what happened?

The hunter leaves his wife in the stand and starts walking to his stand.

So he turns back and heads to her stand. But when he gets there, he sees his his wife arguing with a game warden.

He hears his wife yelling at the game warden, “get away from my deer!”

The game warden yells back, “look, I already told you, this is not a deer. I should have you arrested for such negligence with a firearm!”

The hunter’s wife is so pissed at this point that she loads a round into her deer rifle and points it right at the game warden’s face and says, “This is a deer. I shot it. It’s my deer. Now step away or I will blow your head off.”

The game warden slowly puts his hands up as he’s staring down the barrel of her loaded deer rifle. He then nervously says, “Okay Ma’am. I was wrong. I see now that it is a deer. But before you take it away, can I get my saddle off of it?”",A hunter takes his wife deer hunting for the first time.,63

He then explained how his mouth got dry, and that he was so wasted that, when he went to get a drink from the river, he fell in! 

The inquisitive crocodile says he has to check this out. He walks into the jungle and finds the tree where the monkey is sitting, finishing a joint. He looks up and says “Hey, MONKEY!”
 The Monkey looks down and says “FUUUUUCK, DUDE……. how much water did you drink?”",Too much water!,73

12:05 pm: It's time. You shotgun a 10 oz bottle like it's a lukewarm PBR and you don't want to be a pussy in front of your older brother's friends.

It's suppose to be grape flavored but it's becoming quite clear that whoever led the R&amp;D team that day has never actually tasted anything grape in their life. You are already regretting this decision.

12:06 pm: You deep throat a cupcake like you've been saving it for the apocalypse because let's face it...that time is here. It's going to turn to liquid form before it even clears your throat but you don't care. All is right in the world at this moment. Hold on to that. You're about to enter a very dark period in your life.

12:37 pm: First sign of life. The pressure is growing. You already have 5 lbs of impacted shit in your colon and you basically just drank the ""safe for humans"" version of Drano. You feel a poop coming on finally. You think it's time. You're wrong. You get a little snake turd as a teaser.

Take note...this is the last semi-solid thing you will see leaving your body for the next 24 hours.

12:57 pm: That little science experiment you got cooking is about to reach it's boiling point. Your stomach is angry now. It hates you...you can feel it. You have exactly .3 seconds to make it to the nearest toilet but you can't run... NEVER run! You pray to god there is enough elasticity in your butthole to keep the gates closed 5 more steps as you start to preemptively undo your pants to save valuable time. Almost there. 3...2...1...

12:58 pm: Sweet Mary, mother of God...is this real life? Your cheeks barely hit the seat and all hell breaks loose. The shit/ water mixture you've just created comes out with such force that it actually sprays the back of the toilet bowl at a 45 degree angle thus deflecting it in every direction but down.

Is that blood?

False alarm.

That's just the remnants of a cherry pie you ate at Thanksgiving...when you were 5. The smell is horrid...the sound is frightening. You try to clench whats left of your asshole to soften the blow but it's not working. The whole house just heard your liquid shit fart as it gurgled out of your ass.

1:06 pm- 8:30 pm: Everything's a blur. You have shit out everything you have ever eaten since the day you were born, everything your ancestors have ever eaten since the early 1800's, and your asshole now feels like you have a flaming hot Cheeto and the tears of a thousand Jalapeno seeds stuck in it.

You're now curled up in the bathtub ugly crying because you have to remain within arm's reach of the toilet at all times. You have the poop sweats.

You meet Jesus.

8:37 pm: Your family will never be able to unsee the things they've seen in the last 8 hours.

You're broken.

Your asshole's broken.

Your spirit's broken.

Life as you know it will never be the same. But...tomorrow's a new day. You're going to wake up, throw on the only remaining pair of underwear you have that doesn't have a shit stain on it, and you're going to run up to Target with the last shred of dignity you have left...and buy yourself a new toilet brush. You've earned it.","first post, is there a better sub for this?",0

When he went to the post office to send the letter, he met the mail deliverer Kurt. Kurt said he would deliver the letter.

The man waited a few days and went back to the post office since he didn't receive a letter back. He saw Kurt and asked him if he delivered the letter. Kurt said he tried to, but no one answered or took the letter, so he brought it back the next day.

The man was upset that his daughter ignored him. He left a copy of the same letter every single day at the post office, in the hopes that she would answer one of them someday.

Kurt noticed the man sending letter after letter, day by day, for months. His curiosity got the better of him after some time, and he decided to read one of the letters before delivering it. He was astounded at how useful the man's advice was and decided this was worth sharing with everyone, so he called up a local newspaper company.

The newspaper company sent a reporter to come speak with Kurt, who told them, ""A man sent the same letter every day for months to his daughter, who never answered the letters. Read the letter! It has some very good information that could help the whole world out.""

The reporter, instead of being interested in what the letter said, was interested in the man's dedication of sending the same letter every day to someone who never responded. The reporter wrote an article and sent it to Kurt to look at before publishing.

When Kurt looked at it, he said, ""It's outrageous! The reposting gets more attention than the original content!""","A man had an adult daughter who he loved dearly but rarely met. He decided to send her a letter, and in it was hundreds of pieces of advice to help her succeed in life.",545
