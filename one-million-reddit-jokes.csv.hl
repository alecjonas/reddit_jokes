My uncle was a good friend of his family and told me a bit about his experiences with the sport and some of the odd encounters he had and things he noticed during his career. When he first got started, Manny's win at Flyweight (just over 100 pounds) took the world by storm, but in the celebration afterwards he was still a relatively unknown boxer. People didn't approach him, and he just chatted with family and close friends while re-hydrating, getting some food back in him, and generally having a good time.

Years later, as he pushed up into even fiercer divisions and made a name for himself, he conquered the Lightweight division - a division he had to put on over 20 pounds for the fight and still won in an event many boxing fans remember today. He was a well and established fighter, the party afterwards was tremendous, he ate good food and shared better company - ranging from local politicians to investors who had taken a liking in him. Every conversation left him happier than the last.

Finally, Manny moved forward and conquered the Light Middleweight tier - a full 50 pounds heavier than when he started so many fights ago. The world was amazed - the celebration was like none other he had seen. The food on hand was 5 star, the company was some of the most interesting and intellectual he had ever come across - while waiting for the punch and liquor, he had some of the best experiences he had enjoyed in his life. It truly struck him, then and there, that this punch line was worth the weight. ",[Long] Manny Pacquiao Won 8 Boxing Division Titles,2

Regardless, the father still treats him like a regular boy. They play catch together and watch TV together. He teaches the boy about cars and how to treat women and he lives a relatively normal life despite his lack of a body.

The boy grows up strong and healthy and on the day he can finally have his first legal drink, his father carries him to the local bar. They walk in and his father places him on a bar stool.

""Bartender"", he exclaims, ""today is my son's birthday, he is a man today. Give him the biggest, strongest drink you have to offer."" So the bartender makes a massive concoction of the strongest alcohols he has stocked and sticks a straw in it for the boy.

The boy takes a cautious sip. POP! Suddenly where there was nothing, the boy had grown a torso. Needless to say both the boy and the father were stunned.

The father is ecstatic. ""Have another sip son"", he urges. POP! Two arms appear from the torso. The father begins to yell and cheer and cry with excitement which gains the attention of the rest of the bar.

""Go on son!"" Yells the father, ""Finish the rest of the drink!""

With his new arms and hands the boy picks up the drink and finishes the rest of it in one gulp. POP! Legs suddenly shoot out from his torso, knocking him off the bar stool.

The bar goes absolutely wild. The father is crying and laughing, the other patrons are cheering and taking photos. Everyone is overjoyed at the miracle they had just witnessed.

The boy stands up on his new legs but, from a combination of never having walked before and being incredibly drunk from the alcohol, he is incredibly wobbly. He wobbles one way and then the next. He stumbles forward and out the door, into the street, onto the road where he is promptly hit by a bus and killed instantly.

The cheering stops. Everyone is stunned and silent.

The bartender, meanwhile, had been cleaning some glasses and just shakes his head. ""It's a shame"", he says, ""A real shame. He should have quit while he was ahead.""",A man's wife goes into labor,51

grandson's birthday. She doesn't know which one to get so she just grabs one
and goes over to the counter.

A Bass Pro Shop associate is standing there wearing dark shades. She says,
""Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me anything about this rod and reel?""

He says, ""Ma'am, I'm completely blind; but if you'll drop it on the counter,
I can tell you everything from the sound it makes.""

She doesn't believe him but drops it on the counter anyway.

He says, ""That's a six-foot Shakespeare graphite rod with a Zebco 404 reel
and 10-LB. test line. It's a good all around combination and it's on sale
this week for only $20.00.""

She says, ""It's amazing that you can tell all that just by the sound of it
dropping on the counter. I'll take it!"" As she opens her purse, her credit
card drops on the floor.

""Oh, that sounds like a Master Card,"" he says.

She bends down to pick it up and accidentally farts. At first she is really
embarrassed, but then realizes there is no way the blind clerk could tell it
was she who tooted. Being blind, he wouldn't know that she was the only
person around.

The man rings up the sale and says, ""That'll be $34.50 please.""

The woman is totally confused by this and asks, ""Didn't you tell me the rod
and reel were on sale for $20.00? How did you get $34.50?""

He replies, ""Yes, Ma'am. The rod and reel is $20.00, but the Duck Call is
$11.00 and the Bear Repellent is $3.50."" ",Found this in an old email from my grandpa.,36

post,9q53xf,2qh72,jokes,false,1540141174,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9q53xf/farlo_the_cow_warning_pretty_long/,self.jokes,,"       He heard the gunshot behind him. Suddenly, the extra pair of hoofs that were just behind him came to a stop as he hears a thud, signaling that his companion fell to the ground. Determined more than ever, Farlo manages to turn the corner just as the sound of another bullet whizzes behind him. 

       The man swears as he realizes he missed his target. Angered, he slows down as he starts refilling the ammo on the gun. Farlo, hearing the sound of the man fade behind him, is relieved that his pursuer has finally stopped chasing him. Well, for now. He knows he can’t stop just yet. He needs to put a lot of space between him and the man. You may be wondering, cow in the heck did he get into this situation, and what is even going on? To get there, we need to start at the beginning. Six years ago to be exact. 

       Farlo has just been born, a sleek, brown bull calf. Weighing in at 63.6 pounds, he was as healthy as a cow should be. At 7 months old, he was eventually sold to a scientist dedicating his life as a stockman (the study of cows in case you aren’t intellectually superior). This stockman was more than enthusiastic about his line of work, and had a consistent herd of 200 cattle being tested 24/7 in order to learn their behaviors and how they react to different situations. After a decade or so, the stockman grew tired with his line of work, realizing that there is no longer a need to learn about cattle, as any important discoveries of cattle has been figured out, a big portion of it by the stockman himself. There were a few secrets he kept to himself however. Knowing eventually his scientific career could very well end in a few years if he didn’t move on to something new, he decided to take his cows an extra step further. He wanted to increase their intelligence and bend their will so they will obey him. Why, though, would a man want to control cows? You see, the cows are just a test designed to see if it can be done. And if it can, the implications from it can be used in dangerous ways to take over human life as we know it.

       Cows themselves are already pretty smart. They are capable of following sound through a maze to lead them to where scientists want them to end up. They are also found to possess remarkable emotional sensitivity. But this wasn’t enough for the stockman. He wanted to see if he was capable of giving them human intelligence. Research he kept hidden from the public let him think it could be done, but only experiments can tell. After 3 years of hard work, failure, and a lot of tests that ended with his subjects reacting to the substances in different, gruesome ways, he had done it. He had a created a serum that could provide the cow extra brain power and increase the capability of its brain usage. 

       Farlo was one of the 200 cows specially selected by the stockman for this very reason. Young and healthy, he was the epitomeat of a perfect cow. Over the next couple of years, the stockman injected this serum into the cow’s food and water supply, and he was starting to get results. They began responding to basic human commands, and were functioning at a much higher and smarter level than that of a normal cow. Things were working out fine. Or so he thought.

       It all began with a cow by the name of Hyde. His mind was advancing at a much faster rate than anticipated by the scientists, but at the time they were clueless to how smart this cow had become. After three years on the serum, he began to resist the commands of the stockman. He began seeking his freedom, trying to escape every few days or so. After a month of this, the stockman decided Hyde was much more trouble then he was worth, and sent for the cow to be killed. Little did he know that Hyde had hatched a plan. The guards entered the enclosure, expecting no resistance. The second the padlock unlocked, the massive 1.5 ton cow busted free. The force of the blow killed two of the guards, and injuring another five. Hyde immediately set for the exit, but security was too tight, and he was shot down mere feet from obtaining freedom. Many others followed suit, but they were led to the same fate.

       As time went on, no matter the improvements made to the serum by the science crew, a lot of cattle still rebelled against the stockman’s plans. It had been five years, and people from the stockman’s crew began leaving the team, feeling the project in its entirety has become a waste of valuable time and money, and their talents could find a better use elsewhere. This didn’t discourage the stockman whatsoever. He was set on achieving this dream, one that’ll eventually lead to the enslaving an entire civilization. 

       Five and a half years into his project, only thirteen of the original one hundred-seventy-seven remained on board. They weren’t planning on remaining much longer, however. The stockman was beginning to go insane, delusions of his dreams were making the rest of the staff extremely uncomfortable. 

       At this point in time, the remaining one hundred-thirty-eight had reached their maximum intelligence level. Able to understand humans, and respond with basic physical actions or verbal cues, the cows could do just about anything. Except for the fact that they still wouldn’t not obey any orders they didn’t like. Threats were often used, lashings and other forms of physical harm with an attempt to torture them into compliance were tried out. However, nothing seemed to work. The levels of stubborn these cows had achieved lead to ten more scientists to quit and give up. The small team of the two scientists and the stockman were all that remained of a once blooming project that captivated the interests of many. 

       The stockman had grown weary of all the hard work and effort he had put into his project, and it hurt him immensely to see it all crumbling before him. He and the other scientists knew they couldn’t keep this up for much longer. Their lack of specialists was putting a strain on all of them. 

       Finally, the stockman decided enough was enough. He and the other two scientists decided to officially shut down this multi-year project they each had poured relentless hours into. Only problem they had now was to decide the fate of the cows. 

       The intellectual qualities the cattle were displaying had began to strike fear in these three men. They couldn’t just let these cows go free, for they don’t know the impact it could have on society, and their lives for that matter. They couldn’t bring themselves to outright kill the cows either. Something about killing the cows seemed totally inhumane, as they had adapted to a human’s way of thinking. After much debate, the stockman decided that after all his dedication, he deserved a bit of fun.

       It took several days, but the small crew assembled a gigantic maze through the entire facility (this isn’t a small facility either. Three stories tall with three floors, along with the length being 1.7 miles long and the width being 1.2 miles  wide, it was quite a serious maze. The cows, locked up in the basement area, had no idea what was going on just above them. The following morning after the maze was finished, an announcement was made. 

       “Attention Bulls and Heifers, after much discussion with my remaining crew, we’ve decided it’s time to have fun for a change. We have built a maze, and it’s your goal to get out alive. However, there is only one exit. Whether the exit is a door or an elevator, it’s up to you to try and discover your way out. There is a twist, however. My men and I each will be hunting you down. Those who manage to escape can have everlasting freedom. Those who don’t, get eaten. Good luck trying to survive.” The stockman gets off the mic, and lets out a chuckle. This is the break he’s needed for the past 16 years. 

       The cows are speechless after hearing what the stockman has to say (what’d you expect, they got the ability to talk or something?). Realizing the these men fully intend to kill them, they notice that if they want any chance of survival, they have to start by exiting the basement room. With only one way out, being cornered there is a death trap. 

       Farlo is determined to escape. The very prospect of dying seemed to much to handle, and by escaping he can live a free and happy life. His good friend, Phillip, had a similar mindset, so they decided to stick together for the time being. As they traveled the maze, trying countless doors and elevators, seeing if any have the way out, gunshots are constantly ringing throughout the building. So far, there haven’t been any near the two bulld cattle, but there has been a couple close calls where the men managed to just miss seeing the cows.

       As time goes by, Farlo and Phillip realize they are severely lost. After being let loose for four hours, they have forgotten their surroundings from earlier, and are struggling to recognize areas they’ve visited before, making things much more difficult. The amount of dead cattle they come across is sickening, and only leaves them more determined than ever to escape.

       After 7 hours, another announcement comes on. “Only 47 of you remain, and no cow has yet found the exit. We fear we may have made the maze too hard, but if you’re all dead by the end of it I’ll be happy nonetheless. Ciao.”. 

       “What a psychopath!” Farlo expressed to Phillip. As they creep along, the gunshots become less and less frequent. “They’re starting to run out targets.” Bill assessed. “Maybe we can wait them out and they’ll leave us alone.” Farlo thought about this. As good as it sounded, he knew there wasn’t a chance these men would give up.

        Farlo was about to reply when they hear the scuffling of feet. Immediately, they stop all movement, and realize he sound is coming from their left. They quickly hide behind a small pile of crates, and decide to wait the man out. Unfortunately, he keeps coming their way. Eventually he is going to spot them and they’d be shot dead in a heartbeat. They need to act fast. 

       The man continues to walk towards them. He has an apprehensive look on his face. It seems as though fear is starting to get to him. Finally, when he’s close enough, Phillip sprints out of his spot and around the corner. The man, surprised by the sudden movement, hesitates for a moment before recollecting himself and chasing after the fleeing bull. As soon as he turns the corner, he realizes that another cow is already charging at him, and before he can react, he gets violently slammed into a bar and is out cold. Finally, there is one man down.

       Farlo and Phillip believe their safe, but they didn’t realize the man’s buddy was nearby, and made a beeline towards the slamming sound in an instant. Suddenly, gunshots everywhere. Farlo and Phillip, startled, instantly turn to run. This man was not so great at shooting, and had an aim to rival a storm trooper. 

      The two cattle are weaving throughout the maze, in and out, doing their best to avoid this scientist and cause him to lose them. After twenty minutes of this, they decide they’re in a safe enough position to slow down. This action however, proved to be fatal. Suddenly, the same man from earlier jumps out and begins shooting again. Farlo and Phillip run for their life. As sad as the mans aim was, sometimes a shot had got to hit the target eventually. Unlucky for Phillip, the man had managed to shoot him through the back leg. He went down instantly, and Farlo, ahead by just a bit, turns around to see it’s over for his friend. 

       Farlo quickly returns his mind to the task at hand, or more accurately, at hoof. Even though tears are streaming down his eyes, he knows he has to pull through, or else all of this was for nothing. More shots ring around him, and he escapes around a corner as soon as he hears a shot whizzing by right behind him. The man, cursing the fact that he’s out of Ammo, has to so slow down to spend time to refill it. Farlo, being extra capable, uses this time to put as much distance as he can between that awful human being.

       After wandering for a few hours more, vaguely aware of all the corpses around him, Farlo strikes the motherload. He finds an empty corner, extremely well hidden from the maze, and figures it’s the perfect place for a hiding spot. After spending days straight around in that maze, he knew he would need some rest. Slowly, and reluctantly, he closes his eyes, praying no one finds him while he is sleeping.

       19 hours later, Farlo wakes up. Feeling a bit groggy, he doesn’t recognize the cheering sound that’s sounds awfully close by. As time drags on, he slowly becomes more and more aware of it. Once he has his mind clear, he sets off to see why they would be cheering. As he approaches, he sees empty beer bottles and realizes they have gotten pretty drunk. After doing a bit of thinking, he realizes the stockman has been guarding the exit the whole time, making it nearly impossible to escape. Angry, he decides to sneak up and take a closer look. As much as he wants to get out, it was also just as important to Farlo to find out what’s going on. 

       The men thought they had managed to kill all the cattle, and, believing they’re the winners, have a feast with  all of the cows they had murdered. They sing songs, dance about merrily, and enjoy their food, for they believe they have nothing to worry about. Eventually, the stockman, delighted with how everything turns out, decided to do a toast.

       He raises the meat and proclaims,” No matter how intelligent we can make others, we will always be superior, and will always pull out on top!”. The other man raises his portion of meat as well, and yells,” Here here!”. They both take a couple of bites before tossing the hardly touched meat to the sides.

       This action infuriates Farlo. Before he realizes it, he comes charging out of his hiding spot and straight at the men. The stockman, absolutely shocked, managed to dive out of the way right before Farlo can slam into him. The other guy doesn’t get so lucky and gets gored by the 1500 pound bull. As soon as he does this, Farlo makes an escape towards the door while the stockman is distracted.

       Farlo is 15 feet from the door until he feels the bullet go hit him in the back. The blow causes him to stumble, and he knocks down a barrel filled with oil. The liquid begins to spread across the floor. Farlo continues to go towards the door, and gets within 5 feet before the stockman takes another shot.

        Unfortunately for the stockman, his drunkenness ruined his line of sight and he ends up hitting the fuse box instead. Sparks fly and they land and catch the oil on fire. Suddenly, the whole area becomes surrounded in flames. Farlo was able to escape in time, and finally achieved the freedom he had always wanted. As sad as he was with the hardships he had to deal with over the years, he never felt so lucky and blessed in his life. 

       The stockman, however, is isn’t in a good position at all. As the fire quickly catches on everything around him, he realizes that he doesn’t have much longer until he building collapses on him. With nowhere to escape, he sits down. He’s racking is brain for ideas on how his plan has failed. It had been foolproof, or so he thought it was. After a solid minute, he hears the building rumbling, and a shaking begins to follow. But, he finally realizes what went wrong, and why it had cost him everything. He shouldn’t have raised the steaks.

First, they took 25% of brain mass.

The musician happily composed another master piece, and the scientists listened in disbelief.

They took another 25% of his brain.

Again, the musician composed another piece, and played the violin while the scientists took notes and were saying that this is not possible!

Scientists jaws dropped! how can it be? a genius, only with a quarter of a brain, and still a genius!

The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking, and pecking the ground.

A rooster strolled past.

'So, you're the new hen, huh? How's your first day here?'

'Not bad,' replied Bob the hen, 'but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I'm gonna explode!'

'You're ovulating,' explained the rooster. Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before?'

'Never,' said Bob.

'Well, just relax and let it happen,' says the rooster. 'It's no big deal.'

Bob did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg!

Bob was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood.

He soon laid another egg -- his joy was overwhelming.

As he was about to lay his third egg, he felt a smack on the back of his head, and heard his wife yell, 'BOB, wake up!

 where he had  been born and brought up. As he scurried away from the fencing of the  compound, he felt grass under his little feet and saw the dawn breaking  for the first time in his life.  


""WOW! This is great,"" he thought.  It wasn’t long before he came to a hedge and, after squeezing under it  he saw a wonderful sight: lots if other bunny rabbits - all free and  nibbling at the lush green grass. ""Hey,"" he called out. ""I’m a rabbit  from the laboratory over there and I’ve just escaped. Are you wild  rabbits?""  


""Yes. Come and join us, "" they all cried out.  


Our friend hopped over to them and started eating the grass.  


It tasted so good.  


""What else do you do wild rabbits do?"" he asked.  


""Well,"" one of them said, ""you see that field over there? Its got carrots growing in it. We dig them up and eat them.""  


This  he couldn’t resist and he spent the next hour gorging on the most  succulent carrots he had ever tasted. ""They are wonderful"" he told his  new friends.  


Much later, he asked them again: ""What else do you  do?"" ""You see that field there in the distance? Its got lettuce growing  in it. We eat them as well"".  


The lettuce tasted just as good and he returned some hours later, completely full of lettuce.  


""Is there anything else you guys do?"" he asked.  


One of the other rabbits came close to him and spoke softly:  


""There  is one other thing you must try."" Pointing to a bunch of rabbits in the  far corner of the field, he said ""They’re girl rabbits. We shag them.  Go and try it.""  


Well, our friend spent the rest of the afternoon  screwing his little heart out until, completely knackered, he staggered  back to his male friends. ""That was fantastic,"" he panted.  


""So are you going to live with us then?"" one of the asked.  


""I’m sorry. I had a great time. Believe me, but I can’t"".  


The wild rabbits all stared at him in amazement. ""Why? We thought you liked it here.""  


""I do,"" our friend replied. ""But I must get back to the laboratory.... I’m dying for a cigarette.""

Finally, the three kings decided that they would send their knights out to do battle, and the winner would take the island. The night before the battle, the knights and their squires pitched camp and readied themselves for the fight. The first kingdom had 12 knights, and each knight had five squires, all of whom were busily polishing armor, brushing horses, and cooking food. The second kingdom had twenty knights, and each knight had 10 squires. Everyone at that camp was also busy preparing for battle. At the camp of the third kingdom, there was only one knight, with his squire. This squire took a large pot and hung it from a looped rope in a tall tree. He busied himself preparing the meal, while the knight polished his own armor. When the hour of the battle came, the three kingdoms sent their squires out to fight (this was too trivial a matter for the knights to join in). The battle raged, and when the dust had cleared, the only person left was the lone squire from the third kingdom, having defeated the squires from the other two kingdoms, thus proving that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

The voyage to Skagway was difficult. The seas were rough and Jonathan spent many hours at the rail, emptying his stomach into the frigid, frothing waters.

His journey from Skagway to the Klondike wasn't any easier. Halfway through the journey, a blizzard caught him by surprise. One of his two pack horses didn't survive the frigid night. Wolves took care of the other three days later. 

Pressing on he finally arrived in the Yukon, pulling his sled by hand. There, he discovered that all the claims had been taken, except for one on the outskirts of the town. The claim had not been taken because it seemed to have little promise. 

He worked the claim for weeks, with his gold pan, his pick, and his shovel. Day after day he toiled, his supplies and hope dwindling with each shovel-full of frozen soil lifted from the earth. 

After 9 months, his food supplies were exhausted, as were his mind and body. For all his labor, Jonathan still had nothing to show for all his labor. Dejected and despairing, he made his way back to Dawson and spent his last dollar on a shot of watered-down cheap whiskey. He'd brought his gold pan with him to use as a plate for a meal, but he didn't have the means to purchase even a cup of moose stew. 

With tears welling in his eyes, he left the bar and slumped to the muddy boardwalk outside the blacksmith shop. The pan dropped from his dejected fingers onto the ground in front of him. 

After all his labor, sacrifice, sweat, blood, and tears, he had nothing to show for it. Full of shame and despair, he wept in bitterness unabashedly, heedless of the men passing by on the boardwalk. 

A few minutes later, a prospector in a fine broadcloth suit and a bear skin coat passed by young Jonathan. Looking down at Jonathan, he took pity on the broken young man. From his pocket he pulled forth a nugget the size of an acorn. Bending low, he dropped it into Jonathan's discarded pan with a loud clang. 

Jonathan, aroused by this sound, shook himself free of his stupified state. He stared down into the pan, disbelief dawning on his tear stained face. 

Looking up at the man, with gratitude in his eyes, he said in a breaking voice, ""Thanks for my first gold, kind stranger!"" ",In the year 1897 a young man named Jonathan Quimby set out for adventure from the frontier city of Seattle. He'd risked his entire life savings to make the trek to the Yukon to prospect.,14

A woman decides to have a face lift for her 50th birthday.  She spends $15,000 and looks  sensational. 

On her way home, she stops at a news stand to buy a newspaper.  Before leaving, she says to the clerk, ‘I hope you don’t mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?”.

‘About 32,’ is the reply.’

‘Nope! I’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily. 

A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.

The girl replies, ‘I’d guess about 29.’  The woman replies with a big smile, ‘Nope, I’m 50.’

Now she’s feeling really good about herself.  She stops at a candy shop on her way down the street.

She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.

The clerk responds, ‘Oh, I’d say 30.’

Again she proudly responds, ‘I’m 50, but thank you!’ 

While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.

He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going.  Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was.  It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra  Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her.  She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully.  He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple.  He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

Stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘That was incredible, how could you tell?’

‘I was behind you at McDonalds’.",Whats my age again?,1089

This made Larry very happy and he got up bright and early the next morning and grabbed his wings, his harp, and his halo and got in the elevator to hell. When the doors opened he was met by Sam. The hugged each other and they were off. You see in Hell Sam owned a disco. The spent the day there together and had a great time. At the end of the day Larry and Sam went back to the elevator together said their goodbyes and Larry got back in the elevator and went up to heaven. He stepped off the elevator and was greeted by St. Peter who blocked the doorway to heaven. He looked at Larry and said, ""Larry Lobster, didn't you forget something?""

A week after they were published, I was contacted by a huge publisher that said they liked my puns so much that they offered to pay me an advance to write a book of puns!

The first book sold extremely well, and that cemented me as a world famous comedian and author. I had several Netflix specials as well as a couple world tours.

It was during one of those tours where I met my wife. It wasn't even during one of my acts. I was just waiting in line at a gelato stand and she struck up a conversation with me.

We had two beautiful children. The first, Michael, was a always curious about the world around him. He loved butterflies and wanted to work at the conservatory. Our second, Julia, was a real handful. She loved running around and hoped to make the national women's soccer team.

Unfortunately Michael was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was seven. He passed away two years later. Even now, forty years after he died, I think about him every day. We bought a plot of land on the butterfly conservatory grounds and planted a hedgerow where we spread his ashes. The butterflies love to land on the branches.

Julia never did make the women's soccer team. Instead, she got a career as a real estate agent and moved to rural Alaska. She made a good living selling huge tracts of land before she met her husband and moved back to our hometown to be closer to family.

My wife and I are nearing our deaths, now. My comedy days are long over. I get asked every now and then to make an appearance or do an interview. Why, just last week I was talking to another reporter who asked about how I got started in comedy.

Reporter: you've had quite a fascinating life. Would you say that everything has gone according to plan?

He walks over to the barkeep and asks what's the deal with the horse and money, and he responds ""For 20 dollars, if you can make that horse laugh, you get all the money"" the man thought for a moment, and removed a crispy 20 dollar bill from his wallet and put it in the pot.  
He walked behind the curtain, and after a few minutes the horse started laughing, the man stepped out, took the money, and bid the barkeep adieu. With this amount of money, the man could vacation in New York in style.  
Three weeks later he returned, the horse was laughing still, but the bowl of money was fuller then before. 
Once again he asked the barkeep what was the deal with the horse and money, and the barkeep helpfully responded ""Well, the horse have not stopped laughing, he even giggles in his sleep, so i made a competition much like the one you won a month prior, If you can make the horse cry, the money is yours. Entrance fee of 20 dollars"" the man thought about it for a moment, and pulled 20 crumpled up dollar bills out of his pocket, and put it into the pot.  

The man walked behind the curtain, and the Horse began laughing harder then ever before, and suddenly silence. The barkeep got worried for a second, did he kill the horse? A few seconds ticked by, and the sound of a broken ~~man~~ horse, along with the floodworks began, and the horse was crying as if you had slaughtered his entire family in front of him.  
The man came out from behind the curtains and took the money ""Wait!"" shouted the barkeep before the man could leave.

The king ordered his servants into the forest to beat the brush for moose.
While they did, the king staked out a clearing, his musket poised, waiting for the moose.

One of the servants, who had gotten lost, came out of the forest into the clearing where the king was waiting. Realising his predicament, the servant ran toward the king, waving his arms wildly, yelling: ""I am not the moose! I am not the moose!""

The king raised his musket, and took careful aim, and... POW! He shot the servant dead in his tracks.

The queen was appalled, and asked her husband: ""Sire, why did you shoot that man?! He was one of your most loyal servants, and he was shouting: 'I am not the moose'!""

""Ohh...!"" the king nodded. ""I thought he was yelling: 'I AM the moose'!""",The king and queen were out moose hunting one day.,0

There are two identical twin brothers that  live together. One happens to be a well-known porn star, and the other  is a lazy ass. Lazy ass doesn't have a job and just likes to sit around  the house. One Sunday, the porn star is angry and thirsty. He decides to  make the brother do something useful. He tells him to get off his lazy  ass and go get them something to drink. After some objection, the lazy  brother takes the motor bike and leaves for the store. In the meantime,  the porn star dozes off on his day off. He puts his phone on silent so  he won't be disturbed.

About  45 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a rear-end collision in  the T-junction by the liquor store. His pulse rate is slowing down; he's  in a comma and paralyzed. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to  the hospital. He ends up in the ER under observation, but his condition  is unfavourable. They try calling his porn star brother, but he doesn't  pick up because his phone is on silent.

The  porn star wakes to a bang on the door. Suspecting a legal  representative, he ignores it, but the banging continues. Eventually, he  decides to get up and scream at the person at the door. When he does,  he discloses -----the Angel of Death. He is just as he appears in  movies; a full fleshed face underneath a frayed cloak.

The Angel of Death. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".

""What do you mean?"" asks the pornt star.

""Well...  if you must know, your brother was in a hazardous car accident, and  I've come to take him to hell. I'm afraid his time on Earth is finished.  I'll take my leave now.""

The  porns tar appears upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can  challenge you for my bro's life? After all, YOU made the error. Surely  there must be a way I can negotiate for his life.""

The Angel of Death asks ""What do you have in mind?""

The porn star thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""

The Angel of Death laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you suggest?""

The porn star smiles. ""I suggest we see who can ejaculate the furthest. 2 minutes of masturbating, each, then we decide.""

""Very  well"" says the Angel of Death, who steps away from the porn star  keeping a distance of 5 meters between the two, still facing each other.

Once  there, he pulls back his frayed cloak to reveal his 15 inch penis. It's  long and thick. He takes his hand, spits on it, and starts  masturbating. After 2 minutes, the strongest, slimiest ball of semen  projectiles from his penis towards the porn star and lands 1 meter in  front of the porn star. The Angel of Death smirks. ""You are silly human.  But, you are granted your chance.""

The  porn star takes out his 12 inch penis, wraps in hand around it, and  starts masturbating like a crazy man. When his 2 minutes are up, he  ejaculates.

It's beyond belief.

A  stream of semen projectiles from porn star's penis so fast and far,  that a bit of his semen lands right at the feet of Angel of Death,  millimeters away.

The  winner is obvious. The Angel of Death lowers his head in shame. ""You  win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He evaporates in a puff  of smoke. At the same instant, the brother in comma wakes up in the  hospital. Not only is he unharmed he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly,  the phone by his bed vibrates. It's his brother, the porn star. He picks  up. ""Hey bro! You'll never imagine what happened. Apparently, I went  out to the liquor store and got hit by a truck. They say I almost died.""

The porn star smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today....you might say that I also came close to Death.""",I didn't make this 4 years ago. This might not be the worst joke. I'm posting again for the ones who read the original by the original poster...this is my version to pay homage,6

post,9pt1x9,2qh72,jokes,false,1540031018,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9pt1x9/the_longest_joke_of_all_time/,self.jokes,,"It is a dark and stormy night. A man, let's call him Markus, has been driving on a treacherous mountain road, when his car breaks down. He steps out of his car and opens the hood, hoping to find the source of the problem, but to no avail. Not wanting to sleep in his car, he decides to hike up the rest of the mountain, to find refuge at the monastery located just below the peak. 

He arrives at the gate, and brings his fist up for a heavy knock, when an old and small, yet somewhat powerful monk pulls away the doors.

""Welcome, young man. We don't have much, but we offer you all we can. Serve yourself hot soup and a glass of our wine, and you will find lodging for the night.""

Markus eats a bowl of soup, his stomach delighted by the flavours; he drinks the wine, having never tasted such rich oaken wine. 

At last, he falls asleep in the bed provided to him, but not for long. In the dead of night, he wakes up to a strange sound, stranger than anything he has ever heard. He tried for an hour to identify where it was coming from, or even what it might be, but to no avail. Eventually, exhaustion got the better of him, and he fell asleep once more.

In the morning, he ate breakfast with the monks, still thinking about the sound he heard at night. Too curious to keep quiet, he asked the monk who had opened the door if he knew anything about the phenomenon. Within instants, the hall grew silent. 

""Markus, I know the sound of which you speak, but I cannot tell you anything about it, for you are not a monk""

""Well,"" Markus replied, still itching to know the source, ""How would I become a monk?""

""You must walk every mountain of this region, learning their moods as well as your own. You must see every star in the sky, and gain their knowledge over the world. Lastly, you must rest your head on the bosom of the earth, and feel her heart beat against yours.""

Markus nodded, and continued to eat his food. Thanking the monks for their help, he made his way home. But that was not the last the monks would see of him.



Six years later, a knock once again came from the monasteries gates. The monk opened the door to a man unrecognisable. Markus had grown a scraggly beard, longer hair, and his skin has darkened from years in the outdoors. 

""I have walked every mountain and learned their moods, I have seen every star and gained all their knowledge, and I have rested my head on the bosom of the earth, and felt her heart beat against my own""

The monks gathered, to welcome Markus into their ranks. He received a cleansing shower, a new tunic, and a bed to rest in. 

At night, Markus lay awake, wondering if that sound he had heard all those years ago would occur again, and just the moment he was about to fall asleep, the sound pertruded into his mind.

At breakfast, Markus readied himself to ask the other monks about the phenomenon, but before he could say a word, he was asked to get up.

""Markus, my brother, we know why you have returned to this sanctum. Follow, and you will find the answer to all of your questions.""

Astounded, Markus swallowed his food, and went to follow the monk up a rocky path. Finally, they arrived at a large door, taller than the tallest man Markus had ever seen. 

""From here, you must go alone, Markus, and discover your purpose.""

Solemnly, Markus admired the heavy oak door, seeing each grain of every plank, the simple elegance of the carpentry. Slowly, he pushed open the door, to enter a large hall, lit by torches. He entered, not daring to look back, and stepped into the half dark. At the end of the hall, he could very faintly see a second, slightly smaller door. This one was made from ivory, white and pure, engraved with a story too ancient for Markus to read. Pushing through, he arrived in what appeared to be an identical hall, empty, with no sign of anyone having entered it in millennia. Once again, he saw yet another door. From afar, it appeared to be crafted from a white wood, sculpted into the most elusive shapes. But approaching it, Markus saw that each shape was actually an individual bone, and that the entire door was made from human skeletons, arranged in a way for them to hold their shape even under the stress of being swung open.

Markus pushed on, only to find another hall, followed by another door, and so on, each door more marvelous than the last, and each hall more plain and any before it. Eventually, after what seemed like another six years had passed, Markus came across a door like any other door. Simply made from pine wood, proportioned like any suburban door. There was nothing special whatsoever about this door, but somehow Markus knew that behind this door was the source of the sound he had been searching for for so long.

And so he opened the door, and saw with great relief that he had found his answers. He had finally found the source. But I cannot tell you what it was, for you are not a monk.",The longest joke of all time,45

They were staying at the brides parents house, as it was customary for the first few days while their living situation was sorted out.  The mother was making a delicious red sauce when the bride decided she would join her husband in bed for the first time.

&amp;#x200B;

Once she was in the bedroom her husband took his shirt off.  This was the first time she had ever seen a man without a shirt.  He was hairy as a sasquatch.  This scared the woman and she ran down stairs to her mom.  ""Momma, Momma."" she cried. ""Antonio, He's got a hairy chest momma, Hairy chest.""  The mother replied, ""It's okay baby.  A hairy chest is a good man.  Your father has a hairy chest, is a good man.""

&amp;#x200B;

She went back to bed again.  Antonio then removes his trousers and once again she is frightened by the fact that his legs are just as hairy as his chest.  Back down stairs she runs again where she sees her momma stirring the red sauce.  ""Momma, Momma, Antonio, He's a hairy from head to toes momma.""  Once again momma comforts her. ""Is okay baby.  means he is a strong man.  The hairier the stronger. Go back to bed baby""

&amp;#x200B;

Finally she is ready to lay down when Antonio pulls his socks off.  He has 5 toes on one foot and 3 on the other.  This scared her even more.  She jumps out of bed and runs down stairs again yelling until she finds momma still stirring the red sauce.  ""Momma Momma, Antonio.  Antonio has a foot and a half momma.""

Everyone on that team had a batting average of below .150, and not a single player scored a home-run. The defense was horrible; every outfielder was scared of fly-balls, the infielders couldn’t catch line drives to save their lives, and the catcher led the league in passed balls. The coaching was such a hot mess; 4 managers were fired that season, and the rest of the coaching staff had a high turnover rate as well. The GM knew next to nothing about managing a sports team, and huge contracts were given to players who were less skillful than little-leaguers. The field was poorly-maintained, the stadium was crumbling, the team practiced on a high-school softball field, the fans kept on fighting, and the broadcasters covering the team were critically panned. 

But there was one lone bright spot on that horrid team; the pitching staff. Despite the horrid defense, each starting pitcher was top notch; their ace starter led the league in strikeouts, their second-best pitcher had the lowest ERA in the league, their third-best pitcher was a knuckle-baller who was feared by every batter and drew a lot of swinging strikes, and their worst 2 starters were better than most teams’ top 2 strikers. Their bullpen was also well-renowned; analysts say that many of those relievers would do well as starters on other teams. The closer was the best in the league, and a catalyst for some freak wins. The pitching coaches were the only coaches on that team that stuck through the entire season without getting canned. 

When asked about his team’s situation at the end of a painful season, Jay-Z merely remarked:

“We’ve got 99 problems, 

but a pitch ain’t one!”",Jay-Z owned a baseball team.,4

It's the long-story format, so you can adlib as much as you like to extend it a bit, but I'll give the framework. 

You identify the person you want to execute the joke on, and learn their name if you don't know it. It works best if everyone there also knows that person's name. They'll be the target. 

Edit: your target should be a gender that has a penis. Forgot to add that. Otherwise, adjust the joke for similarly embarrassing body parts that they have. 

Begin: Three men have been best friends their entire lives, and after their 60yr doctor checkups, all find out they have terminal -insert illness here-. (I usually go with ass cancer, but obv depends on your audience). They find out they all only have a few months to live. 

Sitting around drinking, they decide that they need to do something with their lives so that they can be remembered forever. 

I've got it! Says the first friend. Let's all try and get into the Guinness book of world records! I've got (pick a body part) really long arms, maybe the longest in the world, I'll submit that! 

The second guy thinks a bit, and says ""hey yeah, I've got a huge nose! Maybe it's the longest in the world, I'll submit that!"" 

Third guy thinks for a really long time. Finally, he sadly admits ""well... I've got a tiny, tiny penis. Maybe it's the smallest penis in the world. I guess I'll submit that."" 

So, they send off their applications and wait. A few weeks pass, and they get back together because the new edition finally arrived. 

Shaking with anticipation, the second guy says ""go on! Open it, let's see if we made history!"" 

First guy slowly opens, flips to the arms section, and cheers. ""Yes! I've got the longest arms in the world!"" 

Second guy grabs the book. ""let me see!"" He flips to the nose section, and shouts ""Woo! I've got the biggest nose in the world!"" 

Last guy slowly reaches out and takes the book. He resignedly flips to the penis section, and stares at it - then suddenly, angrily shouts 

""Who the fuck is (your target's name)??""

So they stopped. George, their leader, a big burly man of 53, gets off his Harley, walks through a group of gawkers, past the StateTrooper who was trying to talk her down off the railing, and says, ""Hey Baby.....whatcha doin' up there on that railin'?""

She says tearfully, ""I'm going to commit suicide!!""

While he didn't want to appear ""sensitive,"" George also didn't want to miss this ""be-a-legend"" opportunity either so he asked ...""Well, before you jump, Honey-Babe...why don't you give ole George here your best last kiss?""

So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that ... and it was a long, deep, lingering
kiss followed immediately by another even better one.

After they breathlessly finished, George gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even
the State Trooper, and then says, ""Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had, Honey! That's a real talent you're wasting, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why are you committing suicide?""

""My parents don't like me dressing like a girl.""

As the night goes on, he quickly realizes that he's never going to make it through the night. After a few hours, he pulls off at the nearest town. He drives into the small town and stops at the first hotel on the main street. He goes inside and asks the clerk if they have any rooms available. The clerk tells him that they are all full, but there are lots of hotels on the street that should have rooms. As the man is walking out the door, the clerk adds, 
""Just don't go to the hotel at the end of the street!""
The man, walks out of the hotel and goes to the next one on the street, but receives the same response, 
""We're all full, just don't do to the hotel at the end of the street.""
One by one, the man checks every hotel in the town, and they all repeat the message,
""Don't go to the hotel down the street.""
By this time, the man is desperate for some rest, and he decides to go to the hotel down the street. When he walks in the front entrance, the entire hotel seems to sag with age. All the walls are velvet, and at the back of the entrance is a massive wooden desk with an elderly attendant behind it. The man asks the attendant if there are any available rooms, and he replies,
""There's only one room tonight, it's in the basement. Follow me""
The man follows the old man into the basement, down a flight of old creaky stairs. when they reach the room, the attendant hands him an old brass key and then heads back upstairs. The man gets to his room and heads to the shower. as he's showering, he suddenly hears a yell coming from his room,
""DONAEATEPESANDWA""
The man rushes out of the shower and looks into his room, but there's nothing there. Thinking it must just be his imagination, he decides to go to bed. Just as he's about to fall asleep, he hears the voice again,
""DONT EAT THAT PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICH""
He jumps up and turns on the lights, but again, there's no one there. As he is about to head back to bed, he notices that on the nightstand, there's a peanut butter sandwich that was not there when he went to bed. Curious, the man, decides to eat it. Just after he finishes, he hears the voice again, this time laughing, before it finally shouts,

A year later, on their first anniversary, they go out and have a lovely date night, so romantic, and at the end the husband says to the wife ""we've been married for a year now and we know each other really well, and I would love it if you would go down on me. I respect you, it won't make me think less of you I promise."" And the wife says ""I'm sorry, I'm just not comfortable with that."" 
So the husband asks again. And again. At the 5th anniversary, the 10th, 25th, and finally on the 50th he says ""we've spent 50 magical years together. You're the greatest blessing God has ever given me, and I think it would be really special if you went down on me just this once"" and she says ""ok."" She starts to go down on him.

Again, a perfect fit.  

Finally, the tailor asks the man if he’d like anything else, perhaps some socks or underwear.  Being as the man recently had surgery, he decided to get some new underwear.  The tailor looks at him and says that he will go get some 38 underwear.  The man laughs and says, “Ah, I’ve finally stumped you.

The prostitute grabbed the bear’s hand and directed him to her dingy flat, where they had sex. Soon after, the koala bear got out of bed and headed for the door.

The prostitute replied, “Everyone I have sex with has to pay. It’s in the dictionary, look it up.” 
The koala bear agreed to pull out a dictionary from one of her shelves to look up the word “prostitute”. It said: “A woman who has sex in exchange for money.”

I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was a beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered 'No, this is my first time.'  So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.  'Just a minute,' she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me to the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. 'Do these excite you?' She asked.  Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties, and lay down on a desk.  'Well come on,' she said, 'We don't have much time.' So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.  She looked at me with a bit of a frown. 'Did you put that condom on?' she asked.  I said, 'I sure did,' and held up my thumb to show her.﻿ ",My first time buying a condom,16

'yeah'


'Well, behind the screen there's a horse. He's dead serious. Put a tenner in the bowl, if you make him laugh the money is yours.'


Guy ponders for a while, downs the beer, puts the tenner in the bowl, stands up and goes behind the screen.
Not a minute had passed when a maniacal laughter erupts from behind the screen. Clearly the horse can barely keep it together.


The guy walks out, collects the money and leaves without a word.


Few weeks had passed, same guy walks in to the bar and orders a beer. As he sits he notices the bowl is full again so he turns to the barkeep and asks what's up.


'Since you left the horse won't stop laughing so now the bet is to make him stop.'


The guy downs the beer, puts the money in and goes in.


Again maybe a minute and suddenly there's a huge wail resounding from behind the screen followed by more anguish and sobbing.


The guy comes out, collects the money and turns for the door.


'HOLD ON!' Bartender shouts. 'First of all, how did you make him laugh so hard?'


'Easy' the guy says. 'I told him I have a bigger one than he.'

She was a dream!

There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister.

My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when quite near me and I got many a pleasant view. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else.

One day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived.

She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister.

I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me.""

I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house.

I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, ""We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.""

The moral of this story is: Always keep condoms in your car.",A valuable lesson,138
