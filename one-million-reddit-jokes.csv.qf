That night, the whole family is watching TV at their house, when another sex scene comes on. The boy says, ""Look, Mummy! Look Dad! They're making a cake!"" The parents, a bit drunk, simply agree, and send him to bed.

The next day, the son approaches the father and says, ""Dad, you and Mummy made a cake on the couch last night, didn't you?"" The father sheepishly replies, ""Yeah, we did, son. How did you know?""

Satan starts off strong and within the first fifteen minutes has the rough architecture of his program figured out and designed.

30 minutes in and Satan is cruising along. Satan is getting all the layers the way he wants them  and is getting ready to put the finishing touches on his program. 

As Satan is polishing off his program at the 45 minute mark the power goes out.

Satan starts his computer up and he has lost everything. 

Satan is furious but thinks to himself that it is ok because Jesus has lost power too and they will be in the same position. 

Satan is hammering away with his claws trying frantically to get his program back to where it was but God calls time and asks Satan for his program.

God Judges Satans program and it performs absolutely terribly. Satan isn't concerned due to the fact that Jesus had the same issue.

God then asks for Jesus's program and uses it. Works flawlessly.

Satan is flabbergasted as to how Jesus could recover after the power outage and asks God how it was possible.

God looks at Satan and says...

My lame joke:

""Maybe I just like flat breasted turkeys.""

Wife looks down at her chest:

""Well now I feel self-conscious... Wait, is that why you always turn me face down?""

After several weeks, he notices that none of the sheep are getting pregnant, and calls a vet for help. The vet tells him that he should try artificial insemination.
The guy doesn't have the slightest idea what this means but not wanting to display his ignorance, only asks the vet how he will know when the sheep are pregnant. The vet tells him that they will stop standing around and will lie down and wallow in the grass.
The man hangs up and gives it some thought. He comes to the conclusion that artificial insemination means he has to impregnate the sheep. So, he loads the sheep into his truck, drives them out into the woods, has sex with them all, brings them back, and goes to bed.
The next morning, he wakes and looks out at the sheep. Seeing that they are all still standing around, he concludes that the first try didn't take, and loads them in the truck again. He drives them out to the woods, bangs each sheep twice for good measure, brings them back, and goes to bed.
The next morning he wakes to find the sheep still just standing around. One more try, he tells himself, and proceeds to load them up and drive them out to the woods. He spends all day shagging the sheep and upon returning home, falls listlessly into bed.
The next morning, he cannot even raise himself from the bed to look at the sheep. He asks his wife to look out and tell him if the sheep are lying in the grass.

Sheen notices the other party guests looking shocked by his outburst. ""What?"" He says, ""dont you all get it? We made-"". Just then an over head speaker falls hitting him on the head killing him on the spot.

The party guests freak out, start yelling and screaming for 911 and an ambulance.  Two servers watch the guests with very different expressions, one aghast the other stoic.

""I cant believe he did that,"" one server said to the other. ""Why would he taunt the beast like that?""

 The other server picks up her tray of hor d'oeuvres before glancing at the clock on the mantle that read 9. ""Looks like he forgot to switch back to pacific time.""

 A man asked a waiter to take a bottle of Merlot to an attractive woman sitting alone at a table in a cozy restaurant.
So the waiter took the Merlot to the woman and said. ""The gentleman seated over there....and indicated the sender with a nod of his head wants you to have this wine. 
She stared at the wine cooly for a few seconds, not looking at the man, she decided to send a reply by note. The waiter who was standing nearby took the note to the gentleman.
The note read, "" for me to accept this bottle of wine you'd have to have a Mercedes in  your garage,  a million dollars in your bank account and 7 inches in your pants"".
After reading the note the man decided to send a reply. 
It read,""just to let you know, I have a Farrari Maranello, a BMW Z8 an Audi 8L, a Mercedes CL600, and a Porsche Turbo in my several garages"". I have a beautiful villa in the Virgin Islands, a beautiful home in Miami and a winter home in Aspen and a 10,000 acre ranch in Texas. And over 20 million dollars in my bank account.

He waits for a while. Eventually the bartender brings him his beer but before he can take a sip the bartender starts ringing a bell and shouting, ""The wolves are coming! The wolves are coming! Everybody down to the cellar."" So the guy and all the other patrons go down to the cellar and they huddle together while the bartender stands at the top of the stairs and looks through the keyhole. After an interminable wait he gives the all clear and everyone files back upstairs. 

When the guy sits back down on his stool he is surprised to find that his beer is gone. He orders another and after what seems like forever, the bartender brings it to him. As he raises the glass to his lips the bartender starts banging on his bell again. ""The wolves are coming! The wolves are coming! Everybody down to the cellar."" Frustrated, the guy puts down his beer and goes downstairs. It takes even longer this time, but eventually the bartender says it's clear and everyone heads back up. 

When he gets back to his seat the guy finds that, again, his beer is gone. He mutters a curse and orders yet another. He waits and waits. Finally the barman drops off his beer but no sooner does it hit the coaster than he starts clanging on his damnable bell. ""The wolves are coming! The wolves are coming! Everybody down to the cellar."" This time the guy is determined to drink his beer. He gives the bartender a wry smile and says, ""Not again old man. I'm going to stay right here"". The bartender tells him that he MUST go down to the cellar, but the guy stubbornly refuses. The bartender tries one final time, ""The wolves are coming. Please you can't stay here, you have to join us in the cellar.""

The guy just looks at him. ""I am NOT going downstairs again. Twice I have gone downstairs and twice I have come back to find my beer is gone. I will sit right here and I will drink this beer. If the wolves are coming, let them come."" The bartender, standing now at the open cellar door gives one last pleading look and slowly shakes his head as he closes the door, leaving the guy alone with his beer in the bar. 

Then the wolves come. And they eat him. And then they drink his beer.",The wolves are coming,0

“Then show me,” replies the interviewer.

A young game developer is killed before his time, and stands before Saint Peter.
""Because you died so young, we cannot properly judge you on your sins and virtues. Therefore, you will be allowed to choose between going to Heaven or Hell.""
Before the developer can express his dismay, St. Peter sweeps his arm and says ""Behold! A vision of Heaven!"" The developer sees endless row upon row of old people sitting at tables contentedly playing Bingo, easy listening music playing in the background, the saved happily chatting, drinking fruit punch and eating sugar cookies.
Then St. Peter says, ""And now, a vision of Hell!"" The developer sees a grand baccannal, the dammed engaged in a mass orgy, ecstatically drinking whisky and stout, eating from huge platters of meat, smoking weed, snorting cocaine, while the finest rock, R&amp;B, and pop musicians from ages past perform for the crowd. Seemingly any carnal pleasure to be had is available at the sinner's whim.
""Well, what shall it be?"", asks Peter.
The dev sighs and shrugs, ""Well, if those are my choices, I'll have to choose Hell!""
As soon as the words leave the dev's lips, the ground opens beneath his feet and he plunges into a lake of fire. As his skin burns off demons set upon him and begin to violate him in all manner thinkable and unthinkable.
The hole begins to close and the dev screams back to St. Peter ""Wait!! What is this? What happened to the big party!?""
Peter shrugs. ""Well, what did you expect to see in Hell's demo?""",A game develper goes to H*ll,9

Then he asks :


- So, what's all that money about ?


The barman says :


- Well, you put $100 in there and take 3 tests. If you manage to complete all of them, you can have all the money inside the pot.


- What are the tests then ? The man says


-First of all you need to pay, that's the rules.



The man put his 100 bucks inside the pot, and asked the barman one more time.

 

- Ok. That's what you should do.



- First: You are going to drink a full bottle of this tequila, and you are not allowed to give out a single reaction. 


- Second: There's a pitbull out there, he has a sore tooth and it seems like it's hurting him a lot. You need to extract the said tooth with your bare hands. 


- Third : there's a 90 year old woman in the second floor, she never had an orgasm in her life. Your task is to make her hit it.


Without thinking too much, the man rapidly asked :



- Where's the tequila ?



The barman gave him the bottle, and at the same time, the man started to drink it fast enough so he wouldn't give out a single reaction. 


Then, after getting up with some difficulty, looked at everyone in the bar, and with a brave look on his face, he ran through the door leading to the pitbull.



Everyone heard the dog's barks, the man's yells, and everything in between, until the pitbull let out a howl for 3 long minutes, followed by a huge silence.


Everyone assumed the guy was dead, but then, he enters the bar, with scratches all over his body and asks :

At the end of the night's performance and in an area close to the first complaint, however, a second lady bent down and whispered in his ear, ""Sir, I was groped during the performance!"" This time, he knew it had to be taken care of soon.

A few guests had remained in the opera house, and he decided to go back and question them to see if they had any knowledge of what was going on.

He found one old man crawling along the opera house floor underneath the seats and stooped down to question him. ""Excuse me, sir, can I help you?""

Folks generally aren't very creative in choosing names for their dogs.

That's why there are so many named Rover and Spot.

But, have you heard the plight of the fellow who thought he'd be cute and named his  dog Sex?

It goes like this:
""One day Sex and I took a walk and he ran away from me. I spent hours looking for that dog. A policeman came by and asked what I was doing in this alley at midnight? I told him I was looking for Sex.
My case comes up next Tuesday.""

""But, that ain't the worst part.... 
One day, I went to the town hall to get a dog license for Sex. 
The clerk asked me what I wanted. I told him I wanted a license for Sex. 
He said, 'I'd like to have one, too.'
Then, I said, 'You don't understand. She's a dog.'
He said he didn't care how she looked.
When I told him I'd had Sex since I was 5, he said, “You must have been an early bloomer.""

""When I decided to get married, I told the minister I wanted to have Sex at the wedding. He told me I'd have to wait until after the wedding. When I protested that Sex had played a big part in my life and that my whole life revolved around Sex, he said he didn't want to hear about my personal life.""

""After my wife and I were married, I took the dog with us on the honeymoon. When I checked into the hotel, I told the clerk I wanted a room for my wife and wanted one for Sex. 
She said. 'Every room in the hotel was for sex.' 
I said, 'You don't understand. Sex keeps me awake at night.' 
The clerk said, 'Me, too.' ""

""When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. When I told the Judge I had Sex before I was married, he grinned and said, “ Me. too.""

""Now that I've been thrown in jail, married, divorced and had more trouble with that dog than I ever imagined, I'm in counseling. My psychiatrist asked me what my problem was. I said 'Sex has died and left my life... . It's like losing a best friend and I'm so lonely,' I told him.

He said, “Look, you and I both know that sex isn't man's best friend. Get yourself a dog."" ",A dog named Sex,342

The bull was grazing on the grass, the pheasant was picking ticks off the bull.

Then the pheasant looked at a huge tree which was at the edge of the field, and very nostalgically said, ""Alas, there was a time when I could fly to the top most branch of the tree, but today I do not have the strength even to fly to the first branch of the tree""
The bull very nonchalantly said, ""That's no problem! Eat a little bit of my dung every day, you will see, within a fortnight's time you will reach the top of the tree.""
The pheasant said, ""Oh, come off it! How is that possible?""
The bull replied, ""Really, please try and see. The whole humanity is on it, you could try, too.""
Very hesitantly, the pheasant started pecking at the dung, and lo, on the very first day it reached the first branch of the tree. In a fortnight's time, it reached the topmost branch of the tree.

He looks perfect in every way, except for a scar on his clavicle. He's ashamed of that region. Never shows it, so no tank top, half-naked shenanigans. As a result, no one ever knew about his scar. They all call him Mr. Perfect, because he is, well, perfect in their eyes. Till one day, his shirt got stuck on a branch and ripped a perfect line down his shoulders, exposing his blemish. The whole world stopped, everyone stared, everyone saw. The entire planet was in shambles! Mr. Perfect was no longer the perfect human everyone thought he was. Ashamed, Mr. Perfect started a life of seclusion, never seen for many many years. 

About 7 years passed and a young Janet says ""Hey dad, I didn't know there were angels on earth!"" Gazing in the far distance where his daughter pointed, you know it. Mr. Perfect's back, more glowy and beautiful than ever before, and this time, rocking a casual tank top, exposing his mountain of muscles. A crowd began to gather, marvelling at the second coming of Mr. P. He stood tall and proud, looking like he never aged a day. What the people also noticed, was that his scar was gone! People began to doubt if he even had one in the first place. With his now perfect appearance, many voted him Mr Universe. He had looks that could end worldwide conflict, poverty and hunger. 

Uncontested in looks, he began entering all sorts of beauty contests, for the fame and for the money. Needless to say, he won all of them. Out of nowhere, another name emerged in the perfect department. A newbie, sweeping the minor contests that Mr. P did not consider worth his time. It turns out, that they were both to be competing in the finals for Mr. P's last ever beauty contest. Being the richest man ever, Mr. P looked forward to a wonderful retirement after his one final win. 

Mr. P saw his competition the few hours before they were to be on stage together for the first time. He began to sweat, this new guy was actually on his level! While Mr. P was getting ready for his appearance, he noticed his scar resurfacing. All these years, he's been hiding it under layers and layers of special makeup. The 7 years he spent in hiding, were dedicated to the making of it. However, upon seeing the tough competition he had to face, coupled with the sweltering hot dressing room, the makeup started to smear and dribble down, revealing what he had fought so hard to cover. No worries, his shirt'll cover it, he assured himself repeatedly. 

Now, in this final competition, there were multiple rounds. Mr. P of course, easily won most of them, like the best hairstyle and best everyday fashion. However, being on the same level as Mr. P, the competition became really tight and close, with the newbie closing in on the number of wins. Finally the last round of the competition came. At the same time, the large ceiling fan turned on, blowing against his shirt, exposing his skin! What timing! This occurred right as the emcee announced, ""And the best award for neckwear goes to"" 
Everyone's eyes were drawn to Mr. P, knowing he had this in the bag, at the same time, his scar was exposed in full view of every single person in the auditorium. Silence broken, gasps erupted, screams filled the entire room! The audience was amazed, confused, angered at the same time because

""Would you look at that! It's a tie!""",Mr. Perfect,0

We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road. The chicken is either with us or it is against us. There is no middle ground here.

**AL GORE**
I invented the chicken. I invented the road. Therefore, the chicken
crossing the road represents the application of these two different
functions of government in a new, reinvented way designed to bring greater services to the American people.

**HANS BLIX**
We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed access to the other side of the road.


**MOHAMMED ALDOURI** (Iraq's ambassador to the UN)
The chicken did not cross the road. This is a complete fabrication. We don't even have a chicken.

**SADDAM HUSSEIN**
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on the chicken.


**HELEN CLARK**
Unless the chicken had UN approval to cross, this is a blatant breach of international law.


**MARIAN HOBBS**
Chickens must get resource consent to cross roads. Officials from the Ministry for the Environment will investigate the activities of this chicken.


**DR. SEUSS**
Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, The chicken crossed the road, But why it crossed, I've not been told!


**ERNEST HEMINGWAY**
To die. In the rain. Alone.


**MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.**
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.


**JOHN LENNON**
Imagine - chickens crossing roads everywhere - in peace.


**FOX MULDER**
You saw it cross the road with your own eyes! How many more chickens have to cross before you believe it?

**BILL GATES**
I have just released e-Chicken 2003, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook - and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.

**ALBERT EINSTEIN**

The letter read:

Dear God,
I am an 83 year old widow, living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had $100 in it, which was all the money I had until my next pension payment.

Next Sunday is Christmas, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner. Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with, have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope.

Can you please help me?

Sincerely, Edna

The postal worker was touched. He showed the letter to all the other workers. Each one dug into his or her wallet and came up with a few dollars. By the time he made the rounds, he had collected $96, which they put into an envelope and sent to the woman.

The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of Edna and the dinner she would be able to share with her friends.
Christmas came and went. A few days later, another letter came from the same old lady to God.

All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened. 

It read:

Dear God,

How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me?
Because of your gift of love, I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day and I told my friends of your wonderful gift.

By the way, there was $4 missing. I think it might have been those bastards at the post office.

The next morning, in court, matters were made worse when witness after witness came to the stand testifying to all sorts of horrible threats that the accused made to his wife.

Finally, Jeff's lawyer got up to the stand. “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have something quite exciting to tell you. If you would all please direct your attention towards the door behind me on my left, you will see the supposedly dead woman walk in on her own two feet.” 
There was a loud murmuring in the courtroom as all eyes turned towards the door. After a few seconds of anxious waiting, the lawyer said, “To be honest with you, nobody is going to be walking through the door. However, the fact that your eyes all turned towards the door makes it quite obvious that you are not sure beyond the shadow of a doubt about my client’s guilt."" Pleased with his closing statement, the lawyer contentedly sits back for the verdict.
To his surprise, the jury decided that the man was guilty. “But how could you say that he is guilty?  Didn’t I prove it to you?” questioned the lawyer.

Unfortunately they were outnumbered by the cannibalistic tribesman 5 to 1. They were eventually forced to surrender. 
Defeated, the explorers were bound together and gagged by the tribesman, who carried off the three men to be taken as tribute to their chief. 
The men were displayed before the chief for all the village to see. Having heard of the explorers' difficult capture the chief sat in thought for a few moments. Finally he stood and addressed his captives.
""My tribesman tell me you three killed many warriors before they were able to capture you and bring you before me."" The chief said in conveniently perfect English. ""To honor their sacrifice I have decided that, after we kill you, we will use your skins to make a ceremonial canoe in their memory.""  
The village cheered.
""However,"" the chief continued ""I am a just and honorable chief. Because you fought so bravely I will allow you to choose the way you die.""
With a wave of his hand the chief commanded the first explorer be untied and set before him.
""How do you wish to die?"" The chief asks.
This explorer was a Frenchman so he said, ""Give me a knife.""
The chief complied.
The Frenchman shouts out, ""Vive la France!"" And slits his throat.
The chief gestures to the next explorer.
This man was a Spaniard and by no means was going to be out patrioted by a Frenchman. ""Give me a knife!"" He demanded.
The chief complied. 
With all the gusto he could manage the Spaniard shouts out, ""Long live the king of Spain!"" And he too slits his throat.
Satisfied the chief gestures that the final explorer be brought to him.
""And how do you wish to die?"" The chief asked.
This man was an Englishman. He sat for a minute pondering when suddenly he says, ""Give me a fork."" 
The chief gave him a puzzled look but conveniently these cannibals both speak English and eat with forks, so the chief complied and gave him a fork.
The Englishman cracks a smile and holds the fork up in the air. Suddenly he plunges it into his chest over and over again until his entire torso was riddled with tiny holds. Having done the job the Englishman slouches down and with his last dying breath says... ""Fuck your canoe."" ",3 explorers are ambushed by cannibals...,10

He notices a jar on the bar full of 20 dollar bills and asks the bartender what's up with it. The bartender tells him put a 20 in and he'll give him three tasks, upon completion he'd receive the jar of money. The guy thinks this to be obsurd and decides to keep drinking after a few more shots he can't take it anymore and puts a 20 in the jar. The bartender gives him his three tasks.
1. Chug an entire bottle of liquor  (his choice)
2. There's a pit bull out back that needs a tooth pulled, pull it.
3. There's an elderly woman upstairs that hasn't had an orgasm in a very long time, make her feel like a woman again.
The guy, pretty drunk at this point, goes for the choice of liquor. Picks his favorite whiskey and downs it. He heads out back to the pit bull. There's a lot of barking and screaming and about 15-20 minutes later he comes back and yells to the bartender...""ok, where's the old lady with the absess tooth?""","A guy walks into a bar (I know original, right?)",82
post,5kn7ql,2qh72,jokes,false,1482885503,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/5kn7ql/a_man_wakes_up_in_a_dingy_slum/,self.jokes,,"with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.
""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""
All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.
The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""
So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.
""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.
While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""
Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.
And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""
The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.
Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.
The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.
Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.
""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.
The beggar replied, ""I think this is a repost.""","A man wakes up in a dingy slum,",0

Then, he saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow. It was addressed, 'Dad'. With the worst premonition, he opened the envelope and read the letter, with trembling hands.

Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy. She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight Motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it!

Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

The drivers agrees, "" You're right, as your driver I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference at your place.""
""That's a great idea ! "" says Eistein,"" lets switch places then !""
So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein go on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.
But in the crowd, there was one scientist who wanted to impress everyone and thought of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he wouldn't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupt the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.
The driver looks at him, dead in the eye and says :
""Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.""",Einstein and driver,255
