## 

We have always been such a happy couple and everything was fine for 3 years straight. Of course I always felt comfortable in front of her and felt like I can tell her anything. That's where I was wrong.

A few months ago I noticed that she became annoyed by my dumb jokes that were only funny to me, but that just made it even funnier to me so I continued telling all these dad jokes to her and died laughing every time.

She puts up with it because she loves me. At least I thought so.

We were always 100% honest with each other and I'm still shaken by the things she told me today.

I sent her probably one of my worst dad jokes ever (that I stole from reddit), and she just couldn't take it anymore and told me how stupid my jokes are and that she doesn't know if she'll be able to put up with it much longer.

But that's not the worst part, I actually appreciated her honesty and considered the possibility to stop with all the stupid jokes and become more serious in the relationship.

The worst part is that she lied to me for the first time in all these years. I felt like I just couldn't trust her anymore and everything I thought I knew about her as a person just became questionable. I need your advice on how to react to this huge lie...

post,c0nfsy,2qh72,jokes,false,1560536486,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/c0nfsy/its_a_shit_joke/,self.jokes,,"I have recently made one of the biggest mistakes in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.

No, I was not constipated. This was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny balls of shit were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my ass-cheeks. It led to much frustration, with me knowing that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butt hair dwelling place. Eventually I would have to do one of two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its 'Can't-Be-Flushed' threshold.

As I was contemplating this problem, I had what seemed at the time to be a brilliant idea. ""Hey, this is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair all together, and then my crap will flow out like beer from a keg!` I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements, things like ""How many Indians could there be?` said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!` by JFK, or ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!` by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occasionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled; satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know?
I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two ass-cheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.

Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic shit- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. And I mean it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.

Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4-block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""

Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair, ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my ass-cheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum-sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.

As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing back in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a Brillo pad. Well, that's what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.

All I can say is friends don't shave your ass hair!",It's a shit joke,4

The other, more senior commander, goes by Brutus Quintus. He also has highly trained men under his command but he never goes anywhere without a unit of half-naked northern men painted blue. They are, in fact, a group of Pictish barbarians.

On the morning of the battle Marcus Maximus charges forward and destroys the Gauls almost immediately. It is total supremacy on the battlefield and Brutus Quintus just watches it all happen silently without committing a single soldier to the battle.

The following morning the army awakes and there, through some sorcery, is the Gaul army untouched and waiting again for battle. Again Marcus Maximus leads his troops into the fight and wipes out the Gauls only to awaken the next morning to find them magically waiting again.

Five days running Marcus defeats the Gauls and yet each morning his victory is undone by the magics of the Gauls.

Finally on the sixth day Brutus Quintus lines up his troops with his Pictish barbarians in the vanguard. They charge into the Gauls wiping them out. The next morning Marcus Maximus awakens ready to taunt Brutus for his failure but there on the field of battle is all the evidence of the defeated Gauls. Somehow, Brutus Quintus has defeated the Gauls and their magic.

Marcus Maximus looks to Brutus Quintus and asks him, ‚ÄúHow did you undo these magics.‚Äù

Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

/ till the ocean grew dim...

and the earth itself...

began to shrink...

past our moon...

and on...

and Mars...

and on...

higher, and higher...

through the asteroid belt...

and on and on towards the diving board...

past the outer planets, until...

on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...

he reached the board.

He climbed on top and radioed the captain...

and then...

.' '.

he jumped.

faster, and faster,

through the asteroid belt,

past Mars,

and the moon,

faster,

and faster,

faster - ever faster,

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster,

past the albatross,

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

DOWN!

THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!

THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL.........

SMASH!

Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping...

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...

I'm a just poor tramp...

so you must understand...

I've been through many a hard ship in my life.""

The end",There was this tramp... (possibly world's longest joke),21

The god of that pond then showed a golden axe and asked the woodcutter if it was his, the woodcutter said no. The same happened with a silver axe and he only said yes when he was shown the wooden axe, that was his. The god, happy with his honesty, rewarded the woodcutter with all 3 axes.

Jim, as a kid, was very influenced by this story. He grew up to be a honest man, who would only reap what he had sown. 

One day, as he was chopping wood as usual, his axe fell into a ditch. He was heartbroken. The axe was his only source of income. As he kept crying by the ditch, a kind of angel appeared from inside the ditch and asked him why he was crying. 

Jim told everything to the angel, to which she replied,‚ÄùWell then, stop crying. I can bring your axe out of the ditch.‚Äù and disappeared for a few minutes.

She later came back with an axe. It was golden. Jim was overwhelmed. It was finally happening. All his life, he had been honest, now he would be rewarded for it.

The angel said,‚ÄùHere take your axe.‚Äù

Jim, who had rehearsed this moment for hundreds of times, said,‚ÄùNo. That isn‚Äôt my axe. It wasn‚Äôt golden.‚Äù

post,c0hjde,2qh72,jokes,false,1560499684,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/c0hjde/the_worlds_worst_joke/,self.jokes,,"In Plymouth there was a large aquarium, it was the pride of the town and had a worldwide reputation. Despite the decline in the fishing industry the tourism from the aquarium had bolstered the economy and prevented the town from slipping into the local recession that had struck many places along the same stretch of coast.  
  
There were long halls full of crabs and eels and creatures from the deep of every description. All these long halls converged to a large central tank that contained the centre piece of the entire aquarium. Living within this vast tank were some of the oldest and rarest creatures housed anywhere on earth. There was a dolphin with 3 dorsel fins, a large walrus with tusks in the shape of the last 2 popes, a thin frail porpoise that was said to be 250 years old, and a giant squid that was every colour of the rainbow.  
  
It was just last year that a startling thought came to the mayor of the town. He had been on his annual tour to show his appreciation for the aquarium when it dawned on him that there was little or no security overseeing the towns aquatic asset.  
  
During a hurried conference with the directors overseeing the facility he demanded that more stringent measures be put in place to safeguard this hub of the tourist industry.  
  
The scheme was an all round winner as not only did it provide the much needed security, it also gave the directors a chance to get themselves in the papers yet again. The mayor turned the whole thing into a political publicity coup by ensuring that five local fisherman who had lost their jobs through the fishing decline all became the new security force at the aquarium.  
  
And so it was that Bob, Jim, Geoff, Bernard, and Sid all regularly patrolled the empty halls of the aquarium to ensure that no intruders ever made their way in to steal, disturb or damage the livestock.  
  
A few weeks into the scheme, the tourists began to complain of small bags and wrappers on the floor and left on the edges of the tanks each day. Fearing any bad publicity, the directors quickly hauled in all five security guards and asked them to be extra vigilant in ensuring no people left any litter behind. The guards said that they would do their best.  
  
The problem persisted and so the directors secretly installed security cameras in order to track down the culprits. The first morning that the tapes were viewed quickly established that it was the guards themselves that were the secret litter bugs.  
  
In a heated meeting, the directors banned all food being brought onto the premises by any staff and the guards had a weeks wages docked from their pay.  
  
Sleeping through the hot summer days and going hungry through the long nights soon began to became a drag. One particularly long night all five guards met near the central tank - hungry, tired, and exhausted.  
  
""I need food,"" whimpered Bob.  
""We could always eat the fish,"" suggested Sidney.  
""Don't be stupid,"" said Geoff.  
""Lets all stay calm,"" said Bernard.  
""I've been thinking,"" said Jim, thoughtfully.  
""Haven't we all,"" responded Geoff, ""there's nothing else to do round here but think. I'm all thunk out.""  
""No, Look,"" continued Jim. ""Here we all are famished, and there's a snack machine just over there.""  
""Oh, security guards vandalising the snack machine, that'll go down a treat,"" said Bob, sarcastically.  
Jim sighed. ""No one need ever know.""  
""And what about the camera pointing straight at it?"" asked Bernard.  
""Aha, but there's no camera pointing at the back of it!"" announced Jim.  
Sidney looked on in despair. ""Do you not think that has something to do with the fact that you would have to walk across the water of the main tank in order to reach the back of it? You idiot!""  
""And what would we do with the wrappers?"" Said Bob nervously. ""There's talk of them searching us all soon, every morning!""
Jim smiled a long cunning smile. ""As I said, I've been thinking. We can drop the wrappers into the tank itself, no one will ever see them.""  
Geoff was only half convinced. ""There's still the matter of getting across the water without getting completely soaked.""  
""I've thought of that, watch this..."" Jim walked over to the tank and splashed the water while listening.  
  
As the others all watched in amazement, the prize animals of the aquarium all swam to the surface and made their way over to the crowd of men. Without even blinking, Jim removed his shoes and socks, rolled up his trousers, and then climbed aboard the walrus with the papal tusks. A difficult journey across the tank then ensued, followed by the even more difficult task of unscrewing the back of a snacks machine whilst astride a large walrus.  
  
The pair were soon back safely across and the walrus was rewarded with a Crunchie, which it seem to enjoy. The men all enjoyed a feast of snacks and fizzy drinks and slipped the rubbish into the tank to sink out of view.  
  
The next night, Bob said he would perform the ride as it looked like fun. He rippled his hand in the water and all the animals swam over with a look of pining on their faces. Bob chose the triple-finned dolphin and made his way to the machine. He selected a range of snacks for his colleagues and the dolphin chose a Twix.  
  
The next night was more of the same with Sidney opting to perform the ride and the multi-coloured giant squid choosing a Snickers ice cream.  
  
The following night, Bernard decided to give it a go and took the orders off all his colleagues. He was about to sit on the small frail porpoise when Geoff grabbed him back.  
  
""Don't sit on that ancient thing"" snapped Geoff.  
""What?"" asked Bernard.  
""He's right"" said Jim. ""That creature is over 250 years old and very weak, if we were to kill it by riding it, that would ruin the little scheme we have going here. I say we never use this creature, the others are all strong enough anyway.""  
So Bernard rode across on the walrus and everyone was happy.  
  
Several months later, after a set of extraordinary circumstances, David Attenborough was sitting in the offices of the aquarium directors. The directors apologised for disturbing his busy schedule and explained that they had discovered something amazing and he was the only man on earth that might be able to explain the event.
  
They explained at how concerned they had become that the level of outgoing snacks had risen sharply and yet the financial takings from the machines had dropped significantly. They had also noticed that the animals in the central tank had become increasingly tired and their appetites had dropped.  
  
They had not connected the two at all at first. However, when they reviewed the footage of the security cameras, they found that nothing out of the ordinary seemed to be happening to any of the machines. Then one of the directors suddenly noticed that during the night something funny seemed to happen near the machine by the central tank. Although nothing seemed to happen to the machine itself, there were signs of large ripples in the water nearby just in view at the corner of the screen. A quick check of that stock record showed that this was the machine that had lost the most stock out of them all.  
  
""And this is why we have called you in Mr. Attenborough, the only explanation we have is that the animals in the central tank are actually stealing snacks from the rear of the snacks machine. We even found that they have hidden the rubbish in the bottom of their tank.""  
  
David Attenborough agreed that it was all very exciting and that he would love to help out in any way he could. The directors said they were planning to open up 24 hours so that people could visit at night and watch the amazing creatures perform their daring raids.  
  
Mr. Attenborough wasn't so sure. Too much human attention straight away could frighten the animals and make them stop their nightly snack swims. He suggested that the best idea would be to set up a hidden BBC film crew to film the animals at work. It could be broadcast live across the world and so give the directors the publicity they sought. if the animals slowly got comfortable witha human presence then night opening could follow later.  
  
The directors thought this was brilliant. They also decided not to tell the security guards as the idiots would probably get a bit camera hungry and try and hog the limelight. It was thought best to just to leave the guards to wander round as normal, oblivious to the global spotlight suddenly focused on the central tank.  
  
And so it was that on the fateful night that over a billion people worldwide tuned in to stare at the grainy night vision camera shots as the world waited to witness the moment the animals would display their dazzling intelligence tricks in order to find food.  
  
The directors all sat round a TV with the champagne nearby, all ready to toast the 8th wonder of the world right here in their aquarium in Plymouth.  
  
Words like shock, disgust, and outrage don't nearly go far enough in describing what the directors felt when they witnessed the hulking fat form of Bernard slump himself onto the rarest dolphin in existence and proceed to waggle the creature across the water before performing a blatant act of vandalism mixed with insider company theft.  
  
David Attenborough was deeply disappointed and annoyed at someone of his age and standing being made to hide in the cold darkness for nothing. The world watching at home found the whole thing to be very funny, but the amusement would only last for one night and it certainly wasn't going to pull the crowds in.  
  
The very next morning, all five guards were summoned to hear of their instant dismissal and to explain/plead why the company shouldn't have them all locked up on criminal charges.  
  
The guards selected Jim as their spokesman, as he was the most clever, and besides which, he'd got them all into this mess in the first place. The directors took several minutes to calm themselves down before oen of them spoke.  
  
""How? just How? how... How could you?"" he finally exploded.  
""We're all very sorry. Really, we are."" Jim hesitantly replied.  
""Sorry? you humiliate this company in front of the entire world and you say you're sorry!""  
""Yes. We cannot say how sorry we are.""  
""We hired you to keep the place nice and you just littered it!""  
""We're sorry about that.""  
""So we take away your messy snacks and you go behind our backs...""  
""We're sorry about that as well.""  
""...And, without a care, you steal from this company...""  
""And we're very sorry about that.""  
""And you selfishly drop your grubby litter into the main tank of the aquarium...""

He is named the Amazing Octodad, seriously it's on his T-shirt. He heads to the bar, gets a beer and waits for the music to stop. A cute blonde gives a weird wtf look when a tentacle starts wriggling over to tickle her leg but Octodad just winks and says, ""This is my friend Octobud. He's a musician."" She giggle's and goes about her business. Octodad discreetly pulls a chair closer while the music plays. It's an open mic night so all kinds of people with different instruments want to get up and jam.

When the song is over Octodad stands up on the chair and proclaims, ""My name is Octodad and this here is my pet octopus and he can play any instrument at all!"" People guffaw. Pfft, yea right buddy, get lost. ""I'm serious!"" He shouts. ""His name is Octobud and I'll bet anyone in here $50 he can play any instrument you put in front of him!""

The crowd giggles and stirs as expected for a couple of minutes while the mood kind of settles until the trumpet player, just walking off stage says, ""All right man. Let's see what your little buddy can do!""

Octobud picks up the trumpet, wipes off the mouthpiece (because ew jazz players), and begins to trumpet out a medley so soothing and soft one girl even starts crying. People are shocked when the song is over. Jaw dropped staring at an octopus on a bar.

Octodad takes the $50 off the table. ""Any others want to try and stump my little friend here?"" And the crowd piles forward cheering and reaching for their money and any weird instruments they brought with them. People are running out the door to run home and get instruments like that weird thing with strings Aunt Bertha brought back from Uganda that one time....

A trombone was next. Dude thought OG'Puss couldn't reach(dabbingoctopus.jpg). Wrong. Cello player thinking Octobud couldn't use his suckers on a neck. Wrong. The house drummer actually tried. Like c'mon man it's a frigging octopus, of course he nails the drums. Gloriously.

Now while all this was going on it was a peaceful night outside. Old Angus Mc'Cloud saw the octopus come in and heard Octodad sing his little buddies praises. That brought on a smirk when he heard that.

...off to home he went...

On Angus's way back into the bar with a sack under his arm, little Octobud was really starting to draw a crowd! People were still cramming into the place to watch that little slimy dude play some crazy lick's man!

Upon entering there was a cacophony of maracas and tambourines, and somehow a cymbal from the ceiling fan, being played by Octobud who is now on stage and people are cheering him on. Good\_times.woodcut

So when the song is over Angus takes his bag from under his arm and heads for the stage. ""Ay ye wee cunt. Ae wanna see ya trinnea play a diddly on this little doozy."" \*record scratch\* Nobody has seen bagpipes in that bar since that time in 1994 when those tourists got lost on the way to that wedding Carl was supposed to cater for...

The crowd is hushed. Octobud is inspecting the bagpipes, tilting his head left and right, blinking a little too hard maybe... Octodad leans over and kind of whispers, ""Hey bud, c'mon. You can play this right?"" To which Octobud replies,

""Play it?! As soon as I figure out how to get its pajama's off I'm going to fuck it!!""",The Octopus Joke Retold,11

The day finally came, but she encountered an unexpected turn of events. Instead of giving birth to one child, she unknowingly had identical twins. Knowing they couldn't support the two boys, the family decided they must give one up for adoption. They would name their child Juan.

*

Twelve years pass, Juan has grown up to be a wonderful basketball player, and his parents are very proud of him. But they still have an itching temptation to tell Juan of his backstory.

After a while of discussion, they decide to give him the news. When his parents finish, Juan is overwhelmed, yet excited. He tries his best to reach out and try to find his twin.

After searching for some time, he finally tracks his twin down. He had been adopted by a Muslim family at two months old, and his family had named him Amahl. Amahl had also found a way into basketball, and enjoyed many of the same activities as Juan.

Bursting with excitement, he begs his parents to travel to America and meet him. Sadly, after contacting Amahl's parents, they learn that neither family has enough money to travel to the other's country.

But then, during a phone call with Juan's father, the Muslim father has an epiphany.

""We don't need to meet up.""

""Why not?""

""Well, our kids look exactly the same, both love basketball, and enjoy all the same activities. We don't need to see the other.""

Oh I wish I had boobs that would wobble
Mine just stay still in one place
In the breast hall of fame
You won't see my name
For my boobs there would be a disgrace

Sure boobs of my size have their merit
They're easy to fit with a bra
And when I go for a dip
You won't see one slip out
They stay put just where they are

And I'm not one to seek much attention
So you won't find me strutting about
In a boob tube that's trying
by gravity defying
to leave no room, not even for doubt

But I sure envy big breasted women
I've seen them at parties you know
With all confidence thrust
In their mighty big bust
Entrancing the men as they go

Though I've heard from a big bosomed buddy
That it's not all it's cracked up to be
She says in frustration
""Try to hold conversation
When there's only two things a guy sees""

Now if I paid a few grand to enlarge them
To, say thirty-six b or c
Would they still look so natural
And could I class them as collateral
Sorta like home improvements on me

Now I've not taken this boob thing just lightly
I've done quite a bit of research
As I try to keep abreast
In my mammary quest
I've found there's a bit to be learned

There's questions that need to be answered
Like cleavage, how wide and how deep
I can have nipples bigger
But somehow I figured
That could poke Sweetie's eye in his sleep

Oh, I wish I had boobs that were awesome
I'd buy a bright red bathing suit
On the beach I would run
In slow motion for fun
To show off my best attribute

Now don't think I'd just get them for vanity
There's much I'd aspire to do
I could feed many babies
When I was lactating
And for convenience, I could offer drive-thru

In a t-shirt I'd test air conditioning
They could 'see' if they had it too low
And if I stood outside
My breasts pumped up with pride
Police'd use me to stop traffic flow

Well you can see I've a lot to consider
For the big plunge, I need some more time
So I'll keep you updated
But for now they're just fated
To stay as they are for a while

And there's my sweetie who totally accepts me
For he loves each and every little bit
He says ""stay as you are
You're the most beautiful by far""
As he gazes into my eyes not my tits",NSFW: Boobs,0

in the breeze!

""Captain, captain, what do we do?"" asked the first mate.  

""First mate,"" said the captain, ""go to my cabin, open my sea 
chest, and bring me my red shirt.""  The first mate did so. 

Wearing his bright red shirt, the captain exhorted his crew to 
fight.  So inspiring was he, in fact, that the pirate ship was repelled 
without casualties.  

A few days later, the ship was again approached, this time by two 
pirate sloops!  

""Captain, captain, what should we do?""

""First mate, bring me my red shirt!""

The crew, emboldened by their fearless captain, fought heroically, and 
managed to defeat both boarding parties, though they took many 
casualties.  That night, the survivors had a great celebration.  The 
first mate asked the captain the secret of his bright red shirt. 

""It's simple, first mate.  If I am wounded, the blood does not 
show, and the crew continues to fight without fear.""

A week passed, and they were nearing their home port, when 
suddenly the lookout cried that ten ships of the enemy's armada were 
approaching!  

""Captain, captain, we're in terrible trouble, what do we do?""  
The first mate looked expectantly at the miracle worker. 

Pale with fear, the captain commanded, ""First mate.... bring me my
brown pants!""",Seems there was a treasure ship on its way back to port.,6

He calls the female owner to get the best girls together for him to choose from. 

""My name‚Äôs John. I have a billion dollars and a twelve inch penis. I want the most youthful yet mature, intelligent and beautiful seductress who can satisfy my every wish. However, I don't think you'll even be able to meet a single one of my criteria."" He ended with a smirk and an arrogant glint in his eyes.

""Our establishment is the best in the city, which means it's also the best in the country. We have never failed to satisfy any customer that comes here."" She calls her top three hookers to line up before him. 

""This here is Angela, our most intelligent girl. She has a PhD in Biochemistry and a Master‚Äôs in Econometrics.""

Angela was true to her name: she was angelic in both her comportment and appearance. With inquisitiveness and learning deep set in her eyes, it wasn‚Äôt hard to believe that she did truly possess the qualifications claimed.

""What's the seventh law of quantum mechanical cybernetics?""

""I'm sorry sir, my degrees aren‚Äôt related to that, I'm afraid I can't answer your ques...""

""Nonsense! You can't even answer such a basic question! You'd need to be ten times smarter for me to fuck you!""

Understandably the proprietor and the girls were angered by his outburst. But there was nothing they could do as they still wanted his business. Besides, they were practically immune to such misogynistic comments about intellectual superiority. 

""The next girl is Bridgette. She's the most beautiful woman in town. She even won the national beauty pageant a few years ago."" 

Indeed, Bridgette was exquisitely beautiful, with skin as smooth as silk and hair flowing as lusciously as a heavenly waterfall. Eyes as alluring as diamonds, lips as inviting as cocaine, no mortal male should‚Äôve been able to resist her temptations. Her voluptuous figure was thinly hidden behind a crimson dress that accentuated her radiance. Without a doubt, she was one of the most beautiful women in the world.

John sauntered over and scrutinized her body as if inspecting furniture, crassly lifting up her clothes and touching her skin. Although Bridgette voiced her discomfort, he didn't seem to care at all.

""I counted three moles on your back. What a disgrace, to think that you would qualify to be the most beautiful woman in this place! You‚Äôd have to be ten times more beautiful for me to fuck you!‚Äù 

It was one thing to insult a woman‚Äôs intelligence, but to insult her beauty? All four of the women were collectively imagining all sorts of methods of murdering this insolent prick with their stilettos, but as his right to speech was protected under the First Amendment, they could do nothing in practice. Yet, they harboured some faint hope that the last of them could meet his criteria‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThe last girl here is Celine. She‚Äôs the most mature and elegant out of all the young girls here in Vegas.‚Äù

‚ÄúHi there, I‚Äôd love to lead you‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough! Do you take me for a fool? I can clearly see the signs of aging! Especially that crease on your forehead that‚Äôs a sure mark of you already becoming a hag! You‚Äôd have to be ten times younger for me to fuck you!‚Äù

So Sam did something he rarely did, went to the local church, knelt down, and prayed.

""God,"" he said, ""I've been a good man all my life.  I've worked hard, I'm raising my children well, I love my wife.  But I've fallen on hard times. Please, God, help me to win the lottery"".

A few days later he goes back to the church.

""Hi, God, it's me again, Sam.  I'm still down on my luck, there's no sign of me being able to get a job.  I'm a good man, and have been all my life.  I only ask you this one thing, to please help me win the lottery"".

A few more days pass, and Sam is back in the church.  He's not so happy, though.

""God, it's Sam.  I'm almost at rock bottom here. And I've only asked you this one small thing. Why, God, haven't you helped me?""

With this a voice boomed from the heavens:

SAM, YOU'VE GOT TO MEET ME HALF WAY HERE.  GO AND BUY A FUCKING TICKET!

‚ÄòJust a minute,‚Äô she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‚ÄòDo these excite you?‚Äô She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‚ÄòWell, come on‚Äô, she said, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt have much time.‚Äô So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and BOOM, I was done within a few moments.

Being a professional, the archaeologist took the book back to his prestigious university, which was home to several leaders of certain fields. To research the book's power in a controlled manner, the archaeologist rounds up three of the university's brightest minds. A researcher of Astrophysics, who had led the field for many years and had produced many papers theorising cosmic events was first. The archaeologist told him to ask the book one question, and to document whether the response was accurate.

The astrophysicist thought for a moment and asked the book ""What was existence like before the Big Bang?""

The archaeologist opened the book and showed the physicist, and he instantly went insane and began scrawling equations on the nearest pad of paper, mumbling distressed words to himself.

Shocked and uneasy, but willing to see his research through, the archaeologist moved on to the next researcher, a leading professor of Mathematics. She had produced many papers and interpretations on numbers themselves, and the human interpretations behind ever-growing sequences. The archaeologist asked the mathematician to ask the book a question.

The mathematician barely thought for a second. ""How can a human being best visualise infinity?""

The archaeologist once again opened the book and showed it to the mathematician. Her eyes widened in shock and confusion and she, too, went insane immediately. She ran out of the room yelling, back to her notes to make sense of what she'd seen.

Shaken but persistent, the archaeologist turned to the final volunteer. He was one of the world's most highly regarded philosophers, and had spent his whole life researching different views and interpretations of a variety of philosophical debates. The philosopher knew the process by now, and confidently asked:

""What is the meaning of life?""

The archaeologist opened the book and showed the philosopher. The philosopher stared at the book for a moment or two, and broke down. He began sobbing, and began whispering ""I knew it, I knew it..."" over and over.

The archaeologist was understandably shaken at this point. Understanding the now obvious risks, his curiosity overcame him. He turned the book on himself and asked the book:

""How was Stone Henge created?""

With false confidence he thrust the book open and braced himself for whatever answer might be announced.

The book was empty.","After years of research and expedition, an archaeologist finally locates a book of legend...",1

Being a professional, the archaeologist took the book back to his prestigious university, which was home to several leaders of certain fields. To research the book's power in a controlled manner, the archaeologist rounds up three of the university's brightest minds. A researcher of Astrophysics, who had led the field for many years and had produced many papers theorising cosmic events was first. The archaeologist told him to ask the book one question, and to document whether the response was accurate.

The astrophysicist thought for a moment and asked the book ""What was existence like before the Big Bang?""

The archaeologist opened the book and showed the physicist, and he instantly went insane and began scrawling equations on the nearest pad of paper, mumbling distressed words to himself.

Shocked and uneasy, but willing to see his research through, the archaeologist moved on to the next researcher, a leading professor of Mathematics. She had produced many papers and interpretations on numbers themselves, and the human interpretations behind ever-growing sequences. The archaeologist asked the mathematician to ask the book a question.

The mathematician barely thought for a second. ""How can a human being best visualise infinity?""

The archaeologist once again opened the book and showed it to the mathematician. Her eyes widened in shock and confusion and she, too, went insane immediately. She ran out of the room yelling, back to her notes to make sense of what she'd seen.

Shaken but persistent, the archaeologist turned to the final volunteer. He was one of the world's most highly regarded philosophers, and had spent his whole life researching different views and interpretations of a variety of philosophical debates. The philosopher knew the process by now, and confidently asked:

""What is the meaning of life?""

The archaeologist opened the book and showed the philosopher. Confused at first, the philosopher let out a sigh.

post,c036y4,2qh72,jokes,false,1560414267,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/c036y4/pink_pingpong_balls/,self.jokes,,"A very wealthy man and his wife have a son. The son was the apple of his father‚Äôs eye. Once the boy had completed pre-school, the father wanted to get him something special. So he asked his son what he would like for completing this milestone. The son thinks for a moment and says, ‚ÄúDad, I would like one pink ping-pong ball.‚Äù The father replies, ‚ÄúBut son, we are very wealthy! I can get you anything you desire! Would you like a new bike that‚Äôs top of the line?‚Äù The son says, ‚ÄúNo dad just a pink ping-pong ball.‚Äù The father concedes and gets his son the pink ping-pong ball. 

The next day the father goes to awake his son and can‚Äôt find the pink ping-pong ball anywhere in his son‚Äôs room. He dismisses it and continues on with their day. 

Not long after and the son had completed kindergarten. Being the doting father he asked what his son would like for having completed this milestone. The son says, ‚ÄúDad, I would like three pink ping-pong balls.‚Äù The father again tries to sway him with offers of a new game console or computer, anything he can think of. The son stands firm and just wants the three pink ping-pong balls. 

The next day the dad peers into his son‚Äôs room and can‚Äôt seem to find those three pink ping-pong balls anywhere. He thinks that it‚Äôs peculiar but dismisses it as his boy being disorganized. 

In a little while the boy graduated from elementary school to move onto middle school. The proud dad again offers his son anything he would like for completing elementary school. The son says, ‚ÄúDad, I would like a pack of pink ping-pong balls.‚Äù Even after more pressure to sway his son‚Äôs decision with offers of top of the line clothes or summers spent abroad, the son stands firm. The father gives in and gets his son a pack of pink ping-pong balls. 

Again the next day the father snooped in his son‚Äôs room to find the pack of pink ping-pong balls he had just gotten his son. There‚Äôs no pink ping-pong balls on the floor or shelves, none in the drawers, not even any sign that there was ever a pack of pink ping-pong balls. 

In a couple years the son is moving on from middle school to high school. His father is beaming with pride to see his son growing up and turning into a man. He asks his son what he would like to have as a gift for completing middle school and the son says, ‚ÄúDad, I would like three packs of pink ping-pong balls.‚Äù His father again tries to get his son to agree to something more substantial such as a top of the line laptop for school or the best tutor to help with his homework but the son stands firm. So the father goes and buys his son three packs of pink ping-pong balls. 

The father was curious about his son‚Äôs desire for these pink ping-pong balls and again went looking in his son‚Äôs room for them. Surely he couldn‚Äôt have opened and lost all three packs of them! After finding nothing in his son‚Äôs room he searched the rest of the house, every nook and cranny, to find not a sign of any pink ping-pong balls. 

When his son turned of age for a learner‚Äôs permit for driving the father wanted to get him something special. The son just replies, ‚ÄúDad, I would like 10 packs of pink ping-pong balls.‚Äù The father again tries to convince his son to go for something more valuable, they are a wealthy family after all. Again the son insists on the 10 packs of pink ping-pong balls. 

The next day again, while his son was still sleeping, his father crept in to do a search for the 10 packs of pink ping-pong balls. He was getting concerned that his son was receiving these gifts yet they never seemed to be around. His search was again fruitless, much to his dismay. 

When the man‚Äôs son got his driver‚Äôs license on the first try the man wanted to buy him something to show his pride in his son‚Äôs accomplishment. The father suggested maybe a BMW or a Maserati, a nice car that would really show how much his son means to him. The son denies wanting anything except 3 cases of pink ping-pong balls. His father knowing that any coercing would be fruitless went and got his son 3 cases of pink ping-pong balls.

Later that night after giving his son his gift and saying goodnight, the father searched for any sign of those pink ping-pong balls. He searched his son‚Äôs room silently, searched the entire house, went through every box in the garage, to find nothing. There wasn‚Äôt even a box left that the pink ping-pong balls came from. 

When his son graduated from high school and got accepted to the best university, the father was ecstatic. He asked his son what he could get him to make his going away to university better. The son replied, ‚ÄúDad, I would like 10 cases of pink ping-pong balls.‚Äù The father was astounded to hear his son didn‚Äôt want the offers of a new apartment to live in while at university or a new car to commute to school with, just those pink ping-pong balls again. 

While the son was going through his orientation at his new school shortly after the father went on a mission to find those 10 cases of pink ping-pong balls. He searched through his son‚Äôs living accommodations, his son‚Äôs car, everywhere he could think of that his son could have put that many pink ping-pong balls. 

This wore on the dad but didn‚Äôt damper his spirits when his son graduated from the best university with the highest marks. The father again wanted to get his son something to congratulate him on the extraordinary accomplishment. When asked what he would like the son replied, ‚ÄúDad, I would like 25 cases of pink ping-pong balls.‚Äù His father was incredulous, insisting to know what happened to all the other pink ping-pong balls. His son stated that he didn‚Äôt want to tell his father just that he would like the 25 cases of pink ping-pong balls. His father relented and got him his gift. 

Again the father went snooping as he was being driven mad about his son‚Äôs desires for pink ping-pong balls. He looked everywhere he could think of that there could be any signs of pink ping-pong balls to no avail. 

At his son‚Äôs wedding the father asked his son what he could do to show his happiness that his son had gotten married. He offered to pay for the wedding or a month long cruise with the finest of sights. The son said, ‚ÄúDad, I would like 50 cases of pink ping-pong balls.‚Äù His father knew that arguing this was fruitless so he just got his on the gift of 50 cases of pink ping-pong balls. 

A few years later his son had a son of his own. The father, now a new grandfather, was beaming with pride. He couldn‚Äôt wait to go see his new grandson and give his son a gift for such an amazing milestone. He offered to get his son the best nanny in the country and set him up in the finest house next to the best school. The son declined that just saying, ‚ÄúDad, I would like 100 cases of pink ping-pong balls.‚Äù The father was disheartened but not surprised that this was his son‚Äôs request. 

The day after the large shipment of 100 cases of pink ping-pong balls was delivered the dad went searching, again, for any sign of pink ping-pong balls. He searched the attic, he searched the garage, he even scoured the yard with a metal detector for a hidden vault. Again his search yielded no results and the father went home. 

The son was doing fantastic in his chosen field and was awarded the highest honour he could receive. Of the hundreds of thousands of applicants, the son was the only one to win this award. The father was so proud to see his son becoming such a note-worthy person he flew out to the ceremony to congratulate him. When he talked to his son to express his congratulations he also handed his son a key. The son asked, ‚ÄúDad, what‚Äôs this key for?‚Äù The father says, ‚ÄúSon, after all these years I‚Äôve learned you don‚Äôt want anything except those damn pink ping-pong balls. So this is a storage container filled as full as possible with pink ping-pong balls.‚Äù His son expressed his gratitude and they parted ways. 

The next day the father went to the storage unit and, with his extra key, opened it up to find it completely empty. He had personally watched it just the day before he filled to the brim with pink ping-pong balls only to see it empty today. This greatly confused and he couldn‚Äôt figure it out. 

His son was moving up the corporate ladder and soon reached the CEO of position of his company. The father came out for the big celebration and handed his son a slip of paper. The son asked, ‚ÄúDad, what‚Äôs this?‚Äù To which the father explained it was an address of a shipping vessel filled to the top with pink ping-pong balls. There was no storage space that wasn‚Äôt filled with pink ping-pong balls. The son expressed his gratitude and they parted ways.

The next day before catching his plane back home the father went past the shipping vessel. He couldn‚Äôt imagine any way that his son would get rid of that many pink ping-pong balls. As he looked into the hold of the ship he found it empty. Every storage spot he had filled with pink ping-pong balls was completely empty, there was no signs anywhere that there had ever been a pink ping-pong ball on board. 

With this weighing on his mind he travelled home. Every attempt to ask what happened to all these pink ping-pong balls was ignored with the son courteously asking his father to not ask about it anymore. The father couldn‚Äôt find any solution to what happened to these pink ping-pong balls. 

About a year goes by with those weighing on the father immensely. His dreams were filled with questions about these pink ping-pong balls. One day he got a call that his son had been in a terrible car crash and that he should come see his son. The father got there as soon as he could and after the doctor explained that there isn‚Äôt much time left, the father requested his son answer just one question for him. He desperately wanted to know what happened to those pink ping-pong balls. The son replied, ‚ÄúDad, I don‚Äôt have the strength right now to tell you. But come back tomorrow morning and I will relieve you of this burden and tell you what happened to those pink ping-pong balls.‚Äù

The father hardly slept a wink knowing his son was finally going to tell him what happened to all those pink ping-pong balls. The father had never seen any sign of them since his son had taken them into his possession. 

The next morning the father goes into his son‚Äôs hospital room and politely asks again, ‚ÄúSon, what have you done with the pink ping-pong balls?‚Äù The son replies, ‚ÄúDad, I-‚Äú then he died.",Pink ping-pong balls,3

Normally Simon would ignore such things and not get involved, however they were near his pride and joy of a car.

Concerned for his car's safety, Simon  threw on a t-shirt, grabbed his trousers, did his belt up, stuffed his feet in his trainers and exited his property to confront the people.

""Excuse me, would you mind taking your argument elsewhere as it's rather late""

Obviously this was not well taken...

""'dis is gang stuff init, ain't none of your business""

Simon had inadvertently stumbled upon rival gangs and the situation was about to escalate as Simon noticed they were also carrying knives. 

Just as it looked like the situation was about to boil over, one of the gang members started laughing, and pointing at Simon. 

Bemused, the other gang members from opposing sides looked and all started laughing and joking together. 

You see, in Simon's rush to exit the property, he had forgotten his belt was broken and it was missing the bit that goes in to the hole, resulting in his trousers falling down exposing his rather embarrassing nightwear (which we leave to your imagination). 

Given this new, common point of focus, all violence was forgotten and the two gangs started taking the mick out of Simon and bizarrely, actually went off and got some chicken, became friends and the gang violence ceased in that area. 

Simon told his story to the press and was soon recognised internationally by being awarded, the ""no belt-piece prize"".",Simon was woken by a disturbance,3

He's a good man, he doesn't beat his wife, doesn't beat his kids, doesn't beat the armadillo in his yard, he's kind to his neighbours and he takes care of his mother. He goes to work one day and his boss says,  ""Juan, I know that you're a good man, you don't beat your wife, you don't beat your kids, you don't beat the armadillo in your yard, you're kind to your neighbours and you take care of your mother. I'm giving you a promotion.""

Juan replies ""No sir, I couldn't, is there anyone else you could choose?""

""No Juan, it must be you. It's for the good of the company.""

""Fine, if it's for the good of the company, I guess I must.""

So Juan accepts the promotion and is working in his new job. A year later, his boss comes up to him and says ""Juan, you're a good man, you don't beat your wife, you don't beat your kids, you don't beat the armadillo in your yard, you're kind to your neighbours and you take care of your mother. I'm retiring and I want you to take my place.""

""Really, is there anyone else you could choose?"" Juan asks.

""No Juan, it must be you. It's for the good of the company.""

""Well, if it's for the good of the company, I guess I have no choice.""

So Juan, now owning the company, carries on with his day-to-day life. Three years later, it's election day and everybody has heard of Juan. Everyone in the country wants Juan to be the president. Juan is taken aback and asks everyone ""Do you have to vote for me, is there another way?""

One man says ""No Juan, everybody knows you, you don't beat your wife, you don't beat your kids, you don't beat the armadillo in your yard, you're kind to your neighbours and you take care of your mother, you have to lead our country. Its for the good of the country""

""Oh, well if it's for the good of the country, I guess I must.""

Two years later, Juan is a household name, everybody knows who he is, and all of the world wants Juan to lead them, so they nominate him to lead the Earth. The current presidents/prime ministers all agree that Juan is ""a good man that doesn't beat his wife, doesn't beat his kids, doesn't beat the armadillo in his yard, he's kind to his neighbours and he takes care of his mother.""

""Really, me? Can it be anyone else?""

""No, it must be you, after all, it is for the good of the world"". Everyone agrees.

""Fine, if the fate of the world depends on it, I guess I don't have a choice"". 

So Juan, now the president, very rich, very famous, is sitting at home with his family, when a man knocks on his door. Juan  opens the door and the man proclaims ""Juan... you've ruined my life.""

""Oh my God, I'm so sorry, what have I done? Is there anything I can do?""

The man ignores Juan's questions and gives him a choice, to make him happy and step down from his position as the leader of the world, or continue on and make his life more miserable. He gives Juan until the next day to finalise his answer.

Juan gives this a lot of thought. The entire world is happy with him and what a great job he is doing, while one man doesn't like what he is doing. Juan goes to sleep, thinking hard about the ultimatum. The next day, the same man knocks on his door and asks for his response. Juan tells him ""the entire world of more that 8 billion wants me to remain in my position, so that's what I'm going to do.""

""Fine"" the man says and walks away.

During the night, Juan wakes up to the same man standing in his bedroom with a gun. The man speaks softly, ""Juan, I'm sorry I have to do this, I know you're a good man, you don't beat your wife, you don't beat your kids, you don't beat the armadillo in your yard, you're kind to your neighbours and you take care of your mother, but I have to do this"" and he shoots Juan.

But this is a special type of gun. It is a golf gun. So the man put a Hole-In-Juan.",Juan Joke (Really Long),2

The modern day Chief had never been taught the secrets of the ancients. When he looked at the sky he couldn't tell what the winter was going to be like.  


Better safe than sorry, he said to himself and told his tribe that the winter was indeed expected to be cold and that the members of the village should stock up on firewood to be prepared.   


After several days, our modern Chief got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""  


""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded.  


So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to
