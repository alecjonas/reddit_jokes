So out the back of the house we have a place where we can hang out the washing to dry and boy does it dry quickly. We get alot of sun in that area too. For your information, i live in western australia, so during the summer it gets REALLY hot and lots of sunshine. Which is great, because clothes dry fast. Along with fast drying clothes, summer also brings with it beach trips, clear skies and a thriving backyard filled with fish and frogs in the pond and lots of strange critters that come by the oasis. Some of these strange critters are also problems.

Yellow jackets (wasps). So this bunch of them decided to land on our clothes line structure and make a nest out of one of the structure's nook and cranny. To describe the structure, you have two posts cemented into the ground, about 2.5m apart and then an extension of 2 poles which are joined onto the ones cemented and they form an L shape with their respective cemented poles. Then line is drawn between them to hang up washing. Now in the joint of the right pole, there is ample space to set up a nest. So that's where the jackets set up.

This is a problem because whenever we have to go out and hang up the washing or take them down, you have a bunch of pissed off pilots just waiting for you to give them a reason to attack. We have tried dealing with them. Anywhere from insecticide to bleach and ammonia. It sorts the problem for a few days, but then new ones take the place. Annoying really. 

I have looked online for solutions, but, none of us have bothered to try anything else. My family has been stung by them too. Everyone but me (touchwood) and they say it hurts. So we've resorted to tiptoeing around them whenever we go outside to hang up the washing. We've decided to let them bee because we knew they would disappear by the end of summer. We've developed techniques too. You have to be gentle with the clothes line, or come out early morning or late in the evening while their ""asleep"" (not so active). It seems as though we have formed a coexistence of sorts. However, if they don't disappear before the year is gone, we might have to resort to means that we very well would not want to. I guess the point im trying to make here is, in order to deal with these yellow jackets, we've decided to ""let them bee"".",A bit of a problem,0

The professor takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But the company makes an announcement that all of their plumbers must get a 7th grade education. So they all go to night school.

John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is negative pi times radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong so he starts over, but again he comes up with the same equation.

The A/C has been busted for a long time, so he fixes it. Things cool down quickly. The moving walkway motor jammed, so he un-jams it. People can get from place to place more easily. The TV was grainy and unclear, so he fixes the connection to the Satellite dish and now they get hundreds of high def channels. One day, God decides to look down on Hell to see how his grand design is working out and notices that everyone is happy and enjoying umbrella drinks. He asks the Devil what's up? The Devil says, ""Things are great down here since you sent us an engineer."" ""What?"" says God. ""An engineer? I didn't send you one of those. That must have been a mistake. Send him upstairs immediately."" The Devil responds, ""No way. We want to keep our engineer. We like him."" God demands, ""If you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue!"" The Devil laughs.

And she says to him ""I've just been by the Dolphin Tanks, and they're feeling very amourous... They're doing all sorts of things to each other. And the trouble is; in less than an hour we've got three busloads of second graders coming. We can't have them watching those naughty dolphins behaving as if they're in a porno flick.
  
Now there's only one thing that acts as an anti-aphrodisiac for dolphins, and it's the meat of baby seagulls.
  
So I want you to go down to the Sea Shore, grab some baby seagulls, put them in this bag, and hurry on back.
  
But be carefull... A lion escaped from the zoo this morning, and although he was heavily sedated, he still just might be dangerous.
   
Now get going, and hurry on back!""
  
So the guy takes a shortcut through the forest to the sea shore, fills the bag with baby sea gulls, and he's walking back through the forest when he sees the lion! And it is lying across the path directly in front of him.
  
It's too late to run away. And the feline does seem very placid.
  
So, summoning up all his courage, he steps across the lion!
  
Nothing happens.
  
And so with much relief the guy begins to resume his journey when all of a sudden a Policeman jumps out of the forest, grabs the guy by the arm, and says to him ""YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!!""
  
The guy can't believe it.
  
He says, ""Tell me officer, What's the charge?""
  
And the Policeman says...

To save his friend getting embarrassed by his position as king, he cleared his house of all the extravagancies and hid them underneath the bed. But his throne was too large to fit underneath anything, thus he stored it on the top of his house, above the throne room and hid it with a large piece of cloth. When the king's friend arrived, they were very happy to be together after so many years and they went and sat in the place where the throne previously was put. They talked for long about life over the years and until the king went to get dinner, from the other room and as he was coming back he heard a loud noise of something falling. To his horror, he sees that the throne which was stored on top of the house came down through the roof and crushed his friend sitting underneath.

""At times it is extremely cold up here"" says Carlos, who comes from a long line of Inuit people, but prefers we not use his last name. 
""This proposal gives us that extra bit of relief, a few more days of warmth in what is a very long winter.""
The plan has other supporters too. People in the northeastern USA and many Canadians think the revolutionary idea is just what they need to provide some relief to the long, harsh winters that are synonymous with life up north.
""We know that global warming is not real"" says Cindy from Buffalo, ""because President Trump has told us it isn't."" But still, I think this idea to move a few winter days into the summer months is exactly the kind of reason why Trump is a genius, and why I voted for him.   says Cindy, who is  fat.
But the idea may have some traction, as President Trump, fresh off his, 'Coal Is Great. It's Really Really Great' tour, is quoted as saying he is ""excited by the idea"" and went on to say ""I sometimes forget that Plato came before Socrates, and that Pythagorus and Heraclitus were around at the same time, but adding a few days to the summer would show I am not entirely stupid, and help prove that we can stop Global Warming in it's tracks.. If it keeps getting hotter, I will keep changing the days around. We've got 365 of them, they're great! We've got lots, I will move entire seasons if I need to, and I will show the weather that America is great again.""",DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME EXPANDED PROPOSAL,0

be married and one a long-time wife, met for drinks after work. The
conversation eventually drifted towards how best to spice up their
sex lives. After much discussion, they decided to surprise their
men by engaging in some S&amp;M role playing.
The following week they met up again to compare notes.
Sipping her drink, the single girl leered and said, 'Last Friday at
the end of the work day I went to my boyfriend's office wearing a
leather coat. When all the other people had left, I slipped out of
it and all I had on was a leather bodice, black stockings and
stiletto heels.. He was so aroused that we made mad passionate love
on his desk right then and there!'
The engaged woman giggled and said, 'That's pretty much my story!
When my fiance got home last Friday, he found me waiting for him in
a black mask, leather bodice, black hose and stiletto pumps. He was
so turned on that we not only made love all night, he wants to move
up our wedding date!
The married woman put her glass down and said, 'I did a lot of
planning. I made arrangements for the kids to stay over at
Grandma's. I took a long scented-oil bath and then put on my best
perfume. I slipped into a tight leather bodice, a black garter
belt, black stockings and six-inch stilettos. I finished it off
with a black mask, ready for action. When my husband got home from
work, he grabbed a beer and the remote, sat down and yelled ""Hey,

post,62ohi4,2qh72,jokes,false,1490997787,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/62ohi4/the_husband_store/,self.jokes,,"Recently a ""Husband Super Store"" opened where women could go to choose a
husband from among many men. It was laid out in five floors, with the men
increasing in positive attributes as you ascended.

The only rule was, once you opened the door to any floor, you HAD to
choose a man from that floor; if you went up a floor, you couldn't go back
down except to leave the place, never to return. A couple of girlfriends
went to the shopping centre to find some husbands...

First floor

The door had a sign saying, ""These men have jobs and love kids."" The women
read the sign and said, ""Well, that's better than not having a job
or not loving kids, but I wonder what's further up?"" So up they went.

Second floor

The sign read, ""These men have high paying jobs, love kids, and are
extremely good looking."" ""Hmmm,"" said the ladies, ""But, I wonder what's
further up?""

Third floor

This sign read, ""These men have high paying jobs, are extremely good
looking, love kids and help with the housework."" ""Wow,"" said the women,
""Very tempting."" But there was another floor, so further up they went.

Fourth floor

This door had a sign saying ""These men have high paying jobs, love kids,
are extremely good looking, help with the housework and have a
strong romantic streak."" ""Oh, mercy me,"" they cried, ""Just think what must
be awaiting us further on!

So up to the fifth floor they went.

Fifth floor

The sign on that door said, ""This floor is empty and exists only to prove
that women are fucking impossible to please. The exit is to your left, we
hope you fall down the stairs.""

The problem was, the captain's parrot saw all the shows and began to understand how the magician did every trick.
He started shouting in the middle of the show: 'Look, it's not the same hat. Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table. Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?' The magician was furious but, as it was the captain's parrot, he could do nothing. Then one day the ship sank and the magician found himself floating on a piece of wood with the parrot.
They glared at each other but said nothing. Finally, after a week, the parrot said: 'OK, I give up. Where's the boat?'",Magician joke,12

The old Indian gave him a potion and, with a grip on his shoulder, warned ‘This is a powerful medicine.  You take only a teaspoonful, and then say:  ‘1-2-3.'  When you do, you will   become more manly than you have ever been in your life,
and you can perform for as long as you want.”   

The man thanked the old Indian, and as he walked away, he turned and asked:  “How do I stop the medicine from working?"" ""Your partner must say ‘1-2-3-4,' he responded, ""but when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon.”

He was very eager to see if it worked so he went home,   showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine, and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom.

When she came in, he took off his clothes and said:  ""1-2-3!”   Immediately, he was the manliest of men.

His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes,   and asked:  ""What was the 1-2-3 for?”

The BBC Reporter said, ""I’m a reporter to the end. I want to take out my tape recorder and describe the scene here and what’s about to happen. Maybe someday someone will hear it and know that I was on the job till the end.”

The ISIS leader directed an aide to hand over the tape recorder and dictated some comments. The reporter then said, ""Now I can die knowing I stayed true until the end.”

The ISIS leader turned to the Israeli commando and said, “And now, Mr. Israeli tough guy, what is your final wish?”

“Kick me in the butt ,” said the soldier.

“What?"" asked the leader, “Will you mock us in your last hour?”

“No, I’m not kidding. I want you to kick me in the butt ,” insisted the Israeli.

So the terrorist leader shoved him into the open and kicked him in the behind. The soldier went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9 mm pistol from under his flak jacket, and shot the leader dead. In the resulting confusion, he jumped to his knapsack, pulled out his carbine and sprayed the terrorists with gunfire. In a flash, all terrorists were either dead or fleeing for their lives. As the soldier was untying the reporters, they asked him, “Why didn’t you just shoot them in the beginning? Why did you ask them to kick you in the butt first?”

The doctor asks her how she got that and she responds saying, ""Actually it's kind of embarrassing. My boyfriend is proud that he goes to Yale so while we're having sex he likes to keep his varsity jacket on."" 

The doctor finishes up her exam, gets her some ointment, and sends her along.  

Not too much later another girl is in the room. During the exam the doctor finds another rash, this time in the shape of an 'H'. 

After asking this girl how she got the rash she tells him a similar story of how her boyfriend was proud to be a Harvard student and doesn't like to take off his Letterman's jacket. 

Eventually another girl comes in for a physical like the rest. This time he found a rash in the shape of a 'W'.

Realising that this is quite a lot of sheep for one farm, and his sheepdog is getting a bit old, he decides he'll probably need a new dog- no, a whole team of dogs- to round so many sheep up.
So the next day, the farmer goes to the pet store. He looks around at the various herding dogs- they seem very fit, but young and untrained. The shopkeeper asks the farmer if he wants any help.
""Why yes,"" says the farmer. I need a team of sheepdogs to help round up my flock. I have a rather large number of sheep, you see, and I don't think any of these young pups would be up to the task of rounding up so many.""
The shopkeeper says, ""I've got just the thing for you."" and leads the farmer into a small back room, where a single sheepdog sits waiting.
""Are you sure?"" asks the farmer, ""I have very many sheep and I don't think one dog will be able to round all of them up."".
""I'm sure."" says the shopkeeper, ""This is a very intelligent dog. He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen.""
""Yes,"" says the dog, ""I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering."" The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home.
That afternoon, the farmer and the dog walk together uphill, and from the top they can see the entire flock covering the fields. ""Well,"" says the farmer, ""I'd like you to round up all of these sheep."".
""Okay."" replies the dog, ""You have nine hundred sheep.""

""Pay first.  Those are the rules,"" says the bartender.  So the man gives him the $10 and the bartender drops it into the jar.

""O.K.,"" the bartender says.  ""Here's what you need to do:

First, you have to drink an entire gallon of pepper tequila, the whole thing, all at once and you can't make a face while doing it.

Second, there is pit bull chained up out back with a sore tooth. You have to remove the tooth with your bare hands.

Third, there's a 90 year old woman upstairs who has never reached orgasm during intercourse.  You've got to make things right for her.""

The man is stunned.  ""I know I paid my $10, but I'm not an idiot!  I won't do it.  You have to be nuts to drink a gallon of pepper tequila and then do those other things!""

""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but your money stays where it is.""

As time goes on the man has a few drinks, then a  few more, and he asks, ""Where's zat tequila?""

He grabs the gallon with both hands and downs it with a few big slurps.  Tears are streaming down both cheeks, but he doesn't make a face.

Next, he staggers out back where the pit bull is chained-up and soon the people inside the bar hear a huge, noisy scuffle going on outside.

They hear the pit bull barking, the guy screaming, the pit bull yelping and then silence.

Just when they think the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar with his shirt ripped and large bloody scratches all over his body.

The answer by this student was so 'profound' that the professor shared it with colleagues, via the Internet, which is, of course, why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well : 
 

Bonus Question:

Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? 
 
Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.
  

One student, however, wrote the following: 
 

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today.

Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.
 

This gives two possibilities: 

1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose. 
 
2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.
 
So which is it? 
  
If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct..... ...leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa repeatedly kept shouting 'Oh my God, I’m coming!'
