For this occasion, my grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.

After a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoonish images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken things. I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.

When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.

Why am I telling you all of this back story? Because the last time I tried to tell this to someone and I didn't give context, they thought it was weird that I was so excited about inheriting my dead grandfather's hen tie collection",My grandfather died and i inherited some of his cloth,96

This was all it took for us to know.  Exactly at midnight we knew, that we were destined to be with each other.

The clock struck midnight and as it rang out I sat in awe of the joy we were experiencing.  I thought to myself, ‘this calls for something!’

Two priests are fishing on lake outside of Rome. It's a beautiful day, the sun is light, and the water is smooth. Suddenly the first priests fishing rod bends alarmingly; he has hooked a huge fish! It's a struggle but he managed to reel it in. It's a beautiful rainbow coloured fish and big enough to feed a family.

""Would you look at the size of that *Fucker*!"" he exclaims, startling the second priest.

""Hey, you can't talk like that; you're a man of the cloth. I'm a man of the cloth!"" Says the second priest, scandalised.

The first priest raises his hands in a calming gesture ""It's ok my good fellow, that's the fish's name. It's an *Italian Fucker Fish*.""

After breathing a sigh of relief, the second priest is able to appreciate the fish a bit more. ""Why don't we cook it for our dinner with the His Holiness the Pope tonight"" he says. The first priest agrees, and they go their separate ways, the first priest to return their boat and the second to deliver the fish into the Vatican.

Priest number two lobs up at the convent and knocks at the door, a sister answers and he proudly shows her the fish. ""Could the mother superior cook this *Fucker* for our dinner with His Holiness the Pope?"" He asks. Scandalising the poor sister.

""You can't talk like that!"" she says ""You're a man of the cloth. I'm a woman of the cloth"".

""Fret not, dear sister"" the priest says ""that is the fish's name. It's an *Italian Fucker Fish*.""

Mollified the nun agrees to prepare the fish for the mother superior to cook. She scales and guts the fish and then calls on the mother superior. ""Mother, I have prepared this *Fucker* so that you may cook it for our dinner tonight with His Holiness the Pope"".

Mum superior nearly has a heart attack. ""My child"" she shrieks ""We are women of the cloth. You cannot use such language!""

The nun placates the mother by explaining that the fish is an *Italian Fucker Fish*. And, so assured, she agrees to cook the fish for their dinner with His Holiness.

Later that night both Priests, the Nun and the Mother Superior are at dinner with His Holiness the Pope. They remove the silver cover from their meal and serve the fish. The Pope takes a few bites and a sip of wine and states ""This fish is fantastic, practically divine""

""I caught the *Fucker*."" Says the first priest.

""Well I brought the *Fucker* into the city."" Says the second.

""I scaled and gutted the *Fucker*."" Says the nun.

""And I cooked the *Fucker*."" Says the mother superior.

His Holiness takes a look around the table, takes another sip of his wine and says ""You know what? ***You cunts are alright!""***","Two Priests and Two Nuns have dinner with His Holiness, the Pope.",260

In order to keep their troops healthy, they needed to monitor the submarine that carried supplies to where the others were located.

But there was a small problem. Every so often, there would be a defect in the submarine's engine that would cause it to shut down. These defects were manageable at first, but they slowly became so severe that the crew had no choice but to get several ships to surround the submarine and make sure it was functioning properly.

Each ship had a small selection of sailors posted on the end of the ship, and their jobs were to watch the submarine for any problems. If they found any, they were to report to the aiding crew that would repair the ship's engine and keep it alive.

But there was a problem. Despite sailors being required to sit around and do nothing all day, they were hardly being paid. And this inspired a strike! The sailors eventually all abandoned their posts, meaning there was nobody watching over the submarine.

The military leader was confused by the complaints he was hearing and decided to investigate for himself. He went on the security cameras and went to ship 1, but nobody was there.

He checked ship 2, and nobody was there.

He checked ship 3, and nobody was there!

Panicking, the leader called the ship's aiding crew and screamed ""Is this sub still active?! I haven't seen any posts since last deck, Aid!""",I made a (hopefully) original joke!,13

Joe laughed. ""Ah ha! I got you! I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."" The salesman shook his head, ""You can't wear a size 34.

He finds an ad from a farmer in need of some extra hands, so the man calls up the farmer and agrees to meet the next day to see what work he'd be doing.

The farmer greets him at the gate and begins to show the young man around. First, they come across a mango grove, and the farmer explains that he'll be picking and packaging the mangoes for sale. Then they go into the farmhouse, and the farmer introduces the young man to his daughter, Annie, and explains that during the heat of the day, the young man is to help Annie with all of her chores. The young man nods, and they move on. Lastly, they stop at a chicken coop, and the farmer proudly showcases his prize chickens, and his award winner who he named Thai, for the basil she ate that the farmer swore made her plumage glossy.

The young man begins work, and notices how little the farmer is around. So, he figures, he might as well line his pockets by taking a few mangoes for himself and selling them directly. It works out quite well for him, but the excitement of thievery wears off after a while, so he has to find something new to occupy himself with.

During the middle of the day, when he worked inside with Annie, the young man would sweep, so he could sneak peeks at her cleavage whenever she bent over with the dustpan. Again, the farmer didn't seem to notice, and the young man went about his day.

Eventually, he gets bored of Annie, and the mango sales have left him with quite a bit of money. So he figures that the next day he'll steal the farmer's prize chicken and get the hell out of dodge.

He's got the chicken in his hands, and is opening the gate to get off the farm when the farmer suddenly appears and shoots him in the foot. The young man released the bird and starts howling and hollering about how batshit crazy the farmer must be.

The farmer gathers up the chicken, still aiming the rifle at the young man and says:

""I didn't mind ya taking my mangas, and I done ignored you watchin' my Annie May, but if you think you can just blast off with my hen, Thai, you gotta 'nother thing comin'!""","A young man is in need of a job,",21

He'd only have sex with the lights off.

The wife assumed he merely had some shame in the penile department,  but she loved him, so happily obliged. An added bonus was that it felt  like he was actually reasonably well-equipped downstairs, so everything  was good.

However, 20 years of blind sex took its toll on her and their  relationship. In the middle of one of their love-making sessions, the  wife dived for the lamp and turned on the light.

She saw her husband with his pants on and a dildo in hand.

There was a brief moment of silence, then the wife sternly stated ""You have some explaining to do.""

The husband looked her dead in the eye and said ""I'll explain this when you explain the kids"".",One condition to have sex,48

“Dad, what if she is beautiful?”


“Well son, you just tell her that we are farmers, we wake up every day to the sunrise and they don’t compare to her”


“Dad, what if she is plain?”


“Well son, you just tell her that we are farmers, we do hard work every day, and like things that are modest.


“well Dad, what if she is ugly”


The dad pulls out a brown paper bag and puts a bottle of whiskey in it


“Well son, you just tell her that we are farmers, and we like to drink, and down that bottle before you have your way with her.”

 

The son, happy for his Dads advice heads out to the local park to meet the blind date. Upon arrival she is the ugliest thing he has ever seen. She sits down next to him and he is trembling so hard he can’t get a word out. He reaches for the whiskey, pulls it out, and drops it on the ground shattering the bottle.


She looks at him with a face not even a mother could love


“What was that for?”


The son sits for a minute, unsure what to say, but then remembers the words of his father. He picks up the brown bag and places it over her head.


“What the hell did you do that for!”

To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, the head cop shows the first blonde a mugshot for 5 seconds and hides it.

Cop: This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?
Blonde 1: That's easy, he only has one eye.
Cop: Well..that's because the picture I showed is his side pose.

Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he tests the second blonde.

Cop: This is your suspect, and how would you recognize him?
Blonde 2: Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear.

The cop puts up a hopeless face, ""What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a mugshot of his side pose! Is that the best answer you can come up with?""

Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third blonde and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"" He quickly adds, ""Think hard before giving me a stupid answer."" She looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""The suspect wears contact lenses.""

The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. ""Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that."" He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file in his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face. ""Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does in fact wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation? ""

When I entered the backstage of this show, things were so dirty. Tissue papers everywhere, tampons thrown left right and center. I was horrified. Are my angel supermodels so dirty?

I had a few vodkas. I decided to get out when suddenly a supermodel walks in. Her name is Alice and I knew her well from TV of course. ""I saw you in the Vuitton show in 2015 and you were mesmerizing."" She said, ""Thank you!"" and walked away.

I have finally talked to a supermodel! Time for a small dance, since no one is looking.

Since there was noone else there, my brain was racing. What if I could.... no, no, not that. What if I could just talk to her and see she is free. That's what these normal people from TV do. Let's do that.

I walked up to her and said, ""Are supermodels usually this dirty? The room smells pretty bad.""

""Yes, especially the girls from America, they are the worst. They haven't heard of water in their lives and they haven't showered in 2 weeks.""

""Ha, so it's the Americans in the front with all those bad tissues and tampons. Pathetic.""

Having forgotten what I came here for, I mustered the courage to ask Alice, ""Hey, I am new here, is there a chance that I can talk to you after the show....Um... I won't take long, just a few minutes."". Alice accepted.

I did a dance.

That evening, I walked Alice back to her room. Turns out, she's just staying 1 hotel away from me - she in Marriott and me in Marr Motel. While I walked up, she said, ""Come on inside, let's do something fun."".

I have been waiting, all my life, a virgin, for this moment. Everything is shaved. Check. Nice breath. Check. I plan to throw her in the bed the moment we get in and then devour her like a tiger devouring a deer.

She opened the door. We walked in. There is another guy inside. I try to take off my shirt, so he would take a cue and leave. But to my surprise, he also starts removing his shirt. After a few minutes, I decided to take my pants off, and this guy also decides to take the pants off. I try to kiss this guy to see if he is in it for a threesome.

Alice shouted, ""What are you doing to my mirror, and get the hell out of my room you creep!""","For all my life, I have wondered how it would be to sleep with a supermodel.",0

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,39

""Don't worry. There's some one right over there!!!"" And the big alien points to a gas station. 

They walk over and, since this was their first time on Earth, approach the gas pump and smile as kind as they can.

""Excuse me,"" the big alien starts ""we crash landed. We come in peace, is there anyway we can get some help?""

The little alien was nervous ""don't talk to him, I'm telling you!!"" He urged, but the big alien didnt listen.

""Sorry, maybe you didnt hear me? I was wondering if we could get some help? We'll be out of your hair soon."" 
Once again. The gas pump didn't answer. And once again, the little alien pleaded with the bigger one.

""I'm telling you!! Dont mess with him!!"" 

The big alien, caught between the unresponsive ""earthling"", the nervous, clingy small alien, and the stress of crashing millions of miles from home, had become noticably more frustrated now. He pulled out his laser gun, and aimed it at the gas pump.

""I'll give you one last try! Will you help us, or not?!"" 

The little alien covered his eyes, and once again, the gas pump did not answer.

With a fit of rage, he fired the laser, and as you would expect. A huge explosion flung the two aliens back.

After they both came too, the big alien picked himself off the ground, and went to help the little alien.

""I told you he was dangerous!!"" 

""...how? How did you know he was dangerous...?"" 

The little alien looked back to the flames of what once was the only gas station for miles.

The government is in a panic trying to figure out what to do to decide who the next president will be. Finally, Barack Obama comes up with an idea: a literal presidential race. The three candidates would run a lap around the White House and the person with the best time would become president. Bernie Sanders goes first, but being ad sold as he is, he takes about 24 minutes. Trump goes next and arrives with a time of 14:26. Hillary Clinton goes last, running as fast as she can, trampling the flowers and shrubs in her way in an effort to beat Trump's time. She finally crosses the finish line at just under ten minutes.
