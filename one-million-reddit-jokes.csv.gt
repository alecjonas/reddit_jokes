post,a65pnk,2qh72,jokes,false,1544800935,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/a65pnk/im_not_a_window_cleaner/,self.jokes,,"(Inspired by IT crowd)

One gloomy day in London a man by the name of Roy walks in a park, taking a short break from his job in an IT department. Suprisingly, he runs into an old school friend named Alister during his walk, and they catch up. Alister is a local writer for a very famous publishing company, and couldn't stay for long as he had to get back to work. Roy admired his work but didnt get a chance to tell Alister that he worked in IT, showing that he too was successful. He made sure to let him know next time he saw him.

After work that day, a window cleaner came by Roy's house and without his consent started cleaning his windows, looking for a tip. Enraged, Roy asked him to get off his property. The man ran away without taking his bicycle and cleaning supplies located in the bike basket.


The next day, Roy was running late for work and thought to take this old cleaner bike since he knew a shortcut. During his commute, Alister was walking on a sidewalk and saw Roy zoom past him. Roy saw him as he was zooming past and waved. Alister gave a sort of smug smirk as he waved back, seeing the cleaning supplies and raggedy bike. Since Roy was in a rush he couldn't stop, but he yelled back at him from far away ""Oh Alister, I am not a window cleaner!"" He knew he'd run into him again one day and explain the confusion, so he didnt think much of it. 


A few days pass and this time Roy takes his lunch break to go with a good friend to a private lounge in an area downtown. The music is great, the people are intellectual and Roy starts to imagine that it must be so foolish for Alister to think that he is a window cleaner. His break is almost over and Roy decides to step outside for a breather. He comes out on the roof of the building and walks around, really taking in the view. Roy goes back to the door and attempts to rattle it open, but its locked. He soon realises a mistake was made, as there was no reentry to the building. Panicked, he looks around the roof of the building for a way to get down. He notices a man with a lift to get down on the side, as the man washes the building once a week and so happened to be on his way down. He approaches the man and luckily hitches a ride down. During his descent, Roy spots Alister across the street, drinking a coffee. Roy blindly believes he gets very lucky as he begins to shout from the lift ""Alister! Alister!"" 

Alister looks up and sees Roy descending from the lift with the window cleaner next to him.

""Alister! I am NOT a window cleaner!"" As Roy comes down from the lift. Alister looks bewildered and immediately leaves, thinking Roy has gone off his rockers. At this point, the window cleaner next to him gives him a dirty look for mocking his profession. Awkwardness ensues.

Roy could not sleep that night. He made it a mission to find Alister and explain all the misunderstandings. He looks him up in the yellow pages and reaches his number. He gives him a call. Alister picks up the phone.

""Alister, its Roy. Listen, I have to explain myself to you. I am NOT a window cleaner. I am in IT working for a firm in the city. I hope you dont think less of me!""

Alister calmly responds. ""IT? that's wonderful. Do you work with macs?""


""Macs? Oh no, I work mainly with Windows.""","""I'm NOT a window cleaner!""",16

A mouse and a lion walk into a bar, and they're sitting there chugging away at a few ales when a giraffe walks in.

""Get a load of her,"" says the mouse, ""I fancy that!""

""Well, why not try your luck?"" says the lion.

So the mouse goes over to the giraffe and starts talking to her. Within
five minutes they're out the door and gone into the night.

The next day, the lion is in the bar and the mouse staggers in. The mouse is absolutely ragged, worn out, ruined. The lion helps his pal up onto a stool, pours a drink down his throat and asks, ""What the hell happened to you? I saw you leave with the giraffe. What happened after that? Was she all right?""

The mouse says, ""Yeah, she was really something else! She invited me back to her place to spend the night.""

""But how come you look like you're so exhausted?"" asks the lion.

""Well"", says the mouse, ""Between the kissing and the screwing, I must have run a hundred miles!""

A man is fishing on a lake when he catches a fish.  

The fish says to the fisherman, ""I'm a magic fish! I since you caught me I have to grant a wish  ...But only on one condition.""  

The fisherman asks what the condition is.  

""In order to grant your wishes I need to swim up into your ass, though your asshole. That's how my magic works! I swim up into your asshole, and when I'm in there, shout your wish as loud as you can and my magic will grant the wish!"" 

The fisherman thought it over, he didn't like the idea of the fish in his butt, but he could wish for anything he wanted.  After some consideration the fisherman accepts the deal. He pulls down his pants and the fish jump up inside the fisherman.  
The fisherman stood up, shocked from the speed at which the fish jumped, and was even more disturbed way the way the fish thrashed inside. 
Thinking quickly he shouted ""I wish for 5 million dollars!"".

As soon as he shouted his wish the fish shot out and splashed into the pond.  
The fish swam around to face the shocked fisherman and said ""Your wish is granted! The money is in your bank-account"" then swam away under the water. 

The disturbed fisherman, pulled up his pants and decided to go to the bar for a drink, now that he was a millionaire.   
When he got there he ordered a round for everyone in the house, however his card got declined due to lack of funds.  
The fisherman demanded that they try again, as he was a millionaire, the bartender tried again and again, the fisherman's card was declined.
The bartender then asked curiously:

""Why exactly do you think you're a millionaire? By chance were you fishing at the pond nearby?""  

""As a matter of fact I was fishing there, how did you know?"" Said the fisherman.

 ""Now... did you happen to catch a talking fish?"" 

""Yes, I did, and he granted me a wish for 5 million dollars"" 

""Well, I've got some bad news. That fish is well known around these parts as quite the pervert. He claims to be able to grant wishes, but he can only talk.  
He's played quite a few tricks around here, and I fear you might have fallen for his tricks hook line and sphincter.""

When the boss came, the story began:  

\-The client: is room 39 empty? -The boss: yes, sir. 

\-The client: can I book it? -The boss: of course you can. 

\-The client: thank you.  

Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.  

The boss agreed though he was surprised at the weird things the client asked to have. 

The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else. Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39. 

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. 

Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.  

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.  

In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first. 

He went to the room and found everything alright. 

Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.  

The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.  

The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. 

In fact, he started to doubt himself.  After one year, the client showed up again. 

He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.  

The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g. 

This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. 

He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. 

After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.  

Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. 

The smile didn't leave his face.  

The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. 

Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions. 

The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up.  

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. 

He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.  

The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before. 

In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.  

\-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?'' 

\-''I promise I will never let anyone know''. 

\-''Swear'' -''I swear I won't reveal your secret''  So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss. 

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person.  

Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.  

When he does, I will let you know... ",A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss,5

Eventually, their king became frustrated and called a meeting of the tribe's elders. He said he wanted them to figure out a way he could enjoy his wealth, and stay within traditional guidelines.
After much consideration, the elders suggested he build a magnificent throne. When he objected there was not enough room in his hut for a throne, the elders suggested he call in an engineer to solve the problem.
Soon, the king's tiny hut was rigged with an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys. He could lower the huge throne for use during the day, and at night, he could haul the throne up, and lower his bed. This was truly the best of both worlds for the king.
Unfortunately, after a few months of constant use, the ropes frayed, and one night, the throne slipped and came crashing down on the king, killing him.
The wise men of the island recognized a lesson in this experience and added to the lore of their people this statement: ""People who live in grass houses should not stow thrones.""",There was once an island kingdom whose people were all fabulously wealthy.,10

""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday."" 

I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.

My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, 

""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" 

It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me."" 

I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""

We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. 

She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. 

We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?"" 

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" 

She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""

After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, 

""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""

""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake. 

Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy birthday"".

And I just sat there...

On the couch...

Naked...

&gt;**Someone made the comment that preaching to people isn't really all that hard, a real challenge would be to preach to a bear. One thing led to another, and they decided that each would find a bear and attempt to convert it to their religion.**

&gt;**Seven days later, they all came together to discuss their experiences.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**Father Flannery, who had his arm in a sling and had various bandages on his body and limbs, went first.** **Well, he said, 'I went into the woods to find me a bear. And when I found him, I began to read to him from the Catechism. Well, that bear came after me and began to slap me around. So I quickly grabbed my holy water, sprinkled him and, Holy Mary Mother of God, he became as gentle as a lamb.'**   
&gt;  
&gt;**Reverend Billy Bob the Baptist spoke next. He was in a wheelchair and had an IV drip. 'I went out and found me a bear. And then I began to read to my bear from the Bible! But that bear came after me. We wrestled down one hill, until we came to a creek.  So I quickly dunked him and baptized his hairy soul. And just like you said, he became as gentle as a lamb'.**

I was a bit startled by this proclamation, but I was intrigued by the derelict's intuition, since I indeed had never found Mr. Right. I looked at the six items on the belt and saw nothing particularly unusual about my selections that could have tipped off the drunk to my marital status.

The woman, astounded, thinks for a moment and says “age has taken its toll on me. I wish to be young and beautiful once more.”

BAM! In a sudden flash the old woman emerged, a ravishing young woman.

Thrilled by her success the woman says “genie I want to live a life of grandeur! To be rich!”

BAM! With a snap of the genies fingers the room swirled and transformed into a great hall. Her once broken cottage had become a mansion. Upon looking down the woman noticed her worn clothing had been replaced with a stunning dress, and shining heels.

While she marveled at this outcome the genie stood solemnly and said “you have one wish left.”

The woman thought about this for a while and then felt a slight brush against her leg. It was her old cat, frightened by the buildings transformation.

The woman looked up at the genie and said “this cat has been faithfully with me for all my years. Please, transform him into a human man, so that we may spend many happy days together!”

BAM! In a blinding flash the cat had vanished. Standing in his place was a tall, dark-haired, handsome young man. 

Immediately enamored by her new love, the woman fell into his arms. The genie, his work complete, disappeared. As she gazed into his eyes, he drew her close and whispered

A nun walks into Mother Superior's office and plunks down into a chair. She lets out a sigh heavy with frustration. 
'What troubles you, Sister?' asked the Mother Superior. 'I thought this was the day you spent with your family.' 
'It was,' sighed the Sister. 'And I went to play golf with my brother. We try to play golf as often as we can. You know I was quite a talented golfer before I devoted my life to Christ.' 
'I seem to recall that,' the Mother Superior agreed. 
'So I take it your day of recreation was not relaxing?' 
'Far from it,' snorted the Sister. 'In fact, I even took the Lord's name in vain today!' 
'Goodness, Sister!' gasped the Mother Superior, astonished. 'You must tell me all about it!' 
'Well, we were on the fifth tee...and this hole is a monster, Mother -540 yard Par 5, with a nasty dogleg left and a hidden green...and I hit the drive of my life. I creamed it.
 The sweetest swing I ever made. And it's flying straight and true, right along the line I wanted...and it hits a bird in mid-flight !' 
'Oh my!' commiserated the Mother. 'How unfortunate! But surely that didn't make you blaspheme, Sister!' 
'No, that wasn't it,' admitted Sister. 'While I was still trying to fathom what had happened, this squirrel runs out of the woods, grabs my ball and runs off down the fairway!' 
'Oh, that would have made me blaspheme!' sympathized the Mother. 
'But I didn't, Mother!' sobbed the Sister. 'And I was so proud of myself! 
And while I was pondering whether this was a sign from God, this hawk swoops out of the sky and grabs the squirrel and flies off, with my ball still clutched in his paws!' 
'So that's when you cursed,' said the Mother with a knowing smile. 
'Nope, that wasn't it either,' cried the Sister, anguished, 'because as the hawk started to fly out of sight, the squirrel started struggling,
 and the hawk dropped him right there on the green, and the ball popped out of his paws and rolled to about 18 inches from the cup!'

1. He called everyone brother 
2. He liked Gospel

1. He went into His Father's business 
2. He lived at home until he was 33 
3. He was sure his Mother was a virgin and his Mother was sure He was God
 
But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was Italian:

2. He had wine with His meals 
3. He used olive oil

But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was Irish: 
1. He never got married. 
2. He was always telling stories. 
3. He loved green pastures.
 
But the most compelling evidence of all - three proofs that Jesus was a woman:

1. He fed a crowd at a moment's notice when there was virtually no food. 
2. He kept trying to get a message across to a bunch of men who just didn't get it. 
3. And even when He was dead, He had to get up because there was still work to do.

""Well, First I sold him some new fish hooks, Then I sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new fish hooks.

Every other word out of this parrot's beak was profanity, and strings of filthy insults - absolutely appalling behaviour! 

Well, over the course of the next week, John tried speaking to it softy and calmly, playing classical music to it, being very friendly and kind, all in an effort to modify this bird´s language and attitude. It didn´t work. This awful parrot just screamed abuse at him, all day and all night. Finally, after a horrendous day listening to this torrent of filth pouring out of the parrot, I´m afraid John just snapped. He screamed back at the parrot, and of course the parrot screamed louder. He hit the parrot, and of course the parrot bit him. He threw a discarded shoe at the parrot, and naturally the parrot took to the air and shat on him. 

In a blind rage, John grabbed the parrot by the neck and flung him into the freezer and slammed the door shut. In the glorious peace that followed, John leaned against the kitchen door, panting with the exhaustion and fury of it all, and I have to say it took him several minutes to calm down, and collect his thoughts. That´s when he realised that maybe he´d gone too far, and that he might have actually hurt this parrot - so he cautiously opened the freezer door, and to his surprise the parrot meekly walked out, and sat calmly on John´s outstretched hand. 

To John´s amazement, the parrot then said ""I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I'm sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior."" As you might imagine, John was absolutely stunned at this, but before he could even question it, the parrot said ""May I ask you sir,  what the turkey did?""

MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!","So, John received a parrot, as a gift.",208

Long ago on a snowy Christmas Eve Santa was out delivering toys to all the good kiddies. Like the many before this one it was all work, curdled milk and lame cookies. But hey, a job is a job is a job... despite his lower back pain and trick knee he loaded up his sack and slid down another filthy chimney. He noticed the same old stale snacks with warm nog and accepted the mediocrity of his career and went about unloading the gifts from sack to under the tree. Gift after gift he placed when to his surprise he heard a soft voice whisper over his shoulder:

“Santa... I have been very good this year...”

Startled, he stood up defiant of his back pain and turned to see the lady of the house posed seductively on the couch in a silky negligee... he became aware of just how warm it was and as the sweat started to bead on his brow he stammered:

“Ho Ho Ho... Gotta go Gotta go... gotta deliver all the toys to the children you know...”

Turning away and resuming his task he started to really sweat... when again her voice whispered:

“Santa.... I have been very, very, good this year...”

He straightened up determined to chastise this hussy. Faced her ready to scold when he noticed she had undone the front of her sheer, yet tasteful nighty... exposing the curve of her neck to her shoulder right on down further and further ... regrouping his composure he wiped the sweat pouring down his face and said shakily:

“Ho Ho Ho.... Gotta go Gotta go... gotta deliver all the toys to the children you know...”

Off balance he clumsily spun back around and fumbled around the tree not knowing what the fuck he was doing or where he was doing it when once more she whispered out:

“Santa... I have been very, very, very good this year...”

He slowly turned around and the gift in his hand slid out thudding on the floor as his gaze fell upon her standing close to him wearing her birthday suit. Thru the thudding of the blood in his ears he felt his focus rush back to him.. his vision cleared and the years fell away with the ache in his back and with a low rumble of his voice he growled:

“Hey Hey Hey... Gotta stay Gotta stay... can’t get up the chimney with my dick this way...”

Just kidding.... I never knew my Father... but it is better for this Xmas story. 

Thanks for reading.",Ho Ho Ho,3

The man screams in horror,  ""Absolutely not !! I want a second opinion... !!!""

The doctor replies, ""Well, it’s your choice. Go ahead, if you want, but surgery is your only option.”

The next day, the man seeks out a Chinese doctor, figuring that he’ll know more about the disease. The Chinese doctor examines his penis and proclaims, ""Ahh... yes, Mongolian VD. Very rare disease.""

The guy says to the doctor, ""Yeah, yeah, I already know that, but what can we do? My American doctor wants to cut off my penis!""

In conclusion, If it hadn't been for cotton-eye joe, I'd been married a long time ago, Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton-eye joe?

She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money. 

After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office. 

The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'. The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money.  The elderly woman replied that she made bets. 

The president was surprised and asked, 
'What kind of bets?' 

The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.' 

The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that. 

The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?' 

'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.' 

'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 
'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently. 

That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and a gain until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet. 

The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square. 

The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before.  Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly. 

The president was happy to oblige. 

The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.' 

The elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Bank of Canada !'

The man walks back into the room, joins the table, leans towards a power outlet and speaks into it:

The nervous receptionist whispers that KGB came and took them before dawn.

The man is horrified. He wonders why he was spared.

""I am the great Bumbo! You probably know the drill; I grant you three wishes, to be used as you see fit.""

Without thinking, John blurts out ""I wish we were millionaires!"" The genie nods and beside them appears a tremendous golden treasure chest, overflowing with precious gems and ancient treasures.

Darryl thinks for a moment, then says ""I wish we lived in our dream cabin in the countryside!"" The three of them and all their belongings are instantly transported to a gorgeous lakeside cabin. Having enormous wealth and the home they've always wanted, they aren't sure what else they could wish for. Bumbo the genie tells them, ""You don't need to make your final wish now. Simply call me name when you're ready, and I shall appear to grant you one last desire.""

A week passes and they're having a movie night, when John takes a bathroom break. As he's returning, their door is kicked down by a mob of men in white hoods who drag them from their home. They take them to a tree and begin stringing them up when Darryl screams ""Bumbo, Bumbo! Why won't he appear?! He could save us!"" John hangs his head in shame and says ""I... just used our last wish."" Darryl screams, ""What?! What did you wish for?"" He replies, ""I wished we were both hung like black dudes.""","A newlywed gay couple, John and Darryl, buys an old home",32

They hadn't been seeing each other for very long and she lived in Donegal and he lived in Kerry . Paddy consulted with his sister and decided, after careful consideration, that a pair of good quality gloves would strike the right note... not too romantic and not too personal. Off he went with his sister to Marks and Spencer’s and they selected a dainty pair of fur lined quality leather gloves. His sister bought a pair of sexy knickers for herself at the same time. Marks and Spencer’s had a free gift wrap offer but the assistant mixed up the two items, the sister got the gloves and Paddy unknowingly got the knickers. Good old Paddy sent off his gift wrapped present in a parcel with the following letter. 
Dear Maggie 
I chose these because I've noticed that you are not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. If it had not been for my sister I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears shorter ones (which are easier to remove). These are a very delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and I hardly noticed any marks. I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little bit tight on her. She also said that they rub against her ring which helps keep it clean. In fact she hasn't needed to wash it since she began wearing them. 
I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other hands will touch them before I have a chance to see you again.
When you take them off remember to blow into them a little bit because they will be naturally a little damp from wearing.
Just imagine how many times my lips will kiss them during the coming year.
I hope you will wear them for me on our next date.
All my love,
Patrick

The elves were on strike and not making toys

And the reindeer were out getting drunk with the boys

Santa sat in his sleigh and pondered his plight

When what came his way was an angel in flight

The angel fluttered down upon Santa’s knee 

And said, “Hey fatso where ya want this tee?”

Santa just smiled and said with great class

“ Ho you dumb little angel, you picked the wrong time to ask”

So now all the families celebrate with glee

As an angel sits atop their tree!

As his mother’s birthday was approaching, and Reap knew she was a huge fan of vintage cars, instead of the normal compensation, he requested, that for his next party that he was in charge of, his clients would give him a vintage car. 

However, sadly, his clients were unable to provide him with a car, and he had to settle for front seat tickets at an Eminem concert. 

So, he organized another party for an even RICHER client. Yet still, same disappointing result: no car, but an all-expenses-paid vacation to Tokyo. 

This went on for some time. He would run a huge party for a client, requested a vintage car as a payment, but didn’t get one. 

Time was running out. His mother’s birthday was closing in. 

It got to the point where he had a monopoly on the high-end parties for the powerful 1%; he was traveling around 24/7, in charge of numerous parties a day! He made sure to emphasize the fact that he was demanding a vintage car, yet he would never get it. 

Finally, the day before his mother’s birthday, he was furiously speaking with clients all over, and organized a plethora of parties  to see if he could somehow, someway get a vintage car for his mother in time. 

As you would expect, despite all his dedication, he didn’t get said vintage car. ;(

So, with no idea what else to get his mother, he brought out a pen, and wrote a heartbreaking letter to her to apologize.

In the most formal format he could muster, he wrote his deeply unsettling letter.

Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one, ""Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what's your story?""

So the first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell-but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony.""

""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. ""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here."" Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death.

The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated. Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story. ""Picture this,"" says the third man, ""I'm hiding naked inside a refrigerator...""",Cheating Wife...,33

The quiet before the storm.  I was anxious, the setting sun shining in my eyes, the heat and humidity caking my body. It’s been years since it happened, everyone has agreed to never talk about it again. I of course knew that it was going to happen again, so I set out to find the reason behind all of it. A dull droning far off in the distance brought me to my senses. It was almost as if a greyscale kaleidoscope was set in front of the sun, rays of light being reflected in all directions. As I brought up my arm to shade my eyes from the strobing chaos, something cold caught my elbow, making a deathly rattling noise before it disappeared in the tall grass behind me. Two small thin slashes were present on my elbow. The hum of banshee was getting closer, howling as if it was the now silent wind. I couldn’t hear anymore, I couldn’t bear it. I kneeled down, hands to my ears as a darkness fell upon me. It felt like eternity, grass whipping my body, a dull screeching behind my hands. Then it was gone. I stood up in awe of what just took place. I turned around, and as I stared on in awe and utter terror, the blood on my back grew hotter and hotter from the soon to be sleeping sun. I couldn’t look away. After they disappeared from view, it was as if the land gave a soft sigh of relief. The soft summer breeze returned, rustling the marred grass. A pungent, but welcoming smell of plants filled my nose. The birds regained their song. I gave my own sigh of relief as I collapsed in exhaustion and pain. I grew tired of the place, the anxious feeling returned. I must warn the town. My truck wasn’t in any better condition than I was. It had long gashes in its sides and had something that made me hold my breath. A specimen from the horde was stuck on the passenger door, it’s one of many ‘claws’ or cutting devices was shredded and hooked onto a warped chunk of metal. It was dying, I realized. As I held my breath, the rattling grew softer and less frequent, until it rattled no more. I took out my hunting knife, I was going to make sure this creature was dead. As my knife rammed into the flat of its head, it made a sickening ripping sound, as if someone was ripping canvas. I threw the thing in the back of the pickup to be sure I had evidence of the terror. After I drove around a few shredded powerlines and the electrified corpses of the monsters, I drove in silence. Feeling the aching all over my body, I finally muttered... “Thank god my insurance covers flying tambourine injuries”.",Insurance,0

The unrest began last Tuesday, when Al Qaeda announced that the number of virgins a suicide bomber would receive after his death, would be cut by 25% this February from 72 to 54. A spokesman said increases in recent years in the number of suicide bombings, has resulted in a shortage of virgins in the afterlife. 

The suicide bombers' union, the British Organization of Occupational Martyrs (B.O.O.M) responded with a statement saying the move was unacceptable to its members and called for a strike vote. 

General Secretary Abdullah Aloud Bhang told the press, ""Our members are literally working themselves to death in the cause of Jihad. We don't ask for much in return but to be treated like this is like a kick in the teeth"". 

Speaking from his shed in Tipton in the West Midlands, Al Qaeda chief executive Aisheet Mapants explained, ""I sympathize with our workers concerns but Al Qaeda is simply not in a position to meet their demands.  They are simply not accepting the realities of modern-day Jihad in a competitive marketplace. Thanks to Western depravity, there is now a chronic shortage of virgins in the afterlife. 

It's a straight choice between reducing expenditures or laying people off. I don't like cutting benefits but I'd hate to have to tell 3,000 of my staff that they won't be able to blow themselves up."" 

Spokespersons for the union in the North East of England, Ireland, Wales and the entire Australian continent stated that the change would not hurt their membership as there are so few virgins in their areas anyway. 

According to some industry sources, the recent drop in the number of suicide bombings has been attributed to Rosie O'Donnell; many Muslim Jihadists now know what a virgin looks like and have reconsidered their benefit packages. ",Muslim suicide bombers in Britain are set to begin a three-week strike on Wednesday in a dispute over the number of virgins they are entitled to in the afterlife,24

For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.'   

The dog said: 'That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?'   So God agreed.   

On the second day, God created the monkey and said:   'Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.'   

The monkey said: 'Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the Dog did?'   And God agreed.   

On the third day, God created the cow and said:   'You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years...'   

The cow said: 'That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?'   And God agreed again.   

On the fourth day, God created man and said:   'Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.'   

But the man said: 'Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?'   'Okay,' said God, 'You asked for it.'   So that is why for our first twenty years we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves.. For the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next ten years we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. And for the last ten years we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.",The meaning of life,982

""Do not be so nervous, Rosa, he is only a boy, and you are a beautiful girl.""

Somewhat reassured, Rosa went again into her husbands room, and saw that his pants were off, and that he had massive amounts of hair on his legs. So once again, Rosa ran into the hallway, and said,

""Mama! Mama! His legs are so hairy!"" And once again, her mother replied, 

""Please Rosa, do not be so nervous, he is still just a boy, and you are still a girl.""

Finally calm, Rosa proceeded into her husbands room, and saw that his socks were off, and also that half of the toes on his right foot were completely missing. Horrified, Rosa ran out of the room yelling,

""Mama! Mama! He's only got a foot and a half!""
