He is managing to stay afloat by clinging to a small segment of his broken vessel when a lone fisherman draws near and offers him a line. The man in the water refuses, saying, ""I do not need your assistance. The Lord will save me."" The fisherman pleads with the devout man but ultimately relents and sails away as a second, larger vessel draws near. The crew is perplexed as to why the fisherman would abandon this man, but they quickly learn when the man in the water calls out, ""Please, move along. I do not need your help. The Lord will save me."" The crew throws him a line anyway, but the man is adamant and refuses to hold on, always repeating, ""The Lord will save me."" A third ship arrives, and the result is the same. ""The Lord will save me."" As time passes, the man drifts farther and farther away from shore.



Eventually, the man is alone. It is dark, and the horizon is bare. All the ships have gone. The man is shivering with cold and begins to questions his faith. As he slips into the water, he whispers, ""Lord, why have you forsaken me?""



As life leaves the man's body, his soul springs to Heaven. There, he finds a crowd waiting for him. The restored man is immediately pleased to see Jesus standing directly in front of him but is also perplexed. He can't help but repeat his dying question, ""Lord, I was drowning. Why did you let me die?""

My best mate from uni moved to Japan a few years ago for work, he's settled down there and married a nice Japanese girl. Whenever he's been back over, he's always invited me to come and visit them, and this year I finally had the chance.

The flight over was great, the ride from the airport amazing with all the sights. The trouble started when I got to his house. 

After greeting my friend and his wife, and unpacking my stuff in the guest room, I made a trip to the bathroom.

In the UK, toilets are unremarkable and utilitarian in nature. Not in Japan. This was a hi-tech throne that looked like it could transform into a robot. Amazed as I was by this, I was tired and my need was urgent, so I sat down and got to business.

It was when I reached for the toilet paper that I realised my mistake. There was none. 

I looked around, and found nothing suitable. So I looked more carefully at the hi-tech lavatory I was seated upon. There were four discrete push buttons, with writing in Japanese for each. 

At this point, I should have shouted for help, but we English are a reserved lot, especially when it comes to our ablutions. Pride would not let me do it.

Hesitantly, I tried the first button, and was pleasantly surprised by a warm jet of water that cleansed my nether regions. This left me clean, but damp. And so, I tried the second button. A warm and gentle wind dried my bottom.

I was so pleased by this experience, that I decided to try the third button... and passed out in screaming agony. 

As I awoke in the hi-tech Japanese hospital, I found my friend and his wife anxiously sitting by my bed.  

""What was the third button?"" I asked, my voice weak with pain.

My friend's lovely Japanese wife leaned in close, and whispered in broken English, ""Automatic tampon removal"".",Japanese Toilet,54

His father looks at him, and says ""Son, if you want to take my car, there are three things I'm going to need from you. 
First is that you need to start helping your mother around the house. Not just what's expected, but above and beyond. 
Second, start reading the Bible. I see the crap you continuously funnel into your brain, and you need to start reading something beneficial to yourself. 
Third, get a haircut. I'm tired of having a son that thinks he's a rock star and that it's cool to have long hair.""
""Yes sir."" Is all that the son says, and moves along.

Over the course of the next week, the son starts doing what his father has asked of him, and feels as though he's done a good job. So he once again goes up to his dad to ask about the car.

""Dad, do you have a second to talk about me taking the car out this weekend? I really want to take this girl out on a date."" He asks.
His father replied ""Son, your mom told me that there's been some obvious changes with the way you help out around the house. Like how the other day, you cleaned out the garage without being asked. Good job on that. Also, the other night as I walked down the hallway, I noticed your lamp was on, so I peeked in and it looked to me as if you were reading the Bible.""

The son says, ""Yes sir, I was.... So about the car?""

His father looks at him, then back down at the morning paper and simply replies ""Haircut."" 

The son, being too attached to his long locks, wracked his brain for a moment, then says ""Well Dad, I've been thinking, after reading the Bible a bit, I've noticed that the apostles, and even Jesus himself had long hair.""

And without looking up, the father says, ""Well yes son, that is true, but they also had to walk their asses everywhere.""","A son goes up to his father,",1874

King Arthur was worried about leaving Queen Guinevere alone with all those horny knights of the Round Table. So he went to Merlin for some advice. 

The good wizard showed him his latest invention. It was a chastity belt... except that it had a rather large hole in the most obvious place. 'This is no good, Merlin!' the king exclaimed, 'Look at this opening. How is this supposed to protect m'lady, the Queen?'. 

'Ah, sire, just observe.' said Merlin.He then selected his most worn-out wand. He then inserted it in the gaping hole of the chastity belt whereupon a small guillotine blade came out and cut t he stick neatly in two. 'Merlin, you are a genius!' said King Arthur. 

After putting Guinevere in the device, King Arthur then set out upon his Quest. 

Several years passed until he returned to Camelot. Immediately he assembled all his knights in the courtyard and had them drop their trousers for a 'short arm' inspection. Sure enough, each of them has an amputated little Johnny or was damaged in some way. All of them except Sir Galahad. 'Sir Galahad', exclaimed King Arthur, 'The one and only true knight! Only you among all the nobles have been true to me. What is it in my power to grant you? Name it and it is yours!' 

But Sir Galahad was speechless",[Long] King Arthur and Queen Guinevere,57

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man sa,ys, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",An interesting sound,12

Love kicked open the front door, revolver raised, and yelled, ""Who named me? WHO NAMED ME?"" Bonnie loved his wife very much and would do anything to protect her, so he took the blame. ""It was me. I named you.""
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
Love blasted 3 bullets into Bonnie's chest and then ran off. As Bonnie lay there, blood seeping into the carpet, his wife came home. Shocked, she dropped the groceries and held Bonnie as he died. ""What happened, Bonnie, oh my god!?"" And with his last remaining breath he whispered into her ear:

Not wanting to leave yet, his friend comes up with a brilliant idea. “Do you have a 10?” His friend pulls out his wallet and says that he does. “Put the ten in your front pocket and tell her that some drunk guy threw up and was so sorry that he gave you that to get your shirt dry cleaned.”

His friend agreed that this would work so they continued drinking at the bar. 

When the man gets home it’s well past 3am. He tries to sneak in without waking up his wife, but being as drunk as he is he makes quite a bit of noise. His wife wakes up right before he takes off the shirt. She sees that it is covered in partially cleaned off vomit and gets mad assuming it was his own. The man explains his story. He pulled out the bill and said, “some drunk guy threw up on me and gave me a 10 to get my shirt cleaned. “

His wife wiped the sleep from her eyes and said, “But that’s a 20?!”

The man decides to go to an adult store to find her a sex toy to satiate her desires, and finds himself in an old shop run by a Chinese fellow. He explains his problem and the owner tells him he knows exactly what he needs. He brings out a wooden box with some strange engravings on it and explains to the man it is a voodoo dildo. Looking confused the man asks what in the heck a voodoo dildo is. He tells him to just watch and then says, 

“Voodoo dildo, the door.”

The dildo flies out of the box and begins to vigorously pound the door knob, causing the door to crack a little. The man, impressed, tells the owner he’ll pay whatever the price is for it. The owner then says,

“Voodoo dildo, the box,”

and it flies back in the box and the man purchases it.

He goes back home and explains to his wife that whenever she misses him to simply open the box and say,

“Voodoo dildo, my pussy,”

and leaves her the box.

He goes on his trip and the wife starts to miss him, and she decides to try it out. She opens the box and says,

“Voodoo dildo, my pussy,” 

And just like he said it starts to work it’s magic. After about 3 orgasms in she realizes she doesn’t know how to make it stop! She quickly gets in her car and starts to drive to the hospital as she is being pounded by the voodoo dildo. She has another orgasm and swerves quite a lot, when a cop notices and pulls her over. As soon as he gets to the window she starts to try and explain the voodoo dildo in between exasperated breaths to the cop. The cop replies,

So, an angry Henry storms outta the house and milks the cow and slaps her. The cow gets mad and kicks him in the nuts. Then, Henry feeds the pigs and shoves one of them. One pig knocks him down. After that, Henry cleans the crap outta the chicken coop (literally) and kicks one of the hens, then a rooster pecks him on the foot. Henry yells ""Eeyow!!! Ah hate bein' a farmboy!!!""

In pain and sweating, a worn-out Henry plops into a chair at the kitchen table, and his mama gives bowl of dry cereal and an empty plate. Henry springs up and asks ""Ma! Where's my bacon and eggs? And why didn't ya put milk in my cereal?""


Mama explains ""Henry, the reason I ain't gave ya no milk is b'cause you smacked that poor cow, and that's where milk comes from. You don't git no eggs 'cause you kicked that poor chicken, and that's where eggs come from. There ain't no bacon for you 'cause you shoved that poor pig, and that's where bacon comes from.""

Suddenly, Papa walks in and kicks the cat. The cat jumps up and scratches Papa's face then scampers away. Henry looks at Mama and says ""Ma, Pa just kicked the cat! What ya hafta say 'bout that?


Mama says ""That's it! You ain't orderin' no Chinese food!!!""",A Misbehaving Farmboy,9

Soon a brown bear appeared by the stream which ran through the valley. The hunter aimed and fired and killed the bear dead.

Suddenly then there was a tap, tap, tap on his shoulder.

The man turned around and there was a huge black bear, standing 7 feet high, towering over him. The bear said, ""you just shot my cousin"" To which the Hunter replied, ""Yes, I'm afraid I did."" ""Well,"" said the Bear, ""you have two choices. Either I maul you to death, or you pull down your pants and I have my way with you.""

Having no choice in the matter, the Hunter did as he was told.

The Hunter was really angry and vowed to get revenge. 3 months later after he had recovered, he went to the same spot, only this time he brought a huge elephant gun. He saw the black bear appeared at the stream and he fired. And shot him dead.

Tap, tap, tap. Polar bear. ""You shot my cousin""

""Why, yes, I'm afraid I did.""

""You have two choices. Either you die a bloody death, or you take off your pants and bend over. I'm going to screw you up the ass.""

Having no choice the Hunter sighed and did what he was told.

They  had each won a hand, and this one was to determine who was the best  poker player in the world. It was Obama's turn to deal. He dealt out  five cards to the other players, then took a look at his own hand: the  one of hearts, the three of clubs and the three of spades, the seven of  clubs, and the jack of diamonds.  
 

""So, anybody need to draw?"" He asked, knowing that Putin would say no.   
 

Rob Ford looked around the table, then said ""Gimme three."" Obama deals  him the cards, and Rob Ford glances at them as he discards. He has a carefully cultivated poker face, but Obama has noticed that he doesn't  always keep it up- so this must mean Rob Ford's draw wasn't that good.  
 

""I'll take one,"" Kim Jong-Un says. Obama slides him the card, and Kim  Jong-Un barely glances at it. It was hard for Obama to tell if he had a good poker face or if that was just how he looked, so he just assumed that Kim Jong-Un would try to apply some pressure during the bids.  
 

""I'll be keeping my hand,"" Obama says. They all look to Putin, and he clears his throat as if he's about to speak. He doesn't, and instead looks down at his solid platinum Rolex. Obama waits a few more seconds, then speaks up. ""Okay then. Rob, you'll start the-""  
 

""I'll take five,"" Putin interrupts. They all look to him, surprised-  this is the first time in any of the rounds he's taken any cards.   
 

Rob Ford loosens his collar, and pushes forward about four fifths of his chips. ""Eight million,"" he says neutrally, keeping his poker face and  lifting his chin up slightly.   
 

Putin is next, and pushes his whole pile of chips forwards. ""All in."" He  glances over at Rob Ford and smirks for a split-second, then looks back down at his watch. Kim Jong-Un pushes all his chips forwards too, his expression not having changed one bit. Obama shrugs and goes all in, wearing his ""determined yet hopeful"" expression.  
 

""Alright, Rob. Your go.""  
 

Rob Ford lays his cards on the table, but face down. ""One more. I'll  throw in all the leftover crack stashed in my basement."" The other players looked at him oddly. ""I'm still clean. I just kept it there as a reminder of what I'd gone through, and what could happen if I give in again. Aside from its street value, it would also hold a lot of moral  value,"" He adds.  
 

Putin shrugs. ""Then I shall add to my bet a day's production from my private vodka factory."" Obama makes that kind of ""meh/why not"" face, and turns to Kim Jong-Un, who takes the betting in a direction no one expected.  
 

""I shall add five months of the monetary sum of my glorious country's gross domestic product."" Even Putin raises his eyebrow at that. Obama sees a shine starting to form on Rob Ford's brow, and then clears his throat.  
 

""I'll see your five months, and match it.""  
 

""Not any more?"" Kim Jong-Un asks.  
 

""My country's five months of G.D.P. is a little bit more than yours,"" Obama casually comments.  
 

They all turn back to Rob Ford, who is now wearing his poker face. ""I don't have a country, but I'll bet an entire year's worth of Toronto's G.D.P."" He says calmly. ""And on top of that..."" Rob Ford reaches for the  cards he discarded, and flips them over: they're the ace of diamonds, two of hearts, and queen of clubs.  
 

Putin nods, and puts his cards face down on the table. ""If that is how  we are going to bet, then I offer the entire city of St. Petersburg.""  
 

""Do you mean the G.D.P., or the winner actually gets to own the whole thing?"" Obama asks.  
 

""G.D.P. AND legal ownership of the city."" Putin then takes his first hand that he traded in, and flips it over- it's a royal flush, spades.  
 

There's a moment of silence, and then Kim Jong-Un says, ""I shall not be intimidated by you. I see your bet of St. Petersburg, and raise you my entire country and a decade's worth of its G.D.P."" Obama sighs and massages his temples, and he hears Rob Ford quietly swear next to him.  
 

""Okay. You wanna play with the big dogs? I bet all of my country's territories and a year of our G.D.P.""  
 

Rob Ford is sweating now, and his jaw is trembling softly. ""I'll throw in Toronto, and the codes to N.A.T.O.'s Canadian missile system.""  
 

""When the Heck did you get those?"" Obama asks.  
 

""Snowden."" Obama angrily sighs, and looks up to Putin.  
 

""I see your city and the launch codes, and raise you the area of Siberia and our western-most missile system launch codes-""  
 

""I don't think so,"" Obama interrupts. ""We all know Siberia's big but has little to no real economic capability.""  
 

""Very well then. You want to play with the big dogs, Barack? Then I shall also add everything West of the Volga river as well as the launch codes for our southern missile defense systems.""  
 

They all turned to Kim Jong-Un then, who without any hesitation whatsoever said, ""I shall also bet Dennis Rodman."" Putin started to chuckle quietly, and Obama closed his eyes and calmed down.  
 

""He's one of my citizens. You'll have to bet something else, or fold.""  
 

Kim Jong-Un pulled out a cell phone from his jacket, and plays a video on it for Obama. It's several minutes long and very cinematic, featuring Dennis Rodman soulfully gazing into the distance from balconies all around North Korea. At the end Dennis Rodman looks into the camera and says, ""I'm taking my talents to North Korea."" The video then cuts to him in a large arena, signing something on a table. He holds it up for the crowd to see, and they cheer wildly as the camera zooms in and shows the paper to be a citizenship form. ""Dennis Rodman is now a citizen of my  country, and therefore my property. I. Bet. Dennis. Rodman.""  
 

""Fine then, I bet Snowden, as well as Alaska and Hawaii,"" Obama says to Putin. ""Rob?""  
 

""I bet myself,"" He says bravely. A very tense silence settles over the table, while Putin takes a sip of his drink.  
 

""I bet the entirety of my country, as well as Ukraine.""  
 

""You can't do that! You can't bet a country you don't own!"" Rob Ford sputters.  
 

Obama looks over to Rob Ford and says, ""No, but you can bet Djibouti he'll try."" ","One Day, Obama, Rob Ford, Kim Jong-Un, and Putin Were Sitting Around a Table, Playing Poker.",5

He can't believe that a monkey walked into his bar, ordered a martini, and then actually had a twenty-dollar bill to pay for it.

So, in amazement, he takes the twenty and walks to the cash register to make the change. While he's standing in front of the cash register he stops for a second and thinks to himself, ""Let me try something here and see if the monkey notices anything.""

So he walks back over to the monkey and hands him a dollar change. The monkey doesn't say anything, he just sits there sipping the martini. After a few minutes the bartender just can't take it anymore.

""You know,"" he says to the monkey, ""we don't get too many monkeys in here.""

-The client: is room 39 empty?

-The boss: yes, sir.

-The client: can I book it?

-The boss: of course you can.

-The client: thank you.
Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.

The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.

The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.

Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.

In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.

He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.

The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.

The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.

The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.

This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.

Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.

The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.

The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up.

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.

The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.

In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.

-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''

-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.

-''Swear''

-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''

So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss.

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.

When he does, I will let you know... thank you for reading.",A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss.,0

The CEO who was stepping down met with him privately and presented him with three numbered envelopes. ""Open these if you run up against a problem you don't think you can solve,"" he said. 

Well, things went along pretty smoothly, but six months later, sales took a downturn and he was really catching a lot of heat. About at his wit's end, he remembered the envelopes. He went to his drawer and took out the first envelope. The message read, ""Blame your predecessor."" 

The new CEO called a press conference and tactfully laid the blame at the feet of the previous CEO. Satisfied with his comments, the press -- and Wall Street - responded positively, sales began to pick up and the problem was soon behind him. 

About a year later, the company was again experiencing a slight dip in sales, combined with serious product problems. Having learned from his previous experience, the CEO quickly opened the second envelope. The message read, ""Reorganize."" This he did, and the company quickly rebounded. 

After several consecutive profitable quarters, the company once again fell on difficult times. The CEO went to his office, closed the door and opened the third envelope.

There was a heated discussion when all four princes were at an appropriate age for being candidates to the throne. But alas, how unfair fate is as our little prince was bested by his brothers.

At an early age he found himself planting seeds of envy as he spectates his older siblings growing closer to their father, or more precisely closer to inheriting the throne.

Despritied by the thought of missing the chance to the throne, he gathered his courage as he boldly steps into the King's Chamber and with a straight face asked the question:

""Father, how may I increase my chances to succeeding you?""

The king ponders at his youngest son's blatant question, but proceeds to respond anyway. 

""Really?"" said the little prince 

""Yes, really"" reaffirmed the King.

Content on his Father's response, he swiftly exits the King's Chamber.
                         
                          ...
Several years later we find that the little prince now of appropriate age is entitled to be throned the next king.

The once small, but now proud prince rests in his private quarter along with his personal Knight, awaiting the preparations to the crowning ceremony.

""Congratulations Your Majesty""

""Well Rupert you could just call me Fredrick you know, after all you were one my closest friend""

""Nonsense Your Majesty! A King must befit his actions!""

""Well you're right, which reminds me of the words of my old man; because without him I wouldn't have been given this unique opportunity""

""Well pardon my intrusion Your Majesty but what did the former King say?""

""Nothing complex really, he simply said 'Go ask your Mother first.'""",There was once an ambitious prince...,10

She replies, 'The bigger they are, the dumber the man is'

post,956sgd,2qh72,jokes,false,1533601453,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/956sgd/dear_tech_support/,self.jokes,,"Dear Tech Support, Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a distinct slow down in overall system performance -- particularly in the flower and jewelry applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5 and then installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0, NBA 3.0, and Golf Clubs 4.1. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do? Signed, Desperate

Dear Desperate, First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, while Husband 1.0 is an Operating System. Please enter the command ""! http:I\_Thought\_You\_Loved\_Me.html"" and try to download Tears 6.2 and don't forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update. If that application works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5. But remember,overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0 or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the Snoring Loudly Beta. Whatever you do, DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 (it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources). Also, do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0. In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance. We recommend! Food 3.0 and HotLingerie 7.7. Good Luck, Tech Support

Dear Tech Support: Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. I soon noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Football 5.0, Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and Racing 3.6 barely run due to lack of space. I can't seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favorite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. Please help! Thanks, Troubled User

Dear Troubled User: This is a very common problem that men complain about. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 was designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony/Child Support. I recommend that you keep Wife 1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application ""Yes\_Dear 2.6"" to alleviate software augmentation. The best course of action is to enter the command C:\\APOLOGIZE! because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal. Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5, and Do Bills 4.2. However, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nagging 9.5. Once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0!  WARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system! Best of luck, Tech Support",Dear Tech Support,25

Everybody liked the guy, and he was dedicated to his job - stopping people from shooting the deer in the park, maintaining fences and gates, that kind of thing. He was really good at it, too. During the time the ranger served there, no animals were shot, the fence only broke once, and the tourists didn't get lost.

One day, though, the city that hosted the parkland decided to turn it into a business district, as it was right in the center of the city and there was more parkland farther out from the center anyway. 

This decision mentally crushed the ranger, and he went completely crazy and had to be sent to a mental hospital. This was an unexpected turn of events. Everyone who knew him personally thought he was the most mentally stable person they had ever met, and were completely surprised to suddenly get a notice from the mental hospital asking them if they had any other experiences where he went crazy before. They denied it until they went to see the ranger freaking out, at which point they realized that he might not be the best person to look up to anymore. The ranger's wife told their kids that ""he will be back soon, don't worry.""

Doctors tried to cure him, both with mental health drugs and therapy, as his situation was unique - he had no prior history of mental injury, and neither did his family tree have any crazies in it. Scans of the brain he had showed no activity out of the ordinary, and all the chemical balances in his brain and body were the same as a healthy human. Therefore, the doctors assumed that this would be an easy cure.

Yet none of the cures worked. Day by day, he would take different chemicals, see different therapists, perform different exercises, yet none of them did any substantial good. His mental condition had gotten more stable, and he only freaked out twice per day, but the freakouts were bad enough to keep him in the crazy house.

One day, a doctor overheard him muttering about his park in his sleep, and decided to try something that seemed inevitable to fail. The nearest protected parkland had plenty of job opportunities for a ranger like him, and the doctor decided to make the guy apply to the job opening.    
Surprisingly enough, he got accepted in; and after his first day at the park, he returned back to the hospital and went to sleep. He hadn't suffered a freakout the entire day.    
This happened on all the working days of the week. His mental health was completely stable, and the doctor was surprised that even worked, as it was a long shot that shouldn't have paid off.

When it got to the weekend, the nurses waited anxiously for another freakout. He didn't have any. By the end of the month, no freakouts had occurred. The staff at the mental hospital decided to let him go out into the world, and told the ranger's wife to alert them if he had another freakout.

No alerts came. He had been completely cured.

After a year had passed since he left the mental hospital, the ranger's family decided to thank the doctor personally. They walked into his office carrying a gift of cake, and while he talked to them, the ranger's wife asked a question.

""How did you know how to solve his mental issues?""

The doctor replied, ""It was nothing special really. He was just deranged.""

Finally, the third officer, also a lieutenant commander, is our ship's doctor, with an undergraduate degree from the University of Georgia and his medical degree is from the University of North Carolina . We are very proud of him, as he is also a senior fellow in Trauma Surgery at Bethesda .'

After making a sharp turn on the trail he was riding, he spotted an Indian standing on a rock, who was naked and had a hard-on. Confused, the cowboy slowed down to get a glimpse of the Indian.

The Indian spotted him, and then he looked up and down, then once more up and down..

""1:30"" the Indian called

""What"" the cowboy said, confused

""1:30"" the Indian said again

The cowboy took out his watch, and it read 1:30 exactly. *Well I'll be damned*, *how'd he know that?* The cowboy questioned himself.

*Man these Indians are weird* thought the cowboy.

Deciding to shake it off and just forget about it, the cowboy kept on his way. After a little while, the cowboy took another sharp turn with his horse, and saw another Indian. Just as the other Indian was, this man was fully naked and sporting a hard-on standing on a rock.

*Okay, the hell is going on?* Thought the cowboy.

The Indian looked at him, and then he looked up and down, then up and down once more.

""3:17"" the Indian called

""What"" the cowboy responded

""3:17"" the Indian said again

The cowboy took out his watch, and it read 3:17 exactly. *Son of a bitch, how the hell can he know that?* The cowboy thought as he rode by. Again the cowboy then rode on for some time, going up and down valleys, across streams, until he took a sharp turn, and again saw a naked Indian with a hard-on standing on top of a rock. Only this time the Indian seemed to be masturbating.

Confused, the cowboy questioned the Indian, ""what are you doing"" he asked.

The Indian looked up at the cowboy and stopped his apparent masturbating,

""I'm a great gambler, and I can prove it,"" says Grandpa. ""How about a demonstration?""

The auditor thinks for a moment and said, ""Okay. Go ahead.""

Grandpa says, ""I'll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.""

The auditor thinks a moment and says, ""It's a bet.""

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor's jaw drops.

Grandpa says, ""Now, I'll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.""

Now the auditor can tell Grandpa isn't blind, so he takes the bet. Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye.

The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa's attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

""Want to go double or nothing?"" Grandpa asks. ""I'll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.""

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he ends up urinating all over the auditor's desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa's own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

Her initial attempts don't go very well, as most of the contact she receives varies from dick pics to guys asking for nudes. She's about to give up when one day she's contacted by a very polite, kind seeming gentleman named Odaka from Nigeria. They chat for weeks, even video-conferencing, and she eventually discovers that he is actually a king is his country and that his former spouse had also passed some years before.  All the woman's friends warn her that the relationship is probably a scam,  but the man seems so earnest that she ignores them.

One day, her online paramour announces that he is coming to visit her in the USA. Her friends insist that they accompany her to the airport when she meets him, still mindful of scams. To their surprise, the man arrives in a private jet with a royal entourage. He is indeed a king!

  
Feeling embarrassed, they do their best to make up for their doubt and fully support the couple. Agnes and her lover have a great time. He loves America and is in wonder with some of the big city. Despite being king - he explains - he has never left his home city, which is not very large and is quite isolated. Agnes and the king move in together and are very happy.

After awhile, though, the relationship starts to feel strained. Odaka is becoming increasingly distant, and seems to be very unhappy.  


Worried, Agnes asks him what's wrong, but he half-heatedly assures her all is fine.

This goes on for awhile, and finally the friends intervene.  


Is something wrong between him and Agnes, they wonder.  


Odaka assures them that Agnes is the more lovely woman he's ever known, and that it's not her fault

Worriedly, they ask if their previous distrust has driven a wedge between the couple, but Odaka tells them that he understands and that he is very happy with the support they've given them since his arrival.

What then, they ask, is the problem.

Well, he tells them: ""Agnes is incredible, and her friends are all very nice, but...""

The  friends press him for an answer, worried that he may have a potential health issue or some other serious problem.  Finally, he tells them:

""New York is a wonder and America a great country, but...""

I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say ""Happy Birthday"", and possibly have a present for me.

As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone, ""Happy Birthday"". I thought....well, that's marriage for you, but maybe the kids will remember. My kids came down for breakfast and didn't say a word.

So, when I left for the office, I was feeling pretty low and somewhat despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, ""Good morning,
Boss, Happy Birthday"". It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.

I worked until one o'clock and then Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go out to lunch, just you and me"". I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go"".

We went to lunch. but we didn't go where we normally would go. We dined instead at a little place with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office Jane said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day....we don't need to go back to the office, do we?"" I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" She said, ""Let's go to my apartment"".

After arriving at her apartment Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for a moment. I'll be right back."" ""OK"", I nervously replied.

She went into the bedroom and after a couple of minutes, she came 
out carrying a huge birthday cake......followed by my wife, kids and
dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy Birthday"".

And I just sat there........
