""Dear Ronald J. Kse,

This year we have chosen you to be the host of this year's harvest reap! All you need to do is provide your humble farm as the place of the party, and we will all provide.
Thanks, your neighbors""

Now, Ronald had really enjoyed last year's party, so he was delighted to be the host for this year.

After a grand day of eating, drinking, and merrymaking, All of Ronald's neighbors left - without helping clean up.

""That's fine, its just one party, and I've done the same other years"" said Ron.

Fast forward the next year, Ron was looking forward to this year's harvest, and the celebration that would follow.

After attending this year's anonymous vote, he gets another letter in the mail.

""Dear Mr. Kse, After the amazing time everyone had last year, the vote was decided again for you to be the host! We look forward to seeing you again, and thank you.""

Ron sighs, but thinks ""Yeah, last year's party was pretty great. I guess the cleanup wasn't too bad. No worries.""

Again, he gathered with his neighbors, and they feasted and drank themselves silly... but there were twice as many people this year. Friends, family, friends of family were all invited...

The cleanup was far worse this year. ""But,"" Ron thought, ""there's no way I'll get it three years in a row.""

Next year, Ron's sister was visiting, and went with him to check the mail. She handed him a very lavish envelope, garnished with golden filigree and laden with caligraphy.

She exclaimed ""Wow! This is beautiful! It must be something very wonderful and important!""

""No... I've seen this before... It's another fucking reap host..."" said R. Joe Kse",A farmer gets a letter,1521

He finds a suitable establishment and after he sits down he asks for four pints of Guinness to be brought out at the same time. The waitress complies with the unusual request and the Irishman quietly enjoys the four pints before leaving. 

He becomes a regular at the bar and one day the bar tender asked out of curiosity ""Why order all four at once? I could have the waitress bring them out one at a time and they would be cold to drink.""

""That's a fair offer lad,"" replied the Irishman, ""but you see, before I left home, me and me three brothers all agreed that no matter where our fortunes take us we will always drink together.""

The bartender was touched by this sentiment and never asks about it again. With time this touching ritual became familiar to the other regulars and while he kept to himself, not a bad word could be said about the Irishman.

One day the Irishman comes in looking depressed and the bar tender asks, ""Four pints as usual?""

With a deep sigh the Irishman replies, ""Nay, just three from now on.""

A hush falls over the bar as the Irishman takes his regular seat. The bartender personally brings over the three pints and setting them down says, ""I'm sorry for your loss, these are on me."" 

""Loss?"" replies the Irishman

""Well you are only having three pints from now on, did one of your brothers pass away?""

“What a horrible way to die!”

“No no, he survived that, that didn’t kill him at all. So, he’s landed in my upstairs bedroom and he’s all covered in broken glass on the floor. Then, he spots the big old antique wardrobe we have in the room and reaches up for the handle to try to pull himself up. He’s just dragging himself up when bang, this massive wardrobe comes crashing down on top of him, crushing him and breaking most of his bones.”
“What a way to go, that’s terrible!”

“No no, that didn’t kill him he survived that. He managed to get the wardrobe off him and crawls out onto the landing, he tries to pull himself up on the banister but under his weight, the banister breaks and he goes falling down on to the first floor. In mid air, all the broken banister poles spin and fall on him, pinning him to the floor, sticking right through him.”
“Now that is the most unfortunate way to go!”

“No no, that didn’t kill him, he even survived that. So he’s on the downstairs landing, just beside the kitchen. He crawls in to the kitchen, tries to pull himself up on the stove, but reached for a big pot of boiling hot water, whoosh, the whole thing came down on him and burned most of his skin off him.”
“Man, what a way to go!”

“No no, he survived that, he survived that! He’s lying on the ground, covered in boiling water and he spots the phone and tries to pull himself up, to call for help, but instead he grabs the light switch and pulls the whole thing off the wall and the water and electricity didn’t mix and so he got electrocuted, wallop, 10,000 volts shot through him.”

After years and years of torment, Onestone finally cracked and said,' If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!' The word got around and nobody called him that any more.
Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird forgot and said, 'Good morning, Onestone.'
He jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night. He made love to her all the next day, until Blue Bird died from exhaustion. The word got around that Onestone meant what he promised he would do.
Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until a woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away. Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.
She hugged him and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.'
Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, then he made love to her all day, made love to her all night, made love to her all the next day, made love to her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!

The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room, and found her husband laying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle laying next to him and the patio door shattered. The wife ran to the phone and summoned an ambulance. Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the several flights of long steps to the street to direct the paramedics to her husband.

After the ambulance arrived and transported the husband to the hospital, the wife uprighted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas had spilled on the floor, the wife obtained some papers towels, blotted up the gasoline, and threw the towels in the toilet.

The husband was treated at the hospital and was released to come home.

After arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went into the bathroom, sat on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while still seated. The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming.

She ran into the bathroom and found her husband laying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs and his groin. The wife again ran to the phone and called for an ambulance. The same ambulance crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The paramedics loaded the husband on the stretcher and began carrying him to the street.

While they were going down the stairs to the street accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the husband had burned himself. She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them tipped the stretcher and dumped the husband out. He fell down the remaining steps and broke his ankle.

So the husband puts his face onto hers and *pushes* her up against the fence, and mannn, do things start to get hot. They’re out there rubbing against each other, screaming, cursing, doing all the stuff! And they’re at it for a long time, too. Like ten minutes. Well, after those ten minutes are up, they both just collapse onto the ground - physically exhausted - I mean, they are in their 70’s.

Well, after a couple minutes of lying silently on the ground, the husband just says, “Damn, babe, I didn’t remember that fence being electric.”",Hot old couple,5

During the course of the meal, his mother could't help but notice how pretty his roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship between the two, and this had only made her more curious. Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and his roommate than met the eye.

Reading his mom's thoughts, the son volunteered, ""I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, we are just roommates.""

About a week later, his roommate came to him saying, ""Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find one the silver Spoons. You don't suppose she took it, do you?""

He said ,""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure.""

He sat down and wrote :

Dear Mother:

**I'm not saying that you 'did' take a silver spoon from my house, I'm not saying that you 'did not' take a silver spoon .. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.**

**Love,**

**your son**


Several days later, he received an email from his Mother which read:

**Dear Son:**
**I'm not saying that you DO sleep with your roommate, and I'm not saying that you DO NOT sleep with her. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver spoon by now, under the pillow…**

She goes to the kennel and asks for the most ferocious dog they have. 
“That would be Mike Tyson” says the kennel owner. He goes out back and returns with a tiny little pug trotting behind him. 
“That’s Mike Tyson?” she asks incredulously.  “He’s tiny!”
“You would think so” the guy says “but watch this!”
He looks the dog in the eye and says “Mike Tyson - tire!”
The little dog jumps at the spare tire in the corner of the kennel and in a flash of teeth and muscle he rips the tire into shreds. 
The woman is very impressed. She buys the dog and takes him home. 
She decides to test out the dog’s powers for herself. 
“Mike Tyson - chair!“ she calls out. 
Again the little dog turns into a snarling muscular beast. In a flash of teeth and sawdust the chair is quickly disintegrated.
The next day her husband comes back from a business trip. He sees the little doggo in the living room.
“Aww what a cute little pup“ he says. “What is his name?“
“That’s Mike Tyson“ his wife responds.

It fell out like this: In the early 1800s, a certain chief, renowned among his people for his wise leadership, skilful hunting and (when necessary) prowess in battle, went to his medicine man with a highly personal problem: Despite many years of marriage and three beautiful wives, the chief had no children to follow after him, and he had no idea why. The medicine man, after lengthy research, told him what the matter was. According to custom and tradition, the chief should have presented each of his wives with a rare and precious animal skin to lie upon when they were seeking to make a baby, and because he had omitted to do this, the wrathful spirits had closed the wombs of all three. After so many years, the chief would need to resort to heroic measures to appease the spirits – yet, said the medicine man, to such a great chief this should be well within his compass.  

The task, he was told, was to journey further than any chief of legend, and find three animals that no red man had ever seen or imagined, and return with their hides to present to his wives. Then, and only then, would the spirits be satisfied. Accordingly, the chief prepared himself a great canoe and loaded it with supplies of all kind ready for the great journey; and one fine day he set off into the western ocean, not knowing where he was bound.  

After a long voyage, the chief found himself in a land of arid deserts where black men threw strange sticks for weapons, and hunted a strange animal like a deer that went in great bounds upon its hind legs. Learning that this was a *kangaroo*, the chief hunted one, killed it, skinned it, and put the hide in his canoe.  

Journeying on, the chief came to another land of brown men and tall grasses where there roamed a mighty creature far exceeding in size and power the mountain lion of his homeland, decked in a coat of orange and black. Learning that this was a *tiger*, the chief hunted one,  killed it, skinned it, and put the hide in his canoe.  

Finally, in a land of rivers and swamps, the chief learned of a monstrous grey terror with a maw as large as a tepee, with tusks that could rend a man limb from limb, and that this creature was a *hippopotamus*. Therefore he hunted one, killed it, skinned it, and put the hide in his canoe.  

Returning home, the chief presented each of his wives with one of the wondrous hides, and the spirits were at last appeased, and within the year the chief was the proud father of four strong babies. The squaw who received the kangaroo skin bore a maiden as beautiful as the first dawn of Spring, the squaw who received the tiger skin bore a son as splendid as the tallest tree in the forest, while the third squaw bore twins, each as admirable as their brother and sister.  

History has shamefully lost the name of this pioneer, who by his magnificent deeds unlocked a great secret for his people: that the squaw on the hippopotamus is equal to the sum of the squaws on the other two hides.",A legend of the Native Americans,42

 He declines. “Thanks for asking, but, I'm not hungry right now. It's this Viagra,"" he says. ""It's really taken the edge off my appetite.""

At lunchtime, she asks him if he'd like something. ""How about a bowl of soup, homemade muffins, or a cheese sandwich?""

He declines. ""The Viagra,"" he says, ""really trashes my desire for food.""

Come dinner time, she asks if he wants anything to eat. ""Would you like a juicy rib eye steak and some scrumptious apple pie? Or maybe a rotisserie chicken or tasty stir fry?""

He declines again.
 
 ""No,"" he says, ""it's got to be the Viagra. I'm still not hungry.""

St.. Peter said, 'I'm sorry, but there's only one way you can go back, and that is as a chicken.' Bob was devastated, but begged St. Peter to send him to a farm near his home.... 

The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking, and pecking the ground. A rooster strolled past. 'So, you're the new hen, huh? How's your first day here?'

'Not bad,' replied Bob the hen, 'but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I'm gonna explode!'

'You're ovulating,' explained the rooster. Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before? '

'Never,' said Bob.

'Well, just relax and let it happen,' says the rooster. 'It's no big deal.'

Bob did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg!

Bob was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood. He soon laid another egg -- his joy was overwhelming.

As he was about to lay his third egg, he felt a smack on the back of his head, and heard his wife yell.....

He greets them politely saying, “My dear sisters in Christ, before I can allow anyone to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, I must ask each a question.”

Continuing, as he smiles down at them, “I must emphasize, being truthful in your response, and if necessary, atoning as instructed, are the keys to passing these gates.”

All four nuns agree and line up in single file. The first nun approaches Saint Peter meekly.

He asks her, “Dear Sister, in your estimation have you ever done anything in your time on earth that might prevent you from passing through these gates?”

She looks nervously at her feet for a moment or two, then timidly replies. “Yes sir, I touched a man’s penis once...” quickly adding while extending her left index finger, “but only briefly with my finger.”

With a raised eyebrow and a look of mild shock, Saint Peter looks down at her, considering. After a few moments, with a hint of concern, he tells her. “Alright sister, I can let you in, but only if you wash your finger in the holy water from the basin over by the gates.”

The first nun breathes a huge sigh of relief and scurries off to do as he asks, while Saint Peter watches her intently. Once she completes her task the gates open with a fanfare and she disappears inside, gates clanging shut behind her.

Saint Peter returns his attention to the line of nuns, looking a bit irked now, and motions, at which the second nun steps sheepishly forward.

A bit rattled he asks, “Dear Sister, in your estimation have you ever done anything in your life that may prevent you from entering Heaven”?

The second nun is noticeably squirming now. Finally she stammers, “Y-y-yes sir, I also touched a man’s penis, but just briefly, with my hands.”

Saint Peter is now noticeably exasperated, muttering to himself, while staring down at her sharply...

After a minute of careful consideration Saint Peter tells her, “Ok sister, I will allow you in as well, but first you must wash your hands in the holy water there,” motioning irritably towards the basin.

She gasps audibly, then rushes to do as she is told, Saint Peter glowering after her.

It is in this moment the fourth nun taps the third on the shoulder, asking if she can cut in front of her in line. To which the third asks, “Whatever for dear sister?”

“Well,” the fourth replies, “I would really like to gargle that holy water, before you sit in it!”

One day, a young man was recruited by this choir. His beautuful tenor voice made all who herd it stop in amazement.

One thing you should know about this land is that music has magical properties. A well performed  song can do magical things. As such, the study of music and what it can magically do is wide spread.

Well, this monastery was well known for both the beauty of the music its members performed, but also for its strive to learn all music could do magically speaking.

As such, this young man, with the beautiful tenor voice, was trained from day one of his joining the monastery. Each day his skill in singing grew.

And each day his knowledge of magic grew as well....

The first time the choir performed after he joined, this young man, his name was Sam by the way, had an imporant part to play.

You see Sam had a solo, in fact a single note he had to sing.

When it was time for him to sing, he stepped forward.  As Sam sung his single note,  everyone stopped to listen to this beautiful note this young man sung. And smiled a little, admiring the grace of this sound.

This happened year after year. Sam would sing, and something magical would happen. Up until the 6th time he had sung his now famous notes. 

To top it all of, each note that was sung by Sam became more beautiful than the last. Each year people would gather to listen to this boy sing. His 6th year (and 6th magical note) were no different. 

His 6th preformance was so beautiful in every way, people where crying for joy months after the preformance. It semed as if Heaven itself would be commonplace and to plane in comparison.

Than came the 7th year. When it came time for Sam to sing, he stepped forward, sung his note. 

This note, was unusually. It was so vile in sound, pitch and tone that every one flinched. Women wept, babes screamed, children cried in fear.  It was so crude Sam suddenly burst into flames, and died.

Confused as to what happened, a member of the choir askes a friend: ""What happened?""

A little confused herself, the friend turned and said ""Sam sung Note 7....""

He had wanted to be a train driver ever since he was a little boy, and he loved his job. So one day, he was so into his job that he decided to go a little faster. So he sped up the train and it went so fast that it derailed. So the train derailed and it killed one person. So he went to court and the judge decided he was guilty, so he was sentenced to the electric chair. By law, you were given one last meal, so the man asked the train driver what he would like. He said that he would like one banana. So he eats his banana, and then sits in the electric chair. The man flips the switch and sparks fly and smoke fills the room. So when it all clears, the train driver is in the electric chair unharmed. He was then free to go due to this being considered as divine intervention.

So he somehow gets his job back and he speeds up the train again and kills two people. He goes to court again, is guilty, and sentenced to the electric chair. The man once again asks the train driver what he wants for his last meal. The train driver says that he wants two bananas. So he has the bananas and sits in the chair. The man flips the switch, sparks fly, and smoke fills the room. After it clears, the train driver is unharmed and is once again free to go.

So he unbelievably gets his job back and the same incident occurs again except this time he kills three people. He goes through the same process again and is asked once again what he wants for his last meal. He asks for three bananas. So he eats his bananas, the electric chair is activated and when everything clears, the train driver is still unharmed.

So he miraculously gets his job back and this time he kills four people. This time though he doesn't even go to court, he is sent immediately to the electric chair. So when he gets to the place the man looks at the train driver and says: ""Alright, no more bananas, you're going into that chair right now."" So he flips the switch and when all is clear, the train driver is still unharmed. The man is frustrated. ""How did you survive? You didn't get your bananas."" The train driver looked at him and said ""The bananas  have nothing to do with it, I'm just a really bad conductor.",Did you ever hear the one about the Bulgarian train driver?,18

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""

The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are, and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. 

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!

With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.

EDIT 1: if this gets to 5k I'll tell all of you what that haunting and seductive noise is.

EDIT 2: The sweet, haunting and seductive noise is the sound of angry redditors clicking the downvote button after reaching the end of the joke",One of my drill sergeants favorite stories,5469
