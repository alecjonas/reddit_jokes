They young lady replied, “I had been troubled by my Hemorrhoids for quite some time”. The shaman, replied “Young lady, here’s an ancient script, just put it there and it’ll do the trick” ",The Shaman that licks,2

post,ba2u8t,2qh72,jokes,false,1554544887,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ba2u8t/being_unoriginal/,self.jokes,,"I like telling jokes, but I'll tell you, it aint easy being original. It's like all the gimmicks have been taken. A lot of comics say they started out imitating their idols. They would ""borrow"" material at first, then start to develop their own style. I don't know if I like the idea of stealing jokes. Plus, it's difficult to use old material now that everything in recorded history can be looked up in mere moments.

I'll close my eyes and wait for an image to come to me. A few moments go by and I'll see a horse and then a hallway and think... how can I make this funny? Is there a story to tell?

With my eyes still closed I think of a way to start the story. ""What's the deal with... horses... No, 'what's the deal' has been done. Oh, I get no respect...  in the hallway... No, 'no respect' has been done.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So there's this horse standing in a hallway. The school bell rings, and students rush out of the classrooms.

Nick grabs his red tie, shakes his head to the side, and says, ""What's the deal with the horse?

Alex walks over with his hands near his chest. His skinny fingers are curled and pushed together. His hands are making gestures like he's holding something, but they are empty. He says, ""It looks sad. Why the long face horsey, ol' buddy ol' pal? Don't you get any respect?""

It looks over at both students and replies, ""Nicky and Alex, you kids say the darnedest things. I know you'd like to go home and eat some tater salad or go hunting or fishing (get 'er done), but it's bad for ya. If you study hard when we get home, I'll reward you with da pudding popsss.... doh.

&amp;#x200B;

On the way out they pass Gina, the lunch lady.

Nick starts waving his hands and does a robotic duck walk. ""Sooo hot, want to touch to the...  ahwooo"".

Alex says, ""Daamn Gina. Psst, hey, I'd like to sneak you into big mamas house and rock yo world.""

Gina jokingly says, ""You so cray-zay."" Then her face turns serious and she says, ""Beat it, kid. Take a long walk off a short pier. Take a flying leap. Make a day of it. The fresh air will do you some good.""

Alex replied, ""Sure, I'd do anything. I'd survive a plane crash to be with you. I would be like the black box, impervious to destruction. Hey, why don't they make the whole plane a black box.

Gina left. Nick started jumping up and down and stomping, ""Women be shopping, baby. You can't stop... a woman from shopping.""

&amp;#x200B;

They leave school. Nick asks on the way home, ""Mom, how are you so confident?""

Their mom says, ""Sometimes when I get nervous, I stick my hand in my arm pits and then pull them out and smell my fingers. It makes me feel like a superstar. But, you kids should take school seriously, you don't want to...  END UP... LIVING IN A VAN DOWN BY THE RIVER. It's hard out there in the real world. The powers that be, own you. They took our country a long time ago and made it into a giant shopping mall and nobody seems to notice and nobody seems to care... ""

Nick and Alex got worried. To lighten the mood, Nick curled his lip and started twitching his head. ""Hey mamma, it'll be alright."" Then started singing Treat Me Like a Fool and Blue Suede Shoes. When he was finished, he bowed his head and said, ""Tank you veddy much.""

&amp;#x200B;

Alex checked the mail after they got home. He put an envelope up to his head and said, ""Ovaltine."" He then opened the envelope and said, ""Describe Oprah Winfrey in high school.""

Nick said, ""You went to far. If you have to cut others down to make yourself feel better, you might be a redneck.""

&amp;#x200B;

That night when the brothers were going to sleep. Nick asked Alex, ""Do you think we're normal.""

Alex replied, ""What's normal? Our washing machine is normal. It can be delicate and casual, but it never made me laugh.""

It glittered in the sunlight, momentarily blinding anyone who was caught in its reflection. Freddy seemed to be the happiest guy on earth, singing loudly for everyone to hear. Scott just had to ask him.

""Hey Fred, where did you get that necklace? Won the lottery or something?""

""Oh ayuh,"" Fred replied ""my farm was chosen for one of them 'scientific studies'. Couple of them white coats came and gave my cow some injections. She shits solid gold now.""

""That's unbelievable man. You must be a millionaire now.""

""I am. I even got myself some lawyers, to look after my properties"" Freddy said. ""Oh there's one of them, gotta run Scotty. These fellows have been avoiding me since they had me sign some papers."" 

A month later, they met again. This time Freddy looked even more happy. His gold chain was gone, now he was wearing a necklace that seemed to be engraved with every kind of jewel possible. Rubies redder than blood, emeralds as green as grass, opals changing colours like the rainbow. 

""What happened, Freddy?"" Scott asked ""Where's your gold chain?""

""Oh, I had to sell it"", Freddy said "" My lawyers said the cow was theirs now, as was all of its shit. Sadly, some of it was on me. So they took it. I knew I shouldn't have trusted those slicks.""

""Well, what happened then? How did you get this necklace?""

""I got lucky again. The two white coats came again, gave some injections to my chickens. The eggs are now full of jewels."" Fred said ""They are even paying me compensation for not being able to have any chicks. I am even richer now, the jewels sell for more than gold and the hens are laying more eggs than the cow used to crap.""

""That seemed to have worked out in your favour then."" Scott said.

""It did. Listen Scott, I gotta go now, it's time for gathering the eggs. The coop overflows with eggs if they are not gathered in time.""

Two months later when they met again, Freddy seemed to be even happier. He was wearing what looked like a string of black pearls, glistening like black flowers covered in morning dew.

""Hey Scott,"" Freddy said ""what do you think of my new jewellery?""

""It's nice Freddy, but what happened to your chickens?"" Scott asked.

""Well, turns out the papers I signed says that every mutant animal of mine belongs to my lawyers. So they took away the chickens and my necklace.""

""Sorry to hear that, Fred. What happened then? Did the scientist folks change another of your livestock?""

""Yeah they did. They gave some injections to my goat and gave me two grands for my troubles. That was a week ago. One of the lawyers came and took away the goat today. They let me keep this chain as a memento.""

""Then why are you happy? They took away your goat, you should be angry.""

""This place is going to take some getting used to. It's like a mirror version of Earth. The elements which are rare on Earth are the most abundant here while the common elements are extremely rare.""

""So why are we here then,"" the guy asked,  ""we can't settle here, oxygen must be very rare.""

""We are not here to settle, kid"" the Chief said ""we are here to export. It's the biggest stroke of luck the Gaia Company has had since we found that big diamond inside Jupiter. We'll all be very rich after this, you can count on that.""

They travelled in silence after that until they reached the settlement gates. The new guy couldn't believe his eyes.

""The buildings are made of gold!"", he said.

""Not just gold , it's alloyed with one part platinum and one part radium, to glow at night.""

When they entered the settlement the guy was even more surprised. 

""A nuclear reactor at every home?""

""Yep, Uranium's as common as dirt here. You just have to dig two inches and there it is. Also very radioactive, that's why we had the ground covered with gold to keep the radiation contained. Now we just supply the uranium through pipes.""

The guy saw some people carrying large bags down to their houses.

""Who are those guys?"" he asked.

""Scientists. The old buggers are very happy nowadays. All the elements that had to be artificially manufactured on Earth are naturally occuring here. They have been conducting experiments since the day we came here. Some of them haven't been seen for six months.""

They travelled like this for an hour until they finally reached the Department of Communication. 

""This is where you are assigned kid"" the Chief said ""Radio wave communication doesn't work very well here, all the radioactivity in the atmosphere interferes with the signal. So we are going old school, telegraphs. Your job is to manage the lines and look after the posts. You will be the Department Head. There are 20 guys working under you. Come on, let's meet some of them.""

They walked a little while until they came to a forest. The guy couldn't keep his jaw shut. The trees were made of metals. Some of them were glowing radioactively. Some were burning just by exposure to some oxygen. Some were made of gold, some of platinum, some of silver. 

""I don't believe this."" 

""Well, it's right in front of your eyes. We brought some trees from Earth to plant here for the oxygen. But things changed. The guys from NASA tell me that because of the lack of common elements found on Earth, the trees had to make use of what they could get. So here we have trees of every precious metal - gold, silver, platinum - you name it. We cut them off and send them to Earth. Pretty soon they're going to become common as iron but till then make hay while the sun shines, right? We don't use them for making the posts as they are actually quite soft and the people try to steal them. Here we also have trees of Seaborgium (chemical symbol Sg, atomic number 106), Flerovium (chemical symbol Fl, atomic number 114) and Oganesson (chemical symbol Og, atomic number 118). All very rare and very important, the guys at NASA are paying us very big money to supply them. They say it's the biggest find in Chemistry since Lavoisier discovered Hydrogen.""

The Chief was talking while they walked. He stopped near a plantation of trees and pointed to them. The new guy looked at a bunch of trees, silvery-gray in colour, shining smoothly in the moonlight.

""Now those are the trees you are interested in"", the Chief said. ""Made of pure Rhenium (chemical symbol Re, atomic number 75). The fourth or fifth rarest element on Earth. Very strong, third highest melting point, highest boiling point, denser than lead, not affected by strong alkalies, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid or even aqua regia. It's the perfect metal for this job. Strong, sturdy and not radioactive. That's what we have been using for the posts all this time.""
 
""You don't mean to say..."" the new guy began to say.

""Yes,"" the Chief cut him off, ""this place is full of Re posts.""",A guy was recruited for the first settlement on another planet....,458

He goes to the doctor and confesses for the first time the feelings which haunt his daily life: how he perceives the world is harsh and cruel, how he feels lonely and useless, how he relies on the perception of himself by others to grant him happiness, how he doesn't know that he'll ever be satisfied with anything he does, how he doesn't know that he'll ever find contentment in anything.

The doctor sits for a moment, nodding silently. And then he speaks:

""Well, there are a number of medications which I can offer you..."" and he trails off, looking thoughtfully over the man's shoulder, taking a moment to scratch his chin. ""But you know...sometimes these things...we can cure them with simple remedies. A laugh, a good time. You know, there's a circus act in town! Maybe you should go see it! There's a great clown there, Pagliacci, who has brought laughter to the lives of many, many people.""

They laughed some more. One of the men spoke up, “What kind of name is Gallo, anyways?”

“Italian” said Paul Revere. A man from Italy traded it for some silver work I did for him.” He set the chicken down. “But as I said, this bird here is *highly trained!”

They called their marshall or whoever was in charge, who then called the boys' fathers.

Every culprit's father was in the military, so they were naturally scared for their lives.

While standing side by side, waiting for their impending doom, my teacher's friend, Kevin, shakes his head sadly and says, ""Man, I really should've listened to my mom.""

“And that’s why you’re here,” replied St. Peter. “Still, not very impressive. We’ll give you an older Toyota Corolla.” 

The next guy says, “She and I were married for 27 years. Only had one affair- when I went overseas for military. We worked it out though and were very happy together.”

“Eh, not bad, I guess. Not stellar either though. Here are keys to a BMW.”

The third guy proudly beamed, “I’d been married to my wife for 62 years by the time I passed away. Those entire 62 years, I treated her like a queen, never once looking at another woman. I didn’t need to!” 

St. Peter smiled. “Now that’s what I’d like to hear, folks. Sir, here are keys to a brand new Rolls-Royce Phantom. Enjoy.”

A few months pass, and the guys with the Corolla and BMW happen to be at a cafe, when they notice the guy with the Rolls outside, sobbing on the curb.

post,b9v1rp,2qh72,jokes,false,1554490131,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/b9v1rp/lincolns_hunger_pains/,self.jokes,," 

There was a rumor that Abraham Lincoln kept important letters inside his top hat, but his closest friends knew the real reason Lincoln wore a tall top hat. Lincoln had a high metabolism, and was always hungry. He would hide food in his hat so he could have a quick snack whenever he needed to eat. He would wait for an opportunity when nobody was around to turn around and sort of crouch down, pull food out, and take a quick bite. 

One day, Lincoln had traveled to Vermont to see his old friend, Montgomery. They knew each other since they were teenagers. A rivalry between the two had started over Bridget, a young lady who was the pastors daughter.  

The pastor was from Ireland. He had come to America as a young man to mine gold in Georgia. They called him ol' goldie charms because he had struck it rich and donated much of his fortune to the needy.  

Goldie charms was feeling energetic one Sunday morning because he found out his wife was pregnant. He lost track of time and the sermon kept going and going.  

At some point Abraham started to get impatient. It had been a few hours since he had his last hat snack, so he started to step outside to get a quick crouched down bite to eat. His mouth filled with saliva as he thought about getting a moment alone where he could reach into his hat and devour the pieces of chicken he had packed that morning. The anticipation was almost too much. As he was getting up and scooching past people seated next to him, he accidentally touched Bridget on the shoulder.

She thought he was signaling her to meet him outside, so she waited a few moments and went out to meet him. She took a look around after stepping out, walked along the front of the church, and looked around the corner. As she leaned around the corner of the church, she met face to face with Lincoln.

Lincoln and Monty were talking about the old days. Many years had passed since their rivalry and they were struggling to remember what happened that day. They discussed how they were both vying for the affections of Bridget, the pastors daughter, and how the pastor was from Ireland and had come to America as a teenager to mine gold in Georgia, and they called him ol' goldie charms because he had struck it rich and donated much of his fortune to the needy.  

Then Montgomery said, “I sure hate to tell such a long story on a hot and humid day here in Vermont, but seeing as it’s been so long since we’ve seen each other... The sermon seemed like it kept going and going. At some point, you stepped outside and a few moments later Bridget followed you out. She returned shortly after leaving the church, but you never returned. In fact, that morning was the last I seen of you till today. Now, I had heard about you becoming president and about your courageous efforts to free the slaves, but I thought it was a bit odd, a bit out of character from what I heard of you from Bridget.”

Lincoln gulped. His mind wandered for a second and he thought about his hat as he had not eaten in a while. Then he said, “Why is that? What did she say?”

Monty replied, “Well, I seem to remember that Bridget was solemn and a little skiddish when she return from outside the church. Later that day, she said you were a chicken.”

Lincoln said, ""Oh, no, she couldn’t have said that. See, I went outside for a moment to eat because the sermon seemed like it kept going and going. I don’t remember if I ever told you, but I have a high metabolism. What I found to help is carrying food on me at all times, and I keep food in my hat. When I get hungry, I wait for an opportunity when nobody is around. I turn around and sort of crouch down, pull the food out, and take a quick bite. So, I get up to leave and everyone’s still seated. While scooching past the people that were sitting next to me on my way outside to get something to eat, I had accidentally tapped Bridget on the shoulder. I didn’t realize it at the time, but she must have thought that I was signaling her to meet me outside. So, I was outside the church, tearing into a piece of chicken. I was going at it like a wild starved coyote who just stumbled upon a chicken farm when Bridget leaned around the corner of the church. Her eyes opened wide with fear, and she just stared at the site for a moment and then whispered… chicken. I left church early that day, and ended up running into some men who were traveling to Vermont. It wasn’t hard to talk me into going with them. Their wagon was plum full of food.""

She tried to hide it, but her mother already noticed something strange going on.

“My dear, tell me, did you have your period this month?”

She trembled, and finally told her mother that she slept with a rich boy from her class, and that she thinks she got pregnant.

Her mother went pale, she spoke out very quietly, almost as if she was about to have a breakdown:

“That’s it. Wait until your father gets home. 
I didn’t raise a fucking slut!”-she started to cry

Using the given time, the girl dialed a number and hanged up after a brief conversation.

Her father had arrived and, just as they were about to start the long anticipated conversation, a black Mercedes G-Wagon parked across the street.

Her mother was showing her teeth. Ready to jump in, she was abrupted by a lad saying:

“If a boy is born, he will get a factory along with 100.000$ on his account. In case of twins, both get a small shop and 50.000$. In case of a girl, she will be given a small shop, apartment in the Rose Avenue, and 100.000$. In case of twins, both will get a small shop, apartment, and 50.000$ on their accounts. However, it is quite possible that in case of miscarriage, the...”

Her father jumps in, only to say:

“Hey lad, why don’t you hit ‘er again just in case?”",A fine Russian lad,3

However, since the only time they ever got together
was at the park, Fred didn't know where Russ lived,  
so he was unable to find out what had happened to him.

A month had passed, and Fred figured he had seen the last of Russ, but one day, Fred approached the park and there sat Russ! Fred was very excited and happy to see him and told him so.

Then he said, 'For crying out loud Russ, what in the world happened to you?'

Russ replied, 'I have been in jail.'

'Jail!' cried Fred. What in the world for?'

'Well,' Russ said, 'you know Sue, that cute little blonde waitress at the coffee shop where I sometimes go?

'Yeah,' said Fred, 'I remember her.  What about her?

You can't function without breakfast, but the only food you have that you can eat relatively quickly is a lone apple.

You bite into the delicious fruit, only to discover, to your utter shock and horror, the separated half of a worm inside the apple you just bit. A surge of nausea wreaks havoc on your stomach as you begin to feel the grotesque, slimy form of a worm-half on your tongue. Resisting the urge to throw up, you jettison the compromised meal into the nearest waste bin, wishing desperately that you had the time to drive to the nearest coffee shop and wash out the horrid taste of *Rhagoletis* *pomonella* cadaver with a steaming cup of your favorite morning beverage; and you nearly cry, knowing it was never meant to be, not on this day. Still, you figure the rush of adrenaline from your traumatic experience will suffice to get you through the work day.

You walk out of your dark, electricity-deprived abode, and step into your inexpensive, somewhat dirt-encrusted sports car, and you nearly switch on the ignition before you suddenly realize that you should probably let your boss know that you will be a bit late. He is usually quite cordial and understanding, so surely he will let this incident slide. You're never late for work, after all.

You pull out your phone to discover it is dead.

An aggravated groan escapes your lungs as you plug the phone into your car's phone charger. It would take several minutes for your phone to accept input after it has started charging, and at this moment you are quite impatient. I'll just explain it to him directly, you think. You don't have time to wait on technology.

The car starts with an uncomfortable, momentary stutter, before roaring with the usual low, guttural drone of a healthy vehicle. You should probably get the lagging engine issue checked out, but you always forget about it by the time you get home every day. As you drive down the highway to your workplace, struggling to keep your eyes open in your caffeine-deprived state as your stress-induced excitement wanes, the radio begins to play the worst generic, manufactured, pretty-boy pop song in the world, the one your annoying sister never stopped listening to on max volume in the room next to you growing up. You quickly press the button to change the channel, only to discover that the buttons have stopped functioning. The radio is now stuck on this horrid pop channel, and now you have two technical issues surrounding your car to forget about at the end of the day.

As soon as you reach your workplace, you step out of the car and are immediately greeted by a monsoon of pouring rain. And you forgot the umbrella. You march toward your destination, water creeping into your shoes and then your socks - a truly torturous experience, with the ever present risk of trench foot all the while.

You step into the building, before you are accosted by your boss. He rants and raves about how you are two and a half hours late, on the busiest day of the year, before stopping himself and taking a deep breath. He apologizes for his behavior, and reasons that perhaps, due to the downpour, there won't be as many customers. This would mean lower profits, sure, but at least they would not be understaffed, in a sense, in the event that you did not show up. But since you have, the boss is more than willing to send you to your workstation. You apologize for your tardiness and explain that you have not had the chance to eat breakfast or drink your morning ritual coffee; and your boss, understanding as he is, allows you a few moments in the staff kitchen to sate your needs.

Relief and splendor washes over your person as the coffee rushes down your throat, and soon enough you feel wide awake. In an effort to curb your starvation, you look around the kitchen for a fitting morning delicacy. Unfortunately, the room is stocked with only a single edible parcel: an apple.

With a nervous gulp, you guide your quaking, sweating hands towards the healthy breakfast option, worried to death that you will stumble upon another arthropod in your culinary escapade. You hear your boss yell at you to hurry up, and this is the last push you need to take the plunge and bite into the fruit's ripe red flesh.

At first, the delectable food item delivers a wondrous sweet taste, and your thoughts flow towards the possibility that your day may finally start to shape up for you; you could not be more ready to take on the day's challenges. You almost hear a blood-pumping tune of motivation play out in your head. But then, as quickly as these thoughts of hope and optimism entered your mind, so quickly do you realize that such luck is simply out of your grasp. You shudder and tremble as the inside of your cheeks come into contact with the distressing shape of thick, grungy noodles.

You peek into the apple in your hand. It is all you can manage to resist the temptation to cry out in fear and anguish, as your eyes set into easily the most horrific sight of your life, embedded into the yellowed insides of the apple.

Two worm halves.

Your vision tunnels and your senses dampen as you feel yourself falling through the world, into sheer black.

You awaken in the hospital, surrounded by your friends, family, and boss, a searing pain pulsing on the back of your head. You can hardly speak. The doctor soon arrives, bearing unfortunate news. Apparently you fainted in the work kitchen, slamming your head incredibly hard against the table and then the floor. As a result, your skull was mildly cracked and your speech was lost, and you fell into a month-long coma. You are very fortunate to be left with only muteness and an expensive hospital bill, the doctor says. Despite his kind words, you are very nearly on the verge of tears.

Following a procession of I-love-you's and get-better-soon's from your friends, you are informed that you will have to stay in the hospital for another few weeks for medical tests. In addition, they will attempt to figure whether or not they can perform brain surgery to restore your speech to some degree. The next few weeks proceed relatively smoothly, but sadly they conclude that your ability to speak has been lost for good; though by now, you have come to terms with that fate.

You are soon sent out of the hospital and are taken to your home by your mother, whose words of comfort and love serve to assuage your depression in these trying times. With a smile and a hint of tears, she kisses you goodbye as she drops you off at your house, before driving off. You look towards your house, its front porch light lit up, taking comfort in the knowledge that, despite the hell you've been through, and despite all that you have lost, at least now your coffee maker works.

You take a few steps forward before you are suddenly raped by a giant scorpion.",What's worse than finding a worm in your apple?,1

This was his dream since he was young. Henry Hill was his role model. Arty had watched every mafia movie known to man, he was just waiting for the day to meet them and get in. 

One day Arty sees 4 mafia members sitting around a table. Arty was a scrawny dude, but he had balls. He went up to the table and said ""my name is Arty and I want to be in the mafia, I'll do whatever it takes""

They all looked at each other, then looked at Arty and started laughing. The leader then said, ""alright kid, we'll give you a shot. But you have to prove yourself as a professional. We will pay you 3 dollars to kill 3 people, that dollar will be your formal invite into our group""

Arty was happy they gave him a shot, but he has never killed anyone before. He responds ""alright can I think about it?""

To which they say ""you will have till tomorrow morning to complete the task, if we see it in the headlines, then we will know you completed it, if not, it'll be as if we never met""

Arty say ok.

On his way home Arty stops at the grocery store to pick up some things. It's kinda late, so the store is mostly empty. As Arty is walking around , he sees a frail woman. He thinks to himself maybe this is my shot. So he takes it. He wraps his hands around her throat, she doesn't seem to be fighting back so he just squeezes until she dies. 

Arty doesn't think anyone saw so he just goes about his business shopping, however he notices another woman following him. He thinks she must have seen it, so he attacks. He grabs a cast iron skillet from the kitchen aisle and wacks her in the head. She hits the ground and starts bleeding, but she is still moving. Arty has to finish the job, so he sits on her chest and chokes her until she is no longer moving. 

At this point Arty has to get out of there. He heads to the exit but there is an employee there waiting for him. He knows he has to kill him and get out ASAP. So they start fighting, and it's dead even. Eventually Arty gets the upper hand and puts the employee in a headlock and just holds i**t until the guy is no longer breathing. He did it, he killed three people, now he just has to get home. 

As he exits the store, the police are already outside waiting for him, and Arty knows he's fucked up. He gets taken to jail, and the next day the headline reads...

""ARTY CHOKES 3, FOR 3 DOLLARS, AT LOCAL GROCERY STORE""",Savings at the local store,2

There was a lad named John who was dealt a bad hand since he was born. He was an orphan who was brought up in a for profit orphanage, leading him to suffer mental trauma amongst other issues. After turning 16, he was kicked out of the orphanage with no support whatsoever. Not knowing what to do, he resorted to a life of crime to keep him off the streets, and for a while, he was quite successful. This was because he was stealthy. Very much so. He would walk around barefooted in order to not make a sound, putting on his shoes after committing his crimes. Some of the most spectacular bank robberies and museum heists were carried out by himself on his own. However, after an illustrious criminal career, he was finally uncovered by law enforcement and caught, eventually getting sentenced to 20 years in jail. He was restricted to a maximum security prison, but was given access to medical help as his years spent barefoot on broken glass and the like meant that he had callouses and corns all over his feet and toes. The doctor provided him with a device that drew out moisture for John to use on his injuries. John immediately loved the device, and a daily activity for him was to use it on the gigantic corns on his toes, seeing that leisurely activities were severely restricted on the account that it was a maximum security prison. However, John quickly noticed that the prison's power supply cut off in the middle of the night during light's out, after which he could not use his electrically powered dryer. The next morning, he complained to the jail warden. The jail warden, upon hearing this, decided to hook the dryer up to a gigantic battery pack that would be more than enough to last John through the week. John was elated. Soon, night fell, and the power was out. John wanted to use his dryer, but quickly realised that he couldn't see clearly due to the darkness of the cell. He quickly found the electrical wiring system and, having tinkered with appliances during his stint as a criminal, hooked up his device to his mains. The lights in his cell lit up, catching the attention of the prison warden. The prison warden asked John how he did it, to which John promptly replied:
""My toe corn dryer is the powerhouse of the cell""

He fixes the garbage disposal in the kitchen and replaces the whole sink in the bathroom. He fixes the deck that was falling apart. He cleans the gutters, trims the old oak tree in back, and he gets the spare bedroom painted. All week long he works his ass off and by the time Friday rolls around, the entire list is complete.

""...I never thought you would finish,"" responds his wife, ""I hate camping, I dont want to go."".

""I'll give you a choice then,"" says Fred, ""I'm taking the dog for a long walk. When I get back, one of three things is going to happen. You'll have your bag ready and well go camping, you'll let me stick it in your ass, or you'll give me a good blowjob, to completion,""

His wife agrees.

So Fred grabs the leash and heads out with the dog. 30 minutes later he arrives back at the house.

""Well, are you packed?""

""I wont go camping.""

""You'll let me stick it in you're butt then?""

""No, not going for anal either.""

""So you'll blow me? It's been a while since you gave me a good blowjob,"" says Fred.

""I'll blow you. To completion,"" says his wife.

So she gets on her knees and undoes his pants and she goes to town. It was a long list, after all. But just a few seconds in she's coughing and sputtering and spitting. ""Jesus fucking Christ!"" She says, ""I cant do this! What's going on, your dick tastes like shit!""

""Yeah,"" sighs Fred, ""the dog didnt want to go camping either."".","Fred loves camping, but his wife absolutely hates it (NSFW)",12

“Rabbi,” he said, “I noticed that you buy a lot of candles.”

“Yes,” answered the Rabbi.

“Well, Rabbi, what do you do with the candle drippings?” he asked.

“A good question,” noted the Rabbi. “We actually save them up, and when we have enough we send them back to the candle maker. And every now and then, they send us a free box of candles.”

“Oh,” replied the auditor, somewhat disappointed that his unusual question actually had a practical answer.

So he thought he’d go on, in the traditional obnoxious way...

“Rabbi, what about all these cookie purchases? What do you do with the crumbs from the cookies?”

“Ah, yes,” replied the Rabbi calmly, “we actually collect up all the crumbs from the cookies and when we have enough we send them in a box back to the manufacturer. Every now and then, they send a box of cookies.”

“Oh,” replied the auditor, thinking hard how to fluster the Rabbi.

“Well, Rabbi,” he went on, “what do you do with all the foreskins from the circumcisions?”

“Yes, here too, we do not waste,” answered the Rabbi. “What we do is save up all the foreskins and when we have enough we actually send them to the IRS.”

“The IRS?” asked the auditor in disbelief.

“Ah, yes,” replied the Rabbi, “the IRS. And about once a year they send us a little dick like you.”

The night was getting darker and the rain came harder, and no cars went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him. Suddenly Harry saw a car come toward him and stop.

Without thinking about it, Harry got in the car and closed the door. Just as he realized there was nobody behind the wheel, the car started to move. As his panic set in, he looked at the road and saw a curve coming his way. Scared beyond belief, he started to pray, begging for his life. Just when the car got to the curve, and Harry thought it was all over, a hand appeared through the window and moved the wheel.

Harry was paralyzed in terror as he watched the hand appear every time the car got to a curve.

Gathering strength, Harry jumped out of the car and ran to the nearest town. Wet and in shock, he went to a bar and asked for two shots of rye. He started telling everyone about the horrible experience he went through. The crowd sat in an eerie silence when they realized that Harry was crying and wasn't drunk.

About half an hour later, two guys walked into the same bar. One said to the other, ""Look Pete, there's the jerk that got in the car when we were pushing it.""

Finally, he calls in the young couple and he asks them “Were you able to complete the month?”

“No,  we couldn’t do it...” they said.

“Tell me why” the priest replies.

“Well my girlfriend was holding a can of corn and she dropped it,” the boyfriend said “and when she bent over to pick it up, I couldn’t help myself.”

Then the priest said “Well, for not completing the challenge I cannot allow for you to be married in my church. In fact, I never want to see you back here again.”

“Funny,” the boyfriend replies, “we aren’t welcome in the supermarket either.”",Three couples are trying to get married at a local church.,62

The teeny-tiny spider ventured out and eventually found a nice and clean forest, mostly untouched by civilization and followed a slightly beaten down path, curious as to where it lead. 
At the end of it, he was met with the astonishing view of a clearing - the sun shining benevolently with its mild warmth creating tiny spots of light on the surface of a crystal clear pond which was otherwise entirely as blue as the skies with the exception of the reflection of a single tree which had its branches hanging just above the water. The teeny-tiny spider was was certain: this was where he'd spin his web. 

The spider crawled over to the other side of the pond and started building his overwater hammock right away. Pleased with the result, he lit up a fat little spidey spliff and put on some instrumental jazz and let out a relaxed sigh. 

However, the teeny-tiny spider's arrival didn't go unnoticed by pond's inhabitants. It caught the interested of a very curious fish, in particular. 

As the teeny-tiny spider was just dangling down a hand's breadth over the surface of the pond, humming a melody he came up with on the spot, the fish saw an opportunity: ""That teeny-tiny spider is completely unaware of its surroundings. When it dangles a little lower, I'll just go to the surface and eat him"" it thought and only seconds later, the fish swam up, jumped out of the water and swallowed the teeny-tiny spider whole. 

A bear pretending to be sunbathing next to the tree already caught wind of teeny-tiny spider before this all happened and thought: ""So, once that teeny-tiny spider dangles a little lower and the fish comes up to eat it I'll just slap the fish midair and eat it."" Unsurprisingly, the bear's claws hit the fish full-force and slapped it on shore. 

A hunter who'd been spectating the bear through his binoculars a lot before any of the previously mentioned animals decided to satisfy their hunger thought to himself: ""So, once that teeny-tiny spider dangles a little lower and the fish comes up to eat it and the bear decides to stop pretending to be asleep and slaps the fish out of the water, I'll have a clear shot on the bear."" His body tensed up right before the moment he could take the shot and hit the bear right between the eyes, causing the bear to drop into the pond. The hunter then ran over in a hurry, fearing he wouldn't be able to retrieve his trophy. 

A mouse who has picked up the scent of cheese had been patiently waiting for the hunter to leave his bag of rations unattended and had thought to itself before all of this happened: ""So, once that teeny-tiny spider dangles a little lower and the fish comes up to eat it, the bear decides to stop pretending to be asleep and slaps the fish out of the water and the hunter takes the killing shot, possibly causing the bear to drop face first into the water and the hunter to go after him - that's when I'll go in and get that cheese."" As the hunter ran off, the mouse came out of hiding, lept into the bag, came out with the biggest chunk of cheese it could manage to gnaw off and carry and tried to make its way back into hiding to revel in the delightful taste of underhandedly gotten food. 

However, a cat hiding on a tree branch just above the hunter's bag had been ~~dozing~~ attentively analyzing its surroundings before the spider even arrived, just waiting for the key to put its plan into motion: ""So, once that teeny-tiny spider dangles a little lower and the fish comes up to eat it, the bear decides to stop pretending to be asleep and slaps the fish out of the water and the hunter takes the killing shot, possibly causing the bear to drop face first into the water and the hunter to go after him and the mouse I smelled earlier comes out of hiding to get to the cheese, that's when I'll drop on that pitiful creature."" Still pondering about the choice between instantly killing the mouse or taking it him to stash it as a plaything behind some TV furniture, the cat started doing its killer butt wiggle and realized the last instant before the jump that housecats are not supposed to get down from trees alone, causing it to miscalculate the jump due to a spark of quasi-philisophical thinking and fell right into the pond.

He quits his job, packs up his belongings, and flees to a remote region of Siberia.

After days of hiking through the cold, he stumbles upon a small tribe entirely comprised of men.

“A visitor has found our humble community!” the tribe’s leader announces. “Come, join us brother!” The whole tribe rejoices.

Confused, but desperate, the man obliges, and the tribe leader brings him to a small room. At peace, the man falls right asleep.

But suddenly, in the middle of the night, the man is jolted awake by a piercing call in the distance.

“CARIBOUUUUUUUUUUUUU!”

He rushes to his window. All of the tribesman are outside _having sex with caribou!_

“What?! I must be dreaming,” says the man. He falls back asleep and tries to forget what he saw.

A day passes, and the next night at 12 sharp the man’s sleep is once again interrupted.

“CARIBOUUUUUUUUUUUUU!”

Again, he looks outside. Sure enough, a herd of Caribou comes running, and the tribesmen start having sex with them. He slams his blinds shut, and tries to forget once again. 

Overwhelmed with disgust, he decides to approach the leader the next day.

“You guys aren’t having sex with Caribou, right?”

“Ah yes, naive brother! We’re all men and have needs. Caribou make great sexual partners - one day you will find your own.”

“Fuck that!” he exclaims, storming off. But he knows it is his only shelter for miles - he decides to stay for longer despite it.

Weeks, and then months go by.

“CARIBOUUUUUUUUUUUUU!”

The call rattles his windows every night. Eventually, his mind starts to wander.

“I am really fucking horny,” he mumbles to himself one evening. “Maybe I’ll just try it once.”

Midnight comes around, and the man nervously goes into the village with the other tribespeople. The clock strikes 12.

“CARIBOUUUUUUUUUUUUU!”

He calls with everyone else. As promised, a whole herd of caribou comes trotting towards them.

The man awkwardly picks one out, pulls down his pants, and starts having sex with it.

Immediately all the tribesmen stop what they’re doing, and stare at the man in terror.

“WHAT are you doing brother?!” the leader pleads.

“What do you mean?? Everyone does this! You all have sex with caribou, too!”

“Yeah, of course we do,” said the tribe leader, “but that’s the ugliest fucking caribou I’ve ever seen!”",A tired man decides he needs to get away from it all,24

Ken: - I reckon he's an accountant.

Keith: - No way - he's a stockbroker..

Ken: - He ain't no stockbroker! A stockbroker wouldn't come in here!

The argument repeats itself for some time until the volume of beer gets the better of Ken and he makes for the toilet.
On entering the toilet he sees that the suit is standing at a urinal. Curiosity and the several beers get the better of the builder.

Ken: - 'Scuse me.. No offence meant, but me and me mate were wondering what you do for a living?

Suit: - No offence taken! I'm a Logical Scientist by profession.

Ken: - Oh! What's that then?

Suit: - I'll try to explain by example... Do you have a goldfish at home?

Suit: - Well, it's logical to follow that you keep it in a bowl or in a pond. Which is it?
Ken: - It's in a pond!

Suit: - Well then it's reasonable to suppose that you have a large garden.

Ken - As it happens, yes I have got a big garden!

Suit: - Well then it's logical to assume that in this town if you have a
large garden then you have a large house?

Ken: - As it happens I've got a five-bedroom house...built it myself!

Suit: - Well given that you've built a five-bedroom house it is logical to
assume that you haven't built it just for yourself and that you are quite probably married?

Ken: - Yes I am married, I live with my wife and five children.

Suit: - Well then it is logical to assume that you are sexually active with
your wife on a regular basis?

Ken:- Yep! Five or six nights a week!

Suit: - Well then it is logical to suggest that you do not masturbate very often?

Ken: - Me? Never.

Suit: - Well there you are! That's logical science at work!

Ken: - How's that then?

Suit: - Well from finding out that you had a goldfish, I've told you about your sex life!

Ken: - I see! That's pretty impressive...thanks mate!
Both leave the toilet and Ken returns to his mate.

A young woman is late for work. She normally walks down a sidewalk that takes a few turns (she lives in a bigger city) to get to work, but she decides to run through some allies and shave off some time. She takes a turn down a road that has a pet shop on it. As she passes the pet shop, she hears ""Hey lady! Go fuck yourself!"" in a loud, strange voice. Furious, she back-jogs to see where it came from. In the shop window was an old parrot, staring back at her. The parrot cackled and said, ""You heard me! Go fuck yourself!"" The woman was so frustrated with being late for work, that the parrot really got under her skin; probably more than it should have. She just didn't have time to deal with it at the moment and kept jogging to work.

The next day, she was late again and decided to take the same route. ""God help me..."" she thought, ""If that parrot says anything to me, I'm giving the shop owner a piece of my mind."" As she passes the shop, she hears, ""Hey lady!"" She stops. The parrot then follows up with, ""Goooooo FUCK yourself!"" She's had it. She stomps into the shop red-faced and says to the owner, ""That parrot has told me to go fuck myself two days in a row, and I swear to God if it does that again, I'm gonna rip it's wings off and shove them into his beak!"" The shop owner apologized for the parrot's behavior and said it's always been a little antagonizing. ""Just don't let it happen again"" the woman shouted at she walked out. The owner looks at the parrot and says, ""Be careful, Mr. Crackers. I think she means it.""

The next day, the woman isn't as late as she's been, but she needs to take the same shortcut by the pet shop to be on time. Just as she passes the window, the parrot squawks, ""HEY LADY!"" She stops and looks at the parrot, waiting to see if she needs to charge into the store and make it eat it's wings. The parrot pauses for a moment and says, 

""You know...""",A young woman was late for work.,2

Each of the leaders had a different idea on how what they should do with the surviving humans.

""These humans are dangerous,"" said the first. ""We all know the losses we took to subjugate them. We need to kill the rest before they kill more of us!""

""Our losses are precisely why we can't kill them all,"" said the second. ""The cost of this invasion was more than any of us could have predicted! We need to enslave them! Have them harvest their own planet for us so we can recoup our losses.""

Yet a third had another idea. ""We could transport them back home and sell them to the zoos! People would pay dearly to see these them"".

The first two vetoed the third. Shipping that number of people half way across the galaxy was too much, they must stay where they were, dead or alive.

This went on for several months with neither of the three able to convince the two. A compromise was finally reached - the humans would be enslaved, but public executions would take place first, to keep them in line. Some few would be taken home and sold to the zoos.

The alien leaders flew down to earth and arrived at the first of the compounds where the humans were being kept. They announced their plan to enslave the humans. As was expected, there was anger from the crowd. Several started shouting and making obscene gestures. Those were pointed out to the alien guards and brought to the front were they were executed in the most horrific way.

They flew to another camp and the process was repeated. Several humans raised their hands and haves them in obscene ways and those were executed, the rest enslaved.

They visited several camps and finally reached the last one, their task almost complete. They announced the plan one last time and again the humans raised their hands in anger. The alien leaders pointed them out one at a time.

""What's that one doing,"" said the first alien. ""He isn't shaking his fist list the others.""

""It almost looks like he's waving,"" said the second Alien.

""Let me see,"" said the third Alien. ""Wow! I don't believe it.""

""What?"" Asked the second Alien.

""It's Dave!""",Alien overlords are discussing the fate of Earth citizens.,70
