The husband urged Charlie to stay over. There was no spare bed in the house; there wasn't even a sofa. So Charlie would have to sleep with the husband and wife. No sooner had the husband fallen asleep when the wife taped Charlie on the shoulder and motioned for him to come over to her. ""I couldn't do that,"" he whispered. ""Your husband is my best friend!"" ""Listen, sugar,"" she whispered back, ""there ain't nothing in the whole wide world could wake him up now."" ""I can't believe that,"" Charlie said. ""Certainly if I get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up won't he? ""Sugar, he certainly won't. If you don't believe me, pluck a hair out of his asshole and see if that wakes him."" Charlie did just that. He was amazed when the husband remained asleep. So he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her. 

When he finished, he climbed back to his own side. It wasn't long before she tapped him on the shoulder and beckoned him over again. Again he pulled a hair to determine if his old friend was asleep. This went on eight times during the night. Each time Charlie screwed the woman, he first pulled out one of the husband's asshole hairs. 

The ninth time he pulled a hair, the husband awoke and muttered: ""Listen, Charlie, old pal, I don't mind you fucking my wife, but for Pete's sake, stop using my ass for a scoreboard!"" ",Charlie was visiting an old friend and his wife for dinner...,33

 Being very superstitious people, they thought that just going to a hospital would somehow cause Myi to give birth - as a result, neither of them would go to a doctor for serious injuries, or even get a checkup. As a result, they were very physically weak - Myi was missing several teeth as a result of only eating rice and fish for decades on end, and Frank suffered from fragile and brittle bones.

They were weak and poor. 

But they were happy. And, to them, that's all that mattered.

One day, Frank decided to dedicate the rest of his life to his idol, Bruce Lee. With heartfelt goodbyes to Myi, he left America and went to Japan to work as Bruce Lee's entourage - they say he was the best student to work with the best teacher. When Bruce Lee died in 2023 of lung failure, the world christened his last and greatest pupil with the name, ""Lee"".

Myi, while Frank was busy training in Japan, decided to move to Luxembourg to achieve her dream of becoming the world's greatest chef. Myi loved to cook (even if her only customer was only Frank) - so much so, that she decided to pursue a type of cooking known as ""Daer Cooking"" - a reference to the ancient Norwegian dish of the same name, Daer Cooking is the sport of mixing gymnastics and death-defying stunts with cooking, like making ratatouille from atop a tapwire 30 meters off the ground, or making byranii using only what is within 2 meters of you, etc. Despite being tough to complete in, Myi enjoyed Daer cooking with only the passion a crazy old woman could achieve. Between the years 2023 - 2031, Myi nearly died seven times, due to (in chronological order): asphyxiation, frostbite, brain trauma, sulfide-epidermal poisoning, shattered vertebrae, arsenic inhalation, and lastly, heat stroke. Despite the severity of the injuries, she somehow always became well and alive within the hour - because of this, and her skill at the sport, she became known as ""Myi Daer"".

In 2034, Frank and Myi finally decided to have a child (despite Myi being well into her 60s) - however, neither *actually* knew the process of having a child. They assumed one would walk into a hospital with his wife, and his wife would bring a pillow, and they would ask for a child of a certain name - this was not because of their intelligence; no, this was because of their superstitious beliefs. 

On the morning of May 21st, 2034, they decided to choose a name before going to the hospital, to leave the luck blind-eyed. Myi wanted ""Mirelia"", but Frank simply wanted ""Dan"". In a heated argument, Myi finally agreed on Dan.

With a pillow in hand, they walked proudly yet briskly to the hospital an hour away. They did not know it, but there were little children in cars and buses, passing them by, wondering why on Earth was Myi and Frank Lee were walking so air-chestedly, with a pillow in hand.

When they got to the hospital, they made immediately to the maternity ward- they noticed that there were several closed curtains there; obviously, children were a secretive business.

The young, cheery Italian receptionist noticed them gawking at the row of closed curtains, and, knowing who the famous Myi and Frank Lee were, waved them over excitedly.

Without a drop, Frank said, ""I am Frank Lee. I would like a baby named Dan, please.""

The receptionist looked at both of them, from one to another, with a perplexed expression.

She said, ""Frank Lee, Myi Daer, I don't give-a Dan.""",[Long] There once lived an Asian couple...,1

Every Sunday, the mannequin would come out every Sunday and haunt the people of the village and kill one of the village people. Desperate, and looking for a solution to these attacks, the townsfolk went to a con artist who was being held in the town jail. They brought the conman to the place where the last resident was killed. He observed the area, and built a state-of-the-art trap to catch and kill the mannequin. The next Sunday came, and the mannequin went into the village, but completely missed the trap and took its next victim. The conman noticed his flaw and realized that he would need to lure the mannequin in by using some sort of bait. He used sugar, enough to fill a spoon, and placed it in the trap. Next Sunday came and with it, the mannequin. After noticing the trap with its bait, it foolishly went for the sugar, and got trapped and killed. The town had been free at last from this horrible mannequin. 

So what's the morale of the story?

Three men who were lost in the forest were captured by cannibals. The cannibal king told the prisoners that they could live if they pass a trial. The first step of the trial was to go to the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So all three men went separate ways to gather fruits.
The first one came back and said to the king, ""I brought ten apples."" The king then explained the trial to him. ""You have to shove the fruits up your butt without any expression on your face or you'll be eaten.""
The first apple went in... but on the second one he winced out in pain, so he was killed.
The second one arrived and showed the king ten berries. When the king explained the trial to him he thought to himself that this should be easy.
1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8... and on the ninth berry he burst out in laughter and was killed.
The first guy and the second guy met in heaven. The first one asked, ""Why did you laugh, you almost got away with it?""
The second one replied, ""I couldn't help it, I saw the third guy coming with pineapples.""",Death by fruit.,320

On this planet there was a mountain, and atop the mountain was a tree which hosted the most delicious fruit known the the Twid race. But there was a problem: there was a cave near the top that was home to a giant, and every time the twids tried to climb to the top of the mountain, the giant would run out and kick them off the mountain.

The twids became tired of this, and so they contacted Earth to ask for help. Earth didn't find this to be that big of a problem as they were at war and dealing with many different things, so they sent over a rabi. The Twids were happy to have any help they could get, and so they gladly accepted.

The rabbi arrived and wanted to get straight to business, calling all of the Twids to the base of the mountain. A lot of them were too frightened, so only some showed up. The rabi led the Twids most of the way up the mountain, only to have the giant come out and kick all of the Twids off. But he left the rabbi alone. Frustrated, the rabbi went to the Twid village and told them that in order to get to the top, they would all have to show up and work together.

The next day more Twids showed up, but not all of them were there. The rabbi sighed, leading them up to have the monster once again kick off all of the Twids, but leave him standing. The rabbi went back to the Twid village and told them that if every single last Twid wasn't in attendence the following day, he would return to Earth without helping them.

The next day, every single Twid was there. The rabbi smiled and started leading the Twids up the mountain, this time quite confident that they would make it all the way up. But as usual, the giant ran out of his cave and managed to kick every single Twid off the mountain, once again leaving the rabbi standing. The rabbi went to the giant's cave and asked ""Giant, why do you only ever kick the twids, but always leave me standing?"" To which the giant replied ""Silly rabbi, kicks are for Twids!""",The Giant,7

Thus mosques should be allowed, in an effort to promote tolerance. 

That is why I also propose that two nightclubs be opened next door to the mosque, thereby promoting tolerance from within the mosque. We could call one of the clubs, which would be gay, ""The Turban Cowboy "", and the other a topless bar called ""You Mecca Me Hot."" 

Next door should be a butcher shop that specializes in pork, and adjacent to that an open-pit barbecue pork restaurant, called ""Iraq o' Ribs."" 

Across the street there could be a lingerie store called ""Victoria Keeps Nothing Secret "", with sexy mannequins in the window modeling the goods. 

Next door to the lingerie shop there would be room for an adult sex toy shop, ""Koranal Knowledge "", its name in flashing neon lights, and on the other side an off-licence called ""Morehammered."" 

All of this would encourage Muslims to demonstrate the tolerance they demand of us, so their mosque issue would not be a problem for others.

So the therapist, as usual, asks about his life trying to find something that would boost Johnny's confidence. 

-""I used to be a professional boxer. Back then I felt like the king of the world, no one could beat me. But now I'm too old to compete so I'm selling cars in a local dealership and I've been miserable ever since"" says Johnny with a tear in his eye

So the therapist thinks for a while and decides to try an inventive method to boost Johnny's self esteem:

-""Johnny, let's try this. Do you still have your old boxing gloves? Go dust them off and wear them during your day. Perhaps wearing them will bring back your old self and with it your confidence and self esteem"" 

Johnny said we would try this method and report back in the next session.

A week passes and Johnny is back but in a bad mood once again.

-""What's wrong? You look even worst than our last meeting. Don't tell the gloves didn't work""- asked the therapist

-""No, it did work for a while"" - said Johnny - "" First it was weird but it did made me feel special and powerful. At home I felt more passionate with my wife and more caring with my kids, even using boxing gloves. I felt like a better husband and father. On the street people were looking curious at me which made me feel great. I wasn't invisible for a moment. It was great. Even at work I was selling more cars than any other employee. But yesterday I got fired and everything turned bad again""

-""How?""

-""Well.. I found a even more confident man by the name of Mike Strudel. He was wearing a cowboy hat and wanted to buy a car for half the price. We started negotiating and I felt like I could get a good business deal since I was so confident with my boxing gloves. But suddenly Mike dared me to make a bet. We play a game of his choice. If he wins, he gets the car for free but if I win, he would buy it for 10 times the price tag of the car.""

-""What did you say Johnny??""

-""Doctor, I was so confident I could win anything that I accepted the challenge... but ended up losing the game, the car and my job""


-""wow... I'm sad for you Johnny... did he tricked you in any way? what game did you play with him?""


-""Rock paper scissors""

""Heyoo Koala, do you mind if I climb up and try some?"" Lizard asks.

""Not at all Lizard, my dude, come on up!"" Koala wheezed while exhaling a ripe puff.

Lizard climbed up the tree to sit with Koala while they enjoyed a jungle doob and discussed the happenings of the community. After a few minutes, Lizard was having a hard time continuing conversation.

""Bro, my mouth is dry and my tongue feels like sandpaper! For some reason I can barely talk!"" Lizard mumbles, with his lips stuck to his teeth.

""Holy shit bro, don't worry. It is called cotton mouth and it is just from the weed,"" Koala said with bloodshot eyes, ""Look at how fucked up you are, you look like one of those funny faced Spongebob memes.""

Lizard began to panic as existential questions and paranoia started to set in.

""Don't lose it bro!"" Koala stoneously giggled, as he pointed down the path. ""You need to take a quick refreshing walk to the stream and get some water, little buddy!""

Lizard agreed and carefully climbed down the tree and embarked upon the journey.  As he continued down the path he began to see the forest in a whole new light, he was in tune with things on a deeper level.  He could feel every twig and leaf crunch beneath his feet, he could see beautiful vivid patterns emerge in the leaves of the trees as the wind danced through the branches, and he could hear and comprehend all of the sounds of the life in the forest as if it were a song made just for him.    

He finally made his way to the stream and sank his mouth into the flowing water. It was the most fulfilling taste he had ever experienced, as if he could feel every cell in his body being hydrated with every swallow.  

Then all of a sudden...

Alligator emerged from the water directly in front of Lizard, which frightened Lizard immensely!  

""Alligator! My friend! Can you see what I am seeing right now? Can you feel what I am feeling?"" Lizard shouted with a huge smile on his face, and a grin so big you could feel it through his squinted eyes as well.

""Damn dude, you're Lit af! You holding?"" Alligator said with intrigue.

""No brother, but I did just get done reefing with Koala.  He is down the path, up in the big tree by the bluff,"" Lizard said. ""I'm sure he could get you some.""

Alligator aggressively thanked Lizard, and immediately began to mash down the trail to find Koala.  He found the tree and saw Koala  passed out, asleep, with the joint in his hand still smoldering.

""Hey, Koala!"" Alligator shouted.

Koala was startled awake, confused, and almost fell from the tree.  After a quick moment surveying where he was, he looked down to where the shouting came from.

She is young and attractive, and she knows to get all her advice from the Internet, so she figures she can learn enough to become smart, and surely someone will want to marry her. Her only requirement is that her future husband will be able to take care of her when she gets old.

So she walks into a bar and sees a man in scrubs. *Perfect,* she thinks. *Someone in the medical field. I want him.*

So the two get to chatting, and he tells her that he is a doctor whose wife has just left him, and he is depressed because he is also afraid of being alone. The blonde practically trips over herself to offer to run off to Vegas and get married that very weekend.

""Well, not so fast,"" says the doctor. ""I have one requirement: I have to marry someone smart. I'm not so sure about you.""

But the blonde swells up with pride. ""I am smart! I just spent the last six months cramming myself with information on Reddit!""

The doctor grins. ""Okay, let's see what you've got."" So he pulls out his phone and proceeds to quiz the blonde.

""So there was this Pokemon loving guy who wanted to get a tattoo--""

""And he gave himself a terrible Charizard tattoo and now everyone in the world has seen it. Pfft.""

""Okay,"" the doctor said. He scrolls on. ""So a man was in prison and his wife wanted to plow her--""

""And federal agents come and plow the field looking for the bodies. You're an amateur at this.""

""Fair enough."" He scrolls down again. ""What group did the CEO of Reddit get caught trolling?""

""The Donald. Can we get married now?""

The doctor smiled. ""You know, you may be blonde, but I can tell you're a girl that strives to overcome. I think our marriage will be really fun!""

The bar erupts in cheers, and the bartender pours the couple a drink on the house. The doctor goes to put away his phone, but something on the screen catches his attention, and his eyes go wide.

""Did you know Steve Buscemi was a firefighter on 9/11?!""

The blonde rolls her eyes. ""Yes. Everyone knows that. You know, I don't think this is going to work."" She gets up to leave.

""Wait, what did I say? We were having a lovely conversation!""

So the Priest sets up a giant buffet, filled with pizza, fries, a soda fountain, and even a chocolate waterfall.   

The next Sunday, the Priest is disappointed to find that only 20 more people showed up to church. The Priest again goes to the Deacon. 

""I still need to get more people to come to church"", says the Priest. ""What else do people like?"" 

The Deacon says, ""People like beautiful women. Maybe if you hire some models to greet people at the door, we will have a larger crowd"". 

Despite knowing that lust is a sin, the Priest still decides to go out and hire models to stand by the door to greet the churchgoers.  

The next Sunday, the Priest is still disappointed to find only 30 more people showed up to mass. Frustrated, he returns to the Deacon. 

""You and I need to find a way to get at least 100 more people to come to Sunday mass,"" says the Priest. ""What will get the greatest amount of people to show up?""

""Well,"" says the Deacon, ""People love money. Maybe if we offer free money, we will get the largest crowd of any church"" 

So the Priest and the Deacon place bathtubs full of money all around the church, and go out to the local city to advertise their church, even bringing a bathtub full of $100 bills with them. They painted ""Come to our mass"" on the side, so that everyone would be able to see. Soon, the bathtub full of money gained the attention of everyone nearby, and people were flocking to get free money. 

However, it also gained the attention of a local police officer.

We’re thinking of going to a sex therapist”, said Linda. “Oh, we could never do that! We’d be too embarrassed!”, responded Mary. “But after you go, will you please tell me how it went?”

Several weeks passed, and the two friends met for lunch again. “So how did the sex therapy work out, Linda?”, Mary asked. “Things couldn’t be better!” Linda exclaimed. “We began with a physical exam, and afterward the doctor said he was certain he could help us. He told us to stop at the grocery store on the way home and buy a bunch of grapes and a dozen donuts. He told us to sit on the floor nude, and toss the grapes and donuts at each other. Every grape that went into my vagina, John had to get it out with his tongue. Every donut that I ringed his penis with, I had to eat. Our sex life is wonderful, in fact it’s better than it’s ever been!”

With that endorsement Mary talked her husband into an appointment with the same sex therapist. After the physical exams were completed the doctor called Mary and Tom into his office. “I’m afraid there is nothing I can do for you,” he said. “But doctor,” Mary complained, “you did such good for Linda and John, surely you must have a suggestion for us! Please, please, can’t you give us some help? Any help at all?” “Well, OK,” the doctor answered. “On your way home, I want you to stop at the grocery store and buy a sack of apples and a box of Cheerios.”",Sex therapy,596

Then Mrs. Claus told Santa her Mother was coming to visit, which stressed Santa even more.

Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all the toys were scattered. Frustrated, Santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had finished the cider and the liquor. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the liquor bottle, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom. Just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated Santa stomped to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big Christmas tree. The angel said very cheerfully, 'Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn't this a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?

Having heard corporate garbage on the top 40 stations, his mind was so infested with ear worms that he could scarcely read sheet music anymore.  He finally decided to just give in, and turn out his own shit music.
The plan was simple: he would track down a band just talented enough to put out a few infectious hits, clone the members, train the clones in the ways of musical mind control (with which he was familiar from his days writing advertising jingles), and make a fortune selling schlock to the Gap and Starbucks for their holiday advertising campaigns.
As luck would have it, Phil Collins and his guitarist buddy Mike Rutherford were passing through town promoting a best-of album at the local radio station where Andy had a part-time gig liaising with advertisers.  It turned out to be quite easy for him to snag their coffee cups after a visit to the studio.  
Nine months and a craigslist ad later, their surrogate mother gave birth to odd looking twins, who Andy smothered with evil adoration and raised into fine, upstanding evil musicians.  The only hitch in his plan was that he hadn't been able to track down Tony Banks, the keyboardist, to fill out the ranks of his evil band.  But that didn't seem to matter.  His own keyboard chops weren't too bad.  Besides, he and his boys had a lot of evil chemistry, and soon they were churning out awful tunes worthy of any top 40 list.  The time for conquest of the evil charts was nigh.
Finally Andy and his clones rented some studio time and made a full demo, which Andy sent out to all of the worst of the evil music labels, EMI, Sony, Universal, Warner.
And then he waited.
And waited.
And really that's all he did.  Because nothing ever came of his plan.  Eventually he had to give it up and admit to himself that despite his best efforts, they just weren't evil Genesis.",An evil keyboardist decided to form an evil band. [Long],1

So he goes to the florists, and finds a massive queue. But of course, he waits in line and eventually manages to buy her flowers.

The night before prom arrives and he remembers he needs a tux, so he runs out to get one. Lo and behold, there's a big queue waiting for him. He waits hours and hours, but finally he gets his tux. 

The night of prom goes well, and the couple are slowly falling in love. The dance ends and she asks him to get her some punch. So the guy goes over to the punch bar... and gets some punch.

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them unchaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.

Because i didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, i explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.

""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her arse with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""

The silence in the taxi was deafening.....

Edit: As many of you guys have realized, I did not come up with this. It was shown to me by a friend, and I thought it was hilarious, so I posted it. I even posted it in a self post so I wouldn't get any karma for it. It would've been pretty simple to put it on an image and post it that way.

Nonetheless he goes out. He drinks a lot and throws up all over himself. He turns to his friend and asks what he can do. His friend is helpful.

“Go home,” he says. “Tell your wife someone threw up on you. And put a twenty pound note inside your jacket pocket. Show her the money and tell her the other man gave it to you for the dry cleaning bill.”

So this he does. His wife is at first angry. But he explains. He tells her about the drunk man who threw up on him. He shows her the twenty pounds.

She looks. “But why have you got two £20 notes?” she asks.

The couple find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. While waiting, they begin to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? When St. Peter showed up, they asked him.
St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.
The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.
'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'
'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'
St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.

At the first light, an ancient Moped pulls up next to him. The elderly cyclist stares at the sleek, shiny surface of the automobile and asks, ""What kinda wheels ya got there, sonny?""

The young man replies, ""A Ferrari. They go for about a million and a half.""

The old guy is shocked: ""That's a lot of moolah. Why do they cost so much?""

The cool young dude says proudly, ""Because these babies can do 320 miles an hour!""

The gent on the Moped asks, ""Can I take a look inside?""

""Sure,"" responds the owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window, and peers around.

Leaning back on his Moped, the old guy says, ""That's a pretty nice car!""

Just then, the red light turns green, so the young producer decides to floor it. Within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 320. Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear-view mirror, which seems to be getting closer. He slows down to see what it might be, and whoooooosh! Something whips by him, at an incredible velocity.

The young guy is nonplussed: ""What on earth could be faster than my car?!"" Then, ahead of him, he sees the same dot, coming back. Whoooooosh! It goes by again, heading in the opposite direction. It almost looks like the old man on the Moped.

""Couldn't be,"" mumbles the producer to himself. ""How could a Moped outrun my Ferrari?!"" Again, the blasted dot appears in his mirror. Whoooooosh! Ka-boooom! It plows into the back of his car, demolishing the rear end. The young guy jumps out, and it IS the old fellow!

Of course, the Moped and its driver are hurtin' bad, so the Hollywood producer kneels down by him and says, ""You're seriously injured - is there anything I can do for you?""

The barkeep announces ""Last Call!""  Sean protests and the barkeep tells him, ""Sean, it's time ya drink up a get yeself home.""

 Sean hoist his drink and drains it and commences to get up from the bar stool.  
Thud! He lands arms and legs akimbo on the floor.  He struggles to rise but unable to do so he resigns himself to crawling out and literally drags his drunk ass out the door.  

He reaches the street corner and attempts to pull himself up on the pole.

Thud!  Again he lands arms and legs akimbo on the sidewalk.  He struggles to rise but unable to do so he resigns himself to crawling across the street. This continues for several blocks Seans attempting to rise and falling to the street with a loud Thud.  Fortunately he lives reasonably close to the pub and 45 minutes later he's dragging his ass up the walk to his front door. 

Exhausted now and still drunk he finally reaches the door to his home. He struggles to pull himself up to get the key in the lock.

Thud! He lands arms and legs akimbo on the ground.  He struggles to rise but unable to do so he somehow manages to get his door unlocked.  Fearing the worst if his wife awakens and finds him in this condition he crawls as quietly as he can manage to the couch, covers himself with an old wool blanket and immediately passes out.

He's rudely awakened at 9 am by his wife leaning into his face screaming 

""Sean, ya drunkin' sot, ye were fluther'd an piss'd agin les night!""

He rubs his red eyes and says, 

""How do ye know wot I was doin' gowl? To which she replies, McDuff at th' pub called this marnin'.""

""God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, God bless Grandma and good-bye Grandpa.""

The father asked, 'Why did you say good-bye Grandpa?'

The little girl said, ""I don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do.""

The next day grandpa died. 
The father thought it was a strange coincidence.

A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this, 
""God bless Mommy, God Bless Daddy and good-bye Grandma.""

The next day the grandmother died.

""Holy crap"" thought the father, ""this kid is in contact with the other side.""

Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say, ""God bless Mommy and good-bye Daddy.""

He practically went into shock. He couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office. 

He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay. 
He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

When he got home his wife said, 
""I've never seen you work so late. What's the matter?""

He said, ""I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of my life.""

She said, ""You think you had a bad day, you'll never believe what happened to me. This morning my boss died in the middle of a meeting.

A department store opened in New York City that sold men and a woman decides to visit it in search of a husband.  
At the store’s entrance, there’s a sign outlining the department store policy.  
The first rule states that you can only enter the store once.  
There are six floors and on each floor you can choose a husband or elect to move on to the next floor.  
You cannot visit a floor more than once other than to leave the building.  
The woman visits the first floor.  
The sign reads:  
· Men with jobs.  
She moves on to the second floor:  
· Men with jobs that adore children.  
She moves on the the third floor where the sign reads:  
· Wealthy men that adore children and are very handsome.  
She thinks to herself, ""that's a very good deal"" yet moves on to the fourth floor:  
· Wealthy men that adore children, are very handsome and help with the household chores.  
She decides to move on as things are constantly improving:  
· Wealthy men that adore children, are very handsome, help with the household chores and are very romantic.  
The woman is about to make her purchase but can't resist moving on to the sixth floor.  
There the sign reads:  
· You are visitor number 31,456,012 on this floor.  
· There are no men here.  
· This floor exists as proof that it is impossible to please women.

On the second floor the sign reads:

On the third floor the sign reads:

The boss looked at the man and told him ""I'll let it slide this time, but don't be late again"".

So 8 hours later it's time for the next shift to come in. Every single person comes in late, all panting heavily. The boss is furious and asks why they all came in late. They explained ""Well, we all had dates, and they ran a little late. We tried to catch the bus but missed it. We all took taxis, but they broke down before they could bring us here. We then rented horses but they died before they could finish the trip which is why we had to walk to work and that's why we are all late"".

The boss doesn't believe them but lets them off with it just because he let the first guy get away with it.

They explained to the doctor about the problems they were having with their memory. After checking the couple out, the doctor told them that they were in good health, however, the best thing to do was to start writing things down and make notes to help them to remember things.

Later that night while watching television, the man got up from his chair and his wife asked, ""Where are you going?"" 
He replied ""To the kitchen to make a sandwich."" 
She asked ""Will you get me a bowl of ice cream?"" 
He replied ""Sure honey.""

She replied, ""Well I also would like whipped cream on top. I know you will forget that so you better write it down.""
Now irritated, he said, ""I don't need to write that down! I can remember that.""

""Oh, yes,"" said Dr. Phineas Welch, ""I can bring back the spirits of the illustrious dead.""

He was a little drunk, or maybe he wouldn't have said it. Of course, it was perfectly all right to get a little drunk at the annual Christmas party.

Scott Robertson, the school's young English instructor, adjusted his glasses and looked to right and left to see if they were overheard. ""Really, Dr. Welch.""

""I mean it. And not just the spirits. I bring back the bodies, too.""

""I wouldn't have said it were possible,"" said Robertson primly.

""Why not? A simple matter of temporal transference.""

""You mean time travel? But that's quite - uh - unusual.""

""Not if you know how.""

""Well, how, Dr. Welch?""

""Think I'm going to tell you?"" asked the physicist gravely. He looked vaguely about for another drink and didn't find any. He said, ""I brought quite a few back. Archimedes, Newton, Galileo. Poor fellows.""

""Didn't they like it here? I should think they'd have been fascinated by our modern science,"" said Robertson. He was beginning to enjoy the conversation.

""Oh, they were. They were. Especially Archimedes. I thought he'd go mad with joy at first after I explained a little of it in some Greek I'd boned up on, but no-no-""

""What was wrong?""

""Just a different culture. They couldn't get used to our way of life. They got terribly lonely and frightened. I had to send them back.""

""That's too bad.""

""Yes. Great minds, but not flexible minds. Not universal. So I tried Shakespeare.""

""What?"" yelled Robertson. This was getting closer to home.

""Don't yell, my boy,"" said Welch. ""It's bad manners.""

""Did you say you brought back Shakespeare?""

""I did. I needed someone with a universal mind; someone who knew people well enough to be able to live with them centuries away from his own time. Shakespeare was the man. I've got his signature. As a memento, you know.""

""On you?"" asked Robertson, eyes bugging.

""Right here."" Welch fumbled in one vest pocket after another. ""Ah, here it is.""

A little piece of pasteboard was passed to the instructor. On one side it said: ""L. Klein &amp; Sons, Wholesale Hardware."" On the other side, in straggly script, was written, ""Willm Shakesper.""

A wild surmise filled Robertson. ""What did he look like?""

""Not like his pictures. Bald and an ugly mustache. He spoke in a thick brogue. Of course, I did my best to please him with our times. I told him we thought highly of his plays and still put them on the boards. In fact, I said we thought they were the greatest pieces of literature in the English language, maybe in any language.""

""Good. Good,"" said Robertson breathlessly.

""I said people had written volumes of commentaries on his plays. Naturally he wanted to see one and I got one for him from the library.""

""And?""

""Oh, he was fascinated. Of course, he had trouble with the current idioms and references to events since 1600, but I helped out. Poor fellow. I don't think he ever expected such treatment. He kept saying, 'God ha' mercy! What cannot be racked from words in five centuries? One could wring, methinks, a flood from a damp clout!'""

""He wouldn't say that.""

""Why not? He wrote his plays as quickly as he could. He said he had to on account of the deadlines. He wrote Hamlet in less than six months. The plot was an old one. He just polished it up.""

""That's all they do to a telescope mirror. Just polish it up,"" said the English instructor indignantly.

The physicist disregarded him. He made out an untouched cocktail on the bar some feet away and sidled toward it. ""I told the immortal bard that we even gave college courses in Shakespeare.""

""I give one.""

""I know. I enrolled him in your evening extension course. I never saw a man so eager to find out what posterity thought of him as poor Bill was. He worked hard at it.""

""You enrolled William Shakespeare in my course?"" mumbled Robertson. Even as an alcoholic fantasy, the thought staggered him. And was it an alcoholic fantasy? He was beginning to recall a bald man with a queer way of talking....

""Not under his real name, of course,"" said Dr. Welch. ""Never mind what he went under. It was a mistake, that's all. A big mistake. Poor fellow."" He had the cocktail now and shook his head at it.

""Why was it a mistake? What happened?""

""I had to send him back to 1600,"" roared Welch indignantly. ""How much humiliation do you think a man can stand?""

""What humiliation are you talking about?""

Dr. Welch tossed off the cocktail. ""Why, you poor simpleton, you flunked him.""",The Immortal Bard,4

He is amazed by the skyscrapers in the city. He had never seen any building that is taller than two-story. He wanders in the city, looking around like a curious little child.

After a long walk. He starting to have the urge to poop. The old farmer is not dumb, he knows that you need to be ""civil"" in big cities, you can't just ask people where to shit.

So he walked up to a young couple and asks them:""Hey, you two lovebirds, do you guys have any idea where is the, you know, te...ti..."" He had forgotten what is the word for the buildings where you pee and poop since back in the village he can pretty much do that anywhere. What was it again? *Teilet?* *Tailet?*

The young couple stares at the old farmer in confusion. Then the girl asked :""Maybe you wanted to go to the *theater*?"" The farmer answered:""Yes! Yes! I want to go there!"" The couple gives the old farmer direction, the farmer thanks them and rushes towards the theater, he felt like he can't hold it in much longer.

He arrived at the entrance of the theater and saw there was a lot of people queuing. He figured that this is a big city so this must be normal, so he waited. Finally, it was his turn. The man at the counter asked for money to buy the ticket. The farmer  figured that this is a big city so this must be normal, so he paid and got a movie ticket.

He followed the line and got into the theater. He found his seat according to the seat number on the ticket. He figured this is a big city so this must be normal. But the lights are on brightly(The movie haven't start yet), he can't possibly poop in this situation where everyone can see him. So he asked the man beside him:""When do we start?"", the man answered:""When the lights goes out.""

After a few minutes, the lights goes out and the movie is starting. The farmer finally have some privacy in the dark and started to poop. After he finished, he looks in front of him and he saw a huge television playing. He figured this is part of the city's toilet service so he pulls up his pants and watches the movie.

After 10 minutes, the man sitting behind the farmer taps the  farmer's shoulder. The farmer was too focused on the movie so he asked in an annoyed voice:""What da fuck you want?""

The man behind the farmer replied:""Nothing, man, chill. I just want to tell you your sweet potato fell under my chair.""
