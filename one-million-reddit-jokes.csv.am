When we got home, I felt as if I had lost him completely, as if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore.
He just sat there quietly, and watched TV. ¬†He continued to seem distant and absent. 

Finally, with silence all around us, I decided to go to bed. ¬†About 15 minutes later, he came to bed.
But I still felt that he was distracted, and his thoughts were somewhere else. ¬†He fell asleep; I cried.
I don't know what to do. ¬†I'm almost sure that his thoughts are with someone else. ¬†My life is a disaster.

The masseur tells her she'll need to disrobe and lie on the table. The young woman blushes, but strips off all of her clothes, struts across the room, and lies on the massage table. 

The masseur can't believe his luck as he puts his hands on her gorgeous naked form. He gets a little carried away and starts caressing her upper thigh. The blond visibly stiffens. Thinking quickly he says, ""your hamstrings are very tight. Have they been sore lately?""

""Oh. I guess so. A little maybe."" replies the blond relaxing again. 

Some time passes and the masseur takes things a little further. He begins groping her ass. She reacts slightly, but he says, ""you have a bad knot in your glutes too. Let me work it out for you."" The woman again relaxes. 

He turns her face up and starts rubbing lotion on her chest. She blushes but says nothing. He goes further, plainly fondling her breasts. She has no reaction at all. 

Emboldened, he gently parts her legs and slips a finger into her privates. He unzips his pants intently watching for her reaction. The blond just lays there watching him as he proceeds to make love to her. 

Afterward, as the blond woman is settling the bill with the receptionist, she asks if she'd had any concerns that the masseur had neglected to address.

""None at all."" replies the blond. ""I got a full body massage, a breast exam, a pelvic, and he even gave me something for my herpes.""",An extremely attractive young blond woman goes to a massage parlor.,62

The meek Japanese took it all in stride and when the conference ended the US team gifted them one of their great scientific achievements, which was the THINNEST WIRE IN THE WORLD.

Ten years later at the same conference the Japanese and US were again placed side by side and again there was a lot of gentle ribbing and fun making. This time when the conference ended the Japanese team gifted the US team back the same wire they had given them 10 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

The US team thought about how odd the Japanese were for regifting their own gift to them. They just attributed to their ""backward"" culture and just took it back and went home.

The mother could not accept such a feed back and she took her son out from that school. she even shifted to another city.

25 years later, that teacher got a cardio disorder and all the doctors advised her to go for an open heart operation which only one surgeon could perform. Left with no other choice she did it and the surgery was successful. When she opened her eyes, she saw a handsome doctor smiling at her. Being under the effect of anesthesia, she wanted to thank him but could not talk, in turn, he was staring at her face which suddenly started turning blue. She was raising her hand trying to tell him some thing but unfortunately died before she could. The doctor was shocked and was trying to understand what just happened till he turned back and saw our friend Hameed working as a cleaner in that hospital who unplugged the ventilator to connect his vacuum cleaner.

His current assignment was to eliminate a persistent band of rebels who were hiding in the hills and wreaking havoc. After several weeks of searching, the general solicited ideas from his advisers and subordinates. He couldn't figure out how to find the rebel's camp. 

Later that evening, a small group of officers were discussing possible solutions at a nearby tavern. The barkeeper overheard their conversation and cut in.

""Pardon my interruption, but I couldn't help but overhear your problem. I have a small distillery in and, for a reasonable price, I could make sure that the rebels got more than their fair share of my home-made absinthe,"" the bartender whispered so as to not alert the other patrons.

The officers were eager to gain favor with the general and leapt at the opportunity to find the rebel camp. After a quick round of negotiations, the officers paid the bartender and they all parted ways.

A few days later, the officers were starting to lose confidence in the bartender and went to confront him. He promised that he had sent the rebels back to their camp with a large shipment of his highest strength liquor. He advised them to watch for lights in the hills as the rebels were likely to get careless when they consumed the absinthe.

That night, as the officers were meeting to discuss strategy, a messenger ran into their tent to tell them that sentries had spotted dozens of cooking fires on the hill across the valley. The general was shocked that the rebels would be so careless and his officers were very pleased to tell him about their contribution to the effort.

The next morning, the general took his entire army across the valley and soundly defeated the (very hungover) rebels.

Everyone who died and goes to heaven must first get an interview with an angel, who would decide if their death was noble or not. If it was, they would be let inside, otherwise they would be sent to purgatory.

The first angel takes their shift, and is interviewing people for hours. They start to get bored, until a young man walks up. He immediately kneels before the angel, who motions for him to proceed with the story of his death. The young man starts, hesitantly.

‚ÄúWell... See... I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for nearly five years, and I had planned on asking her to marry me this weekend. It was Friday, and I was working at the office downtown, when I get a text from my neighbor. It said that a strange person had entered my apartment with my girlfriend, and it sound like they were having sex. I immediately drove home, getting angrier by the second, and I see my girlfriend in bed naked. This only makes it worse. I look through the apartment, until I finally find the man hanging off of our balcony. I open the door and step on his fingers, so he falls 3 stories down. Me, wanting to get my anger out, grabs a bag of apples that was laying on the floor, starts throwing them at the man. When I was done with those, I... well...‚Äù

The angel raises his eyebrow, curious as to what came next. The young man finally got his wits about him, and continued.

‚ÄúI run to the fridge and I‚Äôm my fit of anger, I threw it at him. In the process of me dropping it, I had a heart attack and... here I am...‚Äù

By the time the young man finished his stories, he was in tears, obviously angry by his own actions. Ge kept apologizing and repenting for his actions, so with a soft heart, the angel let him into heaven. 

The next man walked to the angel, and kneels, just as the first man did. The angel motions for him to talk, so he begins. 

‚ÄúWell, see, I was just sitting on my balcony reading, when I noticed a drip coming from the balcony above me. I wanted to cover it up so my book wouldn‚Äôt get wet, so I grabbed some tape to do just that. As I was standing in the chair to fix it, one of the flimsy legs gave out, and I fell off. Luckily I was able to grab on to the balcony below my own, but this maniac ran over, stepped on my fingers making me fall 3 stories down! I fell straight into the rose bushes below, and as if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, he started throwing stuff at me... I was just getting up, about to crawl away, when he throws a refrigerator at me! Needless to say, I didn‚Äôt survive that!‚Äù

The young man looks down at his feet, ashamed at his anger in front of this divine being. The angel, feeling bad for this mans untimely and undeserving death, let‚Äôs him into heaven.

The next person to walk up was a young woman, who did not waste a moment. She begins without hesitation.

‚ÄúSo picture this. You are in-

This will make words like fotograf 20% shorter.

In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horibl mes of the silent ""e"" in the languag is disgrasful and it should go away.

First I had to dress really nice..

I took my wife out to some high fancy, upper class restaurant, I made small talk with her for an hour while I consciously avoided the basketball game on TV to pay attention to her instead which honestly may have been the most difficult thing to do looking back.

My bill was $113...

Then I watched The Notebook with her which almost put me out also because I was secretly fighting sleep the entire time.

And in that half sleep state of mind I gave her a massage until my hands hurt while I listened to her stories for about 20 minutes.

When I finally went to seal the deal she was saying things like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm in the mood‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting tired‚Äù.

That‚Äôs when I told her, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only massaging, nothing more‚Äù.

Then I heard her say the magic words. ‚ÄúUgh.. Fine..‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I drove that sucker home..

Come to find out five weeks later she‚Äôs five weeks pregnant.

She had morning sickness for four months, and eczema so bad that it kept her up at night, not to mention her painful delivery with no epidural..

I still say I had to work harder for that baby.

Time after time I almost blew it.

I had to play my hand just right and I did.

post,fc5ne2,2qh72,jokes,false,1583118577,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fc5ne2/hell_explained_by_a_chemistry_student/,self.jokes,,"Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving . I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same! , the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.

This gives two possibilities:

1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.

2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, ""It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,"" and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct......leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting ""Oh my God.""",Hell explained by a Chemistry student,50

Harry answered, ""I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!""

Ms. Brooks had had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office. 

While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. 

If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed. 

Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test.

Principal: ""What is 3 x 3?""
Harry: ""9.""

Principal: ""What is 6 x 6?""
Harry: ""36.""

And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know.

The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, ""I think Harry can go to the 3rd grade.""

Ms. Brooks says to the principal, ""Let me ask him some questions."" 

The principal and Harry both agreed.

Ms. Brooks asks, ""What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?""

Harry, after a moment: ""Legs.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?""
The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!
Harry replied: ""Pockets.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a dog do that a man steps into?""
Harry: ""Pants.""

Ms. Brooks: What starts with a C, ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin, whitish liquid?""

Harry: ""Coconut."" The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open.

Ms. Brooks: ""What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?""

The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Harry replied, ""Bubble gum.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?""
Harry: ""Shake hands."" The principal was trembling.

Ms. Brooks: ""What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?""
Harry: ""Firetruck.""

He decided to retire in style and end his career by attempting a canyon jump in the worst car he could find.  After doing some digging, he came across a Chevy Nova in an auction in Champagne, LA.  It was in bad shape, but he took a chance, won the bid, and spent several months doing body work and souping the engine up until it was as good as anything he‚Äôd jumped in before.

Tragedy struck on the day of the jump, though.  The engine suddenly failed just as Roy was leaving the ramp, and the car lost distance, slammed into the opposite wall of the canyon, and plummeted to the ground.  Not only was it pancaked by the fall, it was further crushed by rocks dislodged by the initial impact.

Roy was thusly immortalized in the local paper:

The driver, a young man in a Brioni¬Æ suit, Gucci¬Æ shoes, RayBan¬Æ sunglasses and YSL¬Æ tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?""

Bud looks at the man, who obviously is a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, why not?""

The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell¬Æ notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3¬Æ cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.

The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop¬Æ and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany ...

Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot¬Æ that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL¬Æ database through an ODBC connected Excel¬Æ spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry¬Æ and, after a few minutes, receives a response.

Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet¬Æ printer, turns to the cowboy and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.""

""That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,"" says Bud.

He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car.

Then Bud says to the young man, ""Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?""

The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ""Okay, why not?""

""You're a Congressman for the U.S. Government"", says Bud.

""Wow! That's correct,"" says the yuppie, ""but how did you guess that?""

""No guessing required."" answered the cowboy. ""You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter.

Smithsonian Institute

207 Pennsylvania Avenue

Washington, DC 20078

Dear Sir:

Thank you for your latest submission to the Institute, labeled ‚Äú211-D, layer seven, next to the clothesline post. Hominid skull.‚Äù We have given this specimen a careful and detailed examination, and regret to inform you that we disagree with your theory that it represents ‚Äúconclusive proof of the presence of Early Man in Charleston County two million years ago.‚Äù Rather, it appears that what you have found is the head of a Barbie doll, of the variety one of our staff, who has small children, believes to be the ‚ÄúMalibu Barbie‚Äù. It is evident that you have given a great deal of thought to the analysis of this specimen, and you may be quite certain that those of us who are familiar with your prior work in the field were loathe to come to contradiction with your findings. However, we do feel that there are a number of physical attributes of the specimen which might have tipped you off to it‚Äôs modern origin:

1. The material is molded plastic. Ancient hominid remains are typically fossilized bone.
2. The cranial capacity of the specimen is approximately 9 cubic centimeters, well below the threshold of even the earliest identified proto-hominids.
3. The dentition pattern evident on the ‚Äúskull‚Äù is more consistent with the common domesticated dog than it is with the ‚Äúravenous man-eating Pliocene clams‚Äù you speculate roamed the wetlands during that time. This latter finding is certainly one of the most intriguing hypotheses you have submitted in your history with this institution, but the evidence seems to weigh rather heavily against it. Without going into too much detail, let us say that:

A. The specimen looks like the head of a Barbie doll that a dog has chewed on.

B. Clams don‚Äôt have teeth.

It is with feelings tinged with melancholy that we must deny your request to have the specimen carbon dated. This is partially due to the heavy load our lab must bear in it‚Äôs normal operation, and partly due to carbon dating‚Äôs notorious inaccuracy in fossils of recent geologic record. To the best of our knowledge, no Barbie dolls were produced prior to 1956 AD, and carbon dating is likely to produce wildly inaccurate results. Sadly, we must also deny your request that we approach the National Science Foundation‚Äôs Phylogeny Department with the concept of assigning your specimen the scientific name ‚ÄúAustralopithecus spiff-arino.‚Äù Speaking personally, I, for one, fought tenaciously for the acceptance of your proposed taxonomy, but was ultimately voted down because the species name you selected was hyphenated, and didn‚Äôt really sound like it might be Latin.

However, we gladly accept your generous donation of this fascinating specimen to the museum. While it is undoubtedly not a hominid fossil, it is, nonetheless, yet another riveting example of the great body of work you seem to accumulate here so effortlessly. You should know that our Director has reserved a special shelf in his own office for the display of the specimens you have previously submitted to the Institution, and the entire staff speculates daily on what you will happen upon next in your digs at the site you have discovered in your back yard. We eagerly anticipate your trip to our nation‚Äôs capital that you proposed in your last letter, and several of us are pressing the Director to pay for it. We are particularly interested in hearing you expand on your theories surrounding the ‚Äútrans-positating fillifitation of ferrous ions in a structural matrix‚Äù that makes the excellent juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex femur you recently discovered take on the deceptive appearance of a rusty 9-mm Sears Craftsman automotive crescent wrench.

Yours in Science,

Harvey Rowe

I was a very happy man.
 
My wonderful Italian girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married.
 
There was only one little thing bothering me....It was her beautiful younger sister. 

My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight mini skirts, and generally was bra-less.
 
She would regularly bend down when she was near me, and I always got more than a nice view.
 
It had to be deliberate.
 
Because she never did it when she was near anyone else.

One day her 'little' sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations.
 
She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome.
 
She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister.
 
Well, I was in total shock, and couldn't say a word.
 
She said, 'I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.'
 
I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs.
 
I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door.
 
I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car.

Lo... And behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!
 
With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law put down his shotgun and hugged me and said, 'We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.' 

And the moral of this story is:

Always keep your condoms in your car !",Italian Wedding Test!,52

As the barman places the beers on the counter he glances at the beast lying at the Aussie's feet.  The barman raises one eyebrow and says ""That is surely the ugliest dog I've ever seen in my life. What sort of breed is it?""

The Aussie takes a long swig of his beer, puts down the glass, and says: ""He is a long-nosed, short-eared, long-bodied, short-legged water-hound, and I'll have you know that he's the best darn fighter I've ever owned!""

The barman takes another long look and laughs. ""I happen to own the toughest bulldog in the whole shire, and he's never been beaten in a fight. I'll wager ¬£1000 that my dog could beat that ugly mutt of yours any day of the week.""

The Aussie takes the barman up on the bet and they bundle the two unfortunate creatures unceremoniously into the back room of the pub and pull the door shut. Immediately there is a frenzy of snarls, growls and yelps, followed by an eerie silence. 

Grinning, the barman opens the door, keen to collect on his ¬£1000 wager. To his dismay, his bulldog is lying dead in a pool of blood whilst the Aussie's four-legged companion lays in the middle of the room, casually chewing on the remains of the bulldog's left rear leg.

The barman shakes his head as he reaches into his back pocket and hands over a large roll of bank notes.  ""17 fights..."", he mutters, ""17 fights my dog has been in and he's never lost a single one until now. Who ever knew that such an odd-looking mutt as yours would be able to fight so well.

As the tramp is enjoying his afternoon stroll, he can hear screaming in the distance. He immediately begins to run as fast as he can to the source. The tramp comes along the edge of a frozen lake and sees a young woman has fallen through the ice into the freezing waters below!


Without thinking, the tramp sprints straight across the frozen lake and pulls the woman free of the cold waters. He carries the young lady to the nearest road and wraps her in his jacket and begins to try and wave down a car. The very first car to pull up is a very expensive, long limousine.


From the back, a large, rich man jumps out and exclaims,


""Oh my! That's my daughter you have there! You must have pulled her from the ice and rescued her! I am the mayor of this fine coastal town and I have to repay you! Tell me my dear tramp friend, what can I do to repay you!""


The tramp ponders the situation he has found himself in. He replies most courteously,


""Well Mayor, I have been a tramp my whole life. I've never had much to call my own. I guess the only thing I could ask for is some cash.""


The Mayor nods his head and strokes his chin. He replies slowly,


""How much would you like my homeless acquaintance?""


The tramp replies quickly,


""I only ask whatever you have to spare!""


The Mayor reaches into his wallet and produces $15. He shakes his head and says,


""My destitute pal, I only have $15 on me. This is not enough to repay you fully! Please follow me back to my mansion so that I can properly pay you the amount you deserve!""


The Tramp, however, is shaking with excitement as he replies,


""Oh my! $15 is more than I've ever even held in my entire life! I'll take it!""


He gratefully takes the money and bids the Mayor a farewell and watches as he takes his daughter into the back and they drive off. Now, loaded with more money than he knew what to do with, he skips into the center of town. 


""Oh jeeze! $15 whole dollars! What should I do with all of this money?""


The tramp ponders the question for a bit, wondering what he should do. Suddenly, it comes to him in a flash of brilliance!


""I shall take a vacation! That's exactly what I shall do with my $15!""


So without a doubt in his mind, the Tramp walks proudly into a travel agency and steps up to the front desk. An older woman comes from the back and skeptically asks,


""Hello sir, what can I do for you this fine cold day?""


The Tramp produces the $15 from his pocket and places it on the counter,


""I would like one vacation if you please ma'am!""


The woman stares at the $15 dollars on the counter and scoffs, 


""Sir, this is only $15. There is no way I can find a trip on such a... frugal budget.""


The Tramp is heartbroken as he sadly replies,


""Oh please ma'am, this is all the money I have. Please, there must be something! Can you look?""


The woman shakes her head and walks off into the back. She seems to be gone for quite some time. The Tramp is just about to lose hope when suddenly the travel agent reappears with a large dusty book. She slams it down and flips to a bookmarked page. 


""Sir, you are quite the lucky man, I have an all expense paid, around the world, luxury cruise! And the best part is the booking fee is only $15!""


The Tramp is ecstatic! He exclaims,


""I'll take it! Yes! Oh my!""


He quickly pays and heads straight for the docks to board the ship. As he approaches the pier, he sees the most beautiful, luxurious cruise ship. He starts to run up the brow to board the ship when a man comes running down the opposite way, waving his arms yelling,


""Hey! What do you think you're doing! I can't have no tramps on my fine cruise ship! Get out of here you bum!""


The Tramp quickly produces his ticket and presents it to the man,


""Oh well sir, I rightfully paid for my ticket and I was boarding for my around the world cruise...""


The Captian takes the ticket and looks it over. He nods his head and calms down before saying, 


""I see... Well my friend, you must understand the my passengers are all very rich people and they expect a certain level of class. I can't just have you walking around while they are awake! Do me a favor, go find a place to lay low on the docks and at midnight, I'll come find you and sneak you onto the boat.""


The Tramp nods his head and thanks the Captain. He wonders down to the docks and finds a nice place to settle down and slowly drifts off into a nice nap...


Suddenly, he is shaken awake and he can see that night has descended on the docks. The Captian holds a finger up to silence to Tramp and motions for him to follow. They walk up the brow and board the ship. As they make their way down to the passengers cabins, the Tramp is shocked! It's absolutely the most beautiful and extravagant place he's ever seen. There is 4 inch thick carpets and gold ornate trim on the walls. All of the paintings hanging on the walls are original masterpieces. The Captian turns back to the Tramp and whispers,


""Sorry my friend, but this is first class. I can't keep you here. We are going down a few levels to your lodgings.""


The Tramp nods happily and continues to stare in awe. As they make their way down, the rooms slowly become less extravagant. The second deck down only has 2 inch thick carpets, the ornate trims are silver, and the paintings on the walls are replicas of famous masterpieces. However, the Tramp is still in complete awe of the majesty of it all. The Captain turns around and whispers,


""Again my friend, this is a little too nice for you to stay here. We are going to continue down.""


Again the Tramp nods and they proceed down to the third deck down. This time the carpets are only 1 inch thick and the ornate trim is bronze. The paintings are done by unknown artists. The Captian again explains that this is far to ritzy for the Tramp to stay here. They continue down, further and further they travel down into the bowels of the ship. Eventually they reach the engine rooms.


In the very back of a boiler room there is a large metal door that the Captian enters with the Tramp tailing behind. Inside, there is a simple rope hammock and barrel with an alarm clock on top. The Captain explains,


""I'm sorry it's not much,  but this will be where you have to stay during the day. At night, once all the other guests have retired to their rooms, you are free to roam the topside and enjoy the facilities! But only when the other passengers are asleep!... oh my, are you okay?""


The Tramp looks up with tears in his eyes,


""Oh my goodness Captian, I've never been treated so well in my entire life! Thank you for everything you've done for me thus far! I promise to repay you some how!""


The Captain laughs and pats him on the back. He sets the alarm for midnight and lets the Tramp get settled in....


The following night, the Tramp goes above deck and explores everything. He tries out the shuffle board, enjoys some rock climbing, even enjoys a nice movie! As the night get closers to an end, he spots a large pool with a nice diving board. The Tramp decides to do a few dives before calling it a day. As he gets ready, someone peeks around a corner to observe. They watch as the Tramp dives from the diving board and enters the water without a splash! It's almost unbelievable! The Tramp dives a few more times and every single time he enters the water there isn't a splash! Not even a ripple! The mysterious onlooker is shocked!


The Tramp continues this for a few weeks. Diving and entering the water perfectly! Eventually, the onlooker approaches the Tramp and reveals themselves to be the Captain! 


""My friend! I have been watching you dive for weeks now and I must tell you that you are most phenomenal thing I have ever seen! Please! Let me build you the largest diving board the world has ever seen! We will hold a show, charging a fee, and everyone on the boat will come to see the best diver on all the seas!""


The Tramp agrees most excitedly! He cannot wait to dive for an audience! So for the following weeks, the Captian gets busy building the largest diving board behind a curtain and the Tramp continues to practice his dive. Finally, after the diving board is finished and the Tramp has even further perfected his dive, the Captian comes down to the Tramps room and tells him he has a gift for him. The Tramp accepts the wrapped box and opens it to reveal a brand new swimsuit! 


""My goodness! This is wonderful!"" Exclaims the Tramp, he immediately changes and heads up above deck. The entire ship is waiting on baited breaths. They are whispers to one another, curious as to who the mystery diver is, and how tall is this ""largest diving board ever"" really? The Captian embraces the Tramp and tells him that he wishes him the best of luck. The curtain is thrown back and everyone gasps! The ladder reaches higher than anyone can see! The Tramp sets his shoulders back in determination and begins to climb. 


Slowly he gets higher and higher. Looking down he can see the entire ship below him. He continues to climb and climb, before again looking down and seeing the ship is nothing more than a tiny dot in the ocean. He continues to climb further and further. He glances down again and this time he can see the entire expanse of the ocean, even noticing the curvature of the earth. He continues to climb, higher and higher. He looks down again and sees the entire earth below him. He lets out a breath and wipes his brow before continuing his climb. Finally, he reaches the top and looks down one last time. The earth is but a small speck below him. He says a quick prayer and jumps.


The audience begins to worry, they haven't seen the diver in a few hours. Is the ladder reall that high? Did he get stuck? Will he be okay falling at such a height? Meanwhile, the Tramp is falling. Faster and faster! The earth slowly grows before his eyes! He can see the entire planet! As he builds more and more speed, suddenly the entire ocean is spread out before him, he can see only the curvature of the planet now! Fast and faster he falls, the ship is now a speck in front of him! 


Back on the ship, an audience member gasps! Everyone looks up and they see the diver speeding at breakneck speed straight towards the pool! The Tramp hits the water faster than he's ever hit water before! But still! Not. A. Single. Ripple. Smooth like glass, the surface remains still. The Tramp flies down to the bottom of the pool! He breaks through the bottom! He flies through the first deck, second deck, third, fourth! All the way dowm until he goes straight through the keel! He continues straight down all the way to the bottom of the ocean! He finally stops and kicks his way to the top. He breaches the surface and can hear the cheers from the crowd above. A ladder is lowered and he makes his way back up to the main deck. The Captian is waiting with open arms!


""My dear fellow!"" He exclaims, ""how in the world did you accomplish such a feat? I'm in total awe!""


The homeless man chuckles and replies,


""Captian my good friend! I'm a Tramp, I've been through many a hardship in my life!""

The one who can deliver will be chosen as his heir to the farm.

 So the oldest son goes to the market to get hay while the middle son go get leaves and the youngest son goes to a shop and buys two things that he put in his pocket. 

The middle son went first, he hauled in his leaves and a fails to fill the barn entirely, instead he manages to fill only 1/4 of the barn.

The oldest son is next, he shovels in his truckload of hay only to discover that it's not enough to fill to barn as well, only managing to fill 1/2 of the barn.

Last is the youngest son, he pulls out a lamp and some matches. He strikes a flame and lights the lamp, but as doing so he slips on a pile of cow shit inside the barn, causing him to drop the lamp and lit match onto the pile of leaves and hay his brothers left inside the barn. This causes a giagantic chain reaction resulting in the entire farm being burnt to smithereens as well as the next 75 miles of esate down south. He is charged with arson and sentenced to prison for 45 years.

The girl would secretly sneak out of her house in the middle of the night without a male companion to hangout with Ryan. They would go to Ryan's place and make love for the whole night. Ryan would drop her back before the dawn. She would quietly sneak in the house. This way nobody would know of thier secret affair. It went on for a few months.

A local detective got suspicious. So over the next week he would track thier movements. He noticed that every night Ryan would drive her to his place, they would make love all night and he would drop her off before the dawn. So he informed the police. 

One fine night, the police raided Ryan's place. They found Ryan and the girl having sex. Ryan was immediately arrested.   The court trail followed. Since sex outside of marriage is prohibited, the judge ordered to Ryan's dick to be chopped off in public.

The CIA got hold of this news. They asked the Saudi government to pardon Ryan. The Saudi government didn't rejected the idea of pardon sensing public anger.

So the day of reckoning came. The square was full of people. Ryan was presented before the public at 10 AM. His crime and punishment were read out. 

The judge ordered Ryan's pants to be removed. His dick was placed on a chopping board.

Just when the executioner was about to slam his sword on Ryan's dick, a US marine chopper landed at the square. Everybody including Ryan was puzzled.

Apparently it was a secret mission to rescue him.

From the chopper, 6 marines ejected and surrounded the square to ensure the choppers were safe. Nobody in the audience moved. 

When the sqaure was secured, Tom Hanks in his military uniform came out of the chopper, grabbed Ryan and threw him in. All the marines boarded the chopper and flew off without any incident. The rescue mission was celebrated as a grand success in the media.

Ryan, although thankful was surprised to see Tom Hanks on the mission and so he asked him ""What the hell are you doing here Tom?""

Tom replied ""SAVING RYAN'S PRIVATE""",Ryan Gosling went to live in Saudi Arabia for a year.,12
