Well, there is one tradition that very few people know about. Shortly after the new Pope is enthroned, the Chief Rabbi seeks an audience. He is shown into the Pope's presence, whereupon he presents the Pope with a silver tray bearing a velvet cushion. On top of the cushion is an ancient, shriveled parchment envelope. The Pope symbolically stretches out his arm in a gesture of rejection. The Chief Rabbi then retires, taking the envelope with him and does not return until the next Pope is elected. 

Pope Francis was intrigued by this ritual, that's origins were unknown to him. He instructed the best scholars of the Vatican to research it, but they came up with nothing. When the time came and the Chief Rabbi was shown into his presence, he faithfully enacted the ritual rejection but, as the Chief Rabbi turned to leave, he called him back. 

""My brother,"" the Pope whispered, ""I must confess that we Catholics are ignorant of the meaning of this ritual enacted for centuries between us and you, the representative of the Jewish people. I have to ask you, what is it all about?"" 

The Chief Rabbi shrugs and replies: ""But we have no more idea than you do. The origin of the ceremony is lost in the traditions of ancient history."" 

The Pope said: ""Let us retire to my private chambers and enjoy a glass of wine together, then with your agreement, we shall open the envelope and discover the secret at last."" 

The Chief Rabbi agreed. Fortified in their resolve by the wine, they gingerly pried open the curling parchment envelope and with trembling fingers, the Chief Rabbi reached inside and extracted a folded sheet of similarly ancient paper. As the Pope peered over his shoulder, he slowly opened it. They both gasped with shock - It was the check for the Last Supper.",Every time a new Pope is elected...,32

Johnny’s teacher sees him raise his hand as she gives out the first letter. A......too easy to make a curse word. B also too easy. Definitely not C. On and on she goes and with each letter Johnny enthusiastically raises his hand and each time the teacher calls another students name. 

Letters are running out and she begins to feel bad the little Johnny has not been called on to give an answer. So finally at the letter W she reluctantly calls on Johnny. 

“Ok Johnny your letter is W. What word starts with W?” Johnny thinks for a minute and then shouts “Womb!” 

The teacher is caught off guard and begins to cheerfully exclaim “Well yes Johnny that is a word that starts with W! And a very advanced word too! A womb is where your mommy kept you until you were born”

The drive to the airport was a couple of hours and they were on a tight schedule to make the flight. As they were driving down this lonely stretch of highway they got to talking about what their first time would be like. Words led to a little driving and fooling around. after a few minutes of this the bride says, I can't wait any longer, we need to do this now! The groom, who is also way past his breaking point agrees, but does the math in his head and tells his beautiful bride if they stop to have sex, they will miss the plane and mess up a pretty expensive honeymoon trip. The bride sits back in defeat, a little angry that it is not going to happen until they get to their hotel many hours from now. The husband, starts to think and has an idea. He tells his bride, ""There is nobody on this road, the only people we've even seen are those two guys sitting outside that gas station we passed a minute ago. Why don't we just do it while we are driving, we can get it over with, and still make our flight."" The wife agrees and the both strip down naked and she climbs  on top of him while he is driving. Fast forward 22 seconds later and the husband has his first incredible orgasm inside his bride, so incredible he loses control of the car and they end up in a terrible wreck. The car careens all over the road and ends up rolling over several times and lands in a ditch.

Eventually, they both come to, and the wife is miraculously un-injured minus a pretty bad headache. The husband however is trapped under the steering wheel with two broken legs. He tells his wife she needs to call for help. She looks around and can't find their clothes anywhere, she tells the husband she can't find anything they had on except one of his shoes. The husband thinks about it for a minute and comes up with a plan. He tells his wife, ""Okay, here is what you have to do, you have to go back and get help from those guys sitting outside the gas station, they will be able to call the fire department and get me out of here."" The wife says, ""But I can't find any of my clothes, it's pitch black out here and all I can find i this damn shoe!"" The husband thinks on it a minute and tells his wife, ""Okay, here is what you have to do, take my shoe, use the laces and tie it around your waist with the shoe covering your vagina, then just use your hands to cover your breasts and go to the gas station."" The wife agrees, ties up the shoe and sets off down the road.

Now Clem and Harold are sitting outside their gas station just like they have been every morning for the last 25 years having a cup of coffee and shooting the breeze while the sun comes up. All of a sudden, Harold taps Clem on the should and says, ""Hoooweee Clem, take a look and what is running down the road this way!"" Clem drops his cup of coffee and is totally shocked to see a naked woman running towards them on the side of the road. The woman runs up to them and starts screaming, ""Help me, Help me, please, you have to help me!!! My husband, he's  stuck, he's stuck!!! You have to help me get him out!!!"" Well old Clem looks at the woman, looks at the shoe, looks at Harold, turns back to the woman and says, ""Ma'am if he's in there that far, he ain't eeeeever getting out!""",Honeymoon.,5

The man went through extreme training and was finally ready to conduct a large passenger train.

&amp;#x200B;

All was going great until the man suddenly fell asleep and the train derailed. Everyone on the train died except for the man. He was arrested and sentenced to death for reckless endangerment. The brought him over to the electric chair and asked him what he wanted for his last meal. He said he wanted a peanut butter and honey sandwich. After he ate, they sat him down in the chair and fired it up. After around ten seconds, the chair turned off because it needed to ""recharge."" But the man was completely unscathed.

The officers, too lazy to deal with the man let him go with mandatory therapy to help him stay awake and to redo the conductor training.  He completed his therapy and training and got back to conducting. He was excited because he got to drive an even bigger train this time. He was just getting started when the man got distracted by a beautiful butterfly and the train derailed smashing into a couple of houses. All the people on the train and in the houses died except for the man. He was arrested and sentenced to death. He was taken to the country's most powerful electric chair and asked what he wanted for his last meal. He said he wanted a PB&amp;H sandwich. After he ate, they sat him down in the chair and fired it up. After around ten minutes, the chair broke down from the extreme heat. But the man was completely unscathed.

The officers, angered, released the man on the term that he would go through the most extreme training in the country to help him focus. The man agreed and did what the officers told him to. After a year, the man got the invitation to test drive the newest largest train out there. They didn't trust him to have people on the train but they did trust him to do this because what could go wrong? Right? RIGHT? Anyway, the man was ecstatic to conduct this train. He got going and realized the train could reach incredible speeds. He was zooming around the corners without risk because the train had an electromagnetic in the wheels to connect it to the track. The man was high in the mountains above a large city when he had a violent coughing fit. Violent enough to overcome the electromagnet and derail the train off the cliff and down to the large city. Upon impact, the train exploded with a force of 100,000 lbs of TNT. Everyone in the city was instantly killed except for the man. He was arrested and brought to the worlds most powerful electric chair that wasn't even used for executions yet. The officers threw the man his sandwich and watched impatiently as he ate. When he finished, they shoved him in the chair and cranked it up to full power after dowsing him in water. The chair had the power of over 200 lightning bolts per second. It ran for ten hours before crumbling to ash from the extreme power. The officers reentered to find the man sitting on the floor asleep. They were enraged and forcefully woke the man screaming, ""WHY THE FUCK WILL YOU NOT DIE FROM THE CHAIR?"" The man just drowsily looked up at them, shrugged and said,


""I guess I'm just a bad conductor.""",There once was a man who always wanted to be a train conductor.,64

He never went on the computer because his parents forbid him from touching any computer because they knew all the bad stuff you could find on the internet. 

Nevertheless, Ted was happy and went on without computers until he got to high school. All his friends were playing video games and having fun and he started to feel a bit left out, so when he got home one day from school, he begged his mother to get him a computer. “Please mother, please, all my friends are playing computer games!” He would cry, but his mother continued to deny him.

1 week later the issue rose again in his friends group at school and everyone was confused why Ted couldn’t play video games with him. After repetitive failure from his mother, he asked his dad. “Please father, please, all my friends are playing it!” But his father denied him as well. 

Ted was really angry and all he wanted to do was play online with his friends every once in a while. He thought he’d take matters into his own hands and he stole his fathers computer and hid it in his room. That night he played with his friends for hours and hours until morning, then he secretly stayed home and played all day.

His dad didn’t notice until that afternoon, when he walked into his office and his computer was missing, so he asked his son Ted if he touched it. Ted owned up and gave the computer back, but had a tantrum afterwards. “WHY DON’T I GET TO PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS” he yelled in tears. 

Feeling pity, his dad finally bought him a laptop. Ted was on it 10 hours a day and refused when his parents told him to get off. After 2 months nothing had changed and his parents started to get worried about his wellbeing. They approached him to talk about it. Ted agreed, but only if he could play video games whilst they talked.

“So Ted” his mother said, “we’ve been worrying about you lately” “uh-hu” Ted said. “Seriously son!” His father yelled, “this needs to stop!” “Mhm yep” Ted replied. “Are you listening to us Ted?” His mother said, but Ted didn’t even reply. “You know what son?” His father yelled, “you are a dick Ted!”",The story of Ted,7

One particular parrot is extremely cheap. She asks the pet shop owner why. The owner replies that it has spent some time in a brothel and has picked up some bad language. Always the spendthrift, the lady takes the parrot home with the intention of teaching it some manners.

When she gets home the parrot pipes up. ""New brothel, new Madame"". The lady was a little taken aback, but remembering the Parrots background she chastises the parrot and tells it that sort of language is unacceptable.

A few hours later the lady's two daughters arrive home. The parrot pipes up again: ""New brothel, new prostitutes"". The girls are shocked but the mother explains the parrots background and once again chastises the parrot.

A few hours later the husband returns home. Again the parrot pipes up: ""Yo Steve, how you doing?""",The parrot and the prostitutes,56

Thus, one woman might be known as Squaw of Buffalo Hide, while another might be known as Squaw of Deer Hide.  This tribe had a particularly large and strong woman, with a very unique (for North America anyway) animal hide for her blanket.  This woman was known as Squaw of Hippopotamus hide, and she was as large and powerful as the animal from which her blanket was made.
Year after year, this woman entered the tribal wrestling tournament, and easily defeated all challengers; male or female.  As the men of the tribe admired her strength and power, this made many of the other woman of the tribe extremely jealous.  One year, two of the squaws petitioned the Chief to allow them to enter their sons together as a wrestling tandem in order to wrestle Squaw of the Hippopotamus hide as a team.  In this way, they hoped to see that she would no longer be champion wrestler of the tribe.
As the luck of the draw would have it, the two sons who were wrestling as a tandem met the squaw in the final and championship round of the wrestling contest.  As the match began, it became clear that the squaw had finally met an opponent that was her equal.  The two sons wrestled and struggled vigorously and were clearly on an equal footing with the powerful squaw.  Their match lasted for hours without a clear victor. Finally the chief intervened and declared that, in the interests of the health and safety of the wrestlers, the match was to be terminated and that he would declare a winner.
The chief retired to his tipi and contemplated the great struggle he had witnessed, and found it extremely difficult to decide a winner. While the two young men had clearly outmatched the squaw, he found it difficult to force the squaw to relinquish her tribal championship. After all, it had taken two young men to finally provide her with a decent match.  Finally, after much deliberation, the chief came out from his tipi, and announced that the contest was a tie, adding…

They get back to his place, and he shows her around his apartment. She notices that one wall of his bedroom is completely filled with soft, sweet, cuddly teddy bears.

&amp;#x200B;

There are three shelves in the bedroom, with hundreds  of cute, cuddly Teddy Bears carefully placed in rows, covering the entire wall. It was obvious that he had taken quite some time to lovingly arrange them and she was immediately touched by the amount of thought he had put into organizing the display.

&amp;#x200B;

There were small bears all along the bottom shelf, medium-sized bears covering the length of the middle shelf, and huge, enormous bears running all the way along the top shelf. She found it strange for an obviously masculine guy to have such a large collection of Teddy Bears. She is quite impressed by his sensitive side, but doesn't mention this to him.

&amp;#x200B;

They share a bottle of wine and continue talking and, after awhile, she finds herself thinking, Oh my God! Maybe, this guy could be the one! Just maybe, this could be the future father of my children. She turns to him and kisses him lightly on the lips. He responds warmly and they continue to kiss, the passion builds, and he romantically lifts her in his arms and carries her into his bedroom where they rip off each other's clothes and make hot, steamy love.

&amp;#x200B;

She is so overwhelmed that she responds with more passion, more creativity, more heat than she has ever known. After an intense, explosive night of raw passion with this sensitive guy, they are lying there together in the afterglow.

&amp;#x200B;

The woman rolls over, gently strokes his chest and asks coyly, 'Well, how was it?'

&amp;#x200B;

The guy gently smiles at her, strokes her cheek, looks deeply into her eyes, and says:

A month ago I met this amazing Thai women (23yo) who is more sexually experienced than I am to say the least and wants to take my virginity. She wants my first time to be both special and adventurous at the same time. We have done everything except for sex at this point. What is also important to know is that the first time we did sexual stuff she revealed to me that she has a rare condition (I forget the name) where she was born with male genitalia instead of a vagina. The doctors said that this was a one in a 16 million occurrence or something like that and that she could have had an operation but didn't want the chance of losing the ability to orgasm. At first it was almost a deal breaker, especially when I found out it was bigger than mine, but we hit it off so much and she is so kind and caring that I have learned to accept it and love her for who she is.

Anyway my question is, this Friday she wants to take my virginity but before she wants to do some coke and do this thing where we put cocaine in our foreskins and dock penises before having sex. Apparently it increases pleasure, feels amazing and gets you really fucked up. I am ok with docking penises as we have done this with her before and it was a great experience but I am really concerned about how the coke with affect my penis and whether it will do permanent or longterm damage to my sex organ or whether it will be ok. When I brought this up with my partner she laughed and said that it would be fine but asked if I would prefer we could boof it instead. I know boofing cocaine is fine but I would rather not insert things into my bum because I am not gay (not that I have anything against homosexuals).

Thank you for the help in advance! I feel like she is asking a lot but she seems keen on doing this and I don't want to disappoint her",just took care of a pervert,0

A young monk arrives at the monastery. He is assigned to helping the other monks in copying the old laws of the church by hand. He notices, however, that all of the monks are copying from copies, not from the original manuscript. So, the new monk goes to the head monk to question this, pointing out that if someone made even a small error in the first copy, it would never be picked up! In fact, that error would be continued in all of the subsequent copies.

The head monk, says, “You make a good point, my son.”

He goes down into the dark caves underneath the monastery where the original manuscripts are held in a locked vault. Hours go by and nobody sees the head monk. The young monk gets worried and goes down to look for him. He sees him banging his head against the wall and wailing.

“We missed the R! We missed the R! We missed the R!”

“Father!” cries the young monk. “What’s wrong?”

The head monk with tears in his eyes replies, “The word is *celebrate*!”",Maybe it is just me but so funny,3

One of the preachers, and older and seasoned in his days of scripture, belonged to a Southern Baptist Church. The other, who was simply starting his career in the teachings of the word of God, was preaching at the Protestant church.

Back then, churches did not make a lot of money and therefore did not have much to pay their preachers with. Because of this, it was not uncommon that the preachers would be seen riding their bicycles through the town as they could not afford a car of their own.

When the young preacher had moved to town, the older preacher had welcomed him with a warm welcoming and they established a friendship.

The two would periodically meet down by the river that separates the northern and southern half’s of the town, to discuss their theological differences.

On one particular day the older preacher sat by the river, contemplating Gods existence and why the meaning of life could be. He had been waiting for a longer period of time than usual, awaiting the company of the younger preacher.

Eventually he hears a noise, and as he turns around he sees the young preacher huffing and puffing on his way to their meeting spot.

The older preacher calls out to him, “Well there you are, I didn’t think you’d make it today.”

“Sorry, Father”, replied the younger preacher. “I had to walk all the way here, and this summer heat is like Hell on Earth.”

The older preacher laughed, “Why did you walk, where is your bike?”

“I think someone may have stolen it Father,” replied the young preacher.

“Well, God Almighty, do you have any clue who it could of been?”, the older preacher asked earnestly.

“I haven’t the slightest clue, and I don’t have the cash to get another right now,” replied the young preacher.

“Well I think I might have an idea on how you can get that bike of yours back,” said the older preacher with a slight grin on his face.

“How do you reckon?” replied the young preacher.

“Well,” the older preacher began, “this Sunday you get on up there and you preach about eternal damnation. I mean you lay it on thick, make them feel that fire and smell that brimstone. You preach harder than you ever have about Hell, and you tell them the horrors. Then, you go over His 10 Commandments. And I’ll bet once you start down that list, once you get to Thou Shalt not Steal the perpetrator will confess and deliver you what is yours.”

“That’s not a bad idea Father, but do you think that would really work?” asked the young preacher.

“I don’t see why not, knowing the folks down here. Even if you don’t get a confession, I bet that bike of yours will show up miraculously,” replied the older preacher.

“You’re right! I will do as you suggest Father, I will try that out,” replied the young preacher.

A single week later, and it’s the young Preacher who is waiting for the seasoned Preacher by the river.

“Ah, I see you have recovered your bicycle. So what I told you worked?” shouted the older preacher as he walked up to the riverside.

“Well,” the young preacher started, “not exactly.”

“How do you mean?” the older preacher asked with a confused look on his face.

“Well, Father, I did the whole eternal damnation spiel and really had them burning in their seats. I mean really they were sweating, and it wasn’t just from the summer heat. I was laying it on thick, really bringing the fire and brimstone to life. After that I moved onto the 10 commandments just as you told me...but right when I got the Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery I remembered where I left my bike.”",Back in the day there were two Preachers.

When they got to the last tepee, the guide explained that there was an old Indian who live there that knew the answer to every question ever asked. Intrigued, Harry went in, and there was indeed surely the oldest native American Indian that had ever lived, with full feathered headress and war paint. Harry thought ""He cant possibly know the answer to every single question ever"" so decides to test him. The old Indian looks up at him and says ""What is your question?"" Harry thinks for a second and asks ""Who scored the 2nd goal in the 1908 soccer FA Cup final?"" Harry thinks that old Indian couldn't possibly know much about football, let alone a result that had happened over a 100 years ago. The old Indian looked up and said ""George Headley, in the 47th minute"" Harry was astonished, that was the right answer! He wanted to ask the old Indian how he could possible know this but the tour bus driver was honking his horn and he had to leave.

was barely two, he could hold a proper thirty minute conversation with any adult. And he loved to talk. Well at first, at least. However, as years passed, it started becoming a problem when he started finding it impossible to stay quiet even for minutes. 

Even when he was alone, he felt the constant need to mumble. There were positives, of course. For instance, who doesn’t love a man who stays to talk after sex. But Steven realized something must be done.

When all western medicines failed and there was little hope left, somebody recommended he visit Nepal where there were monks who knew of ancient magic that could heal anything. Having little to lose, he decided to give it a shot. 

On reaching the place, he visited many monks all of whom would tell him, it is simple, and leave it at that. Hopeless, he decided to visit a last priest before he left. “It is simple”, the monk told him.

“Simple, simple, simple. What a waste of a trip. All you monks have given me are six useless letters.

And he stopped. It worked. He was quiet. 

How, he wondered.

After they hit the fruit the computer would display their score and play a congratulatory tune if they got above a certain score.


Everything goes smoothly and Fruit Ninja rents a huge outdoor space to host all of these different stations on the day of the event. The most popular one has to be the Katana Strawberry, with an estimated wait time of 2 hours. That is followed by the Tonfa Watermelon and the Spear Apple, with wait times lasting 1 hours and 30 minutes respectively.


Generally all of the stations are doing very well, but there's one where the crowd gathered appears to be more confused than anything. It's a green fruit but with no physical weapon in sight. Speculation spreads among the crowd, with theories ranging from ""it's not one of the stations"" to ""somebody must have stolen the weapon"".


However, one of the people in the crowd manages to pull over a Fruit Ninja employee to ask them what's going on.


The employee takes one look at the station and sighs, ""I told them from the beginning that we should have ditched this idea or put up signs, because people are going to wonder about the lack of a weapon.""


He continues, ""Yeah, it's a really bad Punch Lime.""","To celebrate their 10th anniversary, Fruit Ninja decides to host a live event.",19

He noticed over time he was suddenly losing weight rapidly through no effort of his own.  He ate more to compensate but still continued dropping pounds rapidly,  In a panic he went to several doctors and was diagnosed with having an extremely rare condition,  he was host to a Giant Tapeworm.

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor who found the tapeworm told him only one Doctor had ever successfully treated his condition,  but he lived in a remote village in Japan only able to be reached by travelling there in person.  The fat man was determined to cure himself being large was his only source of income and he enjoyed the fame and notoriety.  He left the next morning to seek out the doctor in Japan.

&amp;#x200B;

With the help of several forklifts large trucks and luck the fat man found the doctor and made an appointment to be examined.  The doctor examined him and concurred that he was host to the giant tapeworm,  with broken English he explained that his treatment would begin tomorrow,  he should return early in the morning and bring with him One Hard-Boiled Egg and One Chocolate Chip Cookie.  The fat man looked puzzled at the doctors instructions but was desperate and agreed to return in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning the fat man returned and the Japanese doctor greeted him with broken English "" Herro, you bringa hard-boired egg? "" the fat man nodded and placed the egg on the doctors table  "" good good you bringa chocorate  chip cookie?"" tha fat ma nodded and place the cookie beside the egg.  "" ok drop pants grab ankle"" the fat man looked at the doctor puzzled but realized quickly he was serious so he dropped his pants and grabbed his ankles.  The Doctor swiftly shoved the Hard-Boiled Egg up the fat guys ass and counted slowly to 10 then Shoved the Chocolate chip cookie up the fat mans ass as well.  "" ok tomorrow you come back bringa one hard-boired egg and bringa one chocorate chip cookie""

&amp;#x200B;

That's it? asked the Fat man the doctor nodded and smiled and left the room.

&amp;#x200B;

the next morning the ""treatment"" was the same the fat man came in dropped his pants grabbed his ankles and proceeded to have a hard-boiled egg shoved up his ass then after a slow 10 count a chocolate chip cookie followed.  this went on for 2 solid weeks every morning the fat man didn't know how it was working but he noticed his dramatic weight loss had tapered off a bit and he wasn't losing as much weight as before.

&amp;#x200B;

""how long do I have to do this Doc?"" asked the fat man

""tomorrow is rast day, you bringa one hard-boired egg and bringa one hammer"" said the doctor

""A HAMMER WHAT FOR!?!?"" screamed the fat man with shock and the doctor just smiled nodded and left the room.

&amp;#x200B;

The Next morning the Fat man again came to see the doctor bringing with him one hard-boiled egg and this time he had a brand new hammer he purchased in the village.  The Doctor greeted him as before and the man placed the egg and hammer on the table and like he had done every morning for 14 days he dropped his pants and grabbed his ankles.

&amp;#x200B;

The Doctor shoved the Hard boiled egg up the fat mans ass and again counted slowly to 10.  1...2....3....4....The fat man clenched a little worried where that hammer was about to go....""rerax rerax almost ova"" said the doctor....5....6....7....8.....9....10....the fat man closed his ass and tried to think of a happy place.

&amp;#x200B;

nothing happened

&amp;#x200B;

a few seconds later a Giant Tapeworm slithered out of the fat mans ass looks at the doctor and says

"" Hey! where the fuck is my cookie?"" and the Doctor hit it over the head with the hammer killing it.

&amp;#x200B;

The man was cured.",The Giant Tapeworm,6

One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts. ""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me,"" said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.

   Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, ""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me."" He just knew what it was, so he jumped back on his bike and rode off.

   Now just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along. ""Come here quick,"" said the boy, ""you won't believe what I heard!  Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls.""

     The man said, ""Beat it kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk."" When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled to the cemetery.  Standing by the fence they heard, ""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me..."" The old man whispered, ""Boy, you've been tellin' the truth.  Let's see if we can see the Lord."" Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence yet were still unable to see anything.

   The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord. At last they heard, ""One for you, one for me. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence and we'll be done.""

   They say the old man made it back to town a full 5 minutes ahead of the boy on the bike!",Pecans in the Cemetery,7

And I was right! As soon as I caught it, I just couldn't unsee it.

""Oh yeah. Most favourite piece I've made. Its copies sell well.""

""Oh! I must say it does look absolutely magnificent! But I'm sure you realise what's wrong with it.""

""Ah, yes. An intentional design.""

""So you masterfully handcrafted this fox painting, intentionally painted the tail out, and still managed to sell enough copies even though it's an incomplete painting.""

The artist chuckled and nodded in agreement.

My eyes widened, with the hands open and on my sides, and my lips mouthing the word in amazement: ""How?""

1. You see a Gorgeous Girl at a party.You go up to her and say: ""I am very rich. Marry me!""
- That's Direct Marketing.
2. You are at a party with a bunch of friends and
see a Gorgeous Girl.
One of your friends goes upto her and pointing at
you says: ""He's very rich.Marry him!""
- That's Advertising.
3. You are at a party and see a Gorgeous Girl.
She walks up to you and says: ""You are very rich!
Can I marry you?""
- That's Brand Recognition.
4. You see a Gorgeous Girl at a party.
You go upto her and say: ""I am very rich. Marry
me!"" She gives you a nice hard slap on your face.
- That's Customer Feedback.
5. You see a Gorgeous Girl at a party.
You go upto her and say: ""I am very rich. Marry
me!"" And she introduces you to her husband.
- That's Demand and Supply Gap.
6. You see a Gorgeous Girl at a party.
You go upto her and before you say: ""I m rich,
Marry me!"", your wife arrives.

The man says, “No problem. I’m from Miami.”

So the devil goes over to the thermostat, turns the temperature up to 100, and the humidity up to 80. He then goes back to the Miami man to see how he’s doing. To the devil’s surprise, the man is doing just fine.

“No problem…just like Miami in June,” the man says.

So the devil goes back over to the thermostat, and turns the temperature up to 150, and the humidity up to 90. He then goes back over to see how the Miami man is doing. The man is sweating a little, but overall looks comfortable.

“No problem. Just like Miami in July,” the man says.

So now the devil goes over to the thermostat, turns the temperature up to 200, and the humidity up to 100. When he goes back to see how the man is doing, the man is sweating profusely, and has taken his shirt off. Otherwise, he seems OK.

He says, “No problem. Just like Miami in August.”

Now the devil is really perplexed. So he goes back to the thermostat, and turns the temperature down to MINUS 150 DEGREES. Immediately, all the humidity in the air freezes up, and the whole place (meaning Hell) becomes a frigid, barren, frozen, deathly cold wasteland.

When he goes back now to see how the Miami man is doing, he is shocked to discover the man is jumping up and down, and cheering in obvious delight. The devil immediately asks the man what’s going on. To which the Miami man replies…..

Being the loving husband he is, he needs to find a way to keep his wife happy while he is away.

He comes up with an idea and goes to a small odds and ends shop in his city to get what his wife needs. When he walks in he tells the store owner at the counter he needs something to pleasure his wife while he's away. The owner says he has just the thing.

""It's a voodoo dick"", he says, ""It does anything you want on command"".

""How does it work?"", the husband asks.

""To get it to start, you just say, voodoo dick, and then whatever you want it to work upon. To get it to stop you tell it, voodoo dick, stop.""

The husband buys it, and brings it home to his wife before he is about to leave. He tells her she will be fine while he is gone. She asks,

""How?""

The husband says, ""voodoo dick, counter"", and it starts going away at the counter, then he says, ""voodoo dick, pussy"", and the voodoo dick starts plowing his wife. Then he leaves on his trip.

Now, his wife was fine with this for two, maybe three hours, but after awhile everything was starting to go raw and she had to find a way to make it stop. She gets in her car and starts driving for the airport, all the while with the voodoo dick going at it.

He sees a group of rough rider lookin' scoundrels playing poker and he musters up enough courage to sit down with 'em (thinkin' he might get a story out if he was lucky). ""Mind if I play?""

The others look up with a scowl that would curdle milk, but one looks at the clock and shakes his head. He points out the time to the others and they gather up their chips and go. ""Play alone, we're a-leavin'. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""

The writer is confused, but smells a story brewing; a strong one at that. He hoofs it up to the bar, passing most other patrons on their way out, and slaps a whole dollar bill on the table, ""Barkeep, give me a beer and a story, and you can keep the change.""

After taking a quick glance at the clock, the bartender shakes his head, pours the beer, and pushes the bill back to the reporter. ""The drink is on the house, but I suggest you drink it quick and leave. Wild Bill is coming to town."" Without another word the 'tender puts his last glass away and walks right out the swinging doors, leaving the reporter in an empty bar.

Now fear in his gut tears at him as he hears the emptiness in that bar. This emptiness seems to seep in as he realizes that he's about to be the last man in this town, alone with only the sound of that ticking clock to keep him company. Still, a story of this caliber must be worth something; so he waits...

Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, Bong&lt;CRACK!&gt;- Just as the clock strikes the first chime of twelve, a sound like thunder splitting a mountain is heard outside. The reporter runs to the doors to see what it is. In the distance and closing fast is a tornado coming right for the bar. The reporter hits the ground and watches as the tornado comes up to the bar and stops.

The wind settles and there is a giant of a man riding a grizzly bear. He steps off the bear, and instead of hitching it, he punches the great beast right in the face &lt;WHAM!&gt;, knocking it cold on the ground.

The reporter is so scared he runs back into the bar and dives behind the counter, sure that this is the last of his days. &lt;KaPLOW!&gt; the giant kicks in the saloon doors, and they turn to splinters that imbed themselves into the walls and break bottles and glasses that they touch.

The man walks up to the bar, breaking every floor board with each thundering step. He looks down at the reporter and slams his fist on the bar, cracking it down the middle, ""GIMME A DRINK!""

The reporter comes up, shakily holding out two bottles of whisky; which the giant snatches up, chews the glass tops off of, and drinks down as fast as the amber liquid can spill from the bottles. He throws both bottles in the air, whips out his six-shooter and fires off a round. The single bullet rips through both bottles showering the reporter with shards that rain down.

Regretting his curiosity and repenting of his life, the reporter stands on weakened legs and whimpers out, ""W-w-w-would y-you like a-another drink?""

The man turns to him, fire in his eyes, then glances at the clock... ""Nah, I gotta go. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""",High noon,12

Walking slowly, dragging his feet, he finally reaches the bar and sit down. He trows the bag on the next stool unceremoniously and look up, devastated. 


The barman, curious of a man he never saw in his establishment, asked for his order. “ The strongest drink you got “ replied the man with a shaking voice. A glass of whiskey slid over the counter. Three more have been emptied until, after a moment, the barman finally asked “ Why the long face mate, is something happened to you ?”. 


The man looked up from his glass with a sad face. His eyes red and puffy. “ Its.. It's about this...” he said, pointing the small satin bag. 


""What's in the bag"" the barman replied.


The man scoffed, ""what's in the bag..."" he said under his breath. Scratching his head. Looking around distressed, He ultimately reached for the bag with a slow hand. Opened it, and from it pulled a small man. Very small. High as two apple on top of each other. He lifted it and dropped it on the counter.


The barman looked in shock."" What the fuck is that, why he is so small?!"" 


To that, the sad man replied, with a tear rolling on is cheek, "" This... is... Bill..."".


"" Hi!"" said bill.


The barman could not hide his excitement."" He's so small but this dude can talk and walk!.. shit you could be rich with this, why are you so sad !"".


The man now crying silently, reached the bag for a second time and from it he pulled a pristine small black piano. Holding it with both hand, he putted it drunkenly on the bar next to the small Bill person. Bill, visibly very happy, did not waste any second and started playing ""hymn to joy"" on the tiny piano. The man, his face hidden in his hand, cried like a baby.


"" DUDE, why are you crying!"" said the barman. ""Look at what you've got, this guy Bill is a miracle, he plays so well! You should rejoice !""


"" How... how could I? "" Said the man, his face like a river. "" He did NOT understand me correctly!""
