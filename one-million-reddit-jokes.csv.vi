Shrugging his shoulders the boy heads upstairs to use the loo. He knocks on the door to make sure it's empty and hears a shout of pain and the unmistakable sound of a electric shaver. ""Balls"", shouts his dad. The boy then heads downstairs when the doorbell rings. He opens the door only to find two policemen standing at the threshold.

That afternoon, all the local Cowboys tried their best but Blue Steel lived up to his reputation and threw them all off with the greatest of ease. 

As a joke, the organizers then offered the prize to anyone in the crowd who would dare to tangle with such a beast. 

Up jumped Tommy and of course everyone laughed at him. But the organizers decided to let the city boy have a try. 

Blue Steel bucked and lunged but Tommy not only stayed on the horse for 10 seconds but he stayed on for 20 seconds, then 30, then a minute! A few minutes more and Blue Steel was so exhausted he calmed down and Tommy rode him all around the ring like a birthday party pony. 

Everyone was astonished.

One day, the man is in his car on the way home when he gets a call from his wife, who tells him she's just craving it really bad and was going to give it to him the second he gets home.

So he pulls over and starts jerking. Just as he's about to climax he feels a tap on the shoulder. He turns his head to see a cop.

 Blue Steel was famed and renowned throughout the West for being the toughest meanest horse there ever was. He had seen off so many would-be riders that the rodeo organizers had promised $10,000 for anyone who could ride him just for 10 seconds. 

 That afternoon, all the local Cowboys tried their best but Blue Steel lived up to his reputation and threw them all off with the greatest of ease. 

 As a joke, the organizers then offered the prize to anyone in the crowd who would dare to tangle with such a beast. 

 Up jumped Tommy and of course everyone laughed at him. But the organizers decided to let the city boy have a try. 

 Blue Steel bucked and lunged but Tommy not only stayed on the horse for 10 seconds but he stayed on for 20 seconds, then 30, then a minute! A few minutes more and Blue Steel was so exhausted he calmed down and Tommy rode him all around the ring like a birthday party pony. 

 Everyone was astonished.

The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knght with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.

The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.

And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

Anyway, one day he purchased a new milking machine for his cows which promised rapid, efficient delivery of a near-endless supply of dairy goodness by attaching to the cow's udders and gently squeezing and pulling; it was a win-win: the farmer got to sell a lot of milk, and the cows got a pseudo-handjob every day. Even though cows are in fact female.

But the raunchy rancher, naturally, saw the potential in this hi-tech gizmo for some serious fap assistance, and one night, when the animals were all abed and the familiar, calming sound of rednecks shooting each other echoed pleasantly through the cool night air, he snuck down to the cowshed and attached the machine to his manhood. The master milker was now a master bater. Actually, milker still works. Take your pick.

Anyway, the guy's hunch was correct, and he enjoyed nearly 2 hours of pure, unadulterated ecstasy, tarnished only ever-so-slightly by the omnipresent pungent aroma of cow shit. Ten orgasms later, the old perv was spent, and went to remove the machine. However, there was a catch: the device wouldn't come off. The thing was literally welded to his dick, and no amount of pulling was gonna shift it.

Not wanting to spend what few years of his life remained without a schlong, the farmer staggered over to the instruction manual and flipped to the 'help' hotline number. Using his narratively convenient yet anachronistic mobile phone, he rang the manufacturers.

""'Sup."" said the manufacturer.

""Hello,"" said the farmer. ""I've just purchased your new milking machine, and I can't remove it. What the hell do I do?""

""Oh, that'll be the automatic locking mechanism. It's there to make sure it doesn't fall off the cow.""

""Well, how d'you get it off?""

""Easy. *You* don't have to do anything, sir. The machine will automatically disconnect once it has collected 8 gallons."" ",Farmer's Fetish (VERY NSFW),3

Soon a local redneck pulled in, filled his tank and asked for his free sex.

The owner told him to pick a number from 1 to 10. If he guessed correctly he would get his free sex. The redneck guessed 8, and the proprietor said, ""You were close. The number was 7. Sorry. No sex this time.""
A week later, the same redneck, along with a buddy, Bubba, pulled in for another fill-up.

Again he asked for his free sex. The proprietor again asked him to guess the correct number. The redneck guessed 2 this time.

The proprietor said, ""Sorry, it was 3. You were close, but no free sex this time.""

As they were driving away, the redneck said to his buddy, ""I think that game is rigged and he doesn't really give away free sex.""

So, we know that women require time and money. So we can multiply these two: time x money = women

We also know that time is money, so: money x money = money² = women

However, money is at the root of all problems, so we have to replace ""money"" by ""problems"": problems² = women

Finally, we simplify this little equation. Since money is *at the root* of all problems, we take the square root of ""problems²"". Which gives is us our final equation: WOMEN = PROBLEMS

Once he arrived, the dentist immediately understood where the *root* of the pain was from.

The dentist says, ""It's nothing too major, but I'm afraid you have a pretty bad abscess on your tooth. We may have to remove the tooth.""

""That's horrible doc... Am I gonna be ok?""

""Of course you will! Like I said, it's nothing too major, so we just need to pull the tooth, get rid of the abscess, and you'll be as good as new. I'll schedule an appointment for next week to get your tooth extracted. If you feel any worsening pain or think you need medication, come back in and I'll check it out once more!""

""Ok! Thanks Doctor!""

Somewhat upset about this news, George returns home and turns in for the night. The next morning, however, his symptoms started to alter. The pain he was experiencing before was only coming periodically. However, it seemed that anytime a tremor of pain passed through his mouth, George would pass gas. At first, it seemed like a mere coincidence, but as the day went on and his pains came more frequently, George began to notice that he could stop making wind.

Confused about all of this, George falls asleep yet again. Upon waking up, George immediately feels pain on his tooth and, like the day before, cuts the cheese for no reason. However, this time was different. When he farted, it made a strange noise. It almost sounded like his anus was saying ""honda.""

As the day went by, his pains started to become more frequent, and so did his farting. However, it became more clear that every time he would fart, it sounded like someone saying ""honda."" Being utterly confused about all of this, George decides to ask the dentist if everything's ok with him.

""What seems to be the problem George?""

""I don't know doc... Everytime my tooth starts to ache, for some reason, I pass gas for no reason!""

""Hmm... that is strange... Is there anything else out of the ordinary?""

""There is... You probably won't believe this, but whenever I do break wind, it sounds like my butt is saying ""honda"" in a winded voice. I have no idea what this means doc!""

Just as George finishes his sentence, he gets the greatest pain in his mouth that he's had since this whole ordeal started. Immediately after, he rips out a horribly loud one right on the chair in the dentist's office. The word ""honda"" shrieked through the whole office as this excruciating pain crossed through George's body.

""Hmm... It seems this is worse than I originally thought George. But it seems to me that it is true that *abscess makes the fart go honda*.""

An old, bitter looking old man answers the door with a rifle hanging down his right arm. He looks at them and asks ""What you boys want?"" 

They tell him their car broke down, and need to use the phone. 

He responds with ""Ain't no help comin' 'round this time'a night. Y'all could spend the night and help will be here by the mornin'""

They look at each other and agree to stay.

""Course there is one stipulation. You see that girl over there?"" asks the old man with his rifle aimed at the girls direction.

The guys look over with wide eyes and jaws dropped at the direction of a hot, young, blonde girl wearing a crop top plaid shirt, and daisy dukes, standing by the kitchens enterance.  

""That's my promiscuous daughter. You boys gotta agree you ain't gon' try to do anything with her, or I will shoot your dicks off!"" Exclaimed the old man with his rifle now pointing at their dicks. 
""I'm gonna cover my daughters pussy with glitter, and check y'alls dicks in the mornin' to make sure y'all stayed true to y'alls word."" The old man said.

They nod their head in agreement and walk into the house. 

The daughter prepares a small meal for the guys and goes off to her room. The old man then shows the three guys over to their room and reminds them of their agreement.

To the old mans surprise, there was no glitter on his dick.
""Well, I'll be damned! You're one of the good men that stays true to his word! Good job, boy, I'm proud of ya!""

There was this old grandfather in Moscow who was a little confused. His neighbors knew that, so when they saw him standing outside his door with an empty shopping bag, they tried to help:

""Grandpa, what are you doing?""

""Ah, sorry, I forgot. Do you know if I'm going out shopping or have I already returned?""

They could tell him that he wasn't away yet, so he went to see if the butcher had any meat today. But the butcher said:

""Grandpa, you're confused again. We don't have any milk, the butcher without any meat is across the street.""

So the grandpa asked around and heard that another butcher had just received a shipment. He went there, but discovered that there was already a line around the block. There was no choice but to stand in line as well.

A few hours later, as the grandpa was almost at the front, the butcher shouted that there is nothing left. The grandpa had enough at this point. He started to yell:

""I fought in the Revolution under Lenin and again defended our Motherland when Hitler marched in! And yet we poor people have nothing?! This is an outrage!""

A few soldiers overheard him and pulled him aside.

""Grandpa, if Stalin would be still alive, we'd shoot you on the spot for your yelling. Just calm down and go home. There's nothing you can do here.""

The grandpa grumbles a bit, but agrees to calm down and return home. He safely arrives and his wife sees him returning empty-handed:

""So, they didn't have any meat today again?""

He awnsers:

""It's gotten even worse. The butcher not only didn't have any meat, the soldiers didn't have any bullets either!""",Trying to buy things in Soviet Russia.,0

The Englishman requests a year's supply of cigarettes, so he's given the cartons and he too is locked up.

One day while at home watching TV, his phone rings and he answers it.  A deep, slow voice says to him ""the viper is coming..."", and then hangs up before the man has any chance to respond.  He thinks it was pretty strange, but he figures it must just be some kids playing a bad prank or something.

Half an hour later, his phone rings again.  He answers it, and the same voice as before says ""the viper is getting closer..."".  Then the phone hangs up just as before.  The man is now a little bit nervous.  Clearly someone is trying to scare him.

He puts it out of his mind, but no less than 10 minutes later his phone rings again.  He hesitates, then answers it, and hears the voice tell him ""the viper is almost here!"".

""Who are you?!"" the man shouts into the phone, but it was too late.  The line was already dead.  The man is very upset now and considers calling the police, but decides against it.  He calms himself down, but 5 minutes later, the phone rings once more.

""The viper has come!""

The man, now terrified, changes his mind and decides to call the police, but as he's dialing the number, he hears a knock at the door.  He get's up, and slowly walks towards the door.  His hands are sweaty and his heart is racing.  When he reaches the door, he hesitates for a moment - then reaches for the doorknob and pulls the door open.

Standing there is a short man wearing lederhosen who exclaims ""Hello!  I am ze vindow viper!  I've come to vipe your vindows!""",This was my grandma's favorite joke,3

The Fuhrer has a 99% approval rating. What is the approval rating of Neville Chamberlain?! You Deutscher-phobes hate Hitler because he is the only one capable of standing up to Western capitalism &amp; the Jew. 

Because of Hitler, the German economy is now stronger than ever. Austria &amp; Czechoslovakia have wisely switched to using the German Mark &amp; that scares the West. The petro-pound will collapse soon while the Mark will only increase in value.

How can the West even criticize Germany when Great Britain is ruled by a QUEEN? Whatabout British terrorism, such as World War 1? They overthrew the legitimate leader of Germany, Kaiser Wilhelm II, after killing tens of millions of Native Europeans!

The 1.5 million panzer-vacationeers held a referendum &amp; the West should respect that. Let the people of Silesia &amp; Danzig choose their Lebensraum. If the Pole minority wants to remain living in Poland, they can ethnically cleanse themselves to it. 

The League of Nations sanction Germany for annexing ancient German land, but what do they say about the British EMPIRE? More like League of ZIONISTS. Read The Protocols of Zion if you don't believe me.

- Beulah McDillycutty, Texas
 
--------------------------------

The Polish junta started all of this by attacking Volk just because they spoke German. Prussians are but simple coal miners &amp; truck drivers defending their homeland, while the fascist Polkrops prepare Blitzkrieg. 

Remember when Western news claimed invisible U-boats violated their waters &amp; sunk their ships? Allied propaganda lies like this all the time. I trust Himmler &amp; German state press to question more and tell me what is really happening.

There is no proof the Wehrmacht is invading. The Waffen SS can't control what their Schutzstaffel do on vacation. Those Aryan volunteers &amp; freedom fighters liberated those Panzer IIIs &amp; MP-40s from the Pollock invaders. Wake up, sheeple! Why would Germany want a war on 2 fronts?

Hitler personally rebuilt the Wehrmacht because the West seeks to surround them with the Maginot Line. Think about who benefits from global war. This is all part of the international Jew's plan to divide Germany &amp; take its resources.

The West has always planned to start World War 2 &amp; if they do they will lose because German technology is better. By 1945, the West will disentergrate &amp; the Reich will last for a thousand years.

Recently a routine police patrol parked outside a local pub. Late in the evening the officer noticed a man leaving the bar so intoxicated that he could barely walk.

The man stumbled around the car park for a few minutes, with the officer quietly observing.

After what seemed an eternity and trying his keys on five vehicles, the man managed to find his car which he fell into. He sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off. Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off (it was a fine dry night) flicked the indicators on, then off, tooted the horn and then switched on the lights. He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little and then remained stationery for a few more minutes as some more vehicles left.

At last he pulled out of the car park and started to drive slowly down the road. The police officer, having patiently waited all this time, now started up the patrol car, put on the flashing lights, promptly pulled the man over and carried out a breathalyzer test. To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence of the man having consumed alcohol at all! 

Dumbfounded, the officer said ""I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyzer equipment must be broken.""

""I doubt it"", said the man, ""tonight I'm the designated decoy.""",The Designated D,56

He then goes on even longer about how he is going to be feeding homeless people, building schools, etc etc, for the rest of the day. After the service is over, he actually goes and plays golf for the day.

And he does this routine every single Sunday.

After a few months of this, some angels who have been watching the priest get fed up and go to God about it. They say, ""Hey God, so this guy has been lying to his congregation over and over again about how they should be helping people while he just plays golf, could you please curse him or something?"" And He replies, ""Alright , watch this.""

The following Sunday, the priest goes through the same song and dance. He preaches about helping other people, then goes and plays golf. On the first hole, he hits the ball and he gets a hole in one! He's absolutely amazed by this, and goes to the next hole. This time, he hits way off, but the ball miraculously curves a full 90 degrees and goes straight into the hole again! The priest is even more amazed, he's never gotten a hole-in-one before, let alone two! As he goes through the course, he keeps getting hole-in-one after hole-in-one, ending his day with a full 18 holes-in-one! Feeling incredibly happy with himself, he goes home feeling great.

Meanwhile, the angels watching the priest go back to God once again. ""What was that for!? He's been lying to his congregation over and over again, and you bless him with a prefect game of golf!?""

God replies, ""Who's he gonna tell?""",A priest goes golfing.,149

Of course, you have Erectile Dyslexia. One part of your body is confused about being another part.

It’s terminal. You should leave your money to The Erectile Dyslexia Foundation. I have a couple of accounts here.

Maybe I just need a vacation.

Denial is the first phase.

You mind if I get a second opinion?

I’ll give you another one. You have Mobius Monetary Dementia. You think everything loops around somehow back to money.

Seems like that’s how things are going.

I rest my case. Do you need a third opinion?

No!  Thanks.  Is this terminal too?

Not at all. It’s infinite.

The boys seldom show interest. It is her deepest, greatest desire to be tall, not only tall but to have a model's frame. She prays devoutly every night before going to sleep, and one day an angel appears in her dreams and instructs her to go to the next town over, and seek the midget who lives there.

""Once you find him propose marriage to him. He will say no, and each time he does, you will instantly grow 3 inches.""

The girl, skeptical but still more desperate, seeked the midget the next day. Indeed there he was, short, stout and with a mean grimace smeared like peanut butter from jaw to jaw, and once the girl asked for his hand in marriage he yelped a defiant ""No!"" and marched off in a huff.

And wouldn't you know it, the girl had, indeed, grown three inches. Ecstatic from the results, she revisited the midget the next day, and the next, each time boldly rejected with a simply ""No!"" but growing another six inches for her trouble.

Now standing at a proud 5 foot 9, the girl pondered whether she should make one last visit. Her height was now certainly more than adequate, but what she truly longed was to have a grand physique, to be statuesque. So the girl, in high spirits, made one last trek across town to the grouchy midget.

""Kind sir, would you please accept my proposal of marriage?""

All of a sudden, POOF! In a flash and puff of smoke, a little old woman appeared.

She yelled, “I’m Mother Nature! Do you know how long it took me to make those buttercups?

Just for doing what you have done, you won’t have any butter for your popcorn for the rest of your life.

Better still, you won’t have any butter for your toast for the rest of your life.

As a matter of fact, you’ll never have any butter for anything for the rest of your life!!!”

Then POOF! she was gone!

After Joe recovered from the shock, he hollered for his friend, “Bill, where are you?”

Bill yells back, “I’m over here in the pussywillows.”

Joe shouts back, ‘DON’T SWING, BILL. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON’T SWING !

His corn, his carrots, his peas...all are either dead or far too blighted to sell. As he strolls through his fields, he sees that a number of his beets are just healthy enough, but still suffering. He gathers them up and puts them in large baskets. He puts the baskets on a cart and heads into town, hoping to sell or trade his blighted beets. On the way to town, the wheel of his cart breaks and he can no longer pull it. He gathers the large baskets in his arms and continues down the road. Once he gets into town, no one will buy his beets from him, saying that they will not buy such ailed vegetables. He begins to worry that he will have no money or food for his family. In that town, there was a guild where many local farmers could sell and trade their goods with ease and better connections. However, these special benefits and connections were only available to members of the guild. The farmer was not a member of the guild, but, in desperation, he picked up his baskets of blighted beets and headed for the guild's meeting hall. On the way there, he tripped and tore large holes in his baskets. He gathered up all his beets in his arms and continued on, taking care not to let any of his cargo slip from his grasp. When he reached the doors of the hall, a large man in a uniform stopped him from entering. ""Are you a member of this club?"" the large man asked. ""No,"" replied the farmer. ""But I simply must sell my beets! The rest of my crops have died and these are the only ones I have left!"" The beets were beginning to feel very heavy and the farmer was not sure if he could hold on to them. ""I'm sorry, but only club members are allowed in,"" said the large man. In desperation, the farmer cried out, ""You gotta let me in the club before I drop these sick beets!""",A farmer's crops are destroyed by a horrible blight...,2

There were 22 of them living in a small shack in Detroit, with the rest of the extended family too far and also too poor to give any aid. What's worse, only 4 of them were employed, so there were four incomes paying for 22 peoples food. 

The Gregg's tale came to an end one cloudy saturday. all 22 were found dead in their home. It seemed a carbon monoxide leak had caused their demise. The rest of the extended family was heartbroken, but vowed to give them the most dignified funeral they were able to.

Unfortunately, the entire family's net worth was only enough to buy one very large coffin. The family attempted to make do, which turned out to be a horrible mistake.

On the day of the funeral, all 22 ex-Gregg's were shoved into that coffin and brought to church. as the family mourned and the priest was about to speak, the wheeled cart (remember: poor people, poor church) that the coffin was on suddenly started rolling and no one could stop it. Out it went, into the street, where it caused a massive traffic accident which yielded many less casualties than it appeared at first, since many of the bodies at the scene were Gregg's that had flown out of their coffin.

This all just goes to show, however...You should never put all your Gregg's in one casket.",The tragic tale of the Gregg Family.,1

I'm telling you, the public's never gonna go for it."" 

A year later Jimmy informed him that things at the factory were going very well. ""Come on up and check it out, Dad,"" he urged. ""Oh, and by the way, you were right about that ad campaign.

""Well, doctor, I have this very young, very sexually demanding wife, and she just can't seem to keep her hands off of me. As soon as I come home from work she drags me to bed and pounces on me, and after dinner it's round two. Otherwise she's restless and can't get to sleep. She likes to wake me up with a handjob, too, because she's afraid that if she doesn't sexually exhaust me I might start looking at other women.

Well, the thing is, every morning I get on the same train to work, and there's this redhead that takes the same one every day. About a year ago we started talking, and one thing lead to another and now we sneak into the bathroom every morning and bang each other's brains out.

So when I get to the office, you see, I've got this new lady boss that's really tough on the staff; as soon as she took over she started laying people off left and right. But the thing is she seems to have a sweet spot for me, and started calling me into her office and asking me to perform some pretty awkward tasks until we just started to full-on bang each other, and now I'm scared I'll lose my job if I try to break it off.

So by lunch time I'm usually pretty tired, but the thing is, there's this really sweet blonde that works at the diner I like to go to, and she's always so nice and cheerful, and always slips me a piece of cake, on the house. It's carrot cake, too, and you see, I like carrot cake, so I thought it'd be kind of rude to tell her no when she started coming on to me. So now every day at lunch time, we have a quickie in alley behind.""

In fact , the 15-word joke is so funny it took him 6hours to simply resist laughing to get it down on to his small red piece of paper.

In his enthusiastic state he rushes to his car , to get to the nearest law office. Surely he thinks , he can license the rights to this joke. Along the way he can't stop thinking of the fortune he's going to make. As he's arrived at the office he storms through the enters doors .
""I must speak to your best lawyer, NOW!"" 


The receptionist slightly overwhelmed  replies ""Sir , all lawyers are unavailable simply upon request and must be met with through an appointment.""  
""Listen lady"" he says ""Either I meet with a lawyer or you meet my fist""

The receptionist now worried, escorts him to the best lawyer they have . 
As soon as he sees the lawyer he says ""I have joke and it's essential that I patent it.""
""You don't 'patent' a joke"" the lawyer replies , ""you have the right to give someone authority to copy or display your work if you're the author""

Overcome by this news the man thinks of the best possible way to submit his joke and prove he's the author. Then paranoia kicks in, he's just told a lawyer he about his joke..he has to kill him he think or he'll surely try and steal it. After thinking about it he reasons with himself and decide he can't kill him , it'd cause too many problems.

So spontaneously he grabs the nearest pen and starts writing on the wall.
""Hey!"" The lawyer yells ""What are you doing!"" 
It's too late , the lawyer began to read  the joke on the wall and started laughing.

The man smiled and thought to himself that it should keep the lawyer and whoever else in this firm who tries to read it pacified in laughter for a few hours.

The man rushed to his car and knew where he had to go next. A local news studio. He sped off and arrived at the studio within 20minutes.
He looked at his watch and couldn't believe how perfectly it worked out , he had arrived just before the were going to go live.

He walks up to the door the find that it's locked, angered he begins banging on the door. 
About a minute later he's greeted two security guards.
He tries to run by them but fails , they grab him by each arm and begin walking away from the building , he has an idea . He'll break them with his joke, he begins to say it when he they throw him to the ground , knocking him unconscious.


He wakes up not knowing how long he was out for, but long enough to assume he missed his chance to hit live television.

He's not going to let 20 years of his life go to waste, he decides that president Obama needs to hear it. 

Racing off once again he is soon greeted by flashing lights. 

The man thinking the receptionist back at the firm must have sent the cop after him , holds on to the joke tightly.

As the cop steps in front of the mans door , he asks ""Do you have any idea how fast you were going?""

""I need to get there."" Replies the man  ""I know why you're here."" The man begins to get emotional.

""Get where?""

""To the w-w-hite-house"" says the man with a frog is his throat while thinking of how much a disaster this is and no one will even recognize him as owner of the joke.

""What's that you've got in your hand? Do you have any Idea how far the whitehouse is sir, it's almost a 5 day drive? Are you on any type of medication at this time?""

The man looks up at the officer almost crying ""It's my joke!"" He yells  ""I just don't know anymore ..."" the man cries "" I was going there but now I'm not and now it's just all one big mess..., you've got to help me officer"" he continues to cry 

""I don't know where I'm going with this joke.""

Three Generals and an Admiral are sitting in the O Club at Los Alamitos JFTB. They're trying to prove which branch has the bravest men. 

The Marine General says, We got the bravest. 

Prove it, say the others. 

So they hop up to 29 Palms &amp; head out to the range. 

The Marine General walks up to a Lance Corporal &amp; says, Marine, charge that machine gun! 

Aye, aye sir! comes the reply. 

When the lcpl follows his orders, he's immediately turned to swiss cheese. 

The Marine General looks back &amp; says, That takes bravery. 

BS, say the others. 

The Army General says,We got the bravest. 

Prove it. 

So they hop up to Ft Irwin NTC &amp; head for a motor pool. There they find a soldier ground guiding M1A2s out. 

The Army General walks up to the soldier &amp; says, Stop that tank. 

Yes, sir! comes the reply. 

The soldier runs up in front of the tank &amp; is quickly turned into a meat waffle by the tracks. 

Now, THAT takes bravery! says The Army General. 

BS, hes told. 

The Air Force General says, We got the bravest. And I CAN prove it! 

So they hop down to March AFB &amp; head out to the flight line. Theres an F-15 taxing toward the runway. 

The Air Force General walks up to a young airman &amp; says, Stop that plane.

Will do, sir, comes the reply. 

So the airman runs out to the runway in front of the plane , gets sucked-up into the intake, and is promptly spewed out of the exhaust as fish food. 

THATS bravery! says the Air Force General. 

The Admiral just starts laughing. Navy men are the REAL bravest! Follow me, says the Admiral. 

So they hop down to San Diego Naval Base &amp; head for a pier with a carrier moored to it. 

As they walk down the pier, the Admiral spots a pitiful excuse for a sailor, sitting on a fuel can, smoking a cigarette. His Dungarees look like they were pulled out of the refuse. His Boondockers look like they were shined with a hot Hershey bar. He has no cover on. And it appears that his razor ran away from home. 

The Admiral walks up to the sailor &amp; says, Go change all the lights on the island structure. 

The sailor notices that the ship is rocking back &amp; forth in the current. He looks at the Admiral &amp; says, SCREW YOU! 

The Admiral looks back at the Generals &amp; says, Now, THAT takes bravery!",Bravest (US) armed service,0

""Well, as a matter of fact, I have a great reason"", the man says. ""You see, I was working out on my balcony on the 25th floor, when I lost my balance and fell over the edge. Luckily, I managed to grab a hold of the railing on the balcony below. As I was hanging there, though, a man came running out from inside and started hitting my hands with a hammer. I fell down, but by some stroke of luck, I landed in some soft bushes and survived. Seconds later, however, a fridge thrown from the 24th floor hit me and killed me.

""That is one good reason”, Saint Peter admits, and let's the man in.

Shortly after, another man arrives and knocks on the pearly gates. Again, there's no answer, but after some time of persistent knocking, Saint Peter appears.

""We're extremely busy at the moment. Unless you have a really good reason why I should let you in, you'll have to come back another day"" he explains again.

The man replies: ""I have a very good reason! You see, I came home early from work today to surprise my wife, whom I suspect is cheating on me with another man. I barged into our apartment, ran to the bedroom where, true enough, my wife was lying naked in the bed. I search everywhere for her lover – the bathroom, the closets, the kitchen, until finally I see him hanging, half undressed from the balcony. Now, we live on the 24th floor, and I grab a hammer and start hitting his hands. He looses his grip and falls down. By some stroke of luck, the fall doesn't kill him, so I grab my fridge, carry it to the balcony, and throw it over the edge. Unfortunately, the physical exhaustion was too much, and I died of a heart attack seconds later.

""That is actually a pretty good reason”, Saint Peter says. ""Thou shalt not commit adultery, and justice was served”. He let's the man in.

Shortly after, a third man arrives, knocks on the pearly gates, but just like with the other two men, there's no answer. He knocks and knocks until finally Saint Peter shows up.

""We're extremely busy at the moment. Unless you have a really good reason why I should let you in, you'll have to come back later"" he explains, now slightly aggravated.
