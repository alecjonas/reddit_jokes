tches and sighs. ""Well, it all started during the war in Afghanistan. I was in the K9 corps, providing support for mission specialists engaged in secret ops. I'd always been able to understand English, I just never felt a need to talk about it. Anyway, one night during an intense firefight, I got separated from my unit, and walked into a Taliban encampment. Being a dog, of course, they ignored my presence. I soon realized that I could understand the Pashto language as well. So I listened to their plans and then made my way across enemy lines, dodging a few rounds along the way until I reached my unit. Unfortunately, my handler had been hit and there wasn't anyone alive to call it in. So I got on the radio, called in the medivac and relayed the plans I had heard from the Taliban. They were able to medivac my handler back to safety, but realizing that I was a talking dog, they had me run covert ops for a couple of years until too many people knew my identity. Then, they retired me with a silver star and full military honors, and now here I am, enjoying my retirement.""
The guy had listened to the dog's story with his mouth hanging open, simply astonished by the exploits he was hearing. ""Give me just a sec"", he says to the dog and bolts back around the house to where the old man is still rocking on the porch. The old man looks up and asks the guy, ""Heard enough to want to take him?"" ""Hell yes!"" answered the guy, ""just one question. This dog could be worth millions. Why are you just giving him away for free?"" The old man glances around to make sure no one is listening then leans over to the guy. ""Because he's a big fucking liar. He didn't do any of that shit.""",A guy is walking past a house...,33

Screaming down the road at 110 miles per hour the man looks down and sees the chicken is right there with him. The salesman comes to a crossroads and blows right through it. The chicken turned left.

The salesman slams on the brakes. He's sliding all over the road, in and out of the ditch, before finally coming to a stop about a mile down the road. He takes a moment to breath and calm himself, and heads back toward the crossroad to follow the chicken. He turns right and follows the road to a farmhouse, with the farmer sitting on the porch. The salesman gets out of the car, comes to the base of the porch and says, ""Excuse me mister, but I have something of an odd question for you. Did you happen to see a chicken come by here?"" The farmer nods once, ""Why yes sir, I did."" ""Alright, this is going to sound crazy, but did that chicken have three legs?""
Farmer nods again, ""Why yes sir, it did."" The salesman got excited. ""Where did it come from? Who owns it? How did it get three legs?"" The farmer stands up and says, ""well sir, follow me and I'll tell you."" The farmer starts to walk around the side of the house. ""You see, here there's just me, the missus, and the boy. And we all like chicken. And the leg is our favorite part. So, it only made sense for us to breed a three legged chicken.""

So, a road with one lane going north and one going south becomes a two-lane highway. But, they get you where you want to go super fast and very rarely crash.

One day, an American businessman lands in Cairo and soon gets into a cab. He tells the driver which hotel he’s staying in and then leans back in his chair and pulls out his phone. He just starts to check his email when the driver starts up the car and immediately starts flying out of the airport.

The businessman drops his phone and tries to hold onto anything he can, suddenly aware of the fact that there are no seatbelts. The cab driver alternates between assuring him he’ll get him to his hotel quickly and cussing out the other drivers on the road. Then another car comes out of nowhere, they crash, and everyone involved is instantly killed.

The American finds himself at the pearly gates standing before St. Peter, who says to him “I’m sorry, but because of your shady business practices I can’t let you into heaven.”

He drops his head, but he mostly understands. But then he sees his Egyptian cab driver go up to St. Peter and lo and behold the cab driver is welcomed into heaven with open arms and celebration.

The businessman is dumbfounded, so he goes back to St. Peter and says, “Why’d you let that guy in? I may have been shady but I also did some nice things for the poor. But that guy was the worst of the worst! He smoked, I could tell he drank, he swore every other word, and his lousy driving is what got me killed!”

St. Peter replies, “If you knew how many people came to God in the back of his car, you’d let him in too!”",Egyptian cab drivers are kinda crazy...,0

pullets and ten roosters to fertilize the eggs.  


She kept records and any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and  
was replaced.  


This took a lot of time, so she bought some tiny bells and attached them to  
her roosters. Each bell had a different tone, so she could tell from a  
distance which rooster was performing. Now, she could sit on the porch and  
fill out an efficiency report by just listening to the bells.  


Sarah's favorite rooster, old Butch, was a very fine specimen but, this  
morning she noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all! When she went to  
investigate, she saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets,  
bells-a-ringing, but the pullets hearing the roosters coming, would run for  
cover.  


To Sarah's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't  
ring.     He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job, and walk on to the next  
one.  


Sarah was so proud of old Butch, she entered him in a Show and he became an  
overnight sensation among the judges.  


The result was the judges not only awarded old Butch the ""No Bell Peace  
Prize"" they also awarded him the ""Pulletsurprise"" as well. ",Fowl humor,16

One of them happened to have an exceptional talent for this, and while training this dog, several notorious local drug dealers had already been caught. Eventually, the dog was assigned to a cop, and the cop named the dog ""Karma"" seeing as it was bringing criminals what they deserved.

Now, some neighborhood drug dealers weren't particularly happy about this. Even the biggest drug lords had caught wind of this. Karma had busted them more times in the last three months than they had been caught in the previous year. After all, Karma had exceptional talents with this business. Thus, Sneaky Steve and Dealer Dave, two of the most notorious drug lords in the area, devised a clever plan to stop Karma from busting them so much. During a raid, Dave shot Karma three times in the leg. The dog was going to be out of commission forever. Dave thought he was successful, but out of his window, he heard the policemen saying:

""Look, if we can't use Karma, then maybe at least Karma's pups could be of use. Maybe they have the same talents.""

""Sir, Karma has no pups.""

""Well... we'll have to change that.""

Dave and Steve realized that there was only one way to stop this - steal the dog and then remove its... certain organs. Late one night, Steve and Dave went down to the police department, evaded several officers, and took Karma out of the kennel. Steve, being the sneaky one he was, managed to get Karma to not bark the whole time, and Dave had brought a long switchblade to accomplish their mission.

Outside the station, in an alleyway, Steve held the dog down.

""Dave, what's taking you so long? Just cut 'is nuts off and we can get out of here!""

""Steve... I'm having a few unforeseen difficulties with this.""

""Dave, this isn't that complicated. Just slice it off!""

""It's impossible, okay!""

John goes first and fails the test, as he cannot bear the thought of killing his wife. Dan goes next and fails, for the same reasons as John.

It is now Sarah's turn and she heads inside the room. The door shuts. Gunfire is heard, followed by shouts of frustration. Banging on the walls ensues. A few minutes later, Sarah emerges from the room, wipes the sweat from her forehead, and says:

Tearfully, she replies, ""I'm going to commit suicide!""

While he didn't want to appear 'sensitive,' George also didn't want to miss this 'be-a-hero' opportunity either, so he asked, ""Well, before you jump, honey-babe, why don't you give ol' George here your best last kiss?""

So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that ... and it was a long, deep, lingering 
kiss followed immediately by another even better one.

After they breathlessly finished, George gets big thumbs-up of approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, ""Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had, honey! That's a real talent you're wasting, sugar shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why are you committing suicide?""

""My parents don't like me dressing like a girl.""

post,a2a2m9,2qh72,jokes,false,1543722805,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/a2a2m9/the_squire_joke/,self.jokes,,"There was once a faraway kingdom near a lake. When the king died, he portioned up his kingdom for his three sons. The eldest received the most prime piece of land and control of the king's 10 finest knights, each with 10 fine squires. The second son received a decent piece of land and command of the king's 5 pretty okay knights and their 5 pretty okay squires. The youngest received a small parcel of land and the king's oldest, weakest knight and his scrawny but cunning squire.

But what to do with the lake? The king forgot to portion up this fine piece of real estate in his will! The brothers argued amongst themselves over how to divide up control of the lake, but no agreement could be reached, and soon all three brothers sent their armies marching towards the lake to seize control.

Well...

The night before the conflict, the eldest brother's army of 10 knights, each with 10 squires, felt confident in their victory, and all the knights drank heavily in celebration of their anticipated triumph.

The middlest brother's army knew they'd have a tough time of it, and so all the knights sparred and exercised in preparation.

The youngest brother's lone, aged knight knew he had no chance, until his cunning squire came to him with a plan. The squire had spoken with an old witch and acquired a recipe for a legendary potion that would give one man the strength of a hundred and twenty five men. The squire brewed the potion and hung the cauldron from a nearby tree from a rope to cool until the morning.

Well...

Morning came, and the squires of all three armies realized that their plans had gone awry.

The eldest brother's knights were all far too hungover to fight.

The middlest brother's knights were all far too sore from their sparring to fight.

And the youngest brother's lone, aged knight had passed quietly in his sleep!

The squires decided they each had no choice but to fight in their knights' places! So the 100 fine squires of the eldest brother's army strapped on their knight's weapons and armor and headed to the battlefield.

The middlest brother's 25 squires reluctantly armed themselves as well and headed off.

And the youngest brother's scrawny but cunning squire took the pot down from where he'd hung it the night before, drank deeply of the potion within, and instantly felt his muscles swell, his senses heighten, and his skills enhance. Grabbing his knight's rusty weapons and armor, he charged off to meet the other squires in battle.

Well...

The battle raged on for hours, and when it finally ended, the result was horrifying. Bodies lay strewn about every which way and the air was thick with the scent of blood. And yet, standing over the carnage, mortally wounded but with his head held high, was the cunning squire of the youngest brother...

...proving once and for all that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal the the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",The Squire Joke,3

It booms ""You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes.""

The first guy immediately blurts out ""I want a billion dollars."" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 300 billion.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. The first guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

The second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

The third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

The first guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him anymore.

The second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

The third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going.

The first guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.""

The second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

The third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says: ""Guys, I think I fucked up.""",Best joke probably ever,99

kingdoms. 

The first kingdom was wealthy and was filled with prosperous people, the second kingdom was more humble, but had its fair share of wealth and power. However, the third kingdom was small and barely had an army. 

One day the kingdoms decided to battle for control of the lake. The first kingdom prepared 100 knights clad In their finest armour, each with an individual squire. The second kingdom prepared 50 knights with leather and chainmail and a few dozen squires. The third kingdom had an elderly knight with his personal squire. 

The night before the big battle, the knights from the first kingdom went out and drunk late into the night with the finest ale they could buy. The second kingdom did the same but with cheaper wine and ale. However, the third kingdom’s squire tied some rope into a noose and hung it on a tall tree. The squire then hung a pot from the noose and cooked a stew for himself and the knight. 

The next morning, the knights from the first and second kingdom were too hungover and the knight from the third kingdom was too weary. The squires then took their place. It was a long battle but in the end only one squire remained. The squire from the third kingdom.


And it just goes to show that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",The Three Kingdoms,40

Hearing this, the nurse cracked a big smile and replied ""No, you silly Goose, they brought you here yesterday!""

post,a285la,2qh72,jokes,false,1543707599,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/a285la/a_man_wakes_up_in_a_dingy_slum_with_no_memory_of/,self.jokes,,"A man wakes up in a dingy slum, with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.  

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""  

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.  

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""  

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.  

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.  

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""  

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.  

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""  

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.  

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.  

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.  

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused. ""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.  

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""","A man wakes up in a dingy slum, with no memory of how he got there...",16

""Oh yeah?"" Retorted Wendy as she shook out her hat and sauntered to the window. With a flick of her wrist, she pointed her wand outside.

""Tsk, is that all you got?"" Meredith smirked.

But a moment later the storm clouds cleared away, and the sun was shining. With an extra wave, a rainbow appeared.

When Meredith was about to concede, she was interrupted-

""You two have NOTHING on me!""

Both witches sighed. *Karen*. 

""Watch THIS!"" 

Karen began to twirl around the room, waving her wand wildly in the air. After five minutes, she stood dramatically still before tapping the wand on her forehead. 

""Is that all-""

The two other witches winced as a flash of light filled the room. A moment later,  Karen was gone. 

""Where did she go?"" Wendy said, looking around the room.

""Why question a good thing?""

But it was then that Wendy noticed a gold coin on the ground. Picking it up, she flipped it over in her hands. ""Meredith you might want to see this...""

On the tails side was an inscription reading ""World's Best Witch"". On the other was a smug portrait of Karen.

Jane was a first time contestant on the $100,000 quiz show. Lady luck had smiled in her favor, as Jane had a gained substantial lead over her  opponents. She even managed to win the game but, unfortunately, time had  run out before the show's host could ask her the big question.

Jane  agreed to return the following day. Jane was nervous as her husband  drove them home. ""I've just gotta win tomorrow. I wish I knew what the  answers are! You know I'm not going to sleep at all tonight. I will  probably look like garbage tomorrow.""

""Relax honey,"" her husband, Roger, reassured her, ""It will all be OK.""

Ten  minutes after they arrived home, Roger grabbed the car keys and started  heading out the door. ""Where are you going?"" Jane asked.

""I have a little errand to run. I should be back soon.""

After  an agonizing three-hour absence, Roger returned, sporting a very wide  and wicked grin. ""Honey, I managed to get tomorrow's question and answer!""

""What is it?"" she cried excitedly.

""OK. The  question is 'What are the three main parts of the male anatomy?' And the  answer is 'The head, the heart, and the penis.' "" The couple went to  sleep with Jane, now feeling at ease, plummeting into a deep slumber.

At  3:30 a.m., however, Jane was shaken awake by Roger, who was asking her  the quiz show question. ""The head, the heart, and the penis,"" Jane  replied groggily before returning to sleep. And Roger asked her again in  the morning, this time as Jane was brushing her teeth. Once again, Jane  replied correctly.

So it was that Jane was once again on the set of the quiz show. Even though she knew the question and answer, she  could feel butterflies. The cameras began running and the host, after reminding the audience of the previous day's events, faced Jane and asked the big question.

""Jane, for $100,000, what are the main parts of the male anatomy? You have ten seconds.""

""Hmm, uhm, the head?"" she said nervously.

""Very good. Six seconds.""

""Eh, uh, the heart?""

""Very good! Four seconds.""

""I, uhh, ooooooohh, darn! My husband drilled it into me last night and I had it on the tip of my tongue this morning...""

""That's close enough!"" said the game show host, ""CONGRATULATIONS You've won!!""

Following the voice he finds a man fallen into his trapping pit.

The man says: ""Oh boy friend, am I glad to see you! Please, could you help me out of this hole I fell into?""

The trapper helps him out of the pit.

Man asks: ""How can I repay you for saving me?""

Trapper thinks a bit and says: ""Well, times are kind of tough right now, the animals are scarce and rare to find, so I could always use some spare cash for supplies and food and a rare bottle of booze.""

The man replies: ""Well, friend, you know, I feel it is not right to  just give you some money. This may help right now, but when it is spent you will be in the same situation in the long run. But this is your lucky day. I am the CEO of Chrysler Corporation and I bet that if I put in a good word for you, you will land a well-paying job as a welder. It should be quite easy, you can learn it on-site and it pays well.""

&amp;#x200B;

So the trapper travels to Detroit with the CEO who lands him the job. As he goes to personnel office to finish the deal he is asked to sign the contract.

Unfortunately he tells them that he cannot write.

The HR department (who have no idea about the deal with the CEO) tell him that they are unable to hire a person who has not even learned to sign his name. So he returns home and continues to make his living as a trapper.

&amp;#x200B;

A decade later he again finds a man fallen into his trapping pit. (This time it is a different man of course)

Again he helps him out and the man asks how could he repay the trapper.

And, again, he opts to ask for some money.

&amp;#x200B;

This time the man is a billionaire (bitcoin or Apple stocks or whatever, does not matter from the storytelling point, the trapper did not bother to  ask), so he simply takes his checkbook and writes him a check for a million dollars pronto.

The trapper goes to the bank on his first opportunity and wants to cash the check.

The clerk prepares the paperwork and asks for the trapper to sign them.

The trapper tells her: ""I'm sorry dear, I cannot write, I have never learned how""

The clerk says in wonder: Wow, you are a millionaire and can't even write down your own name! Think where you might be if you could write!""

&amp;#x200B;

The trapper answers: ""Hell, girl, I know exactly where I would be. In Detroit, a welder in a Chrysler factory.""

Needless to say, he was disappointed. The place was empty, and the prices were simply ridiculous. Each combo meal there had been pretty expensive, and you could probably get more at any other generic fast food.

He approached the counter, where a bored looking young man stood behind the cashier.

""Welcome to Chezzy's, what can i get for you?"" the young man drawled.

Jack was rather irritated with his attitude, but he decided to give a chance. Perhaps this man was just demoralized by the lack of customers.

""The things here are a little on the pricey side, is there really no way to get a discount of sorts? That might well be the reason as to why there aren't any customers coming in.""

The young man sighed.

""I've tried telling the owners a couple of times already, but the same replies keep coming back. No can do, sorry.""

Just then, the manager of the restaurant happened to come into the store, and Jack pounced at the opportunity.

""You are the manager right? I think you should tone down the prices a bit if you want more business coming in. What do you say?"" Jack grinned. 

The manager was at his wits end, as business had indeed been poor.

""I'll tell you what, I'll offer you a good deal for the first three combo meals. It'll be cheaper than a combo meal on it's own.""

Jack got excited. ""I'm listening.""

On her way home, she stops at a news stand to buy a newspaper.  Before leaving, she says to the clerk, ‘I hope you don’t mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?”.

‘About 32,’ is the reply.’

‘Nope! I’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily. 

A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.

The girl replies, ‘I’d guess about 29.’  The woman replies with a big smile, ‘Nope, I’m 50.’

Now she’s feeling really good about herself.  She stops at a candy shop on her way down the street.

She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.

The clerk responds, ‘Oh, I’d say 30.’

Again she proudly responds, ‘I’m 50, but thank you!’ 

While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.

He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going.  Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was.  It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra  Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her.  She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully.  He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple.  He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

Stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘That was incredible, how could you tell?’

‘I was behind you at McDonalds’.","A woman decides to have a face lift for her 50th birthday. She spends $15,000 and looks sensational.",5399

He pulls into a gas station that also happens to have a mechanic. He asks the mechanic about his car being fixed.

“I’ll take a look at it, but it’s going to be a while.”, the mechanic says.

“Is there anything in town I can do while you’re fixing the car?”, the penguin replies.

“There’s an ice cream shop down the road within walking distance.”, the mechanic says.

Naturally, penguins love ice cream. Both come from cold environments, and it’s also tasty

The penguin heads to the ice cream shop and orders himself a vanilla cone. He thanks the cashier, and begins eating.

Now penguins can’t eat well. Flippers aren’t exactly the greatest utensils for eating, but the penguin gulps down the ice cream with his flippers, while getting vanilla ice cream all over himself in the process.

He then heads back to the gas station and sees the mechanic with his head under the hood, peering into the engine.

Hearing the penguin, he turns around and says, “Looks like you’ve blown a seal.”

“No, that’s just ice cream.”, the penguin replied.","A penguin, some ice cream, and a mechanic.",23

Well, except for Rudolph, he was off doing a photo shoot with Santa somewhere, the Diva that he is. 

Anyway, Donner started the meeting, “Gather ‘round, boys, gather ‘round. Now, listen up. Everyone knows to leave milk and cookies for Santa on Christmas Eve, right?

“Yeah”, Blitzen shouted

“Calm down, boy”, Donner said. 

“But, what about us? We get hungry too, right?”

“Yeah”, Blitzen shouted again

Donner just shook his head

“Now”, he said, “We would like some corn, or some carrots, or even a nice big piece of fruitcake.”

Reindeers love fruitcake. 

Donner continued, “But, no!!! Everyone just forgets about US, but I have a plan”

He gathered the team in closer. 

Moments later, they all stepped back, Donner said, “Got it?  Good!!!  That’s the plan.”

As the days went by, the reindeer ate as much food as they possibly could, without getting sick, of course. It was all part of the plan

Christmas Eve came, Santa gathered the team and harnessed them to the sleigh. 

Rudolph was last to arrive, he was too busy polishing his nose. Clueless, as usual. 

The elves loaded the sleigh with toys, Santa gave Mrs. Claus a kiss, and away they went. 

The trip went off without a hitch, and so did the plan. 

Santa and the team arrived safely back at The North Pole. 

The reindeer were happy and dancing. 

Santa said, “Ho, Ho, Ho, looks like you boys had a good time tonight.”

“We sure did, Santa.”, Donner said. “We sure did”

The elves unloaded the sleigh, Santa unhitched the team, letting them wander in the field to wind down, then went into the house for some hot cocoa and watch a little TV. 

Mrs. Claus greeted him at the door, handed him his cocoa, and they snuggled on the couch, watching “Miracle On 34th Street”. 

The original, not that crappy remake

“We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you this breaking news bulletin. 

An incident has occurred all around the continental United States. 

As Christmas morning arrived, parents and child alike were looking forward to a day of peace and joy. 

But, instead, they are waking up to find what appears to be...

Can I say this on the air?....OK!!!

They’re waking up to find what appears to be huge piles of reindeer shit that have fallen from the skies, landing on cars, houses and front yard Christmas decorations. 

There are no reported injuries, but experts say the cost of damages is in the millions. 

We’ll have more on this story, as it unfolds. 

Now, back to our regularly scheduled program.”

Santa’s eyes widened, his face red with anger. He bellowed, “Donner”

Donner stopped mid-stride in the field, turned to face the rest of the team, Except Rudolph, who is wrapped in a nice warm blanket, somewhere, like usual. 

Donner smiled and said, “Good job, boys....Good job!!!”

Next year...Europe!!!

So two weeks ago my wife got a kitten and as fluffy and cute it is, it’s also extremely playful. One day when I came home from hard days work and just wanted a shower to relax in while my wife prepared dinner for us. She suddenly yells that the kitchen sink wouldn’t drain properly, I decide to go down take a look.  Wearing nothing but a towel. The kitten is in the kitchen playing with a fly. I bend over to look under the sink to see if the drain is clogged, the kitten sees something dangling and charges, and I tell you those claws are sharp.

So I just mutter to my coworkers if only they knew.

A Mormon was seated next to an Irishman on a flight from London to the US.  

After the plane was airborne, drink orders were taken. The Irishman asked for a whiskey, which was promptly brought and placed before him.

The flight attendant then asked the Mormon if he would like a drink. He replied in disgust, ""I'd rather be savagely raped by a dozen whores than let liquor touch my lips.""  

The Irishman then handed his drink back to the attendant and said, ""Me, too, I didn't know we had a choice.""",A Mormon is seated next to an Irishman on a plane..,915

The loan officer explains that they'll need collateral for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to her Rolls Royce along with showing the title as proof of ownership. Everything checks out, so the loan officer approves the loan; after the blonde leaves, the loan officer, management, and executives have a laugh at the $250k Rolls Royce as collateral for a $5,000 loan.

An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.

The loan officer says, ""Miss, we're grateful for your business, but your account status with us shows you're a multi-millionaire; why did you need to borrow $5,000?""

The blonde replies, ""Where else in New York can I park my car for two weeks for only $15 and expect it to be there when I return?""

However it was too late, the police officer flicked on his sirens and pulled them over. The officer walked up to the drivers window:

“Licence and registration please” calmly said the officer 

“Where I’m from we don’t need a licence to drive” responded Shut Up.

The officer suspected that they were up to something and asked them politely to step out the car.

Trying to not to disrespect the officer all three complied and stepped out the vehicle. However Poo was very dizzy from Shut Up speeding earlier that he passed out as soon as he stepped out the vehicle. Manners immediately rushed to go help him up. 

The officer approached Shut Up to ask him some questions:

“What is your name sir” The officer asked kindly

“Shut up”  he responded not thinking anything negatively about his answer.

“Excuse me? I asked for your name” The officer says in shock

“Shut Up.” He says once again confused on why the officer asked him again.

“Listen, I’m going to ask you this one more time. What is your name!” The officer said infuriated with his previous response.

As soon as he sits down at the counter the tiny man hops off his shoulder and starts walking around. It is just a bit taller than a pint of beer, and dressed in a sports jersey. It walks over to the guy right to him, chugs his beer in one go, bumps his fist into the guys shoulder and whispers with a very hoarse throat: ""M'lady!"".

He repeats this with every single patron at the bar, and does the exact same thing, again silently coughing ""M'lady!"".

The first guy jumps off his chair and throws up his fists. ""What the hell? Hey, you! Your gnome drank my beer and called me a woman! You better get me two new ones before I beat you up!""

The tall man sighs, and turns around: ""Okay listen. I'm sorry, but I don't have enough money to buy you any more beer, but I can tell you a secret that is worth more than that. You see, if you go outside to the river and follow it downstream for ten minutes, you will reach a well. If you throw down exactly 1.67$ and clap your hands two times, an old gnome of the well will appear and grant you a wish!""

The guy is skeptical, but also very drunk, so he gives it a shot. He reaches the well and does as he has been told and won't you believe it a very old, shriveled gnome appears. ""You offered me the perfect change and clapped the perfect claps. I shall grant you one wish!""

""I wan't three trillion quid in cash, bundled!"" says the guy excitedly.

""So be it."" says the gnome and claps his tiny shriveled hands, then disappears.

A flash of light - and all of a sudden there are three people standing besides him, black hair, light brown skin, wool caps on their heads. They frantically scratch red patches on their skin, while talking to him as if their mouths were partly paralyzed.
