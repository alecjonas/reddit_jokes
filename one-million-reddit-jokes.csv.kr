The doctor, after pondering on the issue , tells Tommy that he has thought of an effective way of dealing with this worm. The doc asks him to get a slice of pizza , a roll and a cookie on the next day.

Realizing he needed a haircut before the next day's meeting he called down to the desk clerk to ask if there was a barber on the premises. 'I'm afraid not, sir,' the clerk told him apologetically, 'but down the hall from your room is a vending machine that should serve your purposes.' 

Skeptical but intrigued, the salesman located the machine, inserted $15.00, and stuck his head into the opening, at which time the machine started to buzz and whirl. Fifteen seconds later the salesman pulled out his head and surveyed his reflection, which reflected the best haircut of his life. 

Two feet away was another machine with a sign that read, 'Manicures, $20.00'. 'Why not?' thought the salesman. 

He paid the money, inserted his hands into the slot, and the machine started to buzz and whirl. Fifteen seconds later he pulled out his hands and they were perfectly manicured. 

The next machine had a sign that read, 'This Machine Provides a Service Men Need When Away from Their Wives, 50 Cents.' 

The salesman looked both ways, put fifty cents in the machine, unzipped his fly, and with some anticipation, stuck his manhood into the opening. When the machine started buzzing, the guy let out a shriek of agony and almost passed out. Fifteen seconds later it shut off. 

With trembling hands, the salesman was able to withdraw his tender unit..... which now had a button sewn neatly on the end! ",Men Will Try Anything!,3

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Romanian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""

The teacher said, ""Let's begin by reviewing some American History. Who said 'Give me Liberty , or give me Death'?""

She saw a sea of blank faces, except for Chandrasekhar, who had his hand up:?'Patrick Henry, 1775'he said.

'Very good! Who said 'Government of the People, by the People, for the People, shall not perish from the Earth?''

Again, no response except from Chandrasekhar. 'Abraham Lincoln, 1863' said Chandrasekhar.

The teacher snapped at the class, 'Class, you should be ashamed. Chandrasekhar, who is new to our country, knows more about our history than you do.'

She heard a loud whisper: 'F___ the Indians,'

'Who said that?' she demanded. Chandrasekhar put his hand up. 'General Custer, 1862.'

At that point, a student in the back said, 'I'm gonna puke.'

The teacher glares around and asks 'All right! Now, who said that?' Again, Chandrasekhar says, 'George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.'

Now furious, another student yells, 'Oh yeah? Suck this!'

Chandrasekhar jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, 'Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky,1997'

Now with almost mob hysteria someone said 'You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll kill you.' Chandrasekhar frantically yells at the top of his voice, ' Michael Jackson to the child witnesses testifying against him, 2004.'

The teacher fainted. And as the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said, 'Oh shit, we're screwed!' And Chandrasekhar said quietly, 'I think it was Lehmann Brothers, November 4th, 2008'.",F___ the Indians!!,1618

The mortician asks the deceased's wife how she would like the body dressed, pointing out that the man does look good in the black suit he is already wearing.

The widow, however, says that she always thought her husband looked his best in blue, and that she wants him in a blue suit. She gives the mortician a blank check and says, 'I don't care what it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing.'

The woman returns the next day and to her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly.

She says to the mortician, 'Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied.. You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?'

To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check, 'There's no charge.'

'No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit,' she says.

'Honestly, ma'am,' the mortician says, 'it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit.

They applied and were very happy to be flown to London for an interview with Her Majesty.

She says to them: “Because my footmen must wear long white stockings, I must see your ankles to be sure they are not swollen or misshapen.""

After they show her their ankles, the Queen says: “It is also important that you don’t have knobby knees, so I need to see your knees too.”

Once she has seen their knees, she says: “Now everything appears to be in shape, so I just need to see your testimonials.”

Nine years later, when the pair are finally released from prison, one of the blokes says to the other:

The people of each town chose their mayor by magically imbuing life into inanimate objects and letting the sentient objects dispense laws. Often the objects they chose and the way those objects acted reflected the spirit of the villagers that created it. The wealthy village in the north was represented by a big diamond that spoke with a posh accent and tended to be a bit disconnected from the working class. Meanwhile, a friendly wholesome community in the west was ruled over by a blueberry muffin that was determined to instill strong morals in its village and always spoke kindly of those it met. 

In the south there was a rural, backwater village that was unhappy with its mayor: a wooden 2x4 that spoke with an embarrassing hillbilly accent. His speeches were excruciatingly slow and drawn-out. The townspeople implored him to speak with a bit more distinction, but the old 2x4 always fell back into his lazy old tongue. Though the community built around the mayor did indeed reflect its values well enough, they thought they deserved better. They spent years trying out different objects to varying degrees of success--a haughty but untrustworthy umbrella; a bashful stapler that couldn't quite get the hang of being a government official. The people of the village tried and tried but always found that the new inanimate-object-turned-mayors they created were never any better than the original.

Day after day, each suitor came by, telling the princess what they would give her and why she should marry them. This went on for a few weeks, and the princess remained unsatisfied.

Suddenly, one day, in walked a suitor. He was Prince Franz, one of the richest princes of the world. He bowed before the princess and said, ""my dearest, if thy shall marry me, I will grant thee all the finest dresses and jewellery, more sapphires and diamonds than one could imagine."" The princess was convinced, and was ready to choose Prince Franz.

But suddenly, another prince entered. This was Prince Henrik, an even more rich prince. He bowed before the princess and said, ""Your Highness, if thy will marry me, I promise the greatest feasts each night, from the finest wild turkeys to the greatest bison, with the sweetest wine ever imaginable. Every taste from every corner of the world will be at thy dispense."" The princess was now convinced, and was ready to make her decision.

Until a third suitor arrived. This was Prince Gustav, the richest prince in the entire world. The guards gasped in shock when he arrived. Even the King and Queen looked startled. Gustav walked right up to the princess on her throne, bowed, and said, ""I will fuck you in the ass and make you moan louder than you've ever moaned before."" Everyone stood shocked. But they became even more shocked when the princess thought about it, and chose Gustav.

The Royal Family planned an elaborate wedding, inviting all the other Royal Families. It was a beautiful ceremony, which finally led to the princess and Gustav's first night together. Gustav made good on his promise, as he indeed fucked her in the ass and made her moan louder than she ever moaned before.

As both of them finished, the princess turned around to see Gustav climbing out the window. ""Where are you going?"" asked the princess. 

Gustav turned back, chuckled and said, ""who the fuck said I was going to do anything else?""",There was a princess,12

A magical, living snowman had laid a curse on their bakery and they could no longer produce anything. No pastries, no cookies, no muffins, or cakes. Their proofing oven no longer allowed dough to rise. Their refrigerator couldn't keep a chill. Stovetops were cool to the touch. Unsure of how to proceed, they called in a specialist in obscure curses to diagnose the issue. They put some cookie dough on a sheet tray and set it in the oven, but it just would not cook! The oven felt hot. The dough was made correctly. It was as if the ability to bake had completely fled the confines of the oven.

""Well,"" the old curse expert started, ""it seems the functionality of all your appliances are, in fact, still here in the bakery, they have just somehow been displaced to other areas.""

""What do you mean?"" a baker asked.

""For example, if we put a lump of bread dough back in the storage racks, it begins to rise as if it is proofing. This must mean that the functionality of your proofing oven still exists, it's just been relocated. It is all very strange.""

""Is there anything we can do?""

""We will need to break the curse by cancelling it out with some magic of our own. Do you own anything that might be imbued with a hex or charm?""

One of the bakers chimed in that his grandmother had left a silicon baking mat that she purportedly charmed to magically prevent her cookies from burning. It had been stored away in a dusty old box for years, but surely there was still an ounce of power that remained. The baker went home to dig up the old mat while his coworker and the curse specialist mapped out where the different functionalities of the appliances had moved to. The ability to bake, they determined, had been relocated to the bathroom. It would make a suitable testing ground for their experiment to see if the two conflicting curses would break one another. When the other baker returned, they lined a cookie sheet with the silicon mat and headed for the toilet.

Years later, the old curse expert was telling the story at a convention for the supernatural. He got up on stage and recalled, ""They crossed he; the snowman. He's a fairy tale they say. He's made of snow, but now the bakers know how he ruined their life one day. But there must have been some magic in that old Silpat they found. For when they placed it in the head, the dough began to brown.""",A pair of bakers were experiencing a supernatural crisis.,2

The first chef was a master of searing beef and her exceptional skills landed her the nickname ""T-Bone."" Her sister preferred a lighter approach and was better known for working with flakey, white-fleshed fish: tilapia, cod, haddock. But her specialty, the pickerel, landed her a nickname of her own: Walleye, another name for the fish that had driven so many sales, especially during Lent. The youngest chef was a bit more wild and experimental. He loved habaneros, Carolina reapers, anchos. If it was full of capsaichin, it ended up in his dish. He especially loved to add this young peoples' gambit as a twist to classically ""old people"" foods, resulting in strange menu listings such as the Ghost Pepper Liver &amp; Onions, the Habanero Bread Pudding, or the Chipotle Green Bean Casserole. Only the bravest diners found themselves ordering these spicy plates, but it added a challenging dimension to an otherwise standard-fare menu. His love for the heat earned him his simple nickname: Chili.

But there was a problem. A smarmy new French restaurant had opened down the street and they were recieving quite a bit of hype over their menu: duck breast with blueberry demi-glaze. Slow-roasted pheasant. Smoked goose. These were fatty, rich delicassies that delighted the tastebuds and the three chefs had to do something lest they continue bleeding out sales. So, they decided to add a new spin to the menu: black-throated loon that had been cooked long and slow in a slurry of red wine, vinegars, brines, and lemon juice.

Unfortunately, the new menu item did not go over well. Perhaps it was because the loon was not considered a food-animal by the general population or perhaps the flavors were just off. To find answers, the young chefs sent out surveys to their customers. They got only one very short, straight-forward response from an old regular:

T-Bone, Walleye, &amp; Chili:
Don't go braising waterfowls. Please stick to the livers and the steaks that you're used to.",(OC) Three chefs had operated a successful restaurant for many years..,3

So the father of the family got his shovels and picks and all the tools he needed and dug up a nice deep hole and built a beautiful well housing over it. All of the digging had left the older man aching and swollen and in need of a hot bath, so what better way to break in the new well than by drawing up some bath water.

After a long bath, he discovered that the well had miraculous healing powers! Like all of his muscles had been worked out and repaired in minutes. Over the years, news of the healing properties of the well spread through the surrounding counties, attracting visitors and news crews. A nearby university did some testing on the water and, to everyone's surprise, it did indeed have some mysterious anti-inflammatory properties that just couldn't be explained.

Well, as happens, there was a small accident and the well needed to be shut down for a few days for repairs. In the meantime, though, the family's farm was flooded with visitors vying for the curative powers of the well and they weren't going to take no for an answer.

The family reluctantly opened up the old well that had been dug decades ago by the mother's family. A few people were doused with water from the well, but nothing seemed to happen. Odd. Surely the two wells, occupying the same plot of land, must be drawing from the same water table. So why were the anti-inflammatory powers not repeated?

A very beautiful and attractive golfer, who lived right there on the edge of the golf course, heard the noise, came running out of her villa and shouted, ""Are you okay?"" 

As I looked up I noticed she was wearing only a silky see through bath robe which was partially open, revealing what appeared to be a VERY nice figure. 

""I'm okay I think,"" I replied as I pulled myself out from under the twisted cart. 

She said, ""Please follow me to my villa so I can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head, then you can rest a while, and I'll help you upright the cart later."" 

""That's mighty nice of you,"" I answered, “but I don't think my wife will like me doing that!” 

""Oh, come on now,"" she insisted. "" We need to see if you have any more scrapes and treat them if so"". Well, after all, she was really pretty, and very persuasive. 

Being sort of shaken and weak, I finally agreed, but repeated, ""I'm sure my wife won't like this."" 

We walked to her place just a 100 yards away, and after a couple of Scotch and waters and the bandaging, I thanked her and said, ""I feel a lot better now, but I know my wife is going to be really upset, so I'd better go now."" 

""Don't be silly!"" she said with a smile, letting her robe fall even more open. ""Stay for a while. She won't know anything, and by the way, where is she?"" 

I replied, ""Still under the cart, I guess.""

""In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Louisiana State University.
On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephant's foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.
The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually, the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.
Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.
Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter's legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.
Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant",All Elephant's look the same,2

His friend suggested that he try using a new medical computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor.

''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10."" 

Bill found the computer, poured in a urine sample and deposited the $10. The computer beeped, clicked, shirred, and flashed various lights. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which read,  ""You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will heal in two weeks.""

Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was, he wondered if this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:

He’d always been too busy with work, never had kids and his wife left him. What was his purpose?

Dave had always been religious and decided he’d take the plunge and sort his life out by going to live with some monks. He needed the peace, the quiet and the reflection time to get his life back on track.

He loved it but after a few weeks, getting a little bored he asks one of the monks what they did for fun, how did they blow off steam?

""Well,"" responded the monk, ""we live a life of prayer in the service of God. All I can suggest is pray and focus on beating temptation.”

Feeling a bit disappointed, Dave slowly turned and began to walk away.

“Of course…” continued the monk, “there is the barrel on the hill.”

“The barrel on the hill?”

“Yeah, the hill behind the monastery. There’s a barrel at the top with a hole in the side. Some of us go up there some nights and…y'know...use it. You could too, I suppose, however you can never look inside and you can’t go on a Tuesday. You can NEVER go up on a Tuesday.”

“OK...” replied Dave, intrigued, “I’ll give it a go!”

So that night, Dave went to the top of the hill. He sees the barrel, it’s a bit bigger than he imagined, but there’s the hole the monk mentioned so…why not?

Carefully mounting the barrel, Dave began to do the deed.

It was the best he’d ever had, he slumped over the barrel, panting, sweat dripping from his nose, just mind blowing. Finally, the peaceful life he wanted but he could still get off.

The next morning, Dave couldn’t wait to tell the monk how great it was “That was amazing,” he said “I want to go again tonight but today’s Tuesday. You never actually explained why I couldn’t go on a Tuesday…”

“Ah, well, on Tuesdays” said the monk, leaning in closer to Dave, “its your turn in the barrel.”

One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts. ""One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me,"" said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.

Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, ""One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me ....""

He just knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along.

""Come here quick,"" said the boy, ""you won't believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!""

The man said, ""Beat it kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk."" When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery.

Standing by the fence they heard, ""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.""

The old man whispered, ""Boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord...?"" Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.

At last they heard, ""One for you, one for me. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence and we'll be done....""

He has his food prepared for him.

He can eat whenever he wants, 24/7/365.

His meals are provided at no cost to him.

By the way he does not need to pay for medical insurance.

He visits the doctor once a year for his checkup, and again during the year if any medical needs arise. For this he pays nothing and nothing is required of him.

He lives in a nice neighborhood in a house that is much larger than he needs, but he is not required to do any upkeep.

If he makes a mess, someone else cleans it up.

He has his choice of luxurious places to sleep.

He receives these accommodations absolutely free.

He is living like a King, and has absolutely no expenses whatsoever.

All of his costs are picked up by others who go out and earn a living every day.

One evening the wild rabbit noticed that his cage hadn't been properly closed and decided to make a break for freedom. He invited the lab rabbit to join him. The lab rabbit was unsure, as he had never been outside the lab, but the wild rabbit finally convinced him to give it a try.

Once they were free, the wild rabbit said, ""I'll show you the number-three best field,"" and took the lab rabbit to a field full of lettuce. 

After they had eaten their fill, the wild rabbit said, ""Now I'll show you the number-two best field,"" and took the lab rabbit to a field full of carrots. After they had had their fill of carrots, the wild rabbit said, ""Now I'll show you the number-one best field,"" and took the lab rabbit to a warren full of female bunnies. It was Heaven—nonstop lovemaking all night long.

As dawn was beginning to break, the lab rabbit announced that he would have to be getting back to the lab.

""Why?"" said the wild rabbit. ""I've shown you the number-three best field with the lettuce, the number-two best field with the carrots, and the number-one best field with the ladies. Why do you want to go back to the lab?""

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

Sure enough,  a couple of days later, a package appeared on Hell's doorstep. It contained a garment identical in size and shape to Satan's Jacket, but it was a pure white. Needless to say, Satan was upset at the loss of his jacket, and called the girl up. Because she felt bad at having taken his jacket for so long, she eventually picked up the phone.

They pick a random highway and start driving. They're having a great time, laughing and joking the whole time. It's starting to get late, and they see a billboard advertising a hotel for women only.

Intrigued, they take the turnoff. As they drive, they see sign after sign extolling the virtues of this women-only hotel, and they get more and more excited. Finally they arrive, and enter the hotel lobby.

The front desk clerk is a lovely middle-aged woman with a gentle demeanour. She tells them that the hotel works a bit differently from most hotels - at this hotel, all rooms are the same price, and each room has a man who will serve the woman's every desire, whatever it may be. When you find the room that you want, you take it, but you're not allowed to come back down the stairs once you go up. There are five floors in total.

So the women pay, and enter the hallway foe the first floor. A sign there says ""All the men on this floor have small, narrow penises."" The women giggle and quickly agree to go up to the next floor.

The next floor has a sign that says ""All the men on this floor have long, narrow penises"". The women discuss for a bit, but they quickly agree to try the next floor. That one has a sign that says ""All the men on this floor have short and thick penises"".

The women have caught on to the trend. They're excited to get to the next floor, and quickly head up the stairs. Sure enough, the sign there says ""All the men on this floor have long and thick penises"".

One of the women nearly swoons with excitement. They all talk happily and excitedly to each other, until one of them says ""wait... what's on the fifth floor?""

The women all grow quiet, and look to the next flight of stairs with wonder. They share a quick look, then agree to head up to the last floor.

The sign there reads ""This floor is just here to prove that women are never satisfied""",Four women go on a road trip,115

Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. 

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship come to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly  be making such a seductive sound. 

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. 

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. 

After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, “Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" 

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...... ... ... ... ... ... ...

At closing time, he saw a duck stumble out of the bar, trip on the curb and try his keys on five different cars before he found his. The man sat in the front seat fumbling around with his keys for several minutes. 
Meanwhile, all the other patrons left the bar and drove off. Finally he started his engine and began to pull away. The police officer was waiting for him.

The court magistrate showed the king a pair of metal panties, with a hole in the middle.

""Why, doesn't that just defeat the whole purpose?"" asked the King, and the magistrate promptly picked a pencil off his desk and inserted it into the hole.

""SNAP!"", the pencil had cleanly sliced into two! ""Anything that enters the hole will be sliced off, sire"", said the magistrate.

Thoroughly impressed, the King instructed the Queen to wear it for the entire year and left for his expedition. Upon his return, the King called for a meeting of all his country folk.

They were all instructed to drop their pants, and the King made his rounds noticing that many were missing fingers as well as their most vital part. Then, he saw the quiet knight Sir Xavier, fingers and all still intact.

""Xavier, the one and only true knight! Only you among all the nobles have been true to me. What is it in my power to grant you? Name it and it is yours!""

One night as they were driving to yet another rubber-chicken dinner, Einstein mentioned to his chauffeur (a man who somewhat resembled Einstein in looks &amp; manner) that he was tired of speechmaking.

“I have an idea, boss,” his chauffeur said. “I’ve heard you give this speech so many times. I’ll bet I could give it for you.” Einstein laughed loudly and said, “Why not? Let’s do it!”

When they arrived at the dinner, Einstein donned the chauffeur’s cap and jacket and sat in the back of the room. The chauffeur gave a beautiful rendition of Einstein’s speech and even answered a few questions
expertly.

Then a supremely pompous professor asked an extremely esoteric question about anti-matter formation, digressing here and there to let everyone in the audience know that he was nobody’s fool. Without missing a beat, the chauffeur fixed the professor with a steely stare and said, “Sir, the answer to that question is so simple that I will let my chauffeur, who is sitting in the back, answer it for me",Alberts Einstein’s driver,14
