A couple named Jacob and Scarlet have been dating for a few months and Jacob asks her if she wants to go to prom. 

""Of course!"" she says. ""But I require three things first. A limo, flowers, and you must wear a tux.""

""Okay"" says Jacob. 

He has procrastinated till the day of Prom.
He has to skip out on school and is frantically attempting to assemble what he needs for the dance. So first he goes to the limousine rental shop. It's the only one in their small town so every kid from his highschool is there. 

He is standing in line for hours. He checks his watch, checks his phone. Looks at a little reddit. Finally he is at the front of the line. They happen to have one limo left for him to rent. 

Next he goes to get the tux. Another gigantic line of guys from his highschool. He gets in line. He is there for hours. He checks his watch, he checks his phone. Looks at a little reddit. Finally he is at the front of the line. They happened to have one last black tux. 

He finally needs the flowers. He decides on roses and goes to a small flower shop near his school. The line is even longer. So he scrolls through reddit for a few hours until he's at the front of the line. They only had one bouquet of roses. 

Finally it's time for the dance. 
He and his girlfriend are having a great time, and after a few hours a slow dance comes on. He asks his girlfriend if she cares to take a dance. 

""Of course!"" she says. ""But I require one thing first. I need a drink.""

So Jacob walks on over to the refreshments, looks at the drink bar, and alas... 

There is no punch line. ",Prom is near.,7

He knows many bird tourists come there every year so he guides them around the city. He did this once and realized that guiding birds around the historical town didn't make as much money as he hopes so he decided he'd scam them. 

He made a deal with a group of thugs who would wait in a dark alley. The man would lead the unsuspecting tourists there and let them get robbed. The thugs gave him a fair cut and he was happy.

He made a lot of money across several years until one owl realized this and told the police. Because many of the tourists ended up dead (the thugs were unnecessarily violent) he was given death penalty along the group of thugs. Unlike the rest of his associates, he lived through with the killing chair seemingly malfunctioning. The guards had to set him free.

The man didn't see this as a sign to stop the life of crime and continued to scam the tourists coming to the annual Batman convention. He found a new, even more violent group of thugs who even took some people hostage. In a few years however, a parrot told it to the police and the man's group ended up on the death chair as well. Again, the man miraculously survived and continued scamming birds every year.

The man now became fearless and even more cocky with his actions. Therefore it's no surprise that two years later he ended up in the same death chair with the same guard who was supposed to kill him twice in the past. Once it came time to pull the switch the man want afraid. And alas, he lived once again. After being released the prison guard asked him ""How did you not die ?

My Dear Husband, I received your letter and thank you for your honesty about my being 57 years old. I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that you are also 57 years old. As you know, I am a maths teacher at our local college. I would like to inform you that while you read this, I will be at the Hotel Fiesta with Michael, one of my students, who is also the assistant tennis coach. He is young, virile, and like your secretary, is 22 years old.

A new woman joins their Club. When she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, ""I played on my college's golf team. I was pretty good. Mind if I join you next week?

""No one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot. Finally, one man says ... Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m. He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.

The woman says this may be a problem, and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.

They roll their eyes, but say, ""Okay"".

She's there at 6:30 a.m. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round. She's fun and pleasant, and the guys are impressed. They congratulate her and invite her back the next week. She smiles and says, ""I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45.""

The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp. Only this time, she plays left-handed. The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand. They're totally amazed.

They can't figure her out. She's very pleasant and a gracious winner. They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.

The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys. This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.

The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part. However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.

This woman is a riddle no one can figure out. They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse, and finally, one of the men asks her, ""How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?""

The lady blushes and grins. ""When my Dad taught me to play golf, I learned I was ambidextrous,"" she replies. ""I like to switch back and forth.""

""When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his Willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.""

The guys think this is hysterical. Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, ""What if it's pointing straight up?""

She says, ""Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.""",15 minutes late..,22228

When pressed for a fix, he thinks for a few seconds and pulls open a drawer on his desk and starts rummaging around, moving around pill bottles and notepads ‘til he finds what’s he’s looking for. He grabs from the drawer and hands to the man a small butter knife and tells his patient, “When you go home this weekend and make love with your wife, I’d like you to hold onto this knife. Do whatever you’d like, just as long as you’re holding onto this knife, it should resolve that problem you’ve been having.” 
  
So the man goes home and explains the strange remedy his doctor has prescribed. His wife is a bit uncomfortable bringing cutlery into the bedroom but they decide to give it a shot and just as the doctor said, the man is able to last and they have wonderful sex throughout the weekend.  
  
Later the next week, the man is out in the golf course and bumps into his doctor and makes it a point to thank him. “Doctor I can’t begin to imagine why it works but whenever I’m holding onto that butter knife, I seem to be cured. What exactly is so special about that knife?” The doctor casual replies, “Oh, it’s just that knife guys finish last.” ",So a man is having some bedroom issues,42

Paddy Murphy gets up and leaves the bar. Thirty minutes later, he shows back up and taps the Texan on the shoulder.  ""Is your bet still good?"" asks Paddy.


The Texan answers, ""Yes,"" and he orders the barman to line up 10 pints of Guinness.


Immediately, Paddy downs all 10 pints of beer, drinking them all back to back.  The other pub patrons cheer and the Texan sits down in amazement. The Texan gives the Irishman the $500 and asks, ""If ya don't mind me askin', where did you go for that 30 minutes you were gone?""

None ever returned. The King then sent Chester the Jester with the next knight Sir Armond, to report what happened.

A month later, the jester returned and reported that the witch was incredibly beautiful and seductive, and Sir Armond, as though sleepwalking, stripped off his armor and approached her naked. With a wicked laugh, she grasped his manhood in both hands, and it disappeared, killing him in a slow and agonizing fashion.

Now worried, the King sent out a call to all the reaches of the land, begging anyone brave enough to come forward and slay this evil that has befallen the land. But, having heard the jester's story, no one would volunteer.

Then, a huge hulking man-beast at least as tall as a door came to the king's court. With skin as black as coffee, hair in tight curls, Shays the Moor listened gravely to the King's plight and the jester's story. Wielding his broadsword in one hand, he assured the king he would cleanse the land of this evil. Together, the newly-knighted Shay and the jester left to confront the witch.

Much to the King's surprise, the jester came running back in a week, saying that the knight had worn himself out during the battle and would be resting along the way, but the jester had come immediately to report to the king:

""Like all the others, he was entranced and forced to strip. When he approached her, she again grabbed his manhood, but it did not disintegrate! She pulled and tugged to no avail! Then, he made love to her for three days straight until with his final thrust he clove her in two, thus ending the witch once and for all!""

""He laughed in her face,"" said the jester, ""and told her: Sir Shays melts in your mouth, not in your hands!""",The Witch that Disintegrates Penises,1

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts.

However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the birds' beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.

The RCMP then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentage of motorbike kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike.""",Over 2000 Dead Crows Found on Highways,5

The clown spotted John in the audience immediately and says, 'you sir, are the front of an ass?'

Sheepishly John said 'no'

'Are you the back of an ass?'

'No?'

'Then I proclaim you are no end of an ass!' shouted the clown with glee. The audience erupted and John felt betrayed and embarrassed. His hero had let him down.

He pondered what had happened and decided he simply did not have the required eloquence required to combat the clown on his level. As such, he decided to dedicate his life to becoming the most eloquent and witty man he could ever be.

John studied English to a PhD level, he began writing novels and witty interludes for newspapers, he was widely renowned for his incredible sharpness and his grasp of the English language.

Years passed, and one day, the circus returned to his home town once more, John purchased a ticket in the front row.

Once again, the circus wowed John, it truly was a spectacle. But then, the moment came and the very same clown from years past entered the arena once more.

The clown recognised John immediately and pointed at him.

'You sir, are you the front of an ass?'

'No' replied John

'Are you the back of an ass?'

'No'

'Well then, you are no end of an ass!' the clown announced. The audience laughing as they had done in the past.

But then John arose and the audience gasped, they recognised him at once as the wittiest most eloquent man they had ever known.

The barman is aghast. A talking duck! 'Wow, where did you come from?' he asks.

'I work across the road at the building site' replies the duck annoyed. He ruffles his newspaper and begins to read. The barman is in shock but lets him continue uninterrupted. The duck eats his food, pays and leaves.

All week the duck comes in and orders the same pint and a pork pie. The barman is amazed, but can't bring himself to interrupt the duck during his meal.

Saturday rolls by and the duck doesn't come in - obviously not working at the building site on the weekend. However, the circus is in town and in walks the circus ringmaster for a pint. 

The barman says to the ringmaster 'you won't believe what I've seen this week, a talking duck!'

'Wow! That's incredible' says the ringmaster.

'Yeah, he walks in every lunchtime for a pork pie and a pint - it's amazing'

'That is amazing' agrees the ringmaster. He hands the barman his card and says 'tell him to get in touch with me, I could have some work for a talking duck!'

So Monday rolls round as as expected, in walks the duck - who orders his pork pie and a pint as usual. 

The barman sheepishly picks up the card and says 'sorry to disturb you, but a circus ringmaster walked in the other day and I mentioned you've been in all last week. He told me to give you this, he might have some work for you.'

The duck looks confused and studies the card perplexed.

'So, the circus?' says the duck.

'Yeah, he came in on Saturday' says the barman.

'Where they all live in tents, with a big top and it's all made of canvas?'

'Yeah, that's right'

'Where all the humans walk free, and the animals live in cages?'

'I guess so... yeah'

The duck studies the card intently and pulls a face.

So Farmer Jack called the local police station to complain, ""You've got to do something about all these people driving so fast &amp; killing all my chickens,"" he said to the local police officer...

""What do you want me to do?"" asked the policeman...

I don't care, just do something about those crazy drivers!!!”

So the next day the policeman had the council erect a sign that said: SCHOOL CROSSING

3 days later Farmer Jack called the policeman &amp; said, ""You've still got to do something about these drivers... The school crossing sign seems to make them go even faster!!!”

So again, they put up a new sign: SLOW: CHILDREN AT PLAY.

That really sped them up... So Farmer Jack called &amp; said, ""Your signs are no good. Can I put up my own sign???”

In order to get Farmer Jack off his back the policeman said, ""Sure. Put up your own sign...”

The phone calls to the Police Station stopped, but curiosity got the better of the officer, so he called Farmer Jack, ""How is the problem with the speeding drivers, Did you put up your sign???”

""Oh, I sure did &amp; not one chicken has been killed...”

The policeman was really curious and thought he'd better go out &amp; take a look at the sign... He also thought the sign may be something the police could use elsewhere to slow drivers down...

So he drove out to Farmer Jack's house...
