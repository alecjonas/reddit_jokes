He has greasy hair and a five o'clock shadow, he's wearing a filthy jacket and torn jeans, he obviously hasn't had a shower since Christ was crucified, and he smells strongly of stale tobacco smoke and cheap beer.  The vintner sees the man's obviously a homeless dipsomaniac, so he tries to turn him away, but the man tells him he's here about the job.

""Well, all right, then,"" the vintner says.  He pulls a green bottle from the cupboard behind him, making sure to keep the label covered, and pours a glass for the drunk.  ""Can you tell me about this wine?""

""Urgh!"" the drunk says, after taking a sip.  ""It's a 1992 cabernet shauvignon from Bordeaux, grown on a north shlope, matured in Hungarian oak.  You can barely tashte the rotten eggsh and burning rubber over the mould.  Give me something elsh.""

The vintner is impressed; the drunk managed far better than he had expected, identifying not only the wine's faults but also its vintage and the conditions it grew in.  He still doesn't want the man on staff, though, so he decides to give him a glass of something better, with more complex flavours to discern.

""How about this one?"" he says.

""That'sh more like it!  2007 amarone, with a big oseletta content, I'd shay about fifteen per cent, and almost as much forsellina.  Northeast shlope, matured in French chethnut.  It'sh got a big body, long legs, and lots of tannins.  Notes of figs, chocolate, and fine tobacco.  Delicious.  Can I have another?"" the homeless man slurs, obviously drunk.

""Hey, there's more vintages,"" the vintner says as he goes to get another bottle, a white wine this time.  He comes back with the bottle and a glass, hoping against hope that the drunk would be stumped.  ""Try this.""

""Thish is absholutely wonderful!  It'sh a 1999 Tokaj, 6 puttonyos, grown on an eastern shlope, matured in Hungarian oak.  There'sh a shignificant quannity of Kabar in thish.""

The vintner can't take it anymore.  The drunk was obviously qualified, but he simply couldn't have such a person running around HIS winery!  To save himself from the trouble, he decided to give him a truly impossible test: he asked his teenage daughter to urinate into a wine glass and, once she had done so, brought it into the office.

""Woman, 2000 vintage.  Pregnant.  Notes of tobacco and cocaine.  If I get the job, I'll name the father.""",A winery is looking for a taster and so the vintner puts an ad out in the paper.,39

When the old owners passed away and some new people bought the place. They started hearing stories from their customers of odd noises coming from room 1313. 

One night a customer staying in the room around midnight Is awoken by a voice

""If I catch you! I'm gonna eat you!""

The man pulls the covers over his face "" I must be hallucinating""

The voice comes again "" IF...I catch..You. I'm gonna eat you!""

The man starts to panic and jumps out of the bed and heads for the door but the voice comes from that direction once more

""If I catch you. I'm gonna eat you."" 

The man scared witless opts to turn and without thought jumps out the window. Plummeting 13 floors to his death!

The event is investigated and nothing irregular is ever found in the hotel room and there are no signs of someone else being in there or pushing the man out.

So after sometime passes business continues regularly... for a while.
One evening a female customer rents room 1313. 

The owner warns of its previous renters fate.

The women not superstitious and that being the last room available in the area coincidentally, stays there through her own volition, although would have also been forced to stay there.

When midnight comes around and the women is sleeping. The voice comes to life

""IF...I....Ca-atch you... I... I'm gonna eat...you!""

The women wakes up immediately.

""IF I catch you! Im gonna eat you!"" 

The women panics and heads for the door.  The voice coming from near the door again says

""if I catch you im gonna eat you!""

Scared witless like our last customer the woman panics and opts to exit out the window also and plummets thirteen floors to her death.

Witnessing the event the owner decides to investigate the room while the authorities are on the way.

When he enters room 1313 he hears ""if I catch you im gonna eat you"" clearly coming frommthe closet beside the entrance.

He opens it and finds his five year old son sitting in the closet picking his nose and with his struggle he says

""If... I catch...you. I'm gonna eat you!""",The haunted room,0

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

""Hey! What the fuck are you trying to pull? Get your filthy hands off of my duck!"" I said.

""No.  Is boodleshit. Is my duck,"" said Haji.

I'll admit that I got pretty pissed for a second or three, but then my better nature asserted itself.

""First, one guy kicks the other in the nuts. Then the second guy kicks the first guy in the nuts. Whoever makes the least noise wins.""

Haji thought it over for a moment and said ""Okay. ""

I planted my size 11 in his crotch so hard his feet left the ground. He grabbed his nuts, bit his lip, and his eyes rolled back into his forehead as great beads of sweat broke out across his brow. He rolled around on the heath, buried his face in the sod, and convulsed with great, heaving sobs for a good ten minutes. But he didn't make a sound.

She informed me they were set up on the roof. We were both on the ground floor at the time and upon seeing the disdain in my eyes she offered to show me to the access area. She was a cute little blonde thing, and I accepted the offer. 
She takes me to the elevator and we ride up to the 5th floor. She's yapping about something I wasn't fully paying attention to as I'm trailing her down the corridor. I glance left and right through the oblong windows in the doors to the patients rooms. Not much to see. 
As we near the end of the end of hall, she turns back to face me and spots me staring straight into a patients room, my mouth ajar. 
""That man is in there jerking off!"" 
It was fairly violent too. She informed me he had a rare condition that would result in cardiac arrest unless he rubbed one out every couple hours.  I told her to keep me away from that guy. 
We climbed up one more flight of stairs and turned down another corridor with rooms lining either side. 
""It's just ahead sir,"" she said, "" just through the double doors at the end."" 
I was still a shook up about the scene I'd just witnessed one level below, so she took me the rest of the way. 
Sure enough I see another man, a FULLY grown man, yanking on his thing. HARD. 
""What the hell is going on around here?"" I asked her. 
""That man has the same issue as the fellow downstairs. Isn't that interesting?"" She exclaimed. 
'Hardly,' I thought. We kept walking. 
Just then, to no avail, I look into another room, unable to keep my prying eyes away, and there it was. A nurse in her little whit outfit, hair tied up in a bun, blowing this mans cock! Right there in the patients room!

I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry and that the food is nutritionally complete so I was going to give it a try again. 

Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food had poisoned me. I told her no; I had stopped in the middle of the parking lot to lick my balls and a car hit me.

There is no one else in the bar besides the bartender and this guy. Things are slow so the bartender says to the guy ""Hey you want to see something cool?"" The guy says sure. So they both hop into the bartenders car and start driving. They drive for 30 min before they drive up to a gate. The bartender gets out and opens the gate, gets back in and drives through, and then gets out and closes the gate. Now they are at a river. They ditch the car and get into a little paddle boat and paddle across the river. At the end is a gate. The bartender walks up opens the gate, they walk through and then he closes the gate. Now they are at a 2nd river, which is twice as large as the first river. The paddle boat across. Get to another gate and the bartender opens it, they go through, and then he closes it. Now they are at a mountain. They promptly hike over the mountain quick and come up to a gate. Bartender opens, they go through, he closes. Now they are at a 2nd mountain twice as tall as the first mountain. They hike over this one now as well. Then they come up to another gate. The bartender opens said gate, they walk through, he closes said gate. Finally, they have arrived at a cave. The bartender cups his hands around his mouth and yells ""Here little green man, little green man!"" All of a sudden this tiny little green man comes bee-bopping up. The guy is amazed at this phenomenon and decides he wants to touch the little green man. Just as he is reaching out the bartender pulls him back exclaiming ""You must never touch this little green man!"" The man obliges and they leave the cave. So they come up to a gate, the bartender opens it, they go through, he closes it. They hike over the 2nd mountain twice as tall as the first mountain. Come up to a gate, opens, walks through, closes. They hike over the first mountain. Come to the gate, open it, walk through, close it. Now they paddle boat across the 2nd river twice as large as the first river. Come to the gate. Open, walks through, closes. They paddle boat across the first river. Open gate, walk through, close gate. Drive back to the bar. So now the guy is sitting there just thinking over and over wow I could really make some money off of this little green man. So he gets in his own car this time and drives himself to the first gate. He opens it, drives through it, and then closes it. He then paddle boats across the first river. Gets to the gate, opens it, goes through it, and then closes it. He then paddle boats across the 2nd river which is twice as big as the first river. Gets to the gate, opens, goes through, closes. Now he is hiking over the first mountain. Gets to the gate, opens it, goes through it, and then closes it. Then he hikes over the 2nd mountain that is twice as tall as the first mountain. Opens the gate, walks through, closes it. He walks up to the cave and yells ""Here little green man, little green man!"" and sure enough the little green man comes bee-bopping out. The guy thinks to himself this is awesome! He reaches down to pick the little green man up and as soon as he touches him the little green man starts going berserk! The man is startled and takes off running away from the little green man. He runs to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it and starts just sprinting over the 2nd mountain twice as tall as the first mountain. Gets to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it. The little green man chasing behind the entire way. So now the man runs over the first mountain. Opens the gate, runs through, closes it. Little green man still going stride for stride. So he gets in the paddle boat and furiously rows across the 2nd river twice as large as the first river. Gets to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it. The little green man swimming right along after him. So the guy paddles across the first river gets to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it and then he jumps in his car and starts driving. The little green man all along the way is very visible in the mans rear view mirror. The man starts to panic so he drives to the airport. He runs up to the front desk and says ""give me a ticket to the furthest place possible!"" The lady at the front desk says well that would be New Zealand. So she gives him a ticket and he boards and the plane takes off. All the time the man is in the plane he can see a tiny tiny green dot on the ground. After 16 hours the plane finally lands and the man steps off. At this point the little green man comes limping up to him. He is tired, hurt, and exhausted. The man thinks OK I'm out of options I should finally give this little green man a chance to explain himself. So the man stands there while the little green man limps up to him, touches his leg and yells ""TAG YOUR'E IT!""",Little Green Man,4

When they arrived at the doctor's, they explained to the doctor about the problems they were having with their memory. 


After checking the couple out, the doctor tells them that they were physically okay but might want to start writing things down and make notes to help them remember things. The couple thanked the doctor and left. 


Later that night while watching TV, the old man got up from his chair and his wife asks, ""Where are you going?"" 


He replies, ""To the kitchen."" 


She asks, ""Will you get me a bowl of ice cream?"" 


He replies, ""Sure."" 


She then asks him, ""Don't you think you should write it down so you can remember it?"" 


He says, ""No, I can remember that."" 


She then says, ""Well, I also would like some strawberries on top. You had better write that down cause I know you'll forget that."" 


He says, ""I can remember that, you want a bowl of ice cream with strawberries."" 


She replies, ""Well, I also would like whip cream on top. I know you will forget that so you better write it down."" 


With irritation in his voice, he says, ""I don't need to write that down, I can remember that."" He then fumes into the kitchen.
 

After about 20 minutes he returns from the kitchen and hands her a plate of bacon and eggs.

""This is at most, a four year old whiskey. I asked for twelve year old whiskey!""

The bartender apologises for his ""mistake,"" but he still doesn't want to open his expensive whiskey. So he pours the man a glass of 8 year old whiskey, and gives him the glass. 

The man takes another drink, and spits it back out again. 

""That's closer,"" the man says, ""but it's not the twelve year old whiskey that I wanted.""

He steps next to a guy and while doing his job, he sees that the other guys dick is absurdly huge.

The guy with a huge dick asks: ""Would you like to have an enormous dick like I do?""

The other guy nods hastily.

""Okay, then listen carefully! Wait until midnight, then go to the crossroad outside the village. Take the leftroad, walk about 5 minutes and then youll see a huge stone on the side of the road. On that stone will be sitting a huge toad. You will ask the toad: 

""Hello beautiful, would you like to have sex with me?"".

The toad will respond: ""NO!"".

 And suddenly, your dick grows 4 inches!""

The man doesnt believe at first, but seeing as hes been mocked by women his entire life, he decides to give it a try.

He waits until midnight, goes to the crossroad, takes the left road, walks for 5 minutes and he sees a huge toad on a huge stone. He cant believe his eyes, but he maintains calm enough to ask: 

""Hello beautiful, would you like to have sex with me?"" 

The toad responds: ""NO!""

The man hurries home, rushes into the bathroom, pulls down his pants and he cant believe what he sees - his dick is now 4 inches longer! He is mesmerized - yet not satisfied.

The next day, the man decides to try his luck again. He waits until midnight, goes to the crossroad, takes the left road, walks for 5 minutes and he sees the huge toad once again. And once again he asks:

""Hello beautiful, would you like to have sex with me?""

And once again, the toad responds: ""NO!""

The man can already feel his dick grow up in the pants, and he is jumping with joy! 

""Just 4 more inches, and it will be just perfect!"", he thinks.

So the next day, he once again waits until midnight, goes to the crossroad, takes the left road, walks for 5 minutes and he sees the huge toad once again sitting on the huge stone. And once again he asks:

""Hello beautiful, would you like to have sex with me?""

And the toad responds:

They could not find anyone willing to fly into the selected lake, as it was small with many snags and rocks. They finally found a pilot who would take on the job for an extra $5,000. 
They packed in their gear and they were off for an event of a lifetime. They got to the lake and were able to land, with some difficulty due to the snags and rocks in the lake. They arranged to be picked up in a week and the floatplane returned to Fairbanks.
The next week was grand. They each caught a record size lake trout; shot a moose and an elk. When the floatplane returned they attempted to load their gear and the trout, moose and elk. The pilot would not let them pack all of their trophies, as it would cause the plane to be overloaded.
The administrators indicated that they must have the trophies as they were administrators and no one would believe their stories unless they had proof of their adventures. 
They agreed, after giving the pilot an extra $6,000, that they would leave their gear and take out only the trophies. The pilot would return later for the gear that was being left at the lake.
The pilot was still concerned about the weight in the plane and taxied to the far end of the lake and gunned the motor. They rocketed across the lake but the plane was not becoming airborne as they approached the trees. The plane came off of the water and then slammed into the trees. 
After a few minutes one of the administrators crawled out of the plane and made his way to a large rock on which he stood to evaluate their situation. A voice came from the plane “how far did we make it?”.

The first administrator answered, “About a hundred yards further than last year.”",University Administrators.,2

I'm a bit bored at the moment, so I've embellished it a bit! enjoy :)

So, this guy is hiking in the Himalayas, as you do, and, as he's hiking up the narrow, rock-strewn paths, he realises that it is getting late, and darkness comes early in the mountains, and he was still some distance from the next town. He starts walking more quickly, but it became dark and he couldn't see much in front of him. Just as the panic was setting in, he rounded a corner and lo, there was a light in the darkness. A monastery, not on any map, appearing, just as it was sorely needed.
The guy thankfully stumbles up to the great door and bangs on it loudly. After a short time, it slowly creaked open to reveal a large, almost jolly, monk with a huge smile on his face. ""Come in, weary traveller"", he says. Wondering how the happy monk knew English, but not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth, the traveller thankfully entered the monastery.
""Please join us for dinner,"" the monk said, with that warming and happy smile. ""it will be, as always, a very joyous and happy occasion"".
""Thank you so much"" says the traveller, as he is shown to a room to refresh himself before the meal.

At the meal, held in the large Hall, with all of the monastery's inhabitants together, the traveller is seated as a guest of honour, next to the Abbot himself. Small talk ensues as they partake of the feast set before them.
All of the monks seem very happy and friendly. Our weary traveller is confused (thinking monasteries were supposed to be quiet, dull affairs), but again, doesn't want to ask any awkward questions, and so is happy to go along.
All of a sudden, one of the monks at a lower table stands up and says loudly, ""24!"". The other monks start chuckling, and nodding their heads in agreement. One or two even bang their cups on the table.
Another monk then stands up and says, ""37"". A bit more obvious a reaction this time - the monks chuckle more loudly, a few laughing out loud and more cup-on-table banging. Even the Abbot chuckles to himself.
A third monk, ""65!"". Loud laughter, patting on backs, more cup on table bangings, even a few feet stompings - clearly the monks are having a  good time!
The traveller, however, is as confused as all hell! Just as he was about to ask the Abbot what was going on, the Abbot himself stood up and shouted ""17!"". More laughter, more appreciation, clapping and table banging. The monks were loving it!
The Abbot sat down, and saw the confused look on the traveller's face. ""My son"", he said. ""We love a good laugh, here at the monastery. We tell jokes at dinner time, and we all enjoy each others' company. In fact, we tell the jokes so often, that we ended up just numbering them - it makes it so much easier to just say the number of the joke. Why don't you try it?""

The traveller thinks for a bit and then stands up and shouts out ""45"". More laughter, more feet stomping, nods of appreciation, comments of 'our guest is joining our traditions"" and that sort of thing.
The traveller is quite pleased with the response, and thinks to himself, ""I'll have another go!""
So he stands up and shouts out ""112!!"".
There was a moment of shocked silence, and then a deafening roar as every monk there laughed loudly, banging on the tables, stomping their feet, patting each other on the back, pointing to our traveller in obvious appreciation. Some even wiped tears of laughter from their eyes.
The traveller sat down again next to the Abbot, feeling quite proud of himself and turned to the Abbot saying, ""They liked that one, did they?""
""Oh yes,"" said the Abbot, ""That was a good one - they haven't heard that one before!""","Another ""guy goes to a monastery"" joke - an oldie but a goodie",15

post,53fmgg,2qh72,jokes,false,1474253642,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/53fmgg/monk/,self.jokes,,"A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.",Monk...,103

""So, you're a politician..."" ""Well, yes, is that a problem?"" ""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician. ""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears...

Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!"" ""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks.

Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?"" ""No sir!"" says the man. ""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"". ""Well...

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

The second said, ""And I had a large theater built in the house.""

she can't read anymore because she can't see very well.  I met this 
preacher who told me about a parrot who could recite the entire Bible. It took
ten preachers almost 8 years to teach him. I had to pledge to contribute
$50,000 a year for five years to the church, but it was worth it. 
Mama only has to name the chapter and verse, and the parrot will recite it.""

The other brothers were impressed. After the celebration Mama sent out
her ""Thank You"" notes.

She wrote: Milton , the house you built is so huge that I live in only one
room, but I have to clean the whole house. Thanks anyway."" 
 
""Michael, you gave me an expensive theater with Dolby sound and it can
hold 50 people, but all of my friends are dead, I've lost my hearing, 
and I'm nearly blind. I'll never use it. Thank you for the gesture just the 
same."" 

""Marvin, I am too old to travel. I stay home; I have my groceries
delivered, so I never use the Mercedes. The thought was good. Thanks.""

""Dearest Melvin, you were the only son to have the good sense to give 
a little thought to your gift. That chicken was delicious. Thank you so much.""

post,53af7j,2qh72,jokes,false,1474166273,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/53af7j/long_religion_in_a_kingdom_of_the_past_a_long_way/,self.jokes,,"... there was a village that lived on the edges of the kingdom, by a mountainside. The village was intially called ""Trifville"", as a play on how worthless it was to haggle in the village market - over time, people began affectionately calling the village ""Triddville"", and the villagers, ""Tridds"".

The town itself was very religious; there were four sectors of the village - the Christian sector, which followed the teachings of the town priest; the Islamic sector, which followed the teachings of the town imam; and the Jewish sector, which followed the teachings of the town rabbi. The former two were born in the village, and the lattermost was initially a traveler from another village who chose to stay.

One day, a giant appeared at the top of the mountain by the town, bellowing and shaking the ground with each breath. Naturally, the people panicked - until each of the religious figures claimed that the monster was a punishment from the heavens for having a poor market. The villagers were then torn amongst themselves; there was much rioting and pillaging between the three sectors, until a small boy, furious with the riots, screamed at the top of his lungs, ""IF THOSE BASTARDS ALL THINK THEY KNOW WHAT THE TROUBLE IS, LET THEM FIX IT!""

There was silence.

There was more silence.

There was prolonged silence.

A slow chant rose from the villagers, ""GIANT - THEY SLAY"". It got faster. It got more energetic.

It got wild.

Eventually, the villagers raided the homes of the priest, imam, and rabbi (which were previously untouched), and threatened them to stoning if they had not solved the giant problem.

While they had been reluctant at first, when the villagers had kidnapped all of their daughters as hostages, the priest, imam, and rabbi seemed overly enthusiastic to solve the problem immediately.  

First, the priest made the trek up the large mountain. Being the middle-aged man he was, he took a week to climb the sizable spike. When he encountered the giant, he said, ""Brother Giant, can you not spare the villagers of your incessant breathing and stomping. My young girl wakes up every night, scared, because of your actions.""

The giant, without a word, kicks the priest in the testicles so hard that the priest loses his balance, and falls backward down the mountain. He is dead before he touches the base of the mountain.

Second, the imam made the hike up the large mountain. Being the somewhat seniorly man he was, he took a two weeks to climb the colossal mound. When he encountered the giant, he said, in Arabic, ""Brother Giant, shall you spare the villagers of your ever frequent breathing and stomping. My dearest children wake up every night, scared, because of your actions.""

The giant, with a puzzled look, kicks the imam in the balls so hard that the imam loses his balance, and somersaults backward down the mountain. He is dead before he can scream.

Lastly, the rabbi made the journey to the top of Mount Giant. At the base of the mountain, he saw the rotting bodies of the priest and the imam; their abdomens were noticably caved in. The rabbi, slightly unnerved, just muttered to himself, *""...just a test... it's just a test...""* Being the elderly man he was, he took a three weeks to climb the colossal mound. When he encountered the giant, he said, ""Brother Giant, could you please leave us?""

Suprisingly enough, the Giant said, ""Okee dokee,"" and, from then on, the village was not disturbed from the Giant any longer. The rabbi, overwhelmed by his sucess, blurted out, ""My brothers - the priest and the imam, I've seen them at the base of this mountain, with their abdomens caved inwards. Why haven't I recieved the same fate?""

The Giant, smiles and says, ""Silly rabbi! Kicks are for Tridds!""

post,539kwp,2qh72,jokes,false,1474152714,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/539kwp/the_cheerio_joke/,self.jokes,,"On a planet called Cheeriolia, the population is divided into three societal classes: Cheerios are the lower class, Applejacks are in the middle, and Fruit Loops are the wealthy elite. One cannot intermarry between classes, unfortunately, and discrimination is rampant between them. An authoritarian government keeps very close tabs on individual classes and poverty lines criss-cross through big cities. Cheerios are doomed to a certain limit of wealth, Applejacks cannot earn more than Fruit Loops, and Fruit Loops must pay even heavier taxes. Life is difficult, and each class has its own unique complaints with the way they are forced to live.

A Cheerio named Joe worked at a local Wal-Mart as a cashier, a position he had held for years because his boss is a penny-pinching Applejack. One day, he was bagging groceries for a fellow Cheerio when a Fruit Loop walked through the door, frantically darting her eyes around, panting. She ran down a couple isles, found what she was looking for, and hurried to the check-out area. The Fruit Loop had jumped into the same express lane that Joe was manning. Even though the line was moving quickly, it was an especially busy day and there were quite a few people in the queue. She exclaimed,

“Won’t this line move any faster?”

The Cheerio in front of her shook his head and chuckled to himself. The Fruit Loop didn’t notice. She stood with her one item tucked under her arm, glaring at the rest of the line. Five minutes later, she was at the line’s head. Joe looked at her, in awe of her beauty. She was, perhaps, the most beautiful Fruit Loop he had ever seen. His mouth fell open as she said,

“I don’t usually shop here…”

Her pejorative comment had no effect on Joe, who still could not believe his eyes. The Fruit Loop had to snap her fingers in Joe’s face for him to finally take her credit card. She paid and left, but Joe could not stop thinking about her. He resolved to find out who she was and make her fall in love with him. There was only one problem: he was a Cheerio, and she was a Fruit Loop—even if she *did* love him, it was against the law for them to marry. Still, the thought of love and marriage was hopeful, and it occupied his mind for the next two years.

During those next two years, Joe never stopped thinking about the beautiful Fruit Loop. He worked as hard as he could, bought a chin-up bar to hand in the doorway of his tiny apartment, and subscribed to a gym membership. Joe lost some weight, started running in the mornings, and let his beard grow out. One day, much to his surprise, he awoke to a brand-new, hot-pink body that smelled very sweetly of apples. He had made the jump from Cheerio to Applejack! 

That morning, Joe walked through the doors of the Wal-Mart and his co-workers stared at him, with their mouths agape. He continued working as a cashier, but one day the CEO of Wal-Mart fired Joe’s boss and promoted him to manager at the request of his co-workers, who knew his humble nature and diligence would help their local Wal-Mart. He doubled their pay, and even helped stock shelves when he had nothing else to do. 

A few months passed, and Joe still worked out after the workday ended, but he became very lonely. The beautiful Fruit Loop still was all he thought about, so he devoted even more of his time to work and committed himself to physical fitness. In his deluded aspirations, he sought to win the heart of the Fruit Loop without even knowing her name. 

Just as his hope was running low, the same Fruit Loop entered the Wal-Mart, again looking very rushed, and ran down the aisle frantically looking for another item. As she was running around a corner, she ran into Joe, who was carrying a stack of boxes. They collapsed onto the floor. The Fruit Loop began to shout obscenities as Joe helped her up.

“Sorry, miss.”

She sighed.

“No, I’m sorry. I ran into you. I should have been watching.”

“I’m Joe.”

His voice quivered slightly, and he held out his hand.

“Vanessa.”

Joe led Vanessa to the cashiers, where he let his Cheerio employee go on break so he could check Vanessa out. He took a good look at her, and it was as if not a day had passed since he had seen her last. The only difference now was that he was a jacked-up Applejack who felt much closer to winning Vanessa’s heart. She took her item and left once again. Thoughts of marrying Vanessa didn’t leave his mind for three more years.

In those three years, Joe committed every waking moment to physical fitness. He was promoted at work and given authority over all the Wal-Marts in the tri-state area. Joe was still kind to his employees and gave them high salaries, but the economy was booming and he earned quite a bit of money without working very long hours. He attended some formal parties for Wal-Mart executive Fruit Loops and saw they way they lived, so luxuriously. Joe envied it. But all his wishes and hopes relied on his body and what he was made of. He did not lose hope. And one day, much to Joe’s glee, he awoke to a brand-new, sugar-coated, bright blue body. He was finally a Fruit Loop!

That morning, Joe walked from his penthouse flat to the office and, like he usually did, ran up the stairs. All the cubicles were full when he entered, and everyone peered over to get a look at his new body. All the Applejacks in accounting were amazed, all the Applejacks in IT were amazed, and all the Applejacks in administration were amazed. His boss, the Fruit Loop directly under the CEO, took notice quickly and put in a good word with the CFO, who put in an even better word with the CEO. Both thought very highly of Joe and both thought he would make the perfect CEO one day. No-one knew that the CFO was sleeping with the CEO’s wife, however, and when the CEO found out, he delved so deep into alcohol that the board of trustees voted to let him go and replace him with Joe. 

One day, Joe was walking down the street to the office when he passed Vanessa. She had not aged one day in the last three years, and he immediately stopped to reintroduce himself. Vanessa was surprised it was Joe, because she remembered him to be a mere Applejack, but she did remember him nonetheless. He asked her out for some drinks later that night, and she agreed.

Later that night, they met at a bar and got to talking. Joe discovered that Vanessa, despite her goddess-like beauty, had never been married and had only dated a couple other Fruit Loops. He was just as surprised when Vanessa said that she was interested in dating himself. Joe replied with a definite “yes” without hesitation. His dream had come true; now he was to only win her heart. When Joe got home that night, he put himself through the most strenuous workout he had ever done and fell asleep immediately after he had done his last deadlift. 

Vanessa and Joe dated for eight months. Then, one day, on the terrace of his penthouse overlooking the harbor, Joe asked her to marry him. Vanessa screamed “yes!”

Over the next eight years, Joe and Vanessa were faithful to each other. They had three healthy, beautiful children, and Joe continued working as the CEO of Wal-Mart. The company flourished and Joe was able to buy a large mansion out in the country where he hoped to raise his children. He kept the penthouse in the city in case he had to work late, but most of the time he was able to drive home and read his kids their bedtime stories. Vanessa never aged a day, and Joe loved her with all his heart. He had finally fulfilled his dream, and life was good.

One day, Joe was finished with an important meeting and decided to clock out and drive home to surprise his children. He had forgotten what time the school day ended and arrived in the early afternoon at his mansion. A sleek, black sedan was in the driveway, and Joe didn’t know whose it was. He cracked open the front door slowly, and went straight to the bedroom without calling his wife’s name. Joe had a terrible feeling in his stomach. He threw the door to the master bedroom wide open and saw Vanessa in bed with the old CFO. He screamed obscenities at him and threw him out of his house. Vanessa tried to explain that it meant nothing, that she still loved him, but Joe would have none of it. He packed a bag, booked a plane ticket, called the office saying that he was taking a brief leave of absence, and drove to the airport, distraught. 

He boarded a plane destined for Hawai’i and watched as his home grew smaller and smaller in the distance. Joe decided he would stay in Hawai’i for a week to get his head straight and figure out what to do. When the plane arrived the next day, Joe found a five-star hotel right next to the beach. The view was lovely, and every morning before the sun was at its hottest, he would walk along the waves and think about his life. He was troubled, but at the same time he was proud of himself and what he had made of himself. Joe wasn’t sure what to do.

One morning, he passed a young, beautiful woman walking the other way. She was a Fruit Loop, like himself, and though she was not as pretty as Vanessa, she was still breathtaking. Joe stopped, introduced himself, and offered to take her up to a favorite bar by the beach for some fruit juice. The Fruit Loop said her name was Merlot and that she, too, was on vacation. They had a few drinks and talked all afternoon; they told each other their darkest secrets and, by sunset, Joe felt like he knew Merlot better than he had ever known his wife. As the moon was rising, they kissed under the stars, and Joe took Merlot back to his hotel room.

The next day, they both walked along the water. The passed the same bar they had stopped at the day before, and a sign hung in the window: 

“We’re closed for the Juice Festival on 3rd Street.”

The couple was puzzled, so the walked hand in hand to the location the sign specified. A large, frightening bouncer-Applejack stood in the doorway, so Joe gave him a tip and he let them in. The party inside was loud and exciting. Along the far wall, rows and rows of booths surrounded a buffet line. The music playing was so catchy, however, that Merlot dragged Joe onto the dancefloor. Hours passed, and they were soon tired. Looking for a place to sit, the picked a booth. They kissed again. Joe felt like a new breakfast cereal. 

Smells coming from the buffet were so enticing that they had to try a little of everything. They stood in line and chatted up some of the other vacationers who were there for the food and drink. Soon, all the salty food had rendered them both very thirsty. When Joe offered to go find the line for the juice they had seen advertised, he stood between the islands of food and looked around. He didn’t see any juice. There was no punch line.",The Cheerio Joke,19

Tim sighs, but he's a good kid, and doesn't fuss about it. They barely walk a few feet, when Scrooge sees a passing taxi and hails it. 

""How much would you charge to take us home to Springfield Avenue?"", Scrooge asks the cab driver. 

""Springfield Avenue? Around twenty bucks."", says the driver. 

""Oof! That's too much. We won't be requiring your services, thank you.""

The cab drives off. Tim turns to his grandfather, exasperated. ""Did you *really* think that a taxi to Springfield Avenue would cost less than a bus ride?"", he asks, incredulously.

""Don't be ridiculous, of course not."", Scrooge scoffs.

""Then why did you bother flagging down the taxi, Gramps?!""

""Foolish boy! We would've saved $6 by not taking the bus, now we're saving $20 by not taking the taxi!""

The first one was named Chad, the second was named Carter. Chad hated Carter, and Carter hated Chad even more! One day, Chad was in a bar, drinking a tequila. Carter, drunk, came over to Chad and punched him as hard as a wooden plank could. Chad got angry and retaliated, kicking Carter in the face. They got into a bloody and violent bar fight. They both got arrested. They were sentenced to 8 months in jail, and a hefty fine for damages done to the bar. While in jail, Carter and Chad found that they had many similarities, and soon became best friends in jail. When they got out, they decided to start a business together. 
3 years later, Chad and Carter's Hardware store was very successful and they were making tons of money. But, one day, they realized that one of their suppliers had stopped shipping them products! And this wasn't even the first time that they have done this! The 2 wooden planks got very angry, and decided to go give the owner of the factory a piece of their mind. They went over to the factory, which was called, ""Plank and Nail Industries."" Chad thought that this name was a bit creepy. They entered the factory, and saw a quite normal looking lobby, with a quite normal looking wooden plank at the counter. ""Hey"", Chad said. ""We would like to speak with your piece of trash manager."" The clerk gave them a weird look, but picked up his phone nonetheless and called him. ""Please wait 5 minutes while he comes down,"" he said. So they waited. The owner didn't come. ""Where is he?"" Carter said. ""He is a very busy man,"" the clerk replied. They waited half an hour. Then 2 hours. Eventually even the clerk seemed very confused. 4 hours later, an angry Chad shouted, ""Where is he!?"" The clerk replied ""I am really not sure. Please just wait a few more minutes."" Chad sighed, and then looked to Carter. ""How are you feeling?"" Carter smacked his lips and said,

The man agreed and told her that the paint brushes and everything she would need was in the garage.

A crowd gathers around the helpless pedestrian, all wanting a look at the man and thinking about how to help him, although he's in a sticky situation that looks quite inescapable.

Now please, is anyone here a fireman, a body builder, an engineer, anything that could help this poor man?""

""Madam, can you or do you know of any way to help this man?"" 

After a long minute of panting the women finally opens her mouth.

He first visits a hardware store, tying the dog up outside. Upon arriving, he asks where he can find the ""fuckets"". The lady asks if he means ""buckets"", to which he replies ""Yef, that's what I thed, a fucket"".

After he buys his bucket, he decides to have some lunch. He goes to a hotdog stand and asks for ""a hotdog on a bum wif kethup and muftad"". The lady looks at him strangely, but sells him a hotdog on a bun. He pays for it while juggling the dog's leash and the bucket, then strolls off, ready to head home.

As he's walking, his dog catches sight of some pigeons and wants to give chase. The man, unable to juggle lunch and his new red bucket, accidentally lets go of the lead, and the dog goes bolting towards the group of birds on the ground.

Knowing he's unable to do everything at once, he turns to the lady nearby and handing her the food and pail, asks her:

""Will you hold my bum and fucket, while I go get my cock and spanket?""
