post,840rrl,2qh72,jokes,false,1520907701,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/840rrl/my_friend_got_fired_yesterday_long/,self.jokes,,"I’m absolutely livid. My friend Renny has had a really tough life. He grew up with a sort of moderate lisp, where he had a hard time pronouncing the “r” sounds, especially at the beginning of a word.

This made introducing himself very hard at school. The kids teased him very badly, calling him “Wendy.” I bonded with Renny early on, and tried to stop the bullying when I could. Unfortunately, we had different teachers, so I could only back him up at recess.

By the time we hit high school, Renny’s social anxiety had hit a bit of a critical point. He became a kleptomaniac. A little chalk here, someone’s eraser there... It all blew up in his face when he had taken a sentimental pen from a kid with down syndrome. The students and parents flipped their shit, but thankfully the staff were understanding. They reached an agreement with Renny’s parents to send him to therapy. 

Fast forward a few years later, I bump into Renny at the local college. He looked great! I asked him how he was, how he was doing, etc. We ended up picking up our friendship right where we left off, becoming good friends again. His lisp was still present, but I didn’t really catch him taking anything, so I suppose therapy worked!

So one night, on one of our school breaks, we decide to take a trip down to the local casino. We dressed our sharpest, brought a bit of money we had saved up, expecting to blow it all right away. It didn’t really matter, we needed the laugh.

I blew through my money pretty quickly. Ren was down to only a chip or two, and then started turning his luck around. He kept winning, and winning, and winning. He had close to ten times what he had walked in with! I told him that was great, well head back out now and he can buy us pizza until we pee pepperoni.
Ren just shook his head and said that he had a good feeling about this, and placed everything on the next bet.

Now, I don’t understand a lot of the mathematics of gambling odds, but I do know that Renny really had it stacked against him. It was a stupid move. Lo and behold, he blew it all.

Now, like I said, we went in there expecting to lose money, so that wasn’t what I was worried about. What worried me is the way he took to gambling. It reminded me of when he would steal sharpeners and erasers from the other kid’s pencil pouches.

Our break ended, but Renny didn’t really come back. He kept going out to the casino. I’m not sure if it was related, if he had only beat one demon by chasing it out with another, but he definitely had an addiction. 

Halfway through the term, Renny dropped out, was banned from the casino, and was almost homeless. A bad beating from owing some money to some scummy people was his wake up call... because at that point, he called me, and asked me to take him to rehab. 

Three years later, Renny had found his passion, and graduated from a smaller vocational course in his field.

Renny was now a chef! And holy fuck, could he cook. We had some steady girlfriends at that point, and the four of us would get together, and we would just be absolutely wowed by what Renny could come up with. I told him he should make a restaurant someday. He just smiled and said he just might.

You see, the casino Renny had been banned from got a new manager for the staff. This manager happened to be Renny’s uncle. After a chat with the other seniors and even the owner, Renny’s uncle convinced them to let Renny work in the kitchen.

People were worried, but Renny proved them all wrong. People started going to the casino just for the food! They actually had plans to open a restaurant section just to keep up.

That is, until Renny’s girlfriend split. Which wasn’t so bad in of itself. He was bummed, but still very happy with his job, supervised by his tough, but loving uncle... who, unfortunately, passed away two weeks following Ronny’s break up.

Needless to say, Renny was feeling vulnerable. So what can you do when life kicks you down? Nothing, because life’s not done kicking yet.

Enter Thomas the Entitled Engine. Thomas was, by all accounts, an unpleasant human being. He was, however, the son of the owner, and hence untouchable.

Guess who takes up the job on managing staff?

Yup, Thomas.

Now, if Thomas was just a nitwit with an inferiority complex that made him ultra controlling, it may not have been that bad. Shitty, but tolerable. 

No, what made Thomas so reprehensible is that he never matured past grade 4. Do you remember how Renny was teased in school? It was the same damn thing.

Thomas would make fun of Renny’s lisp! Not in a  playful way. Not in a way that could be laughed off as a badly placed joke... no. Thomas made fun of Renny to try and make Renny feel small so Thomas could feel big. He even started calling him ‘Wendy.’

Needless to say, Renny spiralled downwards agin. First the gambling came back... then the kleptomania.  It was awful. Renny kept on taking bigger and bigger gambles, and had moved on from stealing small cutlery to ladles and butcher knives! The greater the chance of being caught, the better. Thomas kept documenting everything. Instead of giving Renny the chance to clean up again and get himself together, they let him go.

Furious, I stormed down to the casino and pulled Thomas aside. 

I asked him if it was because of his lisp, and a cheeky smile appeared at the corner of his lips. He said no.

I asked him if it was because he started gambling again.
He said no.

“Why the *fuck* did you fire Renny then?”






“Because he was a whisk taker.”",My friend got fired yesterday [long],8

His parents loved him too, so they let him have his dream job, a conductor. He would spend all day and all night looking at trains. He was 18 and he needed a job. He saw that his dream job was hiring, so he applied to conductor school. He learned all about everything in a train. He studied day and night to pass the final exams. He had studied for a full day straight, and went to take the test. He finished the test in an hour, the fastest it has ever been completed. The next week he got his test back. He had failed. All his hopes and dreams were gone, so he went to his teacher and asked her how he could become a conductor. She said he could retake the test next year. So the boy studied and studied day and night just to pass the test. It was exam day, and he took the test. He set the record again for completing the test in an astonishing 45 minutes. He failed. He became really depressed and he asked the teacher again. His hopes quickly ignited when he heard her say he could retake it one last time next year. The boy studied and studied for as long as he could. It was time to take the test again. He managed to break the record again completing it in 30 minutes. The next week, he failed. He was so depressed. When he left, he saw a train parked at a station. He quickly jumped into the control room and started to drive again. He crashed the train and everybody but him died. He was arrested and was sentenced to the death penalty. The guard at the prison asked him what he wanted for his last meal before he was executed. He said he wanted the copper apple from the depths of the Amazon river. The prison sent out the best explorers to find the apple. They brought it back to him, and he ate it. He said, ""Wow! This is the best apple I have ever had!"" It was time for his execution. They strapped him into the chair and pulled the switch. Nothing happened. They raised the power, and still nothing happened. They told him he would be executed another day. They day of his execution, he asked for the jade apple of the depths of the Gobi desert. The same explorers went to find the apple, and they found it. They gave it to him and he ate it. He again loved the apple so much. They strapped him in again and flipped the switch. Nothing happened. They told him they would do it tomorrow and he asked for the crystal apple from the sewers of NYC. The explorers found the apple and gave it to him. He said it was the best apple he had ever had and there was no way of changing that. They strapped him in once again and flipped the switch. It was at it's highest capacity. Once again, nothing. They asked what was wrong. He said, ""Well, I guess I'm just a bad conductor.""",A joke about trains,3

After walking around for awhile, John starts to feel annoyed by all the attention Wendy's beautiful body is attracting, especially since many of the strangers are obviously more well endowed than he is. Wendy notices John's annoyance and the couple leave. 

Once back at their hotel, John decides to take a walk by himself to clear his head when he stumbles upon a tattoo shop. John decides he will show his love and devotion to Wendy by getting her name tattooed down the length of his privates (W near the head, Y near the base). Surely she will love that.He gets the tattoo and returns to the hotel to show Wendy, who is ecstatic with John's decision.

Once John is able to remove the bandages, the couple decide to make another trip to the nude beach. This time John doesnt feel bad at all about the attention Wendy gets. They get hungry and approach a hotdog vendor to see about some lunch. While waiting for their order, Wendy looks down and sees a W and a Y on the man's privates. 

Wendy: Look honey, his wife's name must be Wendy, too!

The vendor looks confused, so the couple explain about John's tattoo.

After a brief hello with his new mom, the newborn boy is taken off to the maternity ward.

After a while, the dad takes a stroll over to the ward to see his new son through the glass, but notices an empty cradle instead. Concerned, he stops a nearby nurse walking by and asks for an update.

""Excuse me. Where has my son been taken?"" he said.

""Oh...I have no idea. Let me go inquire with the head nurse."" she replied.

After a few minutes, several maternity nurses, as well as the OBGYN come out from a back area to greet Mr. Wong.

""I'm sorry Vince, but we seem to have misplaced your boy. We've locked down the hospital and are looking everywhere for him. Don't worry.""

Frantic and in denial, Vincent grabs one of the nearby babies in another crib.

""You've made a mistake! This is my baby! This is my boy! SEE! I PAID FOR THIS GODDAMN WARD, AND I'M TAKING THIS BABY HOME!""

He holds up the obviously caucasian child in the face of all of the staff.

""Vince. We can't let you take that baby"" the doctor says.

takes him to the bar and tearfully tells the son he is proud of him.

Dad orders up the biggest, strongest drink for his boy. With all the bar
patrons looking on curiously and the bartender shaking his head in disbelief,
the boy takes his first sip of alcohol. Swoooop! A torso pops out!

begs his son to drink again. The patrons chant ""Take another drink!""

The bartender still shakes his head in dismay. Swoooop! Two arms pops out.

The father, crying and wailing, begs his son to drink again. The patrons
chant ""Take another drink!"" The bartender ignores the whole affair.

By now the boy is getting tipsy, and with his new hands he reaches down, grabs
his drink and guzzles the last of it. Swoooop! Two legs pop out. The bar is
in chaos. The father falls to his knees and tearfully thanks God.

The boy stands up on his new legs and stumbles to the left... then to the
right... right through the front door, into the street, where a truck runs
over him and kills him instantly. The bar falls silent. The father moans in
grief.

""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure."" So he sat down and wrote an email:

I have a confession to make.  I have been riddled with guilt these past few months and have been trying to get up the courage to tell you face-to-face, but I am at least telling you in text as I cannot live with myself a moment longer without you knowing.  The truth is I have been sharing your wife, day and night when you’re not around.  In fact, probably more than you.  I haven’t been getting it at home recently, but I know that’s no excuse.  The temptation was just too great.  I can no longer live with the guilt and hope that you will accept my sincerest apology and forgive me. It won’t happen again.  Please suggest a fee for usage and I’ll pay you.

Fred, feeling so angered and betrayed then grabbed his gun, ran next door and when Alan opened the door, he shot and killed him.  He returned home, poured himself a stiff drink, and sat down on the sofa.  Fred took out his phone where he saw a second message from Alan.

The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Man took the half a lemon and went away.

The next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Man took the half a lemon and went away.

The next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Man took the half a lemon and went away.

Now the Monk was becoming curious as to why the Man always wanted half a lemon, so he decided to ask the Man about it the next time he came. So as usual, the next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Monk tried to ask the Man why he wanted half a lemon, but the Man took the half a lemon and ran away.

The next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Monk tried to ask the Man why he wanted half a lemon, but the Man took the half a lemon and ran away. So, the Monk started chasing the man down the mountain, but he didn’t have good running shoes and the Man got away.

The Monk, very curious about why the man always wanted half a lemon, went out and bought running shoes to prepare for the next time the man came. And sure enough, the next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Monk tried to ask the Man why he wanted half a lemon, but the Man took the half a lemon and ran away. So, the Monk started chasing the man down the mountain. Just as the Monk was about to catch the Man, the Man reached a river and jumped in and swim across. The Monk didn’t know how to swim, so he had to turn back.

The Monk, even more curious about why the man always wanted half a lemon, taught himself how to swim to prepare for the next time the Man came. And sure enough, the next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Monk tried to ask the Man why he wanted half a lemon, but the Man took the half a lemon and ran away. So, the Monk started chasing the man down the mountain. When the Man reached the river, he jumped in and swam across. The Monk jumped in the river and swam across too. After swimming across the river, the Man ran up to a cliff and started to climb. The Monk didn’t know how to climb so he had to turn back.

The Monk, ever more curious about why the man always wanted half a lemon, taught himself how to climb to prepare for the next time the Man came. And sure enough, the next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Monk tried to ask the Man why he wanted half a lemon, but the Man took the half a lemon and ran away. So, the Monk started chasing the man down the mountain. When the Man reached the river, he jumped in and swam across. The Monk jumped in the river and swam across too. After swimming across the river, the Man ran up to a cliff and started to climb. The Monk climbed up the cliff right behind the man. Once the Man reached the top, he ran over to the wreckage of an airplane and locked himself in. The Monk didn’t know how to pick a lock so he had to turn back. 

The Monk, now extremely curious about why the man always wanted half a lemon, taught himself how to pick locks to prepare for the next time the Man came. And sure enough, the next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Monk tried to ask the Man why he wanted half a lemon, but the Man took the half a lemon and ran away. So, the Monk started chasing the man down the mountain. When the Man reached the river, he jumped in and swam across. The Monk jumped in the river and swam across too. After swimming across the river, the Man ran up to a cliff and started to climb. The Monk climbed up the cliff right behind the man. Once the Man reached the top, he ran over to the wreckage of an airplane and locked himself in. The Monk followed and picked the lock to let himself in.

Now that the Man couldn’t run away, the Monk asked the Man again, “Why do you always come on Wednesday and ask for half a lemon?” The Man replied, “Okay, I’ll tell you. But please, Father be good and don’t tell anyone.”

**And the Monk was good and never told anyone.**

He was a professional gamer and had no time for real world items. One day, he decided that he needed to clear out his room and found all his old toys. Without a moment's notice, he placed the whole bag in the garbage bin outside his house. However, there was one toy that he had never played with before...

The toy's name was Marley. He was a doll that reached up to about 90 cm in height and resembled a human. When he was sent to the garbage bin, he was full of sorrow, as he had not been played with since his creation. He cried to God, ""What a cruel world this must be! Was I born just to lay in a heap and rot!"".

Surprisingly, God replied to him, ""This was not meant to be. However, I am willing to give you a second chance, by giving you a life to fulfil."". God animated Marley to make him a 164 cm human who was 16 years old. Marley cried out in joy, ""Thank you God! I will not waste this chance!""

Marley was an intellectual, as he had spent most of his life just observing the surroundings. He did not require food, water or sleep, so he put his full attention towards studying. It was truly not surprising that he always stood first in his class.

He ranked first on the admission exam and with a great portfolio, he entered Stanford for his graduation. He became a financial genius and was envied by all the students around him.
However, all was not well for Marley...

As time went on, Marley had tired out his body, to the point where, one day, his legs refused to work. He was plagued with sorrow as he was the cause for the wear and tear on his body. He was also filled with sadness because he could not fulfil his potential. He could not drive because he could not pass the breathalyser test (because he never breathed) and now, was all on his own. He couldn't even get a wheelchair because nobody would push it around for him. Such was the depth of his loneliness.

But one day...

There was a knock on his door. He was surprised because nobody ever visited him. He was shocked as he couldn't believe his eyes. 
I mean, you wouldn't believe it if, out of the blue, Simon Cowell entered your room and invited you to be a judge for ""Britain's Got Talent""

But this was not Simon Cowell.

It was Gates. Bill Gates.

Bill Gates said, ""Marley, I've heard all about your condition. But we cannot let such potential go to waste. Therefore, I am hiring you to join my company, Microsoft.""

Marley pinched himself out of disbelief. This couldn't be real, could it?. ""What position are too hiring me as, sir?""

""The Treasurer of Microsoft. That should give you enough money to spend time on actual pressing matters, I think.""

Shock. Amazement. Disbelief. All of these emotions ran through Marley's mind. But the worst thought on his mind was the thought of Betrayal.

He was filled with a crude sense of disbelief mixed with anger. He could not control the rage flowing within him. He simply could not.

Marley shouted, looking at the heavens, ""GOD!  DID YOU CREATE MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE JUST FOR... JUST FOR..."" , as he broke down in tears, partly of anger and partly because he had been betrayed. 

A smile was visible on God's face as he said, ""The human proverbs always seem to come true!""

""One man's trash is now another man's treasurer.""

As they are laying out enjoying the sun a bee flies right up between the wife’s legs. The husband rushes her to the hospital. 

He explains to the doctor that his wife is allergic to bees and begs him to help. 

Sensing the urgency of the situation, the doctor comes up with an unorthodox solution. He suggests that the husband should dab a little honey on his dick and stick it inside the wife. The bee should be attracted to the honey and come right out. 

The husband reluctantly agrees but with all the stress of the situation he can’t get up to perform. 

The doctor acts fast and says “I’ll have to do it myself or this woman may die”. The husband gives his consent and the doctor dips his dick in honey and slides into the wife. He pulls out. No bee. He repeats the process. Again he is unsuccessful.

One night the couple is driving home. The guy is driving. Slowly. The frustration grows inside the girl and she blurts out “Why don’t you live a little? You are too scared to even drive fast”. The guy decides to voice his annoyance as well. “Why are you taking so long to take a step closer to us being intimate?”

Just then the couple had a simultaneous idea. They decided that for every 5 mph over the speed limit the guy drove, the girl would remove an article of clothing. In no time the car is speeding down the road and the girl is completely naked. 

The guy can’t help but stare at the naked girl and loses control of the car. They both are ok but the guy is trapped in the car and the girl’s clothes have been thrown from the car. “You’ve gotta go get help” the guy says. “Ok. But I’m naked.

He walks to where Queen Elizabeth II is waiting to welcome him with much pomp and circumstance.  

They are ushered into a new silver Rolls Royce, then chauffeured to Buckingham Palace.  

After tea, they climb aboard an open-topped, perfectly restored antique coach drawn by four stunningly beautiful white horses. As they roll leisurely to Westminster Abbey, they wave to masses of cheering Brits packing the city streets.  

Then all of a sudden the left rear horse uncorks a blast of flatulence that resonates and fouls the air for city blocks. It splits eardrums and shakes the coach. The stench is so horrible it’s hard to keep from gagging.  

The two leaders, however, having just met each other, somehow manage to act like nothing has happened.  

Finally, the Queen feels embarrassed to the point she feels she needs to say something.

""Mr. President,” she says, “On behalf of myself and my countrymen, I apologize for what just happened. As I'm sure you know, there are many things even a Queen can’t completely control."" 

Donald Trump, trying to respond in the most dignified manner possible, says, ""Your Majesty, don't think twice about it. Honestly, if you hadn't mentioned it, I’d have assumed it was one of the horses.""

Suddenly one of the mathematicians shouts: ""Conductor coming!"" All the mathematicians disappear into one washroom. The conductor checks the ticket of each engineer and then knocks at the washroom door: ""Your ticket, please."" The mathematicians stick the one ticket they have under the door, the conductor checks it and leaves. A few minutes later, when it is safe, the mathematicians come out of the washroom. The engineers are impressed.

When the conference has come to an end, the engineers decide that they are at least as smart as the mathematicians and also buy just one ticket for the whole group. This time the mathematicians have no ticket at all...

Again one of the mathematicians shouts: ""Conductor coming!"".
All the engineers rush off to one washroom. One of the mathematicians goes to that washroom, knocks at the door, and says: ""Your ticket, please...""","""Your ticket, please...""",582

Figuring he was just sleep deprived, he ignored the Voice, but the next morning, he heard the same voice: ""Quit your job, sell your car, sell your house, clear out your bank accounts, take the money and go to Vegas...""

Again, the man ignored the Voice, obviously, but every day for the rest of the work week the Voice would call to him: ""Quit your job, sell your car, sell your house, clear out your bank accounts, take the money and go to Vegas...""

Finally, figuring there was something to it, he heeds the Voice's advice. He quit his job, sold his car, sold his house, cleaned out his bank accounts, and booked a flight to Las Vegas.

As his plane landed, the man heard the Ghostly Voice again, this time saying, ""Get into the third cab you see, and have the cabby drive you to the Strip."" The man already did as the Voice first asked, so he figured he's in it for the long haul and better trust his Ghostly advisor, so he hails the third cab he sees, and sets off for the Strip.

As he steps out of the cab, the Ghostly Voice says, ""Good. Good. Now make your way to the Bellagio."" Off goes the man to the Bellagio...

As he enters the foyer of the Bellagio, the Ghostly Voice again instructs the man: ""Make your way to the Roulette tables, and look for a table with a croupier name Renaldo."" The man sets off, trusting with everything in his being the Ghostly Voice. After a few minutes of searching, the man finds the table with Renaldo the croupier.

As he approaches the table, the Ghostly Voice speaks up again, and the man can sense urgency in its Voice as it tells him: ""Now! Now! Put all your money on Eleven Black! Eleven Black!"" The man immediately does as the Voice says. Renaldo takes his bet, spins the wheel, and drops the ball...

Around, and around the ball spins in the roulette wheel, the Ghostly Voice excitedly chanting, ""Yes! Yes!"" After what seems like an eternity, the wheel begins to slow, and the ball comes to a rest in its slot: 

THIRTY RED.

The Ghostly Voice said, 

""Damn!""",One Day at Work...,23

""Father,"" they ask, ""How can you betray your church like that?""

As she bends over to look more closely, she unexpectedly farts. Very embarrassed, she looks around nervously to see if anyone noticed her little woops and prays that a sales person was not anywhere near. As she turns around, her worst nightmare materialises in the form of a salesman standing right behind her - good looking as well.
Cool as a cucumber, he displays all of the qualities one would expect of a professional in a store like Harrods. He politely greets the lady with, 'Good day, Madam. How may we help you today?
Blushing and uncomfortable, but still hoping that the salesman somehow missed her little 'incident', she asks, 'what is the price of this lovely bracelet?'
He answers, ""Madam - if you farted just looking at it - you're going to shit yourself when I tell you the price!""",A lady walks into Harrods.,90

After much prayer and consideration, they concluded the squirrels were predestined to be there and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will.

At the Baptist church the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistery.  The deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistery and let the squirrels drown themselves.  The squirrels liked the slide and, unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.

The Lutheran church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creatures.  So, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the Baptist Church.  Two weeks later the squirrels were back when the Baptists took down the water-slide.

But the Catholic church came up with a very creative strategy!  They baptized all the squirrels and made them members of the church.  Now they only see them at Christmas and Easter.

Not much was heard from the Jewish synagogue; they took the first squirrel and circumcised him.  They haven't seen a squirrel since.",SQUIRRELS IN CHURCH,171

His people believed a man's strength and courage came from his beard, and thus the man with the biggest beard was their chief.

After leading the band for many years, Benny began to feel uncomfortable wearing the beards, in this hot and dusty land. He wanted to shave it off, so he called his council together to get their advice.

When he said he wanted to shave, the councilmen were shocked. One said, ""Do you now remember the ancient legend, dire? The leader who removes his beard is cursed and made into a piece of earthenware.""

Benny had heard this legend, but being a modern man, he scoffed at the tale.

Being headstrong, he went ahead and cut and scraped away his once magnificent beard. As the final whisker was cut off, a huge dust storm came up. It lasted only a few seconds, and when it cleared, there was a man-sized clay vessel where only moments before had stood their leader.

The council then knew the legend must be true. Their conclusion?

Naturally, he is a bit anxious since this is the first time he leaves his precious USA. After looking which one he should visit, he gives it the ol' IDGAF treatment and picks a corrupt, authoritarian country, that is known to be anti-American. Nevertheless, he doesn't care, as long as he'll enjoy provoking the people over there, maybe create some ruckus about freedom &amp; democracy. Besides, he knows enough of the language.                                          

After a long arduous travel, he finally arrives in that country and gets to a hotel. In the evening, he wanders through town and goes to a restaurant to check the local cuisine. After entering, he immediately sees that the place is filled of anti-American propaganda. This doesn't discourage him though, while the people inside immediately guess he's an American. He takes a seat and grabs the menu, without a single word uttered from anyone.                                                

While he checks the food on the menu, he hears the TV turned on the national channel. It was the time when the news were on:

\- *Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Today, the American swines committed another crime against humanity in the Middle East. The reports say...*

He doesn't react. Though he is a bit irritated, the American doesn't say anything. Later, on the news:

\- *Moreover, the president of the United States has signed an executive order so that people, which don't address other people by their preferred pronouns, to be immediately imprisoned without having the right to prove their innocence in front of the law. So much of their so-called freedom of expression and...*

\- What the fuck? *says the American*. ”Executive order”? ”Pronouns”? ”Prove their innocence”? ”So-called freedom of expression”? The fuck is this lying garbage? What the hell, man. 

He goes back into checking the rest of the menu. Still, on the news:

\- *The American secret services continue to poison the American people with drugs and debauched, immoral, entertainment that is meant to distract the public from addressing the woes that plagues their country. Quite so, they're very efficient from distracting the American people from the most important issues at large, mainly vast corruption that plagues the Congress...*

\- Okay, enough is enough. TURN THAT SHIT OFF! *he yells*

The owner of the restaurant comes to his table to check on him:

\- Sir, what is the problem?                                       

\- What's the problem?! I tell you what's the problem, it's the fucking news! Everything they said is a complete lie, every news report, I heard all of 'em. I mean, you all know I'm American, you realized it by now. My country isn't perfect but it's a paradise compared to here. The news lie to you about my country, it's nowhere near as awful as your leaders make it out to be. I don't blame you for hearing these lies but I can't shut up to these callous accusations.

The owner tries to calm him:

\- Sir, you'll need to calm down. As a matter of fact, now that you made it clear that everything is a lie, would you like to hear an anecdote from us about your country?                                        

\- An anecdote? Okay, sure, but it better not be another fucking propaganda lie.                                

\- Oh, no sir, it's not. As a matter of fact, it's more about our leaders than yours.                         

\- Okay, *the American calmed down*, tell me.                                           

\- Do you know when our government doesn't hold important sessions during the workweek?

\- What an odd question. No, I don't know.

The interview only lasted a few moments and it turned out that the driving motive behind the artist’s weekly performances was to raise awareness for sea creatures that battle mental health disorders untreated. He also explained that the destruction of these painted pieces represents the creature’s deteriorated mental state.

...Could you be more specific? A book would be ""off Google"". 

Goes hand in hand with ""I live outside New York"". 
...Me too, in Europe. 

""It's always in the last place you look."" 
...I'd hope so. After locating it, this should be the final place you look. 

Couples with ""I've look everywhere and not found it"". 
...Iiight, it's went extra dimensional, then. 

""What on your mind?"" 
...Should it not be ""in""? Minds are mysterious things but I alway think of it enveloping my thoughts, not a stool to pile them on top of.

He reached a cloud, upon which was sitting a rather plump and very ugly woman.

""Screw me or climb the ladder to success,"" she said.

No way!, thought the man, so he climbed the ladder to the next cloud. On this cloud was a slightly thinner woman, who was slightly easier on the eye.

""Screw me hard or climb the ladder to success,"" she said.

""Well,"" thought the man, ""might as well carry on.""

On the next cloud was an even more attractive lady who, this time, was quite attractive.

""Screw me now or climb the ladder to success,"" she fluttered.

As he turned her down and went on up the ladder, the man thought to himself that this was getting better the further he went. On the next cloud was an absolute beauty. Slim, attractive, 10/10 model.

""Fuck me or climb the ladder to success,"" she flirted.

Unable to imagine what could be waiting, and being a gambling man, he decided to climb again. When he reached the next cloud, there was a 400-pound ugly man, armpit hair showing, flies buzzing around his head.

""Who are you?"" the man asked.

""Hello,"" said the ugly fat man said, ""my name is Cess!""",The ladder to success,12
