ife having an affair for some time now, so today I came home from work early. I just knew the guy was in my apartment, but I couldn't find him. I looked everywhere and was just about to give up, when I went out on the balcony of my 23rd story apartment and there he was hanging over the edge! He was just barely hanging on, there was no way he could climb back onto the balcony. It was a really stupid place to try to hide. I was livid, so I started punching him and clawing at his fingers, but he held on. Finally I went to get a hammer and started pounding on his fingers, and he fell down. But what really angered me was that he landed in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! I was so mad I grabbed the refrigerator, threw it off the balcony and it landed on him. Unfortunately I was so riled up by the incident I had a heart attack and died.""

St. Peter was taken aback, and said ""While you did die in a dramatic fashion, I think we need to look at that whole second degree murder before we let you in - off to limbo with you."" He then approached the second man and asked him how he had died.

""I was riding my exercise bike on the balcony of my 24th story apartment, when the thing broke and threw me over the railing! I grabbed furiously at the railing and slipped, but managed to catch on the balcony below mine. I tried to climb up but it just wasn't possible. I thought I was going to fall but then someone came out on the balcony. I thought he would help me, until he started hitting me! I held on as best I could, but when he got a hammer and started hitting me I finally couldn't hold on anymore and fell. Somehow, though, I fell in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! Just as I'm coming around, I look up and BAM this refrigerator lands on me. So here I am.""

St. Peter immediately admitted this second man to heaven, and pulled aside the third man and asked him for his story.

""Picture this: I'm hiding naked in a refrigerator...""",The refrigerator,1

One side of the equation stores as -&gt;A and the other as -&gt;B

Its basically just a brute force program that adjusts X to balance out the equation.

When Mr. Stevenson was eight years old, he asked another little boy if he would like a Hurts Donut. The other boy said yes. So he hit him on the arm and he said, ""Hurts Donut."" Five years later, Mr. Stevenson asked another boy about his same age at that time if he would like a Hurts Donut. when the boy said yes, Mr. Stevenson stabbed him over and over again in his eye and his cheek with a pencil, saying ""Hurts Donut."" Over the years, Mr. Stevenson did very well in school. On graduation day, he was sat next to another young man, who, like Mr. Stevenson, had earned high marks. When he asked the boy if he would like a Hurts Donut, the boy said, ""Not if you're gonna stab me in the eye with a pencil."" ""I wouldn't even touch you,"" said Mr. Stevenson. So when the boy agreed, he presented him with a photograph of the young man's fiancée at a bachelor party, on some guy's table, fucking herself with a beer bottle. As tears filled the young man's eyes, Mr. Stevenson was heard to say, ""Hurts Donut."" A few years later, Mr. Stevenson got a job as a sales clerk in an electronics store. Within a year, he was caught stealing and immediately incarcerated. When he asked his cellmate if he would like a Hurts Donut, his cellmate said yeah. So... he gave him a Hurts Donut. Over the years, Mr. Stevenson grew too old to take care of himself, so they put him in a hospital. One day, he asked the new nurse if she would like a Hurts Donut. In anticipation of her response, Mr. Stevenson began humming and making smacking noises with his mouth. When the nurse smiled and said, ""I know about you, Mr. Stevenson,"" Mr. Stevenson blurted out something totally incoherent and... and began to laugh.

Finally, after allowing this for a sufficient length of time, the therapist got up, walked around the desk and after asking the wife to stand, he embraced and kissed her long and passionately as her husband watched – with a raised eyebrow.

The woman shut up and quietly sat down in a daze. The therapist turned to the husband and said, ""This is what your wife needs at least 3 times a week. Can you do this?""

post,44vyvz,2qh72,jokes,false,1455011613,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/44vyvz/land_of_the_loons/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time, in a land not so very far away, there lived a village of people.  Funny little people called Loons.

The Loons were a peaceful people, a simple people, with a very simple diet.  The Loons could eat but one thing, and loved that one thing: Pure cane sugar.  Because of this, sugar was very precious to the Loons.

These happy people weren't without their troubles, however.  In fact, there was a blight upon the land in which they dwelt, in the form of a vicious, predatory monster.  The Medigrim.  This swift and cunning beast would come into the village in the dead of night, snatch a little Loon, and scamper off to have its meal.

The Loons attempted to dissuade the creature, of course. Unfortunately, they weren't equipped for violence, and weren't the brightest of groups, so attempts landed in failure.  They tried an offering of the only food they knew, sugar, which got ignored by the carnivore.  They tried launching a rock at it with a rudimentary catapult, but succeeded only in launching a Loon instead.  

These failed attempts at dissuading the beast repeated until one day, a clever little Loon came up with a clever little idea.  They could set a trap with the beast, and bait it so that the Medigrim was tempted to fall for it!  The village agreed, and set to digging.  They dug that hole all day until it was so deep they were sure the Medigrim could not get out.  Of course, that's where the plan faltered, because of course, the bait of choice was the only food to cross their minds.  Sugar!  So they filled that hole with lots and lots of sugar! So much sugar they were sure the hungry Medigrim would not notice he was trapped because he was busy devouring it all!  Satisfied with their work at the end of the day, the village slept.

At least... most of them did.  That night, a naughty little Loon woke up in the middle of the night, snuck out of his hut, and went to go to the trap.  The trap was still there, set and full of sugar.  The Loon's stomach growled.  He thought to himself, ""oh, a bite, a taste, that couldn't hurt, right?""  So he stepped into the hole, which was so full of sugar the top was barely below the surface.  He took his bite... and then another, and another, and on and on until he realized that he had eaten it all!  He looked up, and found that he was stuck at the bottom of the hole, beyond the reach of his jump or climb.

It was at that moment that he saw something else, something dreadful.  The Medigrim stared from above, its eyes mad with hunger.  It pounced, and gobbled that Loon up!  But in its hunger, it too made the same mistake that the Loon had before it.  It was stuck at the bottom of the trap.

The next morning, two things happened.  The others noticed the naughty Loon was missing, and the trap was discovered to have worked.  They saw the corpse of the deceased, and were very sad.  However, the sadness soon changed to praise, as he was lauded a hero of the Loons for sacrificing himself to get rid of this danger once and for all!  A statue was raised in his likeness, and the village celebrated this Loon!  Soon after, songs were dedicated to his memory.  In fact, if you listen carefully, you might recognize it - it goes like this:  ""Just a Loon full of sugar help the Medigrim go down!""",Land of the Loons,0

The new CEO called a press conference and tactfully laid the blame at the feet of the previous CEO. Satisfied with his comments, the press -- and Wall Street - responded positively, sales began to pick up and the problem was soon behind him.

About a year later, the company was again experiencing a slight dip in sales, combined with serious product problems. Having learned from his previous experience, the CEO quickly opened the second envelope. The message read, ""Reorganize."" This he did, and the company quickly rebounded.

“Ohhhh well for $20 you can get our house special and come in back and fuck a turkey”

“Why would I EVER want to do that?” the man asked

“It is by far the best sex you’ll have, guaranteed or your money back,” replied the shopkeeper.

The man contemplates for a while but decides he will spend the $20 bucks, it was free after all.

After 15 min the man comes out from the back and is the happiest he has ever been, screaming and shouting how it was the best sex he’s ever had and how he’s coming back with MORE money. He leaves the shop and an hour later returns with $50.

“ What can I get for $50?” the man asks.

The shop owner says “oh well we have a deal of the day, spend $50 dollars and look into our magic telescope, it will let you see amazing things!”

So the man pays the $50 and looks in the telescope to find he is watching two extremely attractive women having sex. “Oh wow! That’s amazing” the man says. “That is the greatest thing I have ever seen”

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down.

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound
The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say,
""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. 

Some years later, 
The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. 
The monks again accept him, feed him, even fix his car
That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.
The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""

The man says, ""All right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?""
The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.""

The man sets about his task.
Some 4-5 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.
He says, ""I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.""
The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says,
""The sound is right behind that door.""

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.
He says, ""Real funny. May I have the key?""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.
Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.
The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. 

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.
Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire,
So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is relieved to know its the end.
He unlocks the door,turns the knob, 
and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound

Well, one day Manning was sacked so hard, his front split open and his guts spilled out onto the turf.  Luckily, one of the best surgeons in the country was in the crowd, and he scooped up Manning's guts, shovelled them back inside, and sewed Manning up.  He continued the game, and went on to throw the winning touchdown pass.  That's how tough American football is.""

The Englishman said, ""That's quite tough, but there's an English footballer named Steven Gerrard who played for Liverpool and captained the national team. During one match, while rising up to meet a corner kick, Gerrard headed the ball so hard his head split open and his brains tumbled out onto the pitch.  Fortunately in the crowd, there was a quite splendid neurosurgeon who picked up the brains, dusted them off, and tucked them back into Gerrard's skull, before sewing back up.  Gerrard went on to play the rest of the match, and scored a magnificent winner in the 90th minute.  That's how tough English football is.""

The Australian said, ""That's pretty tough, but we had a footy player back in the day named Sam Newman, who had no guts, no brains, and still managed to play 300 games for his club.

Now, Jane is distraught and she tells me she needs to get some stuff from her work.

While at the mortuary I fart around a bit and look over some paperwork on her desk when I come across a paper with info on a male body they have there. One of the notations I see the word ""syphilis"".

  One day in the future, Barrack  Obama has a heart-attack and  dies. 
He immediately goes to hell,  where  the devil is waiting for him.         
 
""I don't know what to do here,"" says the devil. ""You are on my list, but I have no room for you. You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got a couple of folks here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.""
 
Obama thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room. 
 
In it was Ted Kennedy and a large pool of water. Ted kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in hell.
 
""No,"" Obama said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer, and I don't think I could do that all day long.""
 
The devil led him to the door of the next room.
 
In it was Al Gore with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.
 
""No, this is no good; I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day,"" commented Obama.
 
The devil opened a third door. Through it, Obama saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.
 
Obama looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, ""Yeah man, I can handle this.""
 
The devil smiled and said...........  
 
""OK, Monica, you're free to go.
",Obama died joke,26

Then he asks, “OK, how about once a year?”

One man in the back jumps up and down, jubilantly waving his hands. The therapist is shocked—this disproves his theory. “If you make love only once a year,” he asks, “why are you so happy?”

Once there the guy jumped up and smashed his face right into that bell and it was the most beautiful sound I had ever heard, I asked if he could show me again, he agreed and jumped smashing his face once more and the bells rang out but as he landed he lost his footing and sliped, falling straight down the middle of the steeple not hitting anything one the way down until he meet the floor and died, I was horrified and ran down to call the police, once they arrived one of the office asked if I knew the man's name and I replied; no, but his face rings a bell.",Dead ringer,1

John finds himself in heaven after dying in a car accident. He sees nothing but a golden ladder ahead of him and a sign telling him to climb it. He begins to climb, up through a layer of clouds. On the other side of the clouds is a beautiful woman, stark naked. She says to John, ""you may have your way with me for the rest of your afterlife, or you can climb the ladder to success."" Though tempted, John wonders what might be on the next level. He declines and keeps climbing. As he reaches the next layer he sees another, even more beautiful woman, naked too. Again she says, ""You may have your way with me for the rest of your afterlife, or you can climb the ladder to success."" John is very tempted, but still intrigued at what lies at the top. With a last peek he climbs yet further. As the reaches the next layer of clouds there stands a third, even more luscious woman. ""You may have your way with me for the rest of your afterlife or you may climb the ladder to success."" Getting the hang of this, John decides to climb yet higher. He reaches the top of the ladder at the next layer of clouds, and finds a completely nude man waiting for him. Before John could ask what had happened, the man spoke, ""Hi there John!

You name it, you got it"" now the son was turning 12 so the father figured it would be a game system and some games but all the son wanted was one pink ping pong ball. The dad followed up on his promise and got the son what he wanted. Next year came 13 and his dad told him the same thing. But this time the son wanted a little more. ""Two pink ping pong balls dad"" the dad was very confused. He owns one of the biggest businesses in America and can buy anything but his son is so easy to please. He buys  the balls but tells his son ""I will give these to you but first, can I know what you are doing with them?"" The son says ""please dad. Can I just have them?"" The father hands over the balls. These keeps happening for a few years and before his 16th birthday his dad asks again. This time the answer changes a little bit. ""Dad I think I want a garbage truck this year. Full of pink ping pong balls"" the father very confused asked"" son what would you do with all of those balls?"" The son just says ""please dad. I just really want them."" The dad begins to worry because he is close to having 50 ping pong balls already but they seem to just disappear but he gets his son the truck full and his son is in the truck for a few days and comes back home but all the ping pong balls are gone. On his 17th birthday the dad tells him that he can have anything except pink ping pong balls. ""But dad I was kind of hoping you would buy me a ware house full of pink ping pong balls this year."" The dad angry at first yells at the son. "" I can get you anything but if all you want is stupid ping pong balls then so be it."" So the dad buys the warehouse and has it filled with pink ping pong balls. 6 million balls to be exact. He drops his son off because he wants to spend the night there and when the father picks up his son the next morning all the pink ping pong balls are gone. The dad is so furious he just takes the son home and grounds him. 11 months go by and the son is in a horrific traffic accident and is left in critical condition. With 12 hours before  he turns 18 the doctor tells his dad ""I'm not sure he will make it through the night"" the dad starts crying but wants the son to have a good last birthday so he goes in the room and asks his son ""what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The son says ""dad... Can you get me... *cough* one pink ping pong ball?"" The dad says yes and goes to the store to buy his son one last gift. As he hands the boy the ball he says ""son please tell me what you are doing with all of these balls."" His son says ""okay. You have been fair my whole life so I owe it to you to tell you.

post,44crqd,2qh72,jokes,false,1454705033,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/44crqd/first_class_blonde/,self.jokes,,"A direct flight from New York to San Francisco was getting ready for departure and loading the passengers when a stunning 20-something blonde boards the plane.  She wordlessly bypasses the flight attendant waiting near the door and heads straight to first class.  The flight attendant catches a glimpse of the ticket as she passes by and notices that it is in fact an economy ticket.

""Excuse me""  The flight attendant says.  ""That's an economy ticket, so I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to find your seat in the back.  Our first class cabin is reserved for folks who have paid the first class fare in full.""

The blonde woman turns around and fires back ""I'm a young beautiful blonde. There are empty seats, no one sitting up here will be disappointed to have me nearby, so what are you gonna do about it?  If the seat is empty, is this really worth the argument?""

The flight attendant is flabbergasted and can barely respond let alone stop the woman from taking a first class seat.  Still, she knew that it would be wrong to let this woman sit with passengers who paid considerably more for the tickets.  She decides to seek help from the cockpit, and explains the situation to the captain and the co-pilot.

The co-pilot, upset by the nerve of the blonde volunteers to handle it, and goes back to the woman who was now enjoying champagne in her stolen seat and explains: 

""Miss, that's an economy ticket, so I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to find your seat in the back.  Our first class cabin is reserved for folks who have paid the first class fare in full.""

The blonde gives the same response as she did to the flight attendant, and her nerve shakes the co-pilot.  Dumbfounded, a little smitten by her beauty, and unable to respond, he returns to the captain and the flight attendant to report the situation.

The captain, looks back at the woman and turns to the co-pilot and flight attendant saying, ""No worries guys.  My wife's a blonde, I can handle this.""

The flight attendant and co-pilot watch from the cockpit as the captain casually saunters up to the blonde, leans over and whispers something to her.  The blonde looks stunned, collects her things, downs the champagne and scurries sheepishly back into the economy cabin.  The captain cooly returns to the cockpit and takes his seat again.

The co-pilot asks the captain:  ""Sir, what did you say to convince her to go back?""

The captain chuckles and responds, ""It was easy.  I just told her first class doesn't go all the way to San Francisco.""",First Class Blonde,1

Finally the Russian says, ""I wish to drink vodka whenever I want, so make me piss vodka."" The Genie grants him his wish. When the Russian gets home he gets a glass out of the cupboard and pisses into it. He looks at the glass and it's clear. Looks like vodka. Then he smells the liquid. Smells like vodka. So he takes a test and it is the best vodka that he has ever tasted. 



The Russian yells to his wife, ""Natasha, Natasha, come quickly."" She comes running down the hall and the Russian takes another glass out of the cupboard and pisses into it. He tells her to drink, that it is vodka. Natasha is reluctant but goes ahead and takes a sip. It is the best vodka that she has ever tasted. The two drink and party all night. 



The next night the Russian comes home from work and tells his wife to get two glasses out of the cupboard. He proceeds to piss in the two glasses. The result is the same, the vodka is excellent and the couple drink until the sun comes up. 



Finally, Friday night comes and the Russian tells his wife to grab one glass from the cupboard and we will drink vodka. She gets the glass but asks him ""Boris, why do we only need one glass?"" Boris raises the glass and says, ""Because tonight my love, you drink from the bottle.""

Gus was having problems with premature ejaculation so he decided to go to the doctor. He asked the doctor what he could do to cure his problem. In response, the doctor said, ""When you feel like you are getting ready to ejaculate, try startling yourself.""

That same day Gus went to the store and bought himself a starter pistol. All excited to try this suggestion, he ran home to Becky. At home, he found Becky was in bed, naked and waiting. As the two began, they found themselves in the celebrated 69 position. Gus, moments later, felt the sudden urge to ejaculate and fired the starter pistol.

The next day, Gus went back to the doctor. The doctor asked, ""How did it go?""

""Well, not as I'd expected. When I fired the pistol, Becky shit on my face, bit 3 inches off my dick, and my neighbor came out of the closet with his hands in the air.""",The Cure,65

On the way home he stopped at the Hardware Store and bought a bucket and a gallon of paint. He then stopped by the Feed Store and picked up a couple of chickens and a goose. However, struggling outside the store he now had a problem - how to carry his entire purchases home.

While he was scratching his head he was approached by a little old lady who told him she was lost. She asked, 'Can you tell me how to get to 1603 Mockingbird Lane ?'

The farmer said, 'Well, as a matter of fact, my farm is very close to that house I would walk you there but I can't carry this lot.'
The old lady suggested, 'Why don't you put the can of paint in the bucket. Carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?'

'Why thank you very much,' he said and proceeded to walk the old girl home. On the way he says 'Let's take my short cut and go down this alley. We'll be there in no time.'

The little old lady looked him over cautiously then said, 'I am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me.. How do I know that when we get in the alley you won't hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, rip my panties off and have your way with me?'

The farmer said, 'Holy smokes lady! I'm carrying a bucket, a gallon of paint, two chickens, and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?'

The genie just has this request: That the man make the most of his life and live like no man has lived before; love like no man has loved before; and care like no man has cared before. The man obliges.

He first sets out to find his ""calling"". Over the years, he works many jobs. He finds himself becoming depressed with the monotony that he has come to know. Finally, he decides to go back to his roots and do what he knows. He becomes a farmer. With the money he has accumulated from his many professions, he buys a large farm where he decides to take in unwanted and ill animals. Goats (obviously), pigs, cows, cats, dogs, and various other animals. He cares for them. He comes to know and understand them. He has a deep connection with them.

One day, a woman brings her dog to the man's farm. She is worried about the dog. She says ever since the dog's sibling died, he hasn't seemed right. The man agrees to take the dog and care for it. He knows the other animals will comfort it and the dog will enjoy his new family. The woman comes to visit the dog regularly. She becomes familiar with all of the other animals on the farm, and most of all, the man. They spend hours together each visit. Talking and taking care of the animals together. Hours turn to days. Days to weeks. The man asks the woman to live with him and his animals. The woman obliges. They are in love. They are truly happy.

The genie comes to the man one night in his dreams. The genie says to the man ""You have lived like no other man; you have loved like no other man; and you have cared like no other man. You have done well"".

The man wakes up the next morning and he doesn't feel well. He can't explain it, but somethings not right. Weeks go by and the man's condition seems to worsen. His doctors cannot explain his rapidly deteriorating health. The woman is always by his side when she's not caring for his animals. The woman's dog sleeps at the foot of his bed. Never leaving. At last, it seems like he cannot hold on for much longer. He's barely able to speak at this point. He motions for the woman to come near. He says to her ""Do you want to know why I fell in love with you all those years ago? Do you want to know why I love you more and more every day?""

She says, ""Yes, my love, tell me.""

With his final breath, he tells her ""Because you make me feel like a kid again.""",A goat gets his wish granted by a genie.,2121
