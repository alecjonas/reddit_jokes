Oprah goes to LA's best, most reputable therapist because she's been experiencing depression recently. She's heard that the therapist is unorthodox, but effective and she gives it a try. 

She enters his office for her first session and the therapist asks her to remove all of her clothing and go on all fours in front of the TV. 
Oprah is confused but obliges because she's been told she has to trust the process. 

The therapist then asks her to go on all fours against the wall on the other side of the room. 
She walks to the other side of the room, still puzzled, and kneels down.

Again, the therapist asks her to go on all fours in front of the window. Oprah is dying of curiosity so she finally asks, ""Sir, I know you're the best in the business, but how on earth is this supposed to help me?!"" 

The therapist replies: ""Oh, this isn't part of the therapy. I just bought a brown leather couch and I want to see where it looks best!""",(NSFW) Oprah visits a therapist,2

""Is that so?"" Says the husband, ""How do you plan to keep that argument?""

""By following my three-point plan."" Replies the wife.

During this conversation, the wife notices the horses are starting to slow down to just a simple gallop. She orders the driver to stop; she climbs out of the carriage, walks over to the horse and says, ""Strike one.""

She then climbs back into the carriage and continues to cuddle with the husband. The husband though that her getting out and talking to the horse was weird, weird in a good way...

That is until the horses soon slowed down again. She stopped the driver, walks out, and says, ""Strike Two."" to the horses again. Walked back and continued to cuddle with her husband.

The husband now wonders and asks,""Now why did you talk to the horses again?""

The wife then replies, ""It's part of my three-point plan.""

Shrugging it off, the husband and wife go back to their cuddling, that is, until the horses slowed back down to a simple gallop.

She then orders the driver to stop once more. The wife the gets out, walks over to the horses, and *bang!* Shoots the two horses in the head.

Shocked as to what his wife had just done, he then asks the wife, ""Now why in the world did you shoot those two poor horses?""

In the group there was a woman named Maria who loved to gossip every time the group got together. After years of hearing her talk about rumors and nonsense and such, the other women finally had enough and wanted to come up with a plan to deal with her the next time she decided to spread her gossip. 

One of the women said ""I've got it. The next time she starts gossiping, we won't say anything,  but we'll just get up and walk out of the room.""  The other women liked the idea and agreed to go along with it the next time they got together to play cards. 

The following day the women got together at Maria's house and started setting up to play a game. Not five minutes later, Maria exclaimed ""you want to know what I heard last night?"" 

The other women began to look at each other in anticipation as Maria continued.

""I heard that there is a bus leaving town that takes women up to Alaska to work as sex slaves and prostitutes for all the miners that live up there, and that it's a really popular thing to do these days!""

As soon as they heard this, the rest of the women got up, and all started heading for the door to leave the house. 

Seeing this, Maria then exclaimed ""Now hold on ladies! What's your hurry? The bus doesn't leave for another 4 hours.""

- Pessimism: The glass is half empty.

- Realism: The glass is filled halfway with water, halfway with air.

- Skepticism: Does the water even really exist, anyway? And what about the glass?

- Nihilism: It's neither one nor the other. I mean, what difference does it make, anyway?

- Existentialism: The water must decide for itself whether it fills or empties the glass halfway. It exists before its viscosity does.

- Solipsism: The water is really the only entity that truly exists - the glass that surrounds it is but a projection of its consciousness.

- Fatalism: Whether the glass is half full or half empty, there is nothing we can do about it.

- Atheism: The water is in the glass as a result of a series of naturally occurring causal events.

- Deism: Someone put the water in the glass, but does not care what happens to it.

- Polytheism / Paganism: The water and the glass emerge from Chaos and are represented by a respective personification.

- Agnosticism: It is not known how the water got there or if the glass is half full or half empty.

- Behaviorism: To properly answer the question, it is imperative that we observe how the water behaves.

- Consequentialism: To see if the glass is half full or half empty, it is necessary to use a 
system defined by the implications of our actions.

- Positivism: We can only know the truth by tasting the water.

- Impressionism: The details are not important. What counts is the general atmosphere of the glass of water, and that it is painted outdoors.

- Expressionism: We must represent the glass of water in a strictly subjective manner.

- Symbolism: Dreams, imagination and spirituality are what favor an accurate representation of the glass of water.

- Dadaism: Where were the avocado sandwiches during the Second World War?? Garage door, albatross!

- Cubism: We must represent the glass of water from a multitude of viewpoints.

- Postmodernism: The ontology veritably promulgated through the epistemological reality of the individual suffering from the Kierkegaardian concept of ""Angst"" indubitably demonstrates the truth as per experienced by the water perched almost precariously in its nondescript receptacle.

- Advaita Vedanta: The water and glass are one and the same.

- Asceticism: One must separate oneself from the material world to uncover the truth. The water and the glass always give a temporary and illusory happiness.

- Catholicism: The water turns substantially, though not materially, into blood, via the process of transubstantiation.

- Anglicanism: We demand the right to separate the glass from the water.

- Reformism: We believe that our previous authorities have become corrupted. They teach that the glass is half full, which is contrary to what our Lord taught! In addition, they practice simony, selling water in exchange for land!

- Relativism: Whether one believes that the glass is half full or half empty, everybody is correct, even when two beliefs contradict each other.

- Antinatalism: It is immoral to pour water into the glass.

- Extremism: The glass is either completely empty or completely full.

- Capitalism: It is the one who fills the glass who can drink from it.

- Epicureanism: All that matters is whether the glass of water will make me happy.

- Rationalism: Bibo ergo sum.

- Dogmatism: Whether the glass is half full or half empty, the answer is already given to us.

- Utilitarianism: The water must satisfy the thirst of the greatest possible amount of people.

- Kantianism: The way we observe the glass is not necessarily equivalent to how the glass truly is.

His funeral is paid for by the local parish as an act of charity, and a bagpipe player is hired. However, the player is about an hour late to the service. When he gets to the cemetery, the hearse and priest are gone. Only the grave diggers remain. Out of respect, the player pulls out his bagpipes and begins to play Amazing Grace anyway. Suddenly, the workers begin to weep. A fair amount of tears roll out of the bagpipe player's eyes as he plays the final line of the song. As he packs up and is headed back to his car, he hears on of the workers say through his remaining tears ""*sniff*Ain't seen nothing like that before *sniff* and I've been putting in septic tanks for 20 years!""",A man is hired to play bagpipes at the funeral of a homeless man,7

My name is Billy Evans. I am a very sick little boy.

My mother is typing this for me, because I can't. She is crying. The reason she is so sad is because I'm so sick. I was born without a body.

It doesn't hurt, except when I try to breathe. The doctors gave me an artificial body. It is a burlap bag filled with leaves. The doctors said that was the best they could do on account of us having no money or insurance. I would like to have a body transplant, but we need more money.

Mommy doesn't work because she said nobody hires crying people. I said, ""Don't cry, Mommy,"" and she hugged my burlap bag. Mommy always gives me hugs, even though she's allergic to burlap and it makes her sneeze and chafes her real bad.

I hope you will help me. You can help me if you forward this email to everyone you know. Forward it to people you don't know, too. Dr. Johansen said that for every person you forward this email to, Bill Gates will team up with AOL and send a nickel to NASA. With that funding, NASA will collect prayers from school children all over America and have the astronauts take them up into space so that the angels can hear them better. Then they will come back to earth and go to the Pope, and he will take up a collection in church and send all the money to the doctors. The doctors could help me get better then.

Maybe one day I will be able to play baseball. Right now I can only be third base.

Every time you forward this letter, the astronauts can take more prayers to the angels and my dream will be closer to coming true.

Please help me. Mommy is so sad, and I want a body. I don't want my leaves to rot before I turn ten. If you don't forward this email, that's okay. Mommy says you're a mean and heartless nasty person who doesn't care about a poor little boy with only a head. She says that if you don't stew in the raw pit of your own guilt-ridden stomach, she hopes you die a long slow horrible death and then burn forever in hell.

What kind of cruel person are you that you can't take five minutes to forward this to all your friends so that they can feel guilt and shame about ignoring a poor, bodiless nine-year-old boy?

Please help me. I try to be happy, but it's hard.

I wish I had a kitty.

I wish I could hold a kitty.

I wish I could hold a kitty that wouldn't chew on me and try to bury its poo in the leaves of my burlap body. I wish that very much.

Thank You,

Billy ""Smiley"" Evans",Please help little Billy Evans.,0

 The man is getting frustrated so he says fine then how much would it be for that small clock in the window and shopkeep informs him that it's not for sale.

 Very fed up at this point he says how do you stay in business without merchandise or service? The shopkeep explains that it's simple really I'm a mohel (professional circumsiser)  so the man now just confused asks so why do you have all these clocks in your window? The shopkeep says back ,tell me if you made a living cutting off infants foreskins what would you put in the window?",clocks in the window,0

Will you listen? That’s a lot of ass pennies I’ve got out there my friend. And here’s where the magic comes in: When I meet with someone who intimidates me, who put me on edge, a real hard-ass, I just think to myself they’ve probably handled one of my ass pennies. In fact they probably have one in their pocket right then. That just seems to give me the upper hand. I mean, hey, I haven’t touched anything that was in their ass.

The next day, Joe sees the guy in the lunchroom again, and again, the guy has no food. Joe's eating his lunch and again, this guy comes up to him and says, ""Hello, would you mind giving me one of your marshmallows today?"" And since Joe isn't one to deny such a simple request, he gives him a marshmallow. 

The next day, Joe comes prepared! He feels really bad that this guy has no lunch so he makes an extra sandwich to take with lunch for him. 

So when the lunch-less man approaches Joe, Joe has a big smile on his face and pulls out the extra sandwich. ""Here ya go buddy, now you don't have to live off scraps anymore!"" 

But the man with no lunch looks really sad, and doesn't take the sandwich. 

Joe is confused, and asks, ""what's wrong? You don't want lunch?"" 

The man shakes his head ""No.... I was just going to ask you if you had any chocolate.... I wanted to make a s'more!""

In fact which was the biggest store in the world - You could get anything there.

The boss asked him ""Have you ever been an salesman before? Yes Sir, I was a saleman in India replied the lad. The Boss liked the cut of him and said, you can start tomorrow and I'll come and see you.

The day was long and arduous for the young man, but he got through it.

And finally 6.00 PM came around.

The boss duly fronted up and asked, How many sales did you make today?

Sir, Just ONE Sale, said the young salesman. ""Only one sale"" blurted the boss.

No, No you see here, most of them my staff make 20 or 30 sales a day. If you want to keep this job you'd better be doing better than just one sale.

By the say, how much was the sales worth? asked the boss.

-93300534 pounds said the sales man. 

What? How did you manage that? asked the flabbergasted boss. 

""Well"" said the salesman. This man came in and I sold him a small fish hook, then a medium hook and finally a really large hook. 
Then I sell him new fishing rod and some fishing gear.

Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast.

So I told him, he'd be needing a boat, so I took him down to the boat department and sold him that twenty-foot schooner with the twin engines.

The he said his volkswagen probably wouldn't be able to pull it. So I took him to our automotive department and sold him that new deluxe 4X4 blazer.

I then asked him where he'll be staying, and since he had not decided, I took him to camping department and sold him one of those new igloo 6-sleeper camper tents.

Then the guy said, while we're at it, I should throw in about $100 worth of groceries and two cases of beer.

The boss took two steps back and asked in astonishment, ""You sold all that to a guy who came in for a fish hook!""

""No"" answered the salesman. ""He came in to buy a head ache relief tablet and I convinced him that fishing is best remedy for headache.""

A balding, white haired man from Sherman Oaks in
California, walked into a jewelry store in a local mall this
past Friday evening with a beautiful much younger gal at his side.

He told the jeweler he was looking for a special ring for
his girlfriend. The jeweler looked through his stock and
brought out a $5,000 ring. The man said, 'No, I'd like to
see something more special.'

At that statement, the jeweler went to his special stock
and brought another ring over. 'Here's a stunning ring at
only $40,000' the jeweler said. The lady's eyes sparkled
and her whole body trembled with excitement.

The old man seeing this said, 'We'll take it.'
The jeweler asked how payment would be made and
the man stated, 'By cheque. I know you need to make
sure my cheque is good, so I'll write it now and you
can call the bank Monday to verify the funds and I'll
pick up the ring Monday afternoon.'

On Monday morning, the jeweler angrily phoned the
old man and said, 'There was only $25 in your account.'
'I know', said the old man, 'But let me tell you about
MY GREAT WEEKEND!'","A balding, white haired man walked into a jewelry store..",6

He subscribed to tractor magazines, collected tractor figurines, had loads of tractor posters on his wall and even had some DVDs of tractor documentaries. He lived his whole childhood loving tractors. 
On his 17th birthday, his dad said to him ""Son, you're finally old enough to drive, I think its time you had a spin on the old family tractor"" 
The boy was over the moon, and had watched his dad drive it so many times he didn't need lessons. He drove it around straight away and loved it!
Sadly, whilst driving it, he was involved in a nasty accident which damaged the tractor and put him in a coma for 1 year. 
When he finally woke up, his parents were so relived. ""Oh son, I can't believe you're back. We've been so worried about you but we never gave up hope! We even kept all your old tractor stuff and-""
""Dad, I'm sorry"" The son interrupted ""after what happened, tractors only remind me of the accident. I don't want to drive another tractor, see another tractor or even think about another tractor. I just can't"" 
Dad said ""I understand, we'll sell all your old tractor stuff and never speak of it again"" 
So after selling all the merchandise, the son had quite a bit of money. The dad said to him ""You know, you're finally 18, I think its time I took you to the local pub for your first legal pint"". The son agreed that that would be nice. 
When they arrive at the pub, they notice everyone is smoking cigarettes. The bartender is coughing as the dad orders the drinks. The son then goes up for the next round, and he notices the bartenders coughs. 
""Does all this smoke bother you?"" Said the son 
""Yeah it really hits my lungs. I'll be happy once it's banned from the pub"" 
The son replied ""Well I can help you with it no problem!"" 
The son takes a deep breath out, then breathes in all the cigarette smoke right into his lungs, and feels no pain doing it. 
The bar tender is amazed! ""Thank you, but how the hell did you manage that?"" 
The son replies ""Did my dad not tell you...?""
""Tell me what?"" 
""I'm an ex-tractor fan!",So there's this boy who loves tractors,5

In church the following Sunday, Mr. Jones dozed off. Noticing this, the preacher put his plan to work. ""And who made the ultimate sacrifice for you?"" he said, nodding to Mrs. Jones.
""Jesus!"", Jones cried as his wife jabbed him the leg with the hatpin.
""Yes, you are right, Mr. Jones,"" said the minister. Soon, Mr. Jones nodded off again. Again, the minister noticed. ""Who is your redeemer?"" he asked the congregation, motioning towards Mrs. Jones.
""God!"" Mr. Jones cried out as he was stuck again with the hatpin.
""Right again,"" said the minister, smiling. Before long, Mr. Jones again winked off. However, this time the minister did not notice. As he picked up the tempo of his sermon, he made a few motions that Mrs. Jones mistook as signals to bayonet her husband with the hatpin again.
The minister asked, ""And what did Eve say to Adam after she bore him his 99th son?""
Mrs. Jones poked her husband, who yelled, ""You stick that goddamned thing in me one more time and I'll break it in half and shove it up your ass!""

His dog was his only friend when his dad got a new job and they had to relocate. His dog was there to scare away the bullies when he was an awkward kid in school. Timmy's dog was even there as a shoulder to cry on when Timmy had his first broken heart.  They grew from boy and pup to dog and man. They were as close as any man and beast have ever been. 

One day, as Timmy was out on a walk down the road with his faithful companion, a car lost control and headed straight for the pair. Though it happened in an instant, the moment occurred in slow motion. Timmy's dog barked fiercely at the oncoming car as Timmy froze in fear. The instant before the vehicle impacted, his dog lunged and knocked his master from the 2.5 ton 3.5 liter moving mass of death.

Tears rolled down poor Timmy's face as he stared in disbelief. His faithful companion let out an innocent whimper as Timmy scooped his broken, canine body from the pavement. 

The vet was 2 miles away and Timmy reached it and burst through the door and screamed for help. ""My dog!"" He cried like a man posessed. ""A car . . .my dog. . . Help me!"" They hurried him into the back room and laid his dog across the table to let the veterinarian perform his miracle. 

The vet was solemn as he looked at the young man and said, ""I'm sorry son, your dog is dead."" Timmy stared in disbelief. He choked his responses, repeating, ""No, no! I want more tests. I want a second opinion.""

The vet shrugged his shoulders and left the room. He came back with an old tabby cat. He placed the cat on the end of the table and the tabby walked over Timmy's dog, pawing him every couple steps. Finally he looked at the veterinarian and let out an emphatic, "" Mrrooowwwrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.""

The vet assistant had to hold Timmy back from his rage, ""What the hell? Do some tests, you son of a bitch! Where's the second opinion?"" The doctor shrugged and left the room again and a silence settled for a moment. 

He came back with an old, blind Labrador. The Labrador sniffed Timmy's dog and barked at the lifeless body. Finally it hung it's head and whimpered. The doctor laid a gentle hand on Timmy's shoulder and said, ""It's been confirmed son. This dog is dead.""

The disbelief on Timmy's face was obvious. ""What are you doing?"" He screamed. ""I suppose you expect me to pay you for this?""

""Yes,"" the vet said plainly, ""this will be $2050."" Timmy couldn't believe it. ""Are you insane!?!"" he screamed. ""How did this cost $2050!?!"" The veterinarian shrugged and said, ""Well, my fee is $50. Then there's $2000 for the cat scan and lab test.""

He answered : ""12 children.”

The agent asked ""Where are the others?'

Jack graduated at the top of his class, and got a job with a global train company, driving the trains. Jack loved his job, it was his dream. Unfortunately, within the first few months, he caused a major crash that killed a slew of people. Jack was fired, and had to go find work elsewhere.


By determination and a stroke of sheer luck, Jack again found a job with a national train company. It was smaller than the global one, but still a very good gig, and would allow Jack to do what he loved. A few months into that job, he caused yet another crash, killing more people. Again, Jack was fired and had to start looking for a new job.


Throughout the next few years, Jack jumped from company to company, trying to hold on to the job he enjoyed so dearly but ultimately killing people through accidental train crashes. After some time, there were just no companies that would hire Jack.


Deciding to go where nobody knew his name, Jack managed to get a job in a small town, again driving the local trains. He was elated, he had found his dream job again. As it would happen, a couple months in, he crashed the train, and everyone on it died.


Eventually, Jack's guilt caught up with him, he gave up on trying to drive trains, quit working, confessed his accidental crimes, and was sentenced to death by electric chair.


The day of the execution, the executioner sat him down, asked him for any last words. Jack had none. The switch was flipped, Jack was zapped...


... and remained alive.


Distraught, the executioner tried again, but to no avail.


He unshackled Jack and asked, ""why won't you die?""


Jack answered, ""well, I suppose I'm just not a good conductor.""",There once was a man who was in love with trains...,81

The bunny yelled, ""Stop! You cannot proceed further until you play my game, or else you will die.""

The four friends not taking any chances from a talking bunny agreed. The bunny told all four friends to go in the forest and bring back 10 round fruit.

After 10 minutes, the first friend arrived with 10 apples. The bunny said ""That's great, now put all 10 in your butt and you'll be free.""

So the first guy began to place each apple in his butt, but he died after the third apple.

Few minutes later, the second friend arrived with ten oranges. Instructed the same as the first friend, he started to place oranges in his butt, but he died after the fourth orange.

Some time later, the third friend arrived with a bundle of ten grapes. Same rules as the previous two, he began to place grapes up his behind. It was miraculously easy for him. One after the other, the grapes entered his body..6...7...8...9...

When he got to the tenth grape, before he even put it in, he burst out laughing. He fell on the floor and laughed so hard that he couldn't breathe. Eventually he died.

The guy turned up in heaven with the other two friends who died. His friends asked him, ""Dude, why did you start laughing!? You almost had all the grapes in!""

The guy replied, ""Yeah I know, I didn't mean to. I was going to put the last grape in but then I saw our last buddy coming down the hill with ten watermelons!""",The bunny and the fruit.,0

""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday."" 

I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.

My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, 
""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" 
It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me."" 

I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""

We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. 

She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. 
We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?"" 

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" 
She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""

After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, 
""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""

""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.

***

A man goes out for a few beers after a long day at work. He sits at the bar alone for some time before making idle conversation with the new barkeep who'd just begun a shift. They exchange stories, as the man himself once tended bar in his younger days, and he continues to drink. 3AM rolls around before he knows it and his new friend The Bartender tells him it's time to pack it in. 

""Alright Buddy, it's been fun, but I gotta close up."" 

The man smiles, clumsily grabs his wallet from his back pocket and throws a twenty down on the table. He thanks The Bartender for the good conversation and swings around on the stool before falling flat on his face. He looks to the door and thinks to himself that if he can just get outside and get some fresh air, he'll be alright. So he crawls across the room, unnoticed by The Bartender as he counts out his till, and shimmies up the doorway. With a quick turn of the knob, the door lurches forward and the man finds himself making quick friends with the sidewalk. 

""Fuck!"" He shouts as he lifts himself by his elbows. It's quite dark out and the only real good source of light is coming from a streetlight across and down the road a ways. He begins his exciting crawl. Once he reaches the streetlight he pulls himself up again, readying himself for the walk home, before falling forward once more. 

""That's it!"" He figures he's had far too many drinks this evening, and makes the genius decision to crawl home. 

Luckily the man doesn't live too far away and it's not long before he sees his house just down the street. He continues his crawl, up the street, past the ratty shack his neighbours call home, and across his lawn. He pulls himself up the stairs to his front porch, grabs the doorknob and pulls himself upright, pushing the door forward and, again, falling flat on his face. 

The man figures he's had just about enough of this tonight, nudges the door shut behind him, and lets his head rest on one of his slippers in the entrance way before slipping off into dreamland. 

The smell of fresh coffee and the sound of birds chirping and dishes clanging seem to wake the man up all at once. He aches all over and can't quite recall why he's slept on the floor in the entranceway of his house. His wife rounds the corner from the kitchen with a mug of steaming hot coffee in her hands.

""Good Morning,"" she begins, with a crooked smile on her face. ""A nice man named Frank called, he works at the bar you were at last night."" 

Silence. The man readies himself for a good, stern talking to.

She places the coffee down beside her husband and gives him a gentle pat on the back. ""You forgot your wheelchair there last night."" ",A man goes out for a few beers,139

Keep in mind that they are trolling.

Anyway, nobody believes them, except for one very gullible man.

The man then proceeds to do *everything* he can in an attempt to become a rock. He injects himself with ground-up rock dust, shoves boulders up his ass, and replaces his femur with a rock somehow.

Anyway, he can't turn into a rock, and he is very disappointed. He sighs and goes to the Golden Gate Bridge, ready to jump off and kill himself because he didn't manage to become a rock.

Then, just before jumping, he had a brilliant idea.

He could simply lie about being a rock!

So the man immediately went to church and prayed to Jesus to forgive him for the lie he was about to tell. Jesus forgave him, or so he thought.

After this, the man gave the head priest a kidney and a piece of his intestines as thanks.

Anyway, the man quickly ran home, stripped naked, and painted himself brown. 

He now looked like a rock!^not

After consuming some rocks to change his internal organs into rocks, the man went off to the legit scientific laboratory of legit science.

When he got there, he ran inside, killed the security guards for good measure, and went into the science room.

When he got in, he started jiggling his naked body around and dancing like a homo, which irritated the scientists.

""Who the fuck are you?!"", a scientist said.

""I'm the man who's gonna get five billion million gajillion bucks coz I turned into a rock!"", said the man, still dancing.

""What...?"", a confused scientist said.

""You owe me five billion million gajillion dollars because I became a fucking rock, fuckas!"", the man said.

""No, you retard! That was just a joke! Besides, it's impossible for a human being to become a rock, you fucktard!"", said the head scientist.

""B-but I became a rock, I really did..."", said the man, who was still dancing but with a pout on his face.

""NO, YOU DIDN'T! YOU ARE NOT A ROCK!"", another scientist said.

""I am, I *pumise*!"", said the man.

After a few drinks he notices that Ronda is by her self, her friends must have went to the powder room. He decides to pick up his balls and talk to her.

He says, ""Hi I'm Freddy and I'm sure I can't make you scream"".

Ronda looks up and rolls her eyes, ""get out of here loser, I'm just trying to have fun.""

Freddy responds, ""What I meant to say is you are so beautiful that I would like to take you back to my place. I bet I can make you scream before the night is over"".

She sizes him up, Freddy isn't too bad looking. So they talk for a little bit, ""look I bet I can make you scream before the night is up, just give me a try"".

After about an hour of talking Ronda agrees and they head back to his place.

Freddy lights some candles and sets the mood. She lays on the bed and lifts her skirt up a little, ""do your worst. But I warn you, if you don't make me scream I'll put you in an arm bar and break your arm"".  

He takes this as a green light. He jumps on her and immediately stuck it in. He goes at it hard! For about 34 seconds and finishes. He gets off and starts putting on his pants. 

Ronda says, ""what are you doing?""

Freddy replies, ""your welcome"".

Ronda yells, ""I'M GOING TO BREAK YOUR ARM YOU ASSHOLE"".

Freddy runs out shouting behind him, ""told you I could make you scream before the night was up. And I thought you liked to get things done in 34 seconds!"".

zoo. She's wearing a cute, loose-fitting, pink spring dress,
sleeveless with straps.

As they walk through the ape exhibit and pass in front of a very 
large gorilla, the gorilla goes bonkers.  He jumps up on the bars, 
holding on with one hand (and 2 feet), grunting and pounding his
chest with the free hand. He is obviously excited at the pretty 
lady in the wavy, pink dress.

The husband, noticing the excitement, suggests that his wife
tease the poor fellow.  The husband suggests she pucker her lips, 
wiggle her bottom, and play along.  She does and Mr. Gorilla 
gets even more excited, making noises that could wake the dead.

Then the husband suggests that she let one of her straps fall, 
she does, and Mr. Gorilla is just about to tear the bars down.  
Now try lifting your dress up your thighs...this drives the 
gorilla absolutely crazy.

Then, quickly the husband grabs his wife by the hair, rips open 
the door to the cage, slings her in with the gorilla and says, 
""Now, tell HIM you have a headache.""

obviously heavy suitcases when a stranger walks up to him and 
asks ""Have you got the time?""

Lester sighs, puts down the suitcases and glances at his wrist.  
""It's a quarter to six,"" he says.

""Hey, that's a pretty fancy watch!"" exclaims the stranger.

Lester brightens a little.  ""Yeah, it's not bad.  Check this out,"" 
and he shows him a time zone display not just for every time zone 
in the world, but for the 86 largest cities in the world.

He hits a few buttons and from somewhere on the watch a voice says
""The time is eleven 'til six"" in a very West Texas accent.  

A few more buttons and the same voice says something in Japanese.  
Lester continues ""I've put in regional accents for each city.""  

The display is unbelievably high quality and the voice is simply 
astounding.

The stranger is struck dumb with admiration.  

""That's not all,"" says Lester. He pushes a few more buttons and a 
tiny but very hi-resolution map of New York City appears on the 
display.  ""The flashing dot shows our location by satellite 
positioning,"" explains Lester.  ""View recede ten,"" he says, and 
the display changes to show eastern New York State.

""I want to buy this watch!"" says the stranger.

""Oh, no, it's not ready for sale yet; I'm still working out the 
bugs,"" says the inventor. ""But look at this,"" and he proceeds to 
demonstrate that the watch is also a very credible little FM radio 
receiver with a digital tuner, a sonar device that can measure 
distances up to 125 meters, a pager with thermal paper printout 
and, most impressive of all, the capacity for voice recordings
of up to 300 standard-size books, ""though I only have 32 of my
favorites in there so far,"" says the proud inventor.

""I've got to have this watch!"" says the stranger.

""No, you don't understand; it's not ready.""

""I'll give you $1000 for it!""

""Oh, no, I've already spent more than -""

""I'll give you $5000 for it!""

""But it's just not -""

""I'll give you $15,000 for it!""  And the stranger pulls out a
checkbook.  

Lester stops to think.  He's only put about $8500 into materials 
and development, and with $15,000 he can make another one and 
have it ready for merchandising in only six months.  The stranger 
frantically finishes writing the check and waves it in front of 
him.  ""Here it is, ready to hand to you right here and now. 
$15,000.  Take it or leave it.""  

Lester abruptly makes his decision.  ""OK,"" he says, and peels off 
the watch.  They make the exchange and the stranger starts happily 
away.

""Hey, wait a minute,"" Lester points to the two huge suitcases he'd 
been trying to wrestle through the bus station, ""Don't forget your 
batteries.""",i watch inspiration,6

He says” If I can show you the most amazing thing you’ve ever seen can I get a free drink?”
Bartender replies “I don’t know, I’ve seen some pretty amazing things in my day……sure, if you can top them, free drink on me”

The man reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a Rat, reaches into his other pocket and brings out a tiny piano. Sets them both down on the bar.
The Rat sits down at the piano and starts stretching his fingers and stretching his arms. Then it starts playing the blues.

The bartender says ”HOLY SHIT! That is the most amazing thing I have ever seen! Free drink on me buddy, whatever you like!”

So the man orders his drink, grabs the rat, picks up the piano and sits down in a booth to enjoy his beverage.
A little while later he finishes his drink and heads back up to the bar. He says to the bartender “If I can show you something even more amazing than that can I have free drinks all night??”

The bartender thinks about it, and says “sure…you know what, if you can top that free drinks on me all night!”
So the man reaches into his back pocket pulls out the rat, reaches into his other pocket and pulls out the piano.
Rat sits down at the piano and starts stretching his fingers, and stretching his arms. Then the man reaches into his front pocket and pulls out a bull frog.
The Rat starts playing the blues and the bull frog starts singing the blues!

“HOLY SHIT!!” says the bartender. “God DAMN, Ok buddy, drinks on me all night, whatever you want!!”

Sitting in the corner of the bar is a sharply dressed young man, gold chain, greased hair, fancy shoes. The young man says “Sir, excuse me…but how much for the bullfrog?”
The man replies “sorry buddy, I could never sell my bullfrog”
Young man says”$1,000, right now for the bullfrog”
The man replies “no, I couldn’t sell him, too much sentimental attachment”
Young man says “okay, okay…$10,000 dollars!!”
The man replies “no son, I just can’t sell him!”
Young man says “$50,000 cash! Right now, I’ve got it in my briefcase, $50,000 for the bullfrog!!”
The man thinks for a moment, looks at the young man and replies, “Ok, 50 grand? Fine… I will sell you the bullfrog”

Young man opens his briefcase and reveals the pile of cash, hands it to the man. The man gives him the bullfrog and young man leaves on his way, whistling as he goes.

After he leaves, the bartender comes over and says, “hey….I don’t mean to tell you your business…. But I think you could have gotten way more than fifty thousand for that bullfrog!!”
The man replies “Naaah, don’t worry about it. The Rats a ventriloquist”

in prison. The warden
takes a liking to him and puts him in a cell
with a kindly oldtimer
so that he can be shown the ropes and not
get himself in trouble.

So the oldtimer teachs the youngster the
rules of the prison, what
to do, what not to do, stuff like that. One
of the rules he learns
is that there is no talking allowed during
meals.

A curious thing happens during meals
though and the young prisoner
is a bit confused. In the large mess hall,
once everyone is seated,
one of the prisoners stands up and loudly
says, ""47."" Everyone
in the hall laughs hysterically. A few
minutes later, another
prisoner stands up and loudly says, ""19.""
Again, a torrent of
laughter from everyone. This goes on
throughout the meal.

Later, when the youngster and the
oldtimer get back to their cell,
the young man asks, ""What was going in
the mess hall tonight? I
thought you said there was no talking
allowed.""
""Ah, yes, the mess hall. Well years ago,
the warden eased up on
that rule a bit, the one that disallows
talking at meals. You see,
all of us inmates have memorized a long
list of jokes and stories
by the number, so that all one of us has to
do is call out its
number, and, because we have all of the
stories memorized, it's
like someone told the whole funny story.""
The young inmate nods understandingly
and falls off to sleep.

After a few weeks of this mealtime
behavior, the young man gets
up a bit of nerve and decides to tell a
story.

So, one evening at the dinner meal, he
stands up and loudly says,
""26."" No one laughs. Not even a twitter.
So he tries again, ""26.""
Still nothing. He sits down sheepishly and
embarrassed.

Later, he pleads with the oldtimer to
explain what happened.
""That is such a good story, number 26, how
come no one laughed.""
The old man turned to him and explained,
""It's the way you told it.""

Chu(female)- WTF!! how can they ban it, it's so integral part of our life these days. My chachu(uncle) is so much addicted to it that I'm scared he might attempt a suicide. Even I sometimes enjoy it after my dinner with my family.

Me- WTF did you just say? you enjoy with your family!! and why the f**k will your chachu will do such thing as there are other ways to get to the porn.

Chuu- Yes, my whole family loves it and we distribute it to others so that they may too enjoy it. It's good for health and you should too enjoy it with your family.

4) Never be truthful to the candidate always treat them like a second class citizen.

5) Don't take down old job adverts as you can still get peoples hopes up at an imaginary job that does not exist anymore.

6) Don't bother ringing your candidates to update them as they should be waiting on your beck and call. 

7) leave them waiting for days on end not updating them .

A coyote jumps out and attacks the governor's dog, then bites the governor. The governor starts to intervene, but reflects upon the movie Bambi and then realizes he should stop because the coyote is only doing what is natural.

   He calls animal control. Animal control captures the coyote and bills the state $200 for testing it for diseases and $500 for relocating it. He calls a veterinarian. The vet collects the dead dog and bills the state $200 for testing it for diseases. The governor goes to the hospital and spends $3,500 getting checked for diseases from the coyote and getting his bite wound bandaged.

   The running trail gets shut down for six months while the California Fish and Game Department conducts a $100,000 survey to make sure the area is now free of dangerous animals. The governor spends $50,000 in state funds implementing a 'coyote awareness program' for residents of the area. The Legislature spends $2 million to study how to better treat rabies and how to permanently eradicate the disease throughout the world.
The governor's security agent is fired for not stopping the attack. The state spends $150,000 to hire and train a new agent with additional special training, re: the nature of coyotes. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) protests the coyote's relocation and files a $5 million suit against the state.

   The governor of Texas is jogging with his dog along a nature trail. A coyote jumps out and tries to attack him and his dog. The governor shoots the coyote with his state-issued pistol and keeps jogging.

   The governor spent 50 cents on a .380-caliber, hollow-point cartridge. Buzzards ate the dead coyote.

   And that, my friends, is why California is broke and Texas is not.

One of the women shouted to him, ‘we’re not coming out until you leave!’

The old man frowned, ‘I didn’t come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or make you get out of the pond naked.. ‘

Holding the bucket up he said, ‘I’m here to feed the alligator!’

The nun, surprised by the question, politely declines and gets off at the next stop. When the bus starts again, the bus driver says to the hippie, ""If you want, I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you.""

The hippie of course says that he'd love to know, so the bus driver tells him that every Tuesday evening at midnight the nun goes to the cemetery to pray to the lord. ""If you went dressed in robes and some glowing powder,"" says the bus driver, ""You could tell her you were God and command her to have sex with you.""

The hippie decides to try this out. That Tuesday, he goes to the cemetery and waits for the nun. Right on schedule, the nun shows up. While she's in the middle of praying, the hippie walks out from hiding, in robes and glowing with a mask of god. ""I am God, I have heard your prayers and I will answer them but you must have sex with me first,"" he says.

The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity. The hippie agrees to this and quickly sets about having sex with the nun.

After the hippie finishes, he rips off his mask and shouts out, ""Ha ha, I'm the hippie! ""

The nun replies by whipping off her mask and shouting, ""Ha ha, I'm the bus driver!""",How to sleep with a nun,5

All three men have lived good lives, so God decides he will choose who gets in to Heaven based on how they died.  Whoever had the worst luck will get in to Heaven.

So the first man tells his story.

&gt; I married the love of my life.  But she was too good looking for me.  So I worked 60 hours a week to give her a good life.  But because I worked so much, we barely got to be together and rarely had sex.  After a while I had a hunch she was cheating on me.  So I left work early one day and came home to our beautiful condo in our high rise building.  When I entered, she was in the shower.  So I snooped around thinking I'd find some evidence of a man being there.  I looked everywhere but there was no evidence of another man in the condo.  Distraught that I could think so low of the love of my life, I went out to our balcony to think everything over.  But when I got out there, I saw a pair of hands hanging on to the ledge.  I knew this must be the man my wife was cheating with.  So I stomped his hands until he fell to the ground.  But he wasn't dead.  So I went inside and found the biggest thing I could throw off the ledge... The fridge.  I threw it down and crushed him.  Knowing the love of my life was unfaithful, I decided to take my own life.  I shot myself, and next thing I know, I'm up here talking to you.

The second man immediately starts his story:

&gt; Well!... I was working out on my treadmill as I always do.  But it was extremely hot in my condo, so I went to open the window and fell out.  I thought I was going to die, but luckily I was able to grab the ledge of the balcony below mine.  I was hanging there trying to pull myself up, when a crazy man started stomping my hands.  I held on as hard as I could, but I fell to the ground.  I thought I was dead.  But I survived the fall.  But just when I was thanking my lucky stars, I look up to see a fridge falling from the sky.  Next thing I know, I'm up here talking to you.

The third man finally gets to tell his story:

&gt; Well, there I am, naked, sitting in some guys refrigerator...

A tall weather-worn cowboy walked into the saloon and ordered a beer. The regulars quietly observed the drifter through half-closed eyelids. No one spoke, but they all noticed that the stranger's hat was made of brown wrapping paper. 

Less obvious was the fact that his shirt and vest were also made of paper. As were his chaps, pants, and even his boots, including the paper spurs. Truth be told, even the saddle, blanket and bridle on his horse were made entirely of paper. 

Of course he was soon arrested for rustling.

A new employee is hired at the Tickle Me Elmo factory. The personnel manager explains her duties, and tells her to report to work promptly at 8:00 AM.

The next day at 8:45 AM, there's a knock at the personnel manager's door. The assembly line foreman comes in and starts ranting about this new employee. He says she's incredibly slow, and the whole line is backing up.

The foreman takes the personnel manager down to the factory floor to show him the problem. Sure enough, Elmos are backed up all over the place.

At the end of the line is the new employee. She has a roll of the material used for the Elmos and a big bag of marbles. They both watch as she cuts a little piece of fabric, wraps it around two marbles, and starts sewing the little package between Elmo's legs.

The personnel manager starts laughing hysterically. After several minutes, he pulls himself together, walks over to the woman, and says, ""I'm sorry, I guess you misunderstood me yesterday. Your job is to give Elmo two test tickles.""

""Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you. I've been finding real passion with Stacy, and she is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of her piercings, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am. But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children. Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves, and trading it with the other people in the commune, for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS, so Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it! Don't worry, Dad. I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit, so you can get to know your many grandchildren. Love, your son, Joshua. P.S. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jason's house.

post,3frs5b,2qh72,jokes,false,1438709976,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3frs5b/stpeter_special_offer/,self.jokes,,"One day while walking down the street a highly successful person was tragically hit by a bus and she died. Her soul arrived up in heaven where she was met at the Gates of Heaven by St. Peter himself.

“Welcome to Heaven,” said St. Peter. “Before you get settled in though, it seems we have a problem. You see, strangely enough, we’ve never once had someone like you make it this far and we’re not really sure what to do with you.”

“No problem, just let me in” said the woman. “Well, I’d like to, but I have higher orders. What we’re going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in.”

“Actually, I think I’ve made up my mind, I prefer to stay in Heaven”, said the woman. “Sorry, we have rules...” And with that St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and it went down down down to hell. The doors opened and she found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a clubhouse and standing in front of her were all her friends - fellow executives that she had worked with and they were all dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and they talked about old times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the clubhouse where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy (kinda cute, he always is) and she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. She was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everybody shook her hand and waved goodbye as she got on the elevator The elevator went up-up-up and opened back up at the Gates of Heaven and she found St. Peter waiting for her.

“Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven,” he said. So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her. “So, you’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven. Now you must choose your eternity,” he said.

The woman paused for a second and then replied, “Well, I never thought I’d say this, I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell.” So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again she went down down down back to Hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks. The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her.

“I don’t understand,” stammered the woman, “yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a clubhouse and we ate lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.”

The Devil looked at her and smiled. “Yesterday we were recruiting you, today.....you’re staff.",St.Peter Special Offer,4
