Well, it just so happens to have originated through the Father of Our Country, way back when George Washington was crossing the Delaware River with his troops.
There were 33 (remember this number) in Washington ‘s boat.
It was extremely dark and storming furiously and the water was tossing them about. Finally, Washington grabbed Corporal Peters (remember this name) and stationed him at the front of the boat with a lantern.
He ordered him to keep swinging it, so they could see where they were heading.
Corporal Peters, through driving rain and cold, continued swinging the lantern back and forth, back and forth.
Then a big gust of wind and a wave hit and threw Corporal Peters and his lantern into the Delaware .
Washington and his troops searched for nearly an hour trying to find Corporal Peters, but to no avail.
All of them felt terrible, for the Corporal had been one of their favorites. Sometime later, Washington and his troops landed on the other side, wet and totally exhausted.
He rallied the troops and told them that they must go on. Another hour later, one of his men said, ‘General, I see lights ahead.’
So they trudged toward the lights and came upon a huge house. What they didn’t know, was that this was a house of ill repute hidden in the forest to serve all who came.
General Washington pounded on the door, his men crowding around him. The door swung open, and much to his surprise stood a beautiful woman. A huge smile came across her face, to see so many men standing there.
Washington was the first to speak, ‘Madam, I am General George Washington and these are my men. We are tired, wet, exhausted, and desperately need warmth and comfort.’
Again, the Madam looked at all the men standing there, and with a broad smile on her face, said, ‘Well, General, you have come to the right place. We can surely give you warmth and comfort. How many men do you have?’
Washington replied, ‘Well, Madam, there are 32 of us without Peters.’
And the Madam said, ‘You gotta be shittin’ me.",Have you ever wondered...,0

post,3wmv58,2qh72,jokes,false,1450002851,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3wmv58/the_clown_joke_warning_very_long/,self.jokes,,"Once upon a time – which is a terrible way to start a joke – there was a little boy named Billy. 

Billy was six years old, and for the whole of his short life, he had been utterly and intensely obsessed with clowns. He had clown bed sheets and clown posters; he had clown toys and clown-themed games; he had towels with clowns on them, a toothbrush in the shape of a clown, and – if it had existed – he probably would have used clown-flavored toothpaste, as well.

Try not to think about it.

The point here is that Billy loved clowns, and his parents were well aware of that fact. (They'd have to be, right? I mean, how is a six-year-old going to buy all of that stuff on his own?) Thus, they decided that for their son's seventh birthday, they'd purchase front-row seats at the circus, which *just happened* to be in town at the same time. Upon hearing this, Billy was absolutely overcome with excitement, and he was scarcely able to sit still until his family arrived at the big top.

Billy and his parents walked in, took their seats, and waited for the show to start. 

The music flared to life and the lights came up, and in a dazzling display of merriment, everything began. First came the lion-tamers with their whips and chairs... and yeah, they were intriguing, but they didn't hold Billy's interest. Next came the feats of strength with strongmen (and one excessively suspicious woman) smashing bricks and bending bars... and yeah, it was impressive, but Billy didn't really care. The sword swallowers followed, and the trapeze artists, and the tightrope walkers... and yeah, someone might have died at any moment, but it all seemed so *boring*.

Eventually, Billy began to worry that he wouldn't get to see clowns at the circus. After all, he knew very well that clowns usually only appeared when something went wrong. (You didn't know that, did you? Yeah, clowns are typically kept on standby in case someone screws up.) 

Suddenly, all of the lights went out.

A single spotlight shown down to one corner of the arena.

A tiny car came puttering into view, while discordant, almost forlorn circus music played.

*Deet deet deedle-deedle deet deet dee deeeeee...*

The car's doors sprang open, and out poured the most amazing collection of clowns that Billy had ever seen! There were fat clowns, thin clowns, tall clowns, short clowns! Clowns with bright red hair and enormous red noses! Clowns in silly suspenders and oversize shoes! There were clowns wearing every color of the rainbow, and clowns that moved like psychotic ferrets on speed! There were more clowns than Billy had ever *dreamed* of watching all at once!

Then, just as it seemed like that tiny car couldn't produce a single soul more, another clown stepped out. He was too fat to be thin, yet too thin to be fat... but somehow wasn't average, either. He was too short too be tall, yet too tall to be short... but still managed to be both at once. He had pale, almost white skin – not the product of makeup – and deep, almost black, sunken eyes. He had a shock of bright red (and completely natural) hair, and a bulbous, equally red nose.

Billy looked on with awe and wonder as he realized what he was seeing: This wasn't a person in makeup who was putting on an act; this was a *real clown*. The man – if indeed you could call him a man – reached into the front of his pants, wiggled his hand around for a little while, and pulled forth a bright silver microphone. After offering a conspiratorial wink to the audience, the clown cleared his throat... and his dry, raspy voice boomed out for everyone to hear:

""I need a volunteer!""

He swerved to avoid hitting the Bunny, but unfortunately the rabbit jumped in front of his car and was hit. The basket of eggs went flying all over the place.

The driver, being a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulled over to the side of the road, and got out to see what had become of the Bunny carrying the basket. Much to his dismay, the colorful Bunny was dead. The driver felt guilty and began to cry.

A woman driving down the same highway saw the man crying on the side of the road and pulled over. She stepped out of her car and asked the man what was wrong.

“I feel terrible,” he explained, “I accidentally hit the Easter Bunny and killed it. There may not be an Easter because of me. What should I do?”

The woman told the man not to worry. She knew exactly what to do. She went to her car trunk, and pulled out a spray can. She walked over to the limp, dead Bunny, and sprayed the entire contents of the can onto the little furry animal. Miraculously the Easter Bunny came back to life, jumped up, picked up the spilled eggs and candy, waved its paw at the two humans and hopped on down the road. 50 yards away the Easter Bunny stopped, turned around, waved and hopped on down the road another 50 yards, turned, waved, hopped another 50 yards and waved again!

The man was astonished. He said to the woman, “What in heaven’s name is in your spray can? What was it that you sprayed on the Easter Bunny?”

The woman turned the can around so that the man could read the label. It said:

Bubba turns to Jim Bob and says, ""You know, I'm tired of going through life without an education. Tomorrow I think I'll go to the Community College, and sign up for some classes."" Jim Bob thinks it's a good idea, and the two leave.

The next day, Bubba goes down to the college and meets the Dean of Admissions, who signs him up for the four basic classes: Math, English, History, and Logic. ""Logic?"" Bubba says. ""What's that?""

The dean says, ""I'll show you. Do you own a weedeater?""

""Yeah.""

""Then logically speaking, because you own a weedeater, I think that you would have a yard.""

So Bubba and Jethro both go down to the unemployment office to get signed up with benefits and start hunting other jobs.  They fill out their paperwork and, after getting a few leads, head home. 

After two weeks the factory shuts down and a few weeks after that, they get their first checks.  Bubba opens up his and isn't too happy about it but it's enough to survive on.  Jethro opens up his and says, ""Wow.  I got a big check!""  

Bubba takes a look and gets furious, snatching it out of Jethro's hands and dragging him down to the unemployment office.  Inside he says to the clerk, ""I want to know what the hell's going on!  How come Jethro is getting so much more money than I am?""

The clerk takes a look and says, ""Well, you put down that you inserted elastic into women's underwear.  Well, that's an unskilled job anyone can do.  But Mr. Jethro here said he was a Diesel Fitter, and that's a highly skilled job, so he gets a bigger check."" 

Bubba just stares at her and says, ""Diesel Fitter?  Aw hell, after I got done inserting the elastic he'd hold them up, stretch them out, and say, 'dees'll fit 'er!'""",Bubba and Jethro get Unemployment,1

Three men died on Christmas Eve and were met by Saint Peter at the pearly gates.
'In honor of this holy season' Saint Peter said, 'You must each possess something that symbolizes Christmas to get into heaven.'
The Englishman fumbled through his pockets and pulled out a lighter. He flicked it on. 'It's a candle', he said.
'You may pass through the pearly gates' Saint Peter said.
The Scotsman reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys. He shook them and said, 'They're bells.'
Saint Peter said 'You may pass through the pearly gates'.
The Irishman started searching desperately through his pockets and finally pulled out a pair of women's panties.
St. Peter looked at the man with a raised eyebrow and asked, 'And just what do those symbolize?'
The Irishman replied, 'These are Carol's'     

And So The Christmas Season begins......and I sure hope the jokes get better.

Then the cowboy seemed to be infuriated and stood up suddenly grawing his gun and shot the Mexican dead...

At the cowboy's hearing the judge the judge asked the cowboy, ""Why did you suddenly become enraged for no apparent reason and shoot this individual dead.""

""Well, the cowboy explained, I tried to be friendly and he began calling me names and insulting me for no reason and finally I got mad.""

""What names did he call you that made you so mad that you wanted to kill him?"" asked the Judge.

""Well, answered the cowboy, three times I bought him a drink, and each time he grinned in my face and called me Grassy Ass...""",Saying Thanks in Spanish,7

I fuck her high, 

I fuck her wet, I fuck her dry,

But oxygen is highly reactive, and at first, its effect on evolution was so negative that some have named this period the “oxygen catastrophe.” However, as oxygen gradually formed a protective ozone layer, life rebounded. After the first organisms evolved to use oxygen to their advantage, the diversity of aerobic organisms exploded. According to the Theory of Endosymbiosis, engulfing of some of these aerobic bacteria led to eukaryotic cells with mitochondria, and multicellularity, the evolution of multicellular eukaryotic organisms, followed. Today, we live in an atmosphere which is 21% oxygen, and most of life follows glycolysis with the last two, aerobic stages of cellular respiration.
Recall the purpose of cellular respiration: to release energy from glucose to make ATP, the universal molecule of energy for cellular work. The following equation describes the overall process, although it summarizes many individual chemical reactions.
 
[Figure3]
Once again, the first stage of this process, glycolysis, is ancient, universal, and anaerobic. In the cytoplasm of most cells, glycolysis breaks each 6-carbon molecule of glucose into two 3-carbon molecules of pyruvate. Chemical energy, which had been stored in the now broken bonds, is transferred to 2 ATP and 2 NADH molecules.
The fate of pyruvate depends on the species and the presence or absence of oxygen. If oxygen is present to drive subsequent reactions, pruvate enters the mitochondrion, where the Krebs Cycle (Stage 2) and electron transport chain (Stage 3) break it down and oxidize it completely to CO2 and H2O. The energy released builds many more ATP molecules, though of course some is lost as heat. Let’s explore the details of how mitochondria use oxygen to make more ATP from glucose by aerobic respiration.

The father had died years ago fighting in a war. Ever since the only income for this family was a lone dairy cow; which was milked daily. On one morning the mother went out to milk said cow only to find that it was laying dead in the pasture. She fell to her knees and began to cry uncontrollably. Shortly thereafter a mermaid arose from the ocean and tried to console her. She asked ""Why are you crying my dear?"" in which the mother replied ""Our cow, our only source of income is dead. My family will surely starve!"" the mermaid replied ""I happen to know that you have three handsome sons. Mother I will make a deal with you. If your oldest son can fuck me more than 15 times I will bring your cow back to life."" So the mother goes and fetches her eldest son who is 17 years old and explains the situation to him. he replies ""Of course mother, I will do this for the sake of the family!"" Well after 13 times the son drops dead from exhaustion. The mermaid feeling sympathetic tells the mother ""If your middle son can fuck me more than 10 times I will bring your cow back to life."" so the mother grabs the next eldest who is 15 and explains the situation. He agrees to fuck the mermaid, however dies after 8 times from exhaustion. Still feeling sympathetic the mermaid tells the mother that if her youngest son can fuck her more than 5 times she'll bring the cow back to life. The mother fetches her 12 year old and explains whats going on. At this point the 12 year old turns to the mermaid and replies ""Nahhhh lets make it 20 times!!"" as to which the mermaid is taken aback in disbelief. Shes questions his judgement but agrees to 20. After a few days the boy arises from the field from fucking her non stop, the mermaid herself almost dead with exhaustion rolls over and asks ""How did you learn to fuck like that?!?!!?"" as to which the boy replies ""How do you think the cow died?""

“Fine, go ahead,” she sobbed, “but they’ll be the last words you’ll say to me!”

she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty. She told me that she hadn’t eaten for three days! So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night, the ones you wouldn’t eat because you’re afraid you’ll put on weight. The poor thing devoured them in moments.

Since she needed a good clean up I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so I threw them away. Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don’t use because you say they are too tight. I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don’t use because I don’t have good taste. I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don’t use just to annoy her, and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don’t use because someone at work has a pair the same.”

The husband took a quick breath and continued – “She was so grateful for my understanding and help and as I walked her to the door she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said, Please … do you have anything else that your wife doesn’t use?”

I was tired after a long day of travel, so I decided to enter in, and perhaps pay the monks for some food, and water, and a place to stay for the night. To my surprise, when they welcomed me in, they refused to take my money, and gave me all the food I could eat, all the wine I could drink, and the most comfortable bed I have ever rested on. When I awoke, my gear had been replaced by top-quality stuff, easily worth ten times what my own gear had been worth, and loaded down with provisions. I asked them how they could afford to do this for me, and they pointed at an archway above a door, inscribed with symbols that resembled no language that I knew. They said, ""We merely follow the words inscribed on the arch, and all is provided for us, and our guests.""

I asked, ""So, what do the words say?""

They replied, ""Sorry, we can't tell you, you're not a monk.""
I left that day, and the gear kept me cool in the warmth, warm when it was cool, it repelled all water, and it seemed lighter than should be possible. I checked the Internet, and could find no record of these kinds of materials, and no record of the monastery, either. I decided that I had to know their secret, so I made my way back to the Himalayas,and, after a few weeks of searching, found the monastery again.

They welcomed me with in the same style as the last time, and the food and drink were even better this time! I asked them what I would have to do to become a monk, and to learn their secret. They pointed me through the archway, saying that I must go to the far end of the cavern, and when I reached the end, all would be revealed to me. Anything I needed to cross would be provided for me, but I would have to come back and ask for it.

So, I entered the cavern, and ascended a long stairway up. No sooner had I reached the top of that stairway than there was another long stairway going down! Then, at the bottom of that stairway was another long stairway going up, then another stairway going down, then another stairway going up, and one more going down. I was lucky to still be wearing the clothing and boots that the monks had provided for me, because at this point, I was sore, and exhausted, and sweaty: I don't know how bad it would be if I was wearing normal clothing.

At the bottom of this stairway was a lake, stretching as far as the eye could see. I felt the water, and it was ice cold: no way I could swim it. I would have to go back and get a boat.

So I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and arrived, exhausted, back at the monastery. They fed me, and clothed me, and I rested.

The next day, I asked them for a canoe and a paddle, which they kindly provided, but they told me, ""You must bring everything back each time that you return.""

So I picked up the canoe and paddle, and carried them up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and paddled across the lake. On the other side of the lake was another stairway going up, so I continued, and found that they conformed to the same pattern as before: three staircases up, and three down. So, I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and then I came to a top of a tall, completely smooth wall. There was no way that I could jump down and survive, and certainly no way that I could climb back up, so I had to go back for a rope: there was even already a place to anchor it.

So, I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and crossed the lake in the canoe, and carried the canoe and paddle up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and arrived, even more ehausted this time, back at the monastery. They fed me, and clothed me, and I rested.

The next day, I asked them for a rope, a canoe, and a paddle, which they kindly provided, but they told me, ""You must bring everything back each time that you return.""
So I picked up the rope, canoe and paddle, and carried them up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and paddled across the lake. I then carried the rope up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs.

I tied off the rope to the anchor, and descended the rope down to the base of the wall. I found myself at the base of another foot of stairs, and, you guessed it, it was the same pattern. So, I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and at the foot of these stairs, I found a huge chasm. There was a drawbridge on the other side that could swing down to span it, and there was a mechanism on this side to lower it, but a key pin which allowed the mechanism to function was missing - the winch would turn, but the drawbridge would not swing down.

So, I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and climbed up the rope. I untied the rope, and carried it up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and crossed the lake in the canoe, and carried the rope and canoe and paddle up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and arrived, absolutely exhausted to every fiber of my bones this time, back at the monastery. They fed me, and clothed me, and I rested.

The next day, I asked them for a pin for the winch, a rope, a canoe, and a paddle, which they kindly provided, but they told me, ""You must bring everything back each time that you return.""

So I picked up the pin, rope, canoe and paddle, and carried them up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and paddled across the lake. I then carried the pin and rope up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs. I tied the rope off and descended, and carried the pin up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up hte stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs.

I fitted the pin into the drawbridge's mechanism, lowered the draw bridge, locked it into place, and crossed. On the other side of the bridge was more stairs! So, I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and found myself at the end, finally, of the cavern, and there was a great orb. I touched the orb, and I suddenly knew that if I saw the archway again, I would be able to read it, and I would know the secret of the monks.

So, I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and raised the drawbridge, and removed the pin. I carried the pin up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and climbed up the rope. I untied the rope, and carried the pin and the rope up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and crossed the lake in the canoe. I carried the pin and rope and canoe and paddle up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and arrived, on death's very door, back at the monastery.

I looked up at the archway, and understood its message, and I was suddenly rejuvenated, made whole. To this day, I have lived by the words on that archway, and everything has been provided for me.

So, do you want to know what the words on the archway are?

Sorry, I can't tell you: you're not a monk.

His mother attempted suicide via hanging herself but he 'slipped out' of her corpse and was saved by his umbilical chord sorta making him bungee jump. A Catholic priest found him with his mother's corpse and adopted him. He originally something luck related, but because of his birth, he believed that his death was God willed and that he was meant for great things which lead to him changing his name to something more religious. 

 Anyways, we went to a missionary together in Africa and he decided to go down to a nearby village. When he was there he saw that the villagers were being mistreated by another tribe (could've been a gang). One day, he saw them hack up a kid in the streets with a long blade so he followed them back to their hideout. It was an all wood building with some sorta drug deal inside. 

 He hated these men for what they did to that poor child, so he threw a makeshift Molotov cocktail into the center of the building, right next to some sorta crate. He doesn't know what was in that crate, but I'll tell ya, it must have been flammable because I flames all the way from the mission. He was never quite the same since that event. When we got home I thought he was lifeless (he almost completely blanked out), but truth was, he was happy. *Really* happy. 

 He started going out at night more and talked to some questionable people. When I finally confronted him about it he revealed he's been tracking down people related to the same tribe/gang and burning them down in the name of righteous justice. He said there was only one more location left and he asked if I wanted to help burn those bastards to the ground. I refused, burning down other people's stuff was *not* on my to-do list. We had a little spat about it, but in the end he went off to do it by himself. The next day on the news, they said that a ware house exploded near downtown. 

 Apparently, there was some sorta illegal bomb making ring down their and someone decided to literally heat things up. They found several charred bodies, all identified as known convicts from Africa, but one was out of the ordinary, being of Spanish decent. It was at that moment I realized: Jesus died for arson.

Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk.

She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk.

He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.

 For weeks, the two of them worked hard and the ranch was doing very well.

Then one day, the rancher's widow said ""you have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels.""

The hired hand readily agreed and went into town on Saturday night. He returned around 2:30am, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. 

She quietly called him over to her.

""Unbutton my blouse and take it off,"" she said.

Trembling, he did as she directed.

""Now take off my boots."" He did as she asked, ever so slowly.

""Now take off my socks."" He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots.

""Now take off my skirt."" He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light.

""Now take off my bra."" Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.

Then she looked at him and said: ""If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired!",A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife.,503

When he finally became old enough, he applied for the job and lo and behold he got it. Now Charlie was the friendliest street conductor that the city has ever seen. Not only did he never complain about his job, but also he greeted everyone who boarded his street car and treated them like family.  

 Everything in his life was perfect for Charlie until one day he decided to operate the street car after having a few drinks. In his drunken state, he crashed the streetcar and killed all the passengers. After going to court Charlie was sentenced to death by the electric chair.  

 When the day came for his execution, a guard visited Charlie's cell and asked him what he wanted for his final meal. Charlie replied, ""I want a rotten tomato and a raw fish."" After Charlie finished his meal he headed into the execution room and sat down in the electric chair. The warden gave the order to pull the switch and the room went dark as thousands of volts passed through Charlies body.   

After the switch was thrown back it came as a surprise that Charlie was in fact still alive. Having no idea what else to do the warden let Charlie out of jail but banned him from ever operating a streetcar in New Orleans. Since street cars were his life Charlie decided ""Hey I'll go to Japan, I hear they have fancy new street cars there."" In Japan Charlie gets a job as a conductor again, but as before decides that after having a few drinks that he is still able to work the street car.   

To no surprise Charlie crashes the street car and kills all the passengers. Charlie again finds himself in jail ordering his last meal. ""A rotten tomato and a raw fish,"" he tells the guard. After the meal was eaten, Charlie was led to the chair and once again survived the electricity. Because he didn't die, he was set free, but banned from operating the street cars in Japan.    

So Charlie thought to himself, ""Well I heard San Francisco still has street cars operating so I'll go there."" As you can guess Charlie ends up in the same situation and again orders the same meal "" A rotten tomato and a raw fish,"" he tells the guard.  

 Well, the warden from San Francisco had heard of Charlie and his previous death sentences so before he brought Charlie in to be executed he sent a letter to the mayor asking to reroute the city's electricity to the jail. The mayor approved and confident with his new found power the warden smiled and gave the order to pull the switch. The lights in the room burst from the overload and the smell of something burning overwhelmed the air. After a minute, the warden ordered the guard to shut off the chair, and as the smoke cleared, there was Charlie same as always.   

Distraught with emotion, the warden told Charlie to get out of his sights. Charlie, tired of going to jail, finally decided that maybe he shouldn't be a street car conductor after all. So Charlie traveled back to New Orleans and met his friend Thibodeaux at a bar. Thibodeaux after a few minutes of small talk tells Charlie: ""Everyone has heard about the electric chair incidents and I just gotta ask, how were you able to survive all them jolts of electricity through your body, was there something you did that made you resistant to it?""   

Charlie looks at Thibodeaux and says ""I dunno, I guess I was just a bad conductor.""

post,3w33dl,2qh72,jokes,false,1449675774,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3w33dl/my_chilli_fart/,self.jokes,,"went grocery shopping recently while not being altogether sure that course of action was a wise one. You see, the previous evening I had prepared and consumed a massive quantity of my patented 'You're definitely going to Shit yourself' chili. Tasty stuff, albeit hot to the point of being painful, which comes with a written guarantee from me that if you eat the next day both of your butt cheeks WILL fall off.

Here's the thing. I had awakened that morning, and even after two cups of coffee (and all of you know what I mean) nothing happened. No 'Watson's Movement 2'. Despite habanera peppers swimming their way through my intestinal tract, I appeared to be unable to create the usual morning symphony referred to by my next door neighbors as thunder and lightning.

Knowing that a time of reckoning had to come, yet not sure of just when, I bravely set off for the market, a local Walmart grocery store that I often haunt in search of tasty tidbits.

Upon entering the store at first all seemed normal. I selected a cart and began pushing it about dropping items in for purchase. It wasn't until I was at the opposite end of the store from the restrooms that the pain hit me. Oh, don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about. I'm referring to that 'Uh oh, gotta go' pain that always seems to hit us at the wrong time. The thing is, this pain was different.

The habaneras in the chili from the night before were staging a revolt. In a mad rush for freedom they bullied their way through the small intestines, forcing their way into the large intestines, and before I could take one step in the direction of the restrooms which would bring sweet relief, it happened. The peppers fired a warning shot.

There I stood, alone in the spice and baking aisle, suddenly enveloped in a noxious cloud the likes of which has never before been recorded. I was afraid to move for fear that more of this vile odor might escape me. Slowly, oh so slowly, the pressure seemed to leave the lower part of my body, and I began to move up the aisle and out of it, just as an elderly
woman turned into it.

I don't know what made me do it, but I stopped to see what her reaction would be to the malodorous effluvium that refused to dissipate, as she walked into it unsuspecting. Have you ever been torn in two different directions emotionally? Here's what I mean, and I'm sure some of you at least will be able to relate.

I could've warned that poor woman but didn't. I simply watched as she walked into an invisible, and apparently indestructible, wall of odor so terrible that all she could do before gathering her senses and running, was to stand there blinking and waving her arms about her head as though trying to ward off angry bees. This, of course, made me feel terrible, but then made me laugh. Mistake.

Here's the thing. When you laugh, it's hard to keep things 'clamped down', if you know what I mean. With each new guffaw an explosive issue burst forth from my nether region. Some were so loud and echoing that I was later told a few folks in other aisles had ducked, fearing that someone was robbing the store and firing off a shotgun.

Suddenly things were no longer funny. It was coming, and I raced off through the store towards the restrooms, laying down a cloud the whole way, praying that I'd make it before the grand mal assplosion took place.

Luck was on my side. Just in the nick of time I got to the john, began the inevitable 'Oh my God', floating above the toilet seat because my ass is burning SO BAD, purging. One poor fellow walked in while I was in the middle of what is the true meaning of 'Shock and Awe'. He made a gagging sound, and disgustedly said, 'Sonavabitch' and quickly left.

Once finished I left the restroom, reacquired my partially filled cart intending to carry on with my shopping when a store employee approached me and said, 'Sir, you might want to step outside for a few minutes. It appears some prankster set off a stink bomb in the store. The manager is going to run the vent fans on high for a minute or two which ought to take care of the problem.'

That of course set me off again, causing residual gases to escape me. The employee took one sniff, jumped back pulling his shirt up to cover his nose and, pointing at me in an accusing manner shouted, 'IT'S YOU!', then ran off returning moments later with the manager.

I was unceremoniously escorted from the premises and asked none too kindly not to return.

Home again without having shopped, I realized that there was nothing to eat but leftover chili, so I consumed two more bowls. The next day I went to shop at Albertson's. I can't say anymore about that because we are in court over the whole matter. Bastards claim they're going to have to repaint the store.",my chilli fart....,2

Luckily they survived unharmed. As they traveled through the hot desert looking for food and water, they gave up and sat down, thinking of what to do.

As the dust in the air settled, they suddenly could view a mosque ahead. They became very hopeful. But then John said ''Muslims are there. They might help us if we say we are Muslim.'' Then Mike said ''No way, I won't say I'm Muslim, I'm gonna be honest''.

So John and Mike went to the Mosque ahead and were greeted by an Arab Muslim, who asked what their names were.

John thought of a Muslim name and said, 'My name is Muhammad'. And Mike said 'My name is Mike'.

The Arab man said 'Hello Mike.' And told these other men to take Mike and give him food and drink.

Then he turned to John and said, 'Salaam Muhammad. Ramadan Mubarak! (Hello Muhammad, Happy Ramadan)",Here is a Muslim Joke,2

As the man threw a few bucks into her cup the nun launched into a long tirade about the evils of alcohol. She went on and on about how alcohol was tearing apart the fabric of society and how it was the root of all the city's problems.

Slightly pissed off at having to listen to this the guy said, ""Listen sister, I work hard for my money and sometimes at the end of a long day I like a drink or two. That doesn't make me a bad person. I have a wife I idolize and two wonderful kids at home. I provide for my family, I volunteer my time to several local service clubs and I contribute regularly to various charities. Yet you stand here and condemn me just because I drink the occasional glass of scotch!""

The nun was slightly taken aback and replied, ""I see your point my son and I apologize if I offended you but the alcohol is such a powerful demon that all who consume it are doomed...""

""Look there you go again,"" said the man, ""How can you make such a sweeping statement. Have you ever even TRIED alcohol?""

""Of course not!"" gasped the nun, ""The evil alcohol has never touched my lips.""

""Do you really think that one glass of booze can change you from a devout nun to some kind of evil degenerate?""

""Well, I really don't know....""

""I'll tell you what, come into the bar with me and I'll buy you a drink. One drink. I'll prove to you that ""evil"" is not inside the glass, it's inside the person.""

""Oh I could never be seen going into such a den of inequity, it's out of the question.

However, your comment about evil residing in the person rather than the glass is quite intriguing. I must admit you've aroused a curiosity in me.""

""Well let's go inside and settle this""

""No my son, I could never enter such a place... but how about this. Take my tin cup with you and fill it with this ""scotch"" you mentioned. Bring it out to me and I'll try it.""

""You're on!"" said the guy.

Jane thinks for a second and says, ""Uhh. Two?""

The mathematician shakes her head, but, before she can speak, the crowd roars, ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""

Jane steps back up to the mic and says, ""Two plus two equals three.""
And immediately, the crowd shouts in unison, ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""

The mathematician takes the mic and says, ""Jane. This is your last try. What is two plus two?""

Jane walks up and says into the microphone, ""Ummm... Four?""

The crowd screams back, ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""

A part of his act was his pet parrot, who would entertain guests by talking. However, the parrot was being particularly difficult that night.  
  
The magician held up an ordinary cloth, and with a flick of the wrist, it was gone. But as the crowd applauded, the parrot piped up and yelled ""IT'S IN HIS SLEEVE!""  
  
Annoyed, the magician placed his hat on a table. He began to wave his arms around, when the parrot yelled ""RABBIT UNDER THE TABLE!""  
  
The magician, hoping to get away from the parrot ruining his tricks, pulls out a deck of cards. Before he can even approach the crowd, the parrot yells ""EVERY CARD IS THE ACE OF SPADES!""

Furious that his show was ruined, the magician packed up his things and left the parrot behind on stage. That night, there was a horrible storm, and the cruise ship was torn apart. The magician managed to survive, but he was stuck on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea... and as luck would have it, his parrot came flying down and landed next to him.  

For hours, neither said anything, they just glared at each other. As the sun finally came up, the bird sighed and looked at the magician.

The man finishes chewing his steak before responding.

""You wouldn't believe it, trust me.""

""I gotta know.""

The man sighed.

""Okay... I found a genie. I know that sounds ridiculous, but it's true. I decided to really think bout my wishes because I knew they would be the most important decisions of my life. At first I thought I'd wish for immortality, but then I realized how lonely that'd be. I decided to wish for long life and perfect health instead. I never have to worry about going to the doctor, anymore.""

""I thought about wishing for a billion dollars, but that seemed silly. Where would I keep it? I decided instead to wish for exact change whenever I needed it.""

""So you're always as rich as you need to be... Genius! What was the third wish?""

""Oh boy.""
