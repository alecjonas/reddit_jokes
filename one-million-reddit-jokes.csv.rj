""How can I help you two fine gentleman?""

""Oh hello...we-uh...would like to use your phone.""

""Please...we are stranded and out of gas.""

Suddenly an older man comes to the front door and moves the young woman aside.

""Yes ya'll can use my phone. Isabelle, go upstairs.""

The men watch as the young lady heads upstairs and she winks at them before disappearing out of sight. The men call a taxi which will be there the following morning.

""Ya'll can stay the night but don't even think about going near my daughter or I will gun you down like a dog.""

The men agree and they sleep in separate rooms. The following morning the farmer calls the men downstairs. They head down to find him angry with a shotgun in his hands.

""One of ya'll touched Isabelle. I know it. I placed a razorblade in her privates. So drop yer pants let's see who it was.""

The first man is hesitant but the farmer cocks his shotgun and tells him to do it. He drops his pants and sure enough there are cut marks on his dick. The farmer shoots him and aims the gun at the second man. He drops his pants and there are no cut marks.

""Y'all can leave but don't ever let me catch you here again!""

The man runs outside and hops into the taxi.

""Where are we going?"" asks the driver.

""Jass driva!""",The farmer's daughter,4

Outside the purple purple castle there was a purple purple countryside with many purple purple forests and purple purple lakes and purple purple towns. In one of these purple purple towns there was a purple purple street with a purple purple house with a purple purple door and behind this purple purple door there lived a poor purple purple family. When the purple purple winter came the purple purple family ran out of purple purple food and had to beg the purple purple villagers for purple purple money.

However, the purple purple villagers had barely any purple purple food for themselves so the purple purple family had to find another source of purple purple food.

Close to the purple purple castle there was a purple purple forest with majestic purple purple deer that only the purple purple king was allowed to hunt. However, the purple purple family had no other choice so the purple purple father of the purple purple family went out to hunt a purple purple deer.

He went out to the purple purple forest and hunt down a purple purple deer.
Though it took him many people purple hours to carry it back, he finally managed and the purple purple family had food for the day.

But after a few days the purple purple family was hungry again so the purple purple father of the purple purple family went out to the proper purple forest and hunted down a purple purple deer again and the purple purple family was satisfied.

However, they still hadn't learned their lesson on rationing and were soon hungry, as to be expected by now. So the purple purple father of the purple purple family went out to the purple purple forest

* And he hid in a purple purple tree

* And he waited for a very, very long and purple time until finally

* A purple purple deer arrived and he

* Shot it with his purple purple allow, shot from his purple purple bow

* And he dragged the purple purple deer back to the purple purple village

* And snuck down the purple purple road to the purple purple house and knocked on the purple purple door

* And was caught by a purple purple guard.

So the purple purple guard dragged the purple purple family to the purple purple court where they were sentenced by the purple purple king to spend the remainder of their purple purple lives in the deepest, darkest, most people dungeon in all the purple purple land.

The guard dragged the purple purple family down a purple purple staircase.

And then another set of purple purple stairs, and then another.

Each time, the walls got darker and darker and purpler and purpler until they reached the purple purple bottom and walked down a dark purple corridor until at last they reached the deepest darkest most purple cell in the deepest darkest most purple dungeon and opened the purple purple door and said:

""Indigo!""

She insists, ""I've decided, heaven for me!"". But St. Peter says rules are rules and she must visit both.

First he calls an elevator and she anxiously paces back and forth dreading her 24 hours in hell, trying to convince St. Peter to bend the rules for her. But he wont relent.

To her relief hell is more like a sunny Caribbean beach than fire and brimstone. All her old friends are there with flutes of champagne and strawberries chatting.

They welcome her and whisk her off for a three course meal with lobster, sous-vide steak and caviar. The best sorbet she's ever had and they have cocktails into the night.

The Devil turns up fashionably late, welcomes her and drinks and dances. He even sings ""Set fire to the rain"" at kareoke.

Before she knows it St. Peter turns up and whisks her away to the elevator to heaven.

If hell is so great, heaven must be amazing.

There she mingles with cherubs floating amongst the clouds, they don't eat but feel no hunger, they don't drink but feel no thirst and they don't dance but feel nothing but joy.

Finally in what feels like a flash St. Peter reappears and says she must decide.

She says ""Heaven is cool and all, but Hell is where it's at!"" after double and triple checking St. Peter banishes her to hell.

To her shock she finds an endless expanse with nothing but hot sand and dark skies.

The devil appears and she begs him ""What happen? Yesterday everything looked amazing.""

The devil replies: ""Yesterday we were campaigning. Today you voted.""",A politician dies and meets St. Peter,139

That's because he always came up with a pun, no matter the situation, he'd find a pun about it. Mostly, bad puns.

For example, he had to face a Soviet Terrorist named Pain. He had a tumor that would leave him in a constant state of pain. So, the name *pain* comes from there. Anyway, after sneaking into Pain's base, he found a painkiller and used it to kill Pain. Right before killing him, he said 

""I guess you can call me a painkiller now.""

And once, he had to fight againist his father, who was secretly working for North Korean goverment. He, again sneaked his way in. He found his father, and right before killing him, he said

""See? That dad is dead. Yes, this was a dad joke. Or should I call it a dead joke?""

And once, he had to steal an item from a very hidden military base that belonged to North Korea. He also had to plant explosives and blow up the place. But that base was complicated and it was almost impossible to memorize ever single trap and location. So, Navigator Clara was navigating him from USASS. As he got to the base, Clara said 

""Okay, this is very important. You have to fine the item and put it in the special bag so that it doesn't overdose you with radiation.""

""So, you do not want radioactivity. Then I can turn off the radio.""

""*sighs*  Anyway, after you put the item in the bag, blow that entire place. You job is to blow that place. You hear me?""

""Oh... I got it. You just gave me a BLOW JOB!""

Clara then turned off the communication device.

He walked up to a whore house and knocked on the door.

 When the Madam answered, she saw the little boy and asked what he wanted. He said, ""I want to have sex with one of the women inside. I have the money and I'm not leaving until I do."" The Madam figured, why not, so she told him to come in. 

Once in, she told him to pick any of the girls he liked. He asked, ""Do any of the girls have any diseases?"" Of course, the Madam said no. He said,""I heard all the men talking about having to get shots after making it with Amber. THAT'S the girl I want!"" 

Since the little boy was so adamant and had the money to pay for it, the Madam told him to go to the first room on the right. He headed down the hall dragging the squashed cat behind him. Ten minutes later he came back, still dragging the cat, paid the Madam, and headed out the door. 

The Madam stopped him and asked, ""Why did you pick the only girl in the place with a disease, instead of one of the others?"" 

He said, ""Well, if you must know, tonight when I get home, my parents are going out to a restaurant to eat, leaving me at home with my baby-sitter. After they leave, my baby-sitter will have sex with me because she just happens to be very fond of little boys. She will get the disease that I just caught. When Mom and Dad get back, Dad will take the baby-sitter home. On the way, he'll jump the baby-sitter's bones, and he'll catch the disease. Then when Dad gets home from the baby-sitters, he and Mom will go to bed and have sex, and Mom will catch it.

Each time he tried the door, it was ""OCCUPIED"". The stewardess, aware of his predicament, suggested that he go ahead and use the ladies room, but cautioned him against using any of the buttons inside. The buttons were marked ""WW, WA, PP, and ATR"".

Making the mistake that so many men make in disregarding the importance of what a woman says, the man let his curiosity get the best of him and decided to try the buttons anyway.

He carefully pressed the first button marked ""WW"" and immediately warm water sprayed all over his entire bottom. He thought, ""WOW, the women really have it made!"" Still curious, he pressed the button marked ""WA"" and a gentle breeze of warm air quickly dried his hind quarters. He thought that was out of this world! The button marked ""PP"" yielded a large powder puff which delicately applied a soft talc to his rear. Well, naturally he couldn't resist the last button marked ""ATR"".

When he woke up in the hospital he panicked and buzzed for the nurse. When she appeared, he cried out, ""What happened to me? The last thing I remember is I was in the ladies room on a business trip!""

The nurse replied, ""Yes, you were having a great time until you pressed the ""ATR"" button which stands for Automatic Tampon Remover. Your penis is under your pillow.""",Airline Restroom,54

A stats professor plans to travel to a conference by plane. When he passes the security check, they discover a bomb in his carry-on-baggage. Of course, he is hauled off immediately for interrogation. ""I don't understand it!"" the interrogating officer exclaims. ""You're an accomplished professional, a caring family man, a pillar of your parish - and now you want to destroy that all by blowing up an airplane!"" 
""Sorry"", the professor interrupts him. ""I had never intended to blow up the plane."" 
""So, for what reason did you try to bring a bomb on board?!""
 ""Let me explain"" replies the statistician. ""Statistics shows that the probability of a bomb being on an airplane is 1/1000. That's quite high if you think about it - so high that I wouldn't have any peace of mind on a flight.""
 ""And what does this have to do with you bringing a bomb on board of a plane?"" 
""You see, since the probability of one bomb being on my plane is 1/1000, the chance that there are two bombs is 1/1000000. If I already bring one, the chance of another bomb being around is actually 1/1000000, and I am much safer. ",Osama was actually a good guy,0

So they go to the chicken pens.  The room stinks of misery; there are crammed cages in towers up to the ceiling, full of fetid straw and reeking of urea… but no chickens to be seen.  And the manager says: ‘As you can see, how can we mistreat our chickens, when we have no chickens?’

The inspection finishes, and the manager walks the inspector back to the entrance.  Before he leaves, he asks the inspector: ‘So what did you think of our plant?’

Whatever you wish for, your husband will get times ten!""
The woman said, ""That's okay.""
For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world.
The frog warned ☝her, ""You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis whom women will flock to"".
The woman replied, ""That's okay, because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me.""
So, KAZAM-she's the most beautiful woman in the world!
For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world.
The frog said, ""That will make your husband the richest man in the world. And he will be ten times richer than you.""
The woman said, ""That's okay, because what's mine is his and what's his is mine.""

At half time the score is 33 to 0, and it’s only with considerable effort that the little animals manage to stop the opposition’s kickoff return on the twenty-two yard line. 

On the first down, the big animals send the hippopotamus around the right end, but as soon as he gets to the line of scrimmage—Bang!—he’s stopped cold.
Back in the huddle, the squirrel, the captain of the little animals, says, “Say, that was great! Who stopped the hippo, anyway?”
“Me,” says the centipede.

The memories seldom left him, either. Sometimes he'd reminisce - even hear - Tex's southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cigarettes like nothing else. He always kept a pack of Lucky's with him. The boys are gone, now. He knows that; it's just that he forgets, sometimes.

The Witch Doctor tells the guy that he is able to remedy any ailment, and upon doing so he charges a $50 fee. If he cannot cure the ailment, he pays the patient $100. The guy gets the address to the Witch Doctor's office and schedules an appointment for the following day.

The guy goes home and immediately begins to scheme on how to get $100 out of the Witch Doctor. 

He goes to meet the Witch Doctor, and says:
""Doc, my tongue isn't working. I can't taste anything. Is there anything you can do?""
The Witch Doctor replies: ""I have the perfect remedy.""

So the Witch Doctor pulls out a vile of dark liquid. He takes one drop of it and puts it on the guy's tongue. 
The guy quickly responds: ""Doc, this tastes like shit!""
The Witch Doctor replies: ""You owe me $50. Come back with any other ailments and I'll see what I can do.""

So the guy returns home and starts scheming again on how to make his $50 back and make $50 extra.

So he returns the next day and says to the Witch Doctor: ""Doc, there's something wrong with my nose. I can't smell a thing.""
The Witch Doctor replies: ""I have the perfect remedy."" 

So he pulls out the same vile of dark liquid he used the day prior, but this time he just waves it in front of the guy's nose.
The guy responds: ""Doc, this smells like shit!""
The Witch Doctor replies:"" You owe me $50. Come back with any other ailments and I'll see what I can do.""

So this time the guy goes home pissed. Now the best he can do is make back the $100 he has lost, so he starts scheming again.

The guy returns the next day and this time he says: ""Doc, I am blind. What can you do?""
The Witch Doctor replies:""Oh my son, I have no remedy for such an ailment. I owe you $100.""

So the Witch Doctor pulls out a $1 bill and hands it to the guy.
The guy says: ""Doc! You're $99 short here!""

post,57jb2k,2qh72,jokes,false,1476486398,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/57jb2k/the_girlfriend_joke/,self.jokes,,"So I recently moved into a new neighborhood and it's a pretty nice area. After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself.


Being the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?""


And keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel.


So I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, ""Uh... No thanks, I'm good.""


""Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.""


So a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, ""Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.""


So I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, ""OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.""


So I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.


A couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?"" Luckily, she says, ""Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't miss it.""


So I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled ""Video Games."" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, ""Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?"" and she responds with, ""No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it."" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.


So I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.


So a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me.""


I tell her, ""Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great."" 


She says, ""Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow.""


So next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again.""


""Wait, what? Why not? What happened?""


""Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.""


""I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person""


""She told me, and I quote, that she is going to fucking murder me.""


""I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.""


I go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.


So day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.


Then I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, ""She's dead, you're next."" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.


Now I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE.


And it raises the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?

He'd never married, and furthermore had never even attempted to have sex, and decided that he'd waited long enough. It was time to start dating. 

During his next doctors visit, he shared with the doctor his plans, so the doctor performed a full physical...and the results weren't good. 

The doctor explained that the elderly gentleman had a rare disease that had slowly caused the muscles in and around his penis to degenerate. It simply wasn't functional. 

But the news wasn't all bad. The doctor had heard of a radical procedure in which the muscles from a baby elephants trunk could be transplanted into his penis, giving him back a fully functional member. But it wasn't without risk...the surgery alone could kill him, and the price was incredibly high. 

The elderly man thought on the surgery, and decided that he'd go forward with it. He was old after all, so death didn't scare him much, and his years of being a bachelor had allowed him to save a fortune. He signs up and goes under the knife. 

Several weeks later, after he's had a chance to heal up, he meets a gorgeous younger woman. He works up some courage and asks her out to dinner...and she accepts. 

Two days later he picks her up and takes her to the nicest restaurant in town. They carry on a wonderful conversation as drinks are ordered, and seem to be hitting it off as they make their dinner selections. 

In short order the waiter brings by a basket of rolls. The old man begins to feel a pain in his groin. As he reaches down, he can feel a bulge...and it's growing. The pain continues, and he knows he's got to relieve the pressure in his pants, so he quietly reaches down and unzips his pants. 

Almost immediately his penis unrolls, flies out of his pants, onto the table, grabs a roll, and retreats back into his pants. 

""That was AMAZING!"" The young woman said, ""do you think you could do it again?""

""Maybe"", the old man says with tears running down his face, ""but I'm not sure I can fit another hot roll up my ass"".
