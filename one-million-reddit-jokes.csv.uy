Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor, holding his penis out in front of him.

But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk open, pulled out his penis and pointed it at Uncle Vernon.

He looked up. Riddle was still watching him twirling Harry’s penis between his long fingers. “Thanks” said Harry, stretching out his hand for it. A smile curled the corners of Riddles mouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the penis idly.

Harry took the penis. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the penis above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on the walls.

“”EXPECTO PATRONUM!” Harry yelled. Nothing happened. Harry gripped his dick tighter and shook it up and down until a thick, whispy white substance protruded from the end of it.” 

“Panting, Harry fell forwards over the hydrangea bush, straightened up and stared around. There were several faces peering through various nearby windows. Harry stuffed his dick hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent.”

 The scientist knew that although he had made one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs in history, there was no way he could present such an embarrassing example to the world's press, so he decided to kill the clone and make a less offensive replica of himself. 

 The scientist took the clone to the top of a high cliff with the intention of pushing him over the edge. 

 ""Where are you f-ing taking me, you silly old c**t?"" asked the clone as they walked along the cliff edge. 
 ""Just for a nice bit of fresh air"" said the scientist, unconvincingly. 
 ""You're going to f-ing push me over the ******* cliff aren't you, you f-wit!"" screamed the clone as he tried to run away. 
 Unfortunately for the clone, this proved somewhat difficult as he had his trousers around his ankles and was quickly caught by the scientist and tripped up. 

 Quick as a flash, the scientist rolled him off the edge of the cliff and watched him fall to his death. 

 Several weeks went by and the scientist was wracked with guilt and decided to go to the police. Based on the fact that the clone was not officially alive, he was sure he would get away with it. 

 In the police station he told his story, confident that he could not be charged with anything. After much deliberation the chief inspector decided to arrest the scientist. 
 The scientist was shocked and asked on what charge was his arrest based on.

We not yet have American multiplication system, and we hate fucking Russian system, so we do proud Latvian multiplication system in Latvia.

**LATVIAN MULTIPLICATION**

To the example, Ludvigs, Mihails and Pavils argue how many potatoes have. Mihails want have 50 potato, but not sure how many potato have. Pavils math and Ludvigs drink.

**50 potato x 0 potato** (This is original problem need do for math. Now see math below.)

25 potato x 0 potato

12 potato x 0 potato

6 potato x 0 potato

3 potato x 0 potato

1 potato x 0 potato

Now sum right side column:

0+0+0+0+0+0=**0 potato**

So Mihails have zero potato, hungry and Latvia cannot afford American math system, but have independent country and proud mathematical system that superior to Russian Communist math.

He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen Sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs!

Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, “What’s your Business at this convention?”

“Lecturer,” she responded. “I use information that I have learned from my Personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.”

“Really?” he said. “And what kind of myths are there?”

“Well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that African-American men are The most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is That Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Mexican Descent who are the best. I have also discovered that the lover with Absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck.”

Since he wasn’t physically impaired he remained in the military and eventually became an Admiral.  However, during his career he was always sensitive about his appearance.  One day the Admiral was interviewing two Navy Master Chiefs and a Marine Gunnery Sergeant for his personal staff. The first Master Chief was a Surface Navy type and it was a great interview. At the end of the interview the Admiral asked him, “Do you notice anything different about me?” The Master Chief answered, “Why yes. I couldn’t help but notice you are missing your starboard ear, so I don’t know whether this impacts your hearing on that side.” The Admiral got very angry at this lack of tact and threw him out of his office. The next candidate, an Aviation Master Chief, when asked this same question, answered, “Well yes, you seem to be short one ear.” The Admiral threw him out also. The third interview was with the Marine Gunnery Sergeant .  He was articulate, extremely sharp, and seemed to know more than the two Master Chiefs put together.  The Admiral wanted this guy, but went ahead with the same question. “Do you notice anything different about me?” To his surprise the Gunnery Sergeant said, “Yes. You wear contact lenses.” The Admiral was impressed and thought to himself, what an incredibly tactful Marine. “And how do you know that?” the Admiral asked. The Gunny replied, “Well sir, it’s pretty hard to wear glasses with only one ear.”",If You Love military joke Then Read This One And Please Dont Laugh Lol......!,0

I went without breakfast and hurried out to the car, just to realize that I'd locked the house with both house and car keys inside and had to break a window to get my keys.

""Then, driving a little too fast, I got a speeding ticket. Later, when I was about three blocks from the store, I had a flat tire.""
""When I finally got to the store a bunch of people were waiting for me to open up. I got the store opened and started waiting on these people, all the time the darn phone was ringing off the hook.""

He continued, ""Then I had to break a roll of nickels against the cash register drawer to make change, and they spilled all over the floor. I had to get down on my hands and knees to pick up the nickels and the phone was still ringing. When I came up I cracked my head on the open cash drawer, which made me stagger back against a showcase with a bunch of perfume bottles on it. Half of them hit the floor and broke.""

""Meanwhile, the phone is still ringing with no let up, and I finally got back to answer it. It was your wife. She wanted to know how to use a rectal thermometer. And believe me mister, my hand to God, all I did was tell her.""

Panicking, our inflatable boy yet again pulls out the pin and jabs it into himself. Later on that evening, he wakes up in an inflatable hospital and, in the bed next to him, he sees the inflatable headmaster.

A leading local politician and member of the congregation was chosen to make the presentation and to give a little speech at the dinner.

However, since the politician was delayed, the Priest decided to say his own few words while they waited:

I got my first impression of the parish from the first confession I heard here. I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place. The very first person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and, when questioned by the police, was able to lie his way out of it. He had stolen money from his parents, embezzled from his employer, had an affair with his boss’s wife, taken illegal drugs and gave VD to his girlfriend. 

I was appalled. But as the days went on, I learned that my people were not all like that and I had, indeed, come to a fine parish full of good and loving people.

Just as the Priest finished his talk, the politician arrived full of apologies at being late. He immediately began to make the presentation and gave his talk:

I’ll never forget the first day our parish Priest arrived, said the politician. In fact, I had the honor of being the first person to go to him for confession.

""Who is our Lord and Savior?"" But, again, June didn't stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. 

""JESUS CHRIST!"" shouted June and the teacher said,

""Very good! I'm proud of you, June,"" and she fell back to sleep.

""What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?""

He would sleep in the tree house in the park. He had been abandoned as a small child and had to survive by eating the leftover food of picnics and parties. 

Every day he would go swimming in the lake, practicing diving out of the a tree. He became really good at it and took pride in the one thing he was good at.

One day he was caught by a lady after trying to steal food from a birthday party. Fortunately the lady was really kind and, instead of taking him to the police, gave him 50$. 

The boy had never seen such money before in his life and thanked the lady. He wanted to spend the money on something that he would enjoy. 

He decided to spend the money on a vacation cruise. He went to try and book a room on the ship but the person told him that 50$ was not nearly enough for a proper room. He begged and said that he would stay in any room. The person said there was one room available. He took it without any hesitation.

when he got to the ship an attendant walked him to his cabin. On the first floor, the rooms were made out of diamond. The boy thought he would be staying there with much glee. The attendant said that his room was further down. They walked past a gold room, silver room, bronze room, copper room, iron room, they past the kitchen and even the pantry. 

eventually they got to the boiler room, the attendant said that his room was behind the boiler through a somewhat hidden door. Nonetheless, the boy was still happy.

A little while later the captain came to the boy and said that the boy had to work on the ship in order to pay for the remaining fees. The boy told the captain the only thing he was good at was diving into water. The captain came up with a great idea. The boy would dive from a high ladder into the pool in order to entertain guests. 

Later that day, the staff began to prepare the ladder. The ladder was high but the boy said that it could go higher, so they raised it. Again the boy demanded it go higher. They kept on raising it until the boy was pleased. The ladder was so high it was almost impossible to see the top.

""Bob! It's great to see you again! Please come inside!""

""I'm amazed, but I'm absolutely sure that you don't know Queen Elizabeth.""  
""Actually, I was planning on seeing her soon anyway."" Bob replies, and as you can probably guess, they got into a plane and flew to London, England.  
When they arrived at Buckingham Palace, there was a huge crowd around the stage where Queen Elizabeth does her famous wave.

""Tell you what,"" he says as he turns to Jeff, ""I'll get into the Palace, and I'll go up on stage with her. That'll prove I know her.""  
""Fine,"" Jeff says.  
Bob went into the palace, and Jeff waited in this huge crowd for a few minutes. Then, the Queen walked up with Bob and they did the famous wave.  
When Bob came back into the crowd, he could see an ambulance with Jeff on a stretcher.  
""Jeff!"" Bob shouted, ""What happened?""

Smiling to himself, he stopped to listen and heard her say, “God bless mommy, God bless daddy, God bless Grandpa, bye bye Grandma.” How odd, thought father, but he didn’t want his daughter to know he’d been listening so he didn’t say anything to her. But tragically, next day Grandma collapsed and died. 

A few months went by and one evening father heard his daughter praying again. “God bless mommy, God bless daddy, bye bye Grandpa. No, it couldn’t mean anything thought father apprehensively, but next morning they received a phone call to say that Grandpa had passed away in his sleep! 

The household got back to normal and almost a year passed before father heard his daughter again. “God bless mommy, bye bye daddy.” Absolutely panic-stricken, father stayed up all night, too frightened to sleep in case he didn’t wake up. The next morning he walked to work instead of taking the car, in case there was an accident, and spent the day at his desk doing very little but worrying. 

When he got home that evening he collapsed into a chair, his nerves in pieces, and told his wife all about the nightmare day that he’d had. She replied, “You’re not the only one to have had a bad day. This morning when I opened the front door I found the gasman dead on the front doorstep.”",One evening...,8

So this guy decides that he's going to Vegas. No special occasion, he just wants to go and gamble and drink and enjoy the many luxuries of Sin City. So he gets there and almost immediately gets loaded and orders himself a prostitute to his hotel room. They ask him if he has a preference of girl. He says 
""No preference but she had better be your top prostitute!"" 
They send a girl right over and she wants to make sure that she's the best prostitute experience he's ever had. She knocks on the door and as soon as she gets inside she rips her clothes off, lays down on the bed and says 
""Stick your fingers in my pussy you stud."" 
So he does, already pleased with the quality of this particular prostitute. She moans 
""OHHH YEAH! Why don't you put a couple more fingers in there big boy?"" 
So he does without hesitating *Kersploosh* He's knuckle deep on his right hand and she's loving every minute of it. This guy's in heaven. She quivers with excitement and says 
""Get your whole fucking fist in there"" 
So he does! He's got his whole hand in this woman, he's wiggling his fingers around, he's performing complex gang signs, there's room to spare is what i'm saying. She squeals and screams and says to him, 
""Get your other hand inside of me."" 
So he does, he just slides it right in there with a wide eyed grin you only see from a kid at Christmas. She says 
""Yeah that's it big boy, see if you can get them in up to your elbow!"" 
So he does. *SPEEELUNK* He's all the way up in there now and she whispers to him 
""Now clap for me."" 
He moves his hands around and tries to find enough room to clap before he says a defeated 
""I can't...I can't clap.""

One of them is a local homeless guy with no arms The priest almost laughs when the guy asks to try out.

""How are you going to ring the bell?"" the priest asks.

""Let me show you,"" the man replies. So the two of them climb up the bell tower. The priest watches as the man backs up, gets a running start and slams his face into the bell. The results is the most beautiful ""BONNNNNNNGGGGGG"" the priest has ever heard.

""You're hired,"" he says. For years, the homeless man serves as the church's bell ringer, sleeping with the livestock and waking up ever morning to slam his face into the bell. His stench grows worse, and nobody ever gets close enough to learn the man's name.

One day, the man is tasked with ringing the bell during a thunderstorm. He gets his running start, and right when he's about to launch himself into the bell, he loses his footing on the wet floor and slides across and out the window, where he falls to his death.

A crowd gathers around his lifeless body on the cobblestones below.

""Who is he?"" asks someone.

""I don't know,"" comes the reply, ""but his face rings a bell.""

“Really?” he said. “And what kind of myths are there?”

“Well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that African-American men are The most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is That Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Mexican Descent who are the best.

The barman looks at him and says, “hang on! You’re a duck.”

“I see your eyes are working,” replies the duck.

“And you can talk!” exclaims the barman.

“I see your ears are working, too,” says the Duck.  “Now if you don’t mind, can I have my beer and my sandwich please?”

“Certainly, sorry about that” says the barman as he pulls the duck’s pint.  “It ‘s just we don’t get many ducks in this pub.. What are you doing round this way?”

“I’m working on the building site across the road,” explains the duck.  “I’m a plasterer.”

The flabbergasted barman cannot believe the duck and wants to learn more, but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it.

So, the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his sandwich, bids the barman good day and leaves.

The same thing happens for two weeks.

Then one day the circus comes to town.

The ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the barman says to him “you’re with the circus, aren’t you? Well, I know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. He talks, drinks beer, eats sandwiches, reads the newspaper and everything!”

“Sounds marvelous,” says the ringmaster, handing over his business card. “Get him to give me a call.”

So the next day when the Duck comes into the pub the barman says, “hey Mr. Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money.”

“I’m always looking for the next job,” says the duck.  “Where is it?”

“At the circus,” says the barman.

“The circus?” repeats the duck.

“That’s right,” replies the barman.

“The circus?” the duck asks again. “With the big TENT?”

“Yeah,” the barman replies.

“With all the animals who live in CAGES, and performers who live in CARAVANS?” says the duck.

“Of course,” the barman replies.

“And the tent has CANVAS sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?” persists the duck.

“That’s right!” says the barman.

The duck shakes his head in amazement, and says ..

his pocket and pulls out a five dollar bill. He walks down the street to the
local brothel and knocks on the door. The madame opens the door and asks
Jack what she can do for him.
'I'm really horny, but I only have $5. What can you do for me?' Jack asks
the madam.
She looks over this fellow and tells him, 'Don't worry. We can take care of
you. No problem.'
She leads Jack into this room where in the opposite corner is a chicken.
Jack thinks about this a second and figures it can't be that bad. He gives
the madam the $5 and she closes the door behind her. Jack undresses and has
the time of his life. When he's done he can't remember when he had ever had
such a pleasurable experience.
One week later, and horny again, Jack has saved up $10. Being a satisfied
customer he goes back to the same madame and asks what she can do for him
for $10.
'Well, for $10 we have a special show,' the madame replies. She leads him
into a different room where there are several other people sitting on
benches. 'Sit back and enjoy the show, Jack,' she tells him.
Jack gives the money to the madame and takes a seat on one of the benches.
Soon after, the lights dim and the blinds open, revealing another room on
the other side of a two-way mirror where two women begin to undress each
other. Jack is very impressed. Clearly these women are unaware anyone is
watching as they begin to make love to each other passionately. Apparently
there is nothing they won't do to each other.
Jack once again feels like he is getting his money's worth. He turns to the
person beside him and says, 'This is a pretty good show for ten bucks, eh?!'
The guy turns to Jack and says, 'That's nothing... last week we saw a guy
screw a chicken!'",Jack is one horny guy and is not sure........,5

As a result of these three experiments, the scientists wrote in their final report that the dog had lost it's hearing after having three legs cut off. ",Jokes on Dog,1

- Hey people, do you want to see Chuff?  
- No, we don't have time for that!  
- Guys, I won't be going back, it is a one-time experience.  
At first villagers thought that it was stupid but after a while they decided to go with him.  
So they were walking and walking... and they arrived to the city.  
- Heyyy, people! do you want to see... Chuff?!  
- Go f*ck yourself! Noone wants to see it! We are busy, go away!  
- But heyyy people, it is your only chance to see Chuff, think about it.  
And finally the citizens joined the mysterious wizard too.
Then the mysterious wizard went to the wood and yelled:  
- Heyyy animals! Gather up! Do you want Chuff?!  
- Go away mysterious wizard! We have to survive, prepare food for the winter, raise up your kids and...  
- My sweet animals, Chuff can change your life forever. Go with me, I will show you.  
And the animals followed him.
And they were wandering through woods, mountains, rivers, cities, villages and all that stuff.  
He was gathering more and more people when finally they arrived to that place.  
It was a lake surronded by mountains. Next to it there was a mystical sword covered with ancient runes in the stone.  
- Sooo, people! Do you want to see Chuff?!  
- Yes!!! Give it to us already!!!  
- Sooo, animals, do you want the Chuff?!!  
- Come on wizard!!!  
- Okay, okay...  
The mysterious wizard pulled out the sword,  
walked to the lake and throwed the sword.
  
When the water was splashing you could hear the...  
""chuff""!

One day, Ving told Ling that he didn't like his name anymore because it was weird and he got bullied for it. He wanted to change it to 'Lee' like Bruce Lee. But his sister told him that he can't do it for it'd be blasphemous to his father and his entire warrior ancestry. He couldn't care less and sneaked after school to the town's court, where Ling joined him. At the court, he requested the form where he could provide the information for changing his name and he had his birth certificate and everything along with him too. As he started to write his name into the form, he threw the pen away and broke down, sobbing like never before. His sister went up to him. ""I can't do this Ving, I really want to, but father will do horrible things to me, I know it. It's blasphemous."" His sister hugs him and requests a cancellation from the court. ""I'm sorry ma'am, but cancellation requires a separate fee in and of itself."" Just as she reaches into her purse, their dad bursts into the courtroom, with tears in his eyes. ""Son, do you really want this?"", he asks loudly with tears in his eyes. ""Yes dad, but I know it'll be blasphemous to you."" His dad hugs him and Ling. ""Son, then I've only got one thing to say to you;
