The farmer nods. ""That's a good start, but you'll need to work on your lingo.""

""Well, see, you said you'd need a rooster,"" answers the farmer. ""Around these parts, we call that a cock. You also said you'd need a chicken... but as it happens, we call that a pullet. Anyway, I can sell you one of each so that you can get the hang of caring for them.""

Money exchanges hands, and the city-slicker leaves, a chicken held under one arm and a rooster held under the other.

'I Wanted A Wank Over The Washing Machine But I Got My Balls Caught In The Soap Drawer'.

'As I Fuck You Under The Stars With The Moonlight Shining Off Your Hairy Ring-Piece,' replies the bloke.
The manager is highly upset by the bloke's language but offers him the job on condition that he doesn't introduce any of his songs or talk to any of the customers.
This arrangement works well for a couple of months until one night, sitting opposite him, is the most gorgeous blonde he has ever laid his eyes on.
She's wearing an almost see through dress, her breasts are almost falling out the top of her black lace bra, and the skimpy little 'G' string she's wearing is doing very little to conceal her ample charms. She's sitting there with her legs slightly open, sucking suggestively on asparagus shoots as the butter is dripping down her chin.
The image is too much for the bloke and he scurries off to the Gents to masturbate. He's tugging away furiously when he hears the manager's voice.
'Where's that bastard pianist?'
He just has time to relieve himself, and in a fluster he runs back to the piano having not bothered to adjust himself properly, sits down and starts playing some more tunes. The blonde steps up and walks over to the piano, leans over and whispers in his ear,
'Do you know your knob and bollocks are hanging out your trousers and dripping spunk on your shoes?'
'Know it?' the bloke replies 'I fucking wrote it.'",The bloke with turret's syndrome,0

Next were the eyes – “Well, we see all the beauty on earth for man, therefore, we should be boss.”
Then the asshole applied. No sooner than he applied, all of the other parts began to laugh. They all laughed so hard that the asshole closed up.
After a few days of this closing, the legs went weak, the brain fogged up and the eyes shut closed. At that point, the case was closed and the asshole won.

""No thank you, I must save myself for God"" the nun politely replies. At the next stop, she gets off the bus, and goes about her day.

The hippie, now in a slump, is walking off the bus when the bus driver taps him on the shoulder. ""Hey, I saw what happened, and I think I can help."" 

Excitedly the hippie replies ""Please, I really want to have sex with a nun!"" 

The driver leans in,  ""Ok buddy. Listen closely. Every Sunday night at 10:00, I drop that nun off at the cemetery where she prays to God for hours. If you disguise yourself as God, I guarantee you can convince her to have sex with you."" 

At this point the hippie is thinking, 'Right on, she's mine for the taking' and his morale has skyrocketed. He hands the driver a generous tip, and uses the rest of his money to buy a disguise. 

Sunday night comes, and the hippie is decked out in a sparkling white robe, long grey wig and fake beard; and sure enough at 10:00, the nun arrives as promised. 

Cautiously approaching her, the hippie reveals himself and says ""Alas, it is I, God. I have come to answer your prayers, but first you must have sex with me!"" 

The nun, struck by awe, looks at the hippie and says ""Yes my lord! But can we do anal so I can remain pure for you?""

'Home run' thinks the hippie. ""Of course my child"" he answers. 

Soon enough, the hippie has finally had completed his quest of having sex with the nun, so he rips off his disguise and yells ""AH-HA! ITS ME! THE HIPPIE!""

'Where's the pissing, mother fucking manager, you cock sucking arsewipe?' he inquires of one of the waiters.

The waiter is taken-aback and replies, 'Excuse me sir but could you please refrain from using that sort of language in here. I will get the manager as soon as I can'.

The manager comes over and the bloke asks, 'Are you the fucking manager of this bastard place?'

'Yes sir, I am,' replies the manager, 'but I would prefer it if you would refrain from speaking such profanities in this, a private restaurant'.

'Fuck off' replies the bloke 'and where's the fucking piano?' 'Pardon?' says the manager.

'Fucking deaf as well, are we? You snivelling little piece of shit, show me your cunting piano.' 'Ah,' replies the manager, 'you've come about the pianist job' and he shows the bloke to the piano. 'Can you play any blues?'

'Of course I fucking can,' and the bloke proceeds to play the most inspiring and beautiful sounding honky-tonk blues that the manager has ever heard.

'That's superb. What's it called?'

'I Tried To Shag Yer Missus On The Sofa But The Springs Kept Hurting My Dick,' replies the bloke.

The manager is a bit disturbed and asks if the bloke knows any jazz. The bloke proceeds, playing the most melancholy jazz solo the manager has ever heard.

'Magnificent,' cries the manager. 'What's it called?'

'I Wanted A Wank Over The Washing Machine But I Got My Balls Caught In The Soap Drawer'.

The manager is a tad embarrassed and asks if he knows any romantic ballads. The bloke then plays the most heartbreaking melody the manager has ever heard, 'And what's this called?' asks the manager.

'As I Fuck You Under The Stars With The Moonlight Shining Off Your Hairy Ring-Piece,' replies the bloke.

The manager is highly upset by the bloke's language but offers him the job on condition that he doesn't introduce any of his songs or talk to any of the customers.

This arrangement works well for a couple of months until one night, sitting opposite him, is the most gorgeous blonde he has ever laid his eyes on.

She's wearing an almost see through dress, her breasts are almost falling out the top of her black lace bra, and the skimpy little 'G' string she's wearing is doing very little to conceal her ample charms. She's sitting there with her legs slightly open, sucking suggestively on asparagus shoots as the butter is dripping down her chin.

The image is too much for the bloke and he scurries off to the Gents to masturbate. He's tugging away furiously when he hears the manager's voice.

'Where's that bastard pianist?'

He just has time to relieve himself, and in a fluster he runs back to the piano having not bothered to adjust himself properly, sits down and starts playing some more tunes. The blonde steps up and walks over to the piano, leans over and whispers in his ear,

'Do you know your knob and bollocks are hanging out your trousers and dripping spunk on your shoes?'

'Know it?' the bloke replies 'I fucking wrote it.'

One day, two boys filled up a bucket of macadamia nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts.

'One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me,' said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.

Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. 

Sure enough, he heard, 'One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me...'

He just knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along.

'Come here quick,' said the boy, 'you won't believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!'

The man said, 'Beat it kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk.' When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery.

Standing by the fence they heard, 'One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.'

The old man whispered, 'Boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord...

Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.

At last they heard, 'One for you, one for me. That's all.. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence and we'll be done....

One year, he comes to town, heads straight for the bar, and tells the bartender ""set 'em up, I'm celebratin'!"" 

After he knocks back a few, he motions for the bartender to come closer, and whispers ""hey, I just got my money from the claim for this year, and I'm lookin' to spend some of it...ya'll got any women' round here?""

  The bartender replies ""nope, haven't had any women 'round these parts since summer before last.  But if it's a good time you're lookin' fer, we got 'ol Jim round the back.""

The old prospector jumps up and shouts ""goddammit I ain't one of them city fellers, and I ain't into that shit!""
He storms out and no one sees him for the rest of the year.

The next year, around the same time, the old prospector comes down from his claim, and goes to the bank, and then straight to the bar again.  He tells the bartender ""set up them glasses and leave the bottle, I've got some drinkin' to do!""

After he's downed about 6 shots, he motions the bartender over, and whispers 
""I've been up on that claim 'fer years and haven't seen nor felt a woman in ages.  You got any women what I might pay for some comp'ny?""

The bartender replies ""Welp, we did have a lass come through about September, but she gone off to San Francisco after a couple a' weeks.  But if'n you're that hard up, we still got 'ol Jim 'round the back.""

The prospector leaps up and practically roars, ""I done told you last year I ain't into that shit!!""

He leaves town in a huff and no one sees him for a full two years this time.

2 years later, the prospector comes riding into town, heads as usual for the bank, and then straight to the bar.  He calls the bartender and says ""a round for everyone in here, and a bottle o' your finest juss for me!  I got two years worth of catchin' up in me!!""

After the prospector is good and tipsy, he motions the bartender over, and whispers ""Listen, I know ya said you ain't got no women the last time I came through here, but anything changed since then?""

The bartender shakes his head and says, ""sorry mister, the last woman I seen was the school mistress what died of consumption last July.  But if you're really itchin' fer somethin' we still got 'ol Jim 'round the back.""

The prospector takes one look at the bartender, and says, ""Look mister, I told you I ain't into that shit!""  Then he leans closer and whispers even lower, ""But, um, supposin' I was to go round back with 'ol Jim...who 'round here would know about it?""

The bartender looks at him, thinks for a minute, and says ""Welp, there's you 'o course, and there's me, and obviously 'ol Jim's gotta know about it too.  Oh, and there's the two other guys.""

The prospector looks baffled, and says, ""what the hell would we need to bring in two other guys for?""

The same beige pants every day. Really starts to put a strain on your eyes.

So I asked him why he wears them, and he responds that it's because they're durable, cool and make him feel indestructible, and he attributes his success to his pants.

One day I decide to deter him from wearing these same pants: every day for the next week I almost spill coffee on him, but I either miss or I stop just before.

He of course exclaims: 

""With these babies on, nothing could ever happen!""

So the next week I don't stop myself. I just watch as the black coffee falls onto his beige pants, the stark contrast looking extremely uncomfortable, hell, looking at it someone could assume something else.

So he asks to leave that day, and the next day, comes back with some different pants.

A man walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich bird behind him. 

The waitress asks them for their orders. 

The man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke,' and turns to the ostrich, 'What's yours?' 

'I'll have the same,' says the ostrich. 

A short time later the waitress returns with the order 'That will be $9.40 please,' and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment. 

The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke' 

The ostrich says, 'I'll have the same' 

Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. 

This becomes routine until the two enter again. 

'The usual?' asks the waitress. 

'No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and a salad,' says the man. 
'Same,' says the ostrich. 

Shortly the waitress brings the order and says, 'That will be $32.62.' 

Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. 

The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer.
 
""Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time?"" 

Says the man, ""Well, several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. 

The first wish I asked was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.""

The waitress said ""That's brilliant! Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live. How smart of you!''

""That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact amount of money is always there"" says the man proudly.

The waitress asks, ""But, what's that ostrich all about?""

The man sighs, pauses and answers with a heavy heart, ""My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who accompanies me wherever I go and agrees with everything I say"".

This greatly aided the poor woman in her familial matters, along with hiring several competent nannies, and her children generally grew up without serious issues.

One of the younger children, a lovely young lady who was ninetieth in line, grew into a lovely young woman who soon married and started a family of her own, after confirming with her fiance that they would have no more than two children. She may have grown up without serious issues, but she wasn't about to repeat the past.

They had two children as planned, twins actually, a boy and a girl. They grew up happy and playful, and all was well until they saw a stray cat hiding under their back porch. The poor thing was cold and alone, and the siblings decided to take it in. There was just one problem. 

Their mother absolutely would not allow pets.
Having devoted herself to having a better life than hey childhood, Ninety kept a very clean household, and she refused to let an animal get dirt everywhere, be constantly underfoot, and be a general nuisance. Her husband accepted this as a product of her unusual upbringing, and made it a point to never go against her on the fact.

Yet still, seeing the poor cat, all alone in the world, filled the twins with compassion. They snuck it into the basement and tended to it over the next few weeks, until it was healthy and happy. The children were shrewd enough to always keep the cat out of their parents' knowledge, and decided upon an ingenious system of communicating about their hidden pet. They named it ""This"".

Whenever they had to discuss the cat in earshot of their parents, they could do so freely, saying things like ""I'll take care of This tonight,"" or ""This will be ok until I get back from school."" Using this method, the children spent a happy time caring for their little friend, until tragedy struck.

The children had just come home from school, and they went downstairs to check on This. Much to their horror, they discovered the basement door ajar and This nowhere to be found. They ran out into the yard to see a horrifying sight: their poor cat, on the side of the road, hit by a passing car. 

The twins ran to save their pet, but by the time they made it to This, they realized it had passed away. They looked at each other in sadness, but realized there was nothing to be done. They couldn't even talk to their mother or their father about their loss, without revealing the whole affair. Hanging their heads, they gathered up This's remains and took them into a nearby forest. They buried it by an old oak tree, and vowed to keep This alive in their hearts always. Thus showing that

She follows his trail and finds him furiously humping a tree-trunk that has a curiously well-used looking hole in it. Initially disgusted, she's mollified thinking, ""At least he wasn't doing it with other animals like everybody else claimed, this was his best way to relieve stress for all those years."" At that, she decides Tarzan need not go through that ordeal ever again.

The next night, she sits next to the door, all dolled up and inviting, legs spread wide open, waiting for Tarzan. When he finally makes his appearance, he sees her and makes an enquiring hoot to which she replies, ""I know where you're headed off to, you don't need to suffer through that indignity anymore now that I'm here"", while gesturing to herself.

Tarzan looks her up and down considering, then nods his head, comes running at a full sprint and kicks her right in the puss.
Jane, now rolling around in agony, anticipation all forgotten, asks him with tears in her eyes, ""…why?""

Tarzan shrugs, ""Checking for squirrels.""","One of the first ""dirty"" jokes I heard when I was 10",169

To make it more popular, the bar let its customers choose the next bartender.

The bartender assistant and the alcoholic were sitting at a table, while the bar owner and the prohibition supporter at another. The other customers were carefully watching and waiting to decide which of these people was more fit to be the next bartender.

The bar owner was wealthy and owned a share of the bar, but nobody seemed to be concerned with the conflict of interest between owning part of the bar and being the bartender. He spoke first: ""This bar has gone down the tubes. The problem is all the unwashed people who come from across the street to drink here. They break everything, they harass the regular customers, and they increase demand which drives the prices up.""

The prohibition supporter spoke second: ""The problem aren't people from across the street. Heck, my father lives across the street. The problem is the bar is serving alcohol. And the biggest issue are the gay customers. Nobody wants this to turn into gay bar! At least people should choose if they let gays at their table.""

The bar owner replied: ""I think you lie in everything you say. You can't be a bartender and in favor of prohibition. Your father who educated you is probably guilty of killing one of the last bartenders we had, the one who died in mysterious circumstances.""

At the other table, the alcoholic spoke first: ""The price of drinks is too high. It is immoral when somebody can't pay for the drink they ordered and they have to mop the floor as payment. This bar has become increasingly open only for the owners. We need to fundamentally change our view and realize the real owners are the customers. Also, every other high class bar in town offers free rides to the hospital to intoxicated customers. I have stood up to bar owners numerous times in the past and I'm telling you, free drinks and bartending classes should be available for everyone!"" The alcoholic had drank his life away, but a lot of customers respected him for being a regular. Unfortunately, those who wanted him as bartender were not old enough to drink legally.

The bartender assistant, who worked at the bar, sought to replace the retiring bartender and replied to the alcoholic: ""Your theory about how only bar owners drink here doesn't make sense. The price of a drink is a contract between the customers and the bar owners and it is negotiated with only moderate bartender interference. If the bar owners step over the line, then I, as future bartender, promise to go and tell them to cut it out!""

The alcoholic replied: ""What are you talking about? You will be paid by the bar owners. How can the customers believe you will look after them?""

The customers in the bar decided the prohibition supporter and the alcoholic were not fit to become bartenders, but they still had to choose between the bar owner and the bartender assistant. Meanwhile, one of the customers was asking the others who did they think was best for the job, and they predicted the bartender assistant would be the new bartender.

The bartender assistant then spoke: ""I want to be the first woman bartender. And despite women being just as good at bartending, mugs are heavy, and a female customer might drop it. Under current policy, she doesn't have to pay for the spilled drink but under my policy, she wouldn't pay for the mug either. I have lots of experience in bartending and I can make everyone happy. The bar owner has none, has never worked before and this would be his first job, and considering he doesn't want customers from across the street, I don't even know how he's so wealthy or how this bar would sustain itself. Every customer should be valued. In fact, my bartender assistant will be from across the street.""

The bar owner replied: ""You are corrupt. The bartender with whom you work now doesn't even have the necessary credentials and you admitted it the last time you tried to become bartender instead of him. I also heard you took tips from some customers to give them their drinks faster while others were in line. You were also paid by other bars to help them sell their drinks here and steal our customers. And the last time a customer was killed in a bar fight by some guy on the street, you forgot to lock the doors and call 911. You are so corrupt, you might turn the basement of this bar into a child brothel. My assistant will be a prohibition supporter to help me combat alcoholism.""

In a stunning upset that reverberated across the town, the bar owner was decided by the customers to become the bartender. Technically, more customers wanted the bartender assistant as bartender, but the rules of the bar said each table decides for itself and then the tables decide together, and since most people at most tables wanted the bar owner, he became the bartender.

The entire thing was hilarious. The people who wanted to bartend were godawful, their ideas were ridiculous, and nobody expected the actual bar owner to become the bartender, despite him having the most control over the bar.","A bartender assistant, a bar owner, an alcoholic, and a prohibition supporter were in a bar.",15

Inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair . . . Kill her!!' The man said, 'You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.' The agent said, 'Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home.'

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes, 'I tried, but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said, 'You don't have what it takes. Take your wife home.'

Finally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. He took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the man, wiping the sweat from his brow.

Well, late one afternoon, the Air Force folks out at Area 51 were very surprised to see a Cessna landing at their ""secret"" base.  They immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room. The pilot's story was that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel.  The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation. By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn't a spy.  They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying ""you-did-not-see-a-base"" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way. The day after that though, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane...  Only this time there were two people in the plane. The same pilot jumped out and said, ""Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last night!""

One day he was called up by Kim Jong-Un and asked to compose a piece for the great North Korean orchestra play it live for him and the entire country. The man, not wanting to displease the leader, did what was asked of him.

The musician completed the piece, and then came the big night. However, the musicians sounded terrible. The piece sounded nothing like the composer wanted it to.

The great leader was disappointed, and had him sentenced to death. Upon arriving at his death sentence, he was asked what he would like his last meal to be. 

""Piping hot curry!"" he said.

He ate his curry, was tied to the chair, and the switch was flipped. However, the musician was unharmed.

The great leader was in awe. Having witnessed this himself, he decided to give the musician another chance at writing a piece of music.

The composer put all his work into writing this piece. But come the night of the concert, the piece sounded terrible yet again.

And yet again, he was sentenced to death. For his last meal, he had piping hot curry again. He ate his meal and the switch was thrown. However, the musician was unharmed.

The great leader, again in awe, decided to give him one last chance.

So the musician got to work, putting even more work into this piece than he did the last one. But come the night of the concert, it sounded nothing like the musician had written.

However, the great leader denied his request and flipped the switch himself. Sparks flew, smoke filled the room, but the musician sat in the chair unharmed.

Meanwhile, the boys in the cabin were sleeping in their beds. They heard a faint noise.

^^^^""I'm ^^^^gonna ^^^^get ^^^^ya, ^^^^and ^^^^when ^^^^I ^^^^get ^^^^ya, ^^^^I'm ^^^^gonna ^^^^eat ^^^^ya!""

The noise was so quiet, nobody even said a word, but soon they heard it again.

^^^""I'm ^^^gonna ^^^get ^^^ya, ^^^and ^^^when ^^^I ^^^get ^^^ya, ^^^I'm ^^^gonna ^^^eat ^^^ya!""

This time, it was a tad bit louder, and some of the boys shifted uncomfortably in their beds. They heard it once more.

^^""I'm ^^gonna ^^get ^^ya, ^^and ^^when ^^I ^^get ^^ya, ^^I'm ^^gonna ^^eat ^^ya!""

Now the boys were sure they heard something. One of them asked, ""What was that?"" but the other boys didn't know. They heard it again.

^""I'm ^gonna ^get ^ya, ^and ^when ^I ^get ^ya, ^I'm ^gonna ^eat ^ya!""

Now the boys were all up, and thoroughly freaked out. Their blood ran cold when they realized that Jimmy was still sleeping outside. The boys grabbed their flashlights, and walked towards Jimmy's tent.

From inside the tent, they could hear the voice even louder.

""I'm gonna get ya, and when I get ya, I'm gonna eat ya!""

The boys were on the verge of wetting themselves, and one of the braver boys opened the tent flap.

Inside, they saw Jimmy, sitting in the middle of his tent, violently picking his nose and yelling:

They knew they needed to lighten the sled so they drew straws and the one with the shortest straw blessed Russia and leapt off the back. He was jumped upon by the wolves and torn to pieces as he was devoured.

Soon, however, the pack, still hungry, took up their chase of the sleigh. They again got closer and closer. Straws were drawn again and the loser blessed Mother Russia and leapt from the back of the sled. The wolves devoured him and still came on, getting closer and closer.

The tallest of the remaining two on the sled said ""I guess we should draw straws again.""

""No, that won't be necessary,"" said the shorter man, and he pulled out an AK-47 from inside his parka and blasted all the wolves to smithereens.

""Why did you not do that before?"" asked the taller man.

The shorter man reached into his parka and pulled out a liter of Vodka and said, ""What? And share a bottle among four?""",Actual Russian Joke,134

Later in the evening,after being intoxicated,the sadistic warlord decides to play a game..

He asks all the men from the village to stand in a line and strip down their pants..

He then instructed one of the wives of the men to be blindfolded and she should recognize her husband after examining the penis of the men standing in the line..

If she points to a wrong man,then she and her husband will be executed.

The first woman nervously stepped out and she kept touching the penises until she found her husbands and declared it.... The warlord was disappointed that she succeeded.

Then the second woman came forward. She was so nervous that she kept touching each penis for a long time and kept thinking for a while before rejecting them. She too recognized her husband's penis.

Now the warlord got really angry. So he asks some of his soldiers to stand in the line posing as villagers to confuse them.

The third woman started. She hardly took more than few seconds for each penis while thinking out loud ""Not him"" ""Not him either""..

This continued until she touched a soldier's penis. She stopped for a while and thought really hard

""Not from our village"" she muttered and moved on

When you win big in Vegas the casino will give you free things, like meals, show tickets, or rooms; This is all designed to keep you there so that you will lose what you have won. After winning half a million dollars at roulette, the casino gives Bob a night in the penthouse suite.

Bob went up to the room, opened the big double doors, and stepped into a three room suite. The room is on a corner of the hotel and two walls are nothing but windows, with a fantastic view of the city. There's a bar in one corner, big screen TV and a silk covered king-size bed.

Bob drops his bag of money in a chair and stood looking out the windows at the city. He realized he was all alone and needed someone to share his good fortune. He called the front desk and told the clerk to send up the best, high-priced call girl in the city.

Thirty minutes later there was a knock on the door. Bob opened it to find the most gorgeous girl he has ever seen. Long blond hair, short red dress, and spiked heels. She walked into the room. Bob went to the bar and fixed two drinks; he gave one to the hooker, and drank one himself.

""Now, down to business,"" he began. ""How much for a hand job?""

The hooker said, ""Honey, a hand job is $5000.00""

""What?! That's unbelievable!"" he said.

""Come over here,"" she said walking towards one of the windows. ""See that strip mall over there?"" pointing out the window. ""I own the two stores on the end. I was able to buy those stores with the money I made from giving hand jobs. I must be pretty damn good.""

""All right, I'll try,"" our lonely friend replied. A half hour after she's done, Bob is sitting on the couch revelling in ecstasy. He gets up, goes to the bar and made two more drinks. He gives one to the hooker and drinks one himself.

""That was the best hand job I have ever had. How much for a blow job?""

She replied, ""Honey, a blow job is $25,000.""

""What?! That's outrageous!"" he exclaimed.

""Come over here,"" she said walking towards the window. ""See that hotel over there next to the mall?"" pointing out the window. ""I own that. I was able to buy it with the money I made from giving blow jobs. I must be pretty damn good.""

""Oh, all right, screw it. Money is no object,"" he said, giving her 25 grand. An hour after she's done, Bob is still laying on the bed, head lolling back, eyes rolled up inside his head, drool coming out of the corner of his mouth. Finally, he gets up, barely able to stand, staggers over to the bar, mixes two more drinks, gives one to the hooker, and drinks one himself.

""My god, that was the best blow job I have ever had. I've gotta know, how much for some pussy?""

The day was so nice that she became careless and a fox snuck up behind her and caught her.

""I am going to eat you for lunch,"" said the fox.

""Wait,"" replied the rabbit, ""You should at least wait a few days.""

""Oh yeah? Why should I wait?""

""Well, I am just finishing my thesis on 'The Superiority of Rabbits over Foxes and Wolves.'""

""Are you crazy? I should eat you right now! Everybody knows that a fox will always win over a rabbit.""

""Not really, not according to my research. If you like, you can come into my hole and read it for yourself. If you are not convinced, you can go ahead and have me for lunch.""

""You really are crazy!"" But since the fox was curious and had nothing to lose, it went with the rabbit. The fox never came out.


A few days later the rabbit was again taking a break from writing and sure enough, a wolf came out of the bushes and was ready to set upon her.

""Wait!"" yelled the rabbit, ""you can't eat me right now.""

""And why might that be, my furry appetizer?""

""I am almost finished writing my thesis on 'The Superiority of Rabbits over Foxes and Wolves.'""

The wolf laughed so hard that it almost lost its grip on the rabbit.

""Maybe I shouldn't eat you; you really are sick ... in the head. You might have something contagious.""

""Come and read it for yourself; you can eat me afterward if you disagree with my conclusions."" So the wolf went down into the rabbit's hole ... and never came out.


The rabbit finished her thesis and was out celebrating in the local lettuce patch. Another rabbit came along and asked, ""What's up? You seem very happy.""

""Yup, I just finished my thesis.""

""Congratulations. What's it about?""

""'The Superiority of Rabbits over Foxes and Wolves.'""

""Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.""

""Oh yes. Come and read it for yourself.""

So together they went down into the rabbit's hole. As they entered, the friend saw the typical graduate abode, albeit a rather messy one after writing a thesis. The computer with the controversial work was in one corner. 

And to the right there was a pile of fox bones, on the left a pile of wolf bones. 

And in the middle was a large, well-fed lion.


The moral of the story:   
The title of your thesis doesn't matter.   
The subject doesn't matter.    
The research doesn't matter.    

All that matters is who your advisor is.   ",The Superiority of Rabbits,525

First to recite his poem was the Yale graduate. He stepped to the microphone and said:

Trekked a lonely caravan.

Destination---Timbuktu.
