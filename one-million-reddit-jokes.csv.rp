A: In regards to my work, outside of being efficient, effective and thorough. My managers have always appreciated that I come to work every day with an all day smile.

However, they did tend to groan at my puns. I always took this with a grain of salt, as it rounds out the flavour profile when you're given wine with cheese.

I lived in a small town out of southern Virginia. I helped my dad with the farm while my mom and sisters made food and washed the clothes. At the end of the day I just wanted to be out in the world. When i turned 18 i finally was able to do that. I was accepted into a university and was off! I spent 4 years there and got a bachelors in architecture. After many months of job searching i found a nice job working with a construction company. I loved working for that company. Probably because I met my true love there. A young, spunky blond. I was 26 at the time and hadn't had a girl friend before. So this was a new experience. We married a few years later and were as happy as we could be. At age 35 we had twins. A boy and a girl. They were adorable, but i didnt get any fuckin sleep, god bless them. 20 years go by and they are both out of the house and my wife and I are comfortably retired in a nice condo off the coast of Maine. 

A few months ago, i had a sudden urge to make a trip back to my hometown in southern Virginia. I took a flight down and took a taxi to my old home. When i had gotten there, everything had changed. It wasn't a small town anymore, it was a roaring suburb! I was disappointed, but suddenly, I had the strongest thirst. I walked down to the local Lemonade shop and to my dismay there was a huge line. I needed something to drink so i rushed around the other corner to get a cold coffee. And that line was EVEN LONGER! I couldnt take it, i needed something to drink. OH, Punch! I loved punch! So i ran to the punch shop and thank god there was no punch line. ",My life story,5

Billy replied, ""I was walking to school and found a purple feather, which I told my friend Jacob, who told Mrs. Martha,who sent me down to the principal's office, who expelled me.""  the parents couldn't take it and kicked him out of the house. A week later Billy was dirt poor and decided to go to the police for help. When he arrived at the police station, the cop asked him what happened and Billy said, ""I was walking to school when I found a purple feather, then I told my friend Jacob , who told my teacher Martha, who sent me down to the principal, who expelled me, and then my parents kicked me out and I'm dirt poor."" the cop arrested Billy and put him in maximum security prison. Billy was enraged as he didn't understand why everyone is reacting so harshly to a purple feather. A wise old man saw his breakdown and asked him what happened. ""I was walking to school when I found a purple feather, which I told to my friend, who told my teacher, who sent me to the principal, who expelled me, then my parents evicted me, and the cops arrested me."" ""Do you want to know what the purple feather means?"" said the old man. ""yes!"" exclaimed Billy. ""South of this prison there is a cave, which will teleport you to a realm. You will then have to walk 10 miles, swim across the river, and climb the mountain. You will then find a hidden palace, cross the road and open the gate. There you will find your answer. "" Billy teamed up with his cell mates and escaped prison. Just like the old man said the cave was there. He walked the 10 miles but came prepared with lots of water. He then swam across the river. Billy also came prepared with climbing gear and went up the mountain. At last Billy saw the palace. Billy began crossing the road, forgot to look both ways,and got hit by a car and died.

Firstly, you need to turn the conversation towards hitchhiking, however you do it, it needs to happen so it appears naturally. Once you've changed the subject, you begin my telling everyone you picked up a hitchhiker the other week, and he was carrying a bag, then tell as follows...

So I was driving down the (road of your choice) the other week, and there was a hitchhiker on the side of the road, and I was in a good mood so I picked him up. He was carrying a massive bag that he could barely carry, so I helped him get it in the boot (trunk).

After driving for a little while in silence, I decided to break the ice by saying 'so, I'm just wondering what is in that huge bag of yours?' And the guy replied 'mind your own fucking business.'. I was shocked, so I didn't say anything else, and we carried on driving in silence.

After about another ten minutes, I couldn't handle how tense it was, so I said 'listen buddy, I didn't mean to offend you, I was just making conversation by asking what was in the bag.', and to my surprise, he answered 'I told you already, mind your own fucking business.'. At this point I'd had enough of his attitude, so I pulled over and told him to get out my car, begrudgingly he got out, and I drove off. After a while I realised I still had his bag in the boot (trunk)!  I've still got it, and I'm keeping it in the garage!!

Now if you've told the joke convincingly enough, all of the people you are with should jump at the chance to ask 'so what was in the bag?!?', to which you reply.... 'mind your own fucking business!'. This will work amazingly if told correctly and without anyone catching on.

Side note : I'm really sorry for the lack of tags and a warning of this being a long post, I'm writing this on my phone and I don't know how to do these things, please forgive me.",A joke to tell your friends.,4

One day Tyrone's mother came to school to see how he was doing. The
teacher told her honestly that her son was simply a disaster, getting
very low marks, and that she had never had such an unmotivated and
ignorant boy in her entire teaching career.
Tyrone's mom, shocked at the feedback, withdrew her son from school
and moved out of Detroit, relocating to Cleveland.

25 years later, the teacher was diagnosed with irreversible cardiac
disease. Her doctors all strongly advised her to have open heart
surgery, which only one surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic could perform.

Left with no other options, the teacher decided to have the operation,
which was remarkably successful.

When she opened her eyes after the surgery she saw the handsome young
doctor who headed her surgical team smiling down at her. She wanted to
thank him, but could not talk. Her face started to turn blue, she
raised her hand, trying to tell him something, but quickly died.

The doctor was shocked, wondering what went wrong so suddenly.
When the doctor turned around to leave the room, he saw Tyrone, now a
janitor at the Clinic, had unplugged the life-support equipment in
order to plug in his vacuum cleaner.

 Well the day has arrived and the journey begins. The days turn to weeks..the weeks become months, yet finally the merchant returns home, pleased with his ever increasing wealth.

 He calls all of his man servants to stand before him for inspection. The merchant tells the servants to stand in line and drop their pants. 

He looks at the first man's groin, gnarled and raw. Fresh wounds still seeping blood. He is infuriated. ""OFF WITH HIS HEAD!"" he screams, and the undertaker hauls off the servant for execution.

 The merchant moves on to the next man. Swollen, scabbed, and scarred. ""OFF WITH HIS HEAD!!!"" the merchant roars, and the undertaker again hauls off the servant for execution. 

As the merchant moves down the line he becomes more and more enraged with each new servant, always yielding the same results... mangled, maimed man parts.  

After sentencing dozens of men to death, dejected and hopeless, the merchant arrives to the last man in line. As he examines the man's tools, his demeanor suddenly becomes cheerful. 

The servant's genitals are pristine. Unblemished in any way. The merchant is over the moon and immediately begins praising his servant.

I'll tell you. First of all the number 2, by the way, I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy, but he's like, '10101000101,' on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers, and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me","Donald trump is asked ""What is 2+2?""",359

Since both of them were widowed, they decided to go fishing together the next day.

 The gentleman picked the lady up, and they headed to the river to his fishing boat and started out on their adventure.

 They were riding smoothly on the current when they came upon a fork in the river, and the gentleman asked the lady, 'Do you want to go up or down?'

 All of a sudden the lady stripped off her shirt and pants and made mad passionate love to the man right there in the boat!

 When they finished, the man couldn't believe what had just happened, but he had just experienced the best sex that he'd had in years.

 They fished for a while and continued on down the river, when soon they came upon another fork.

 He again asked the lady , 'Up or down ?'

 There she went again, stripped off her clothes, and made wild passionate love to him again.

 This really impressed the elderly gentleman, so he asked her to go fishing again the next day.

 She said yes and there they were the next day, riding in the boat when they came upon the fork in river, and the elderly gentleman asked, 'Up or down ?'

 The woman replied, 'Down.'

 A little puzzled and disappointed, the gentleman guided the boat down the river when he came upon another fork in the river and he asked the lady,' Up or down ?'

 She replied, 'Up.'

 This really confused the gentleman so he asked, 'What's the deal? Yesterday, every time I asked you if you wanted to go up or down you made mad passionate love to me, but now today, nothing!'

 She replied, 'Well, yesterday I wasn't wearing my hearing aid, and I thought the choices were ""fuck"" or ""drown"". ","At a Senior's luncheon, an elderly gentleman and an elderly lady",119

It also have a mystical power that will change the person's skin colour according to the colour of the water.

Then, God calls upon three chief from different tribes, and tell them and their fellow tribesmen to bath at the bathtub, but under one condition, that is they have to kept their eyes closed. They all agreed as they dare not defy God.

First tribe to reach the bathtub is the White Man tribe. They closed their eyes and they jump into the bath tub together. All of them are come out with white skin. Before they left they decide to make fun of the other two tribes. Hence, all of them pee into the bathtub, making the bathtub yellow.

The second tribe to reach is the Asian tribe. They repeated what the White Man tribe did. But they came out yellow instead. One of the tribesmen from Asian tribe opened his eye, noticing his skin colour changed, he screamed: ""Why the fuck am I yellow?"" The other tribesmen, opened their eye and see themselves came out yellow, cried as well. They were so angry that they decide to poop in the bathtub.

Because sound travels at 340ms, it took around 3 minutes to reach God's home. When God heard the Asian screaming and crying, he came down, and say ""Who allowed you all to open your eyes?"" Without further ado, God shrinked the Asian's eyes. Leaving them chinky and yellow.

The last tribe to reach is the Nigga tribe. They repeated what the White Man tribe and the Asian tribe. However, when they are bathing, one tribesmen from Nigga tribe touched something at the bottom of the pool. It was a cylinder shaped stuff. It is the Asian's poop.

Nigga tribe, unlike Asian tribe, obeyed God's order to not open their eyes when they are at the bathtub. Nigga tribesmen thought it was some kind of sex toy from God, hence they put the Asian's poop on their dick. 

The mystical water somehow merged the poop and the Nigga's dick together. When Nigga tribesmens leave the bathtub, they are black, and with big dick.

He worked as a farmhand in Louisiana back in the 1930's, and was quite the skilled worker. Every day he would show up on time and work his hardest. One fateful afternoon, while baling hay, a wire snapped. His right eye was mutilated beyond any possible repair, even by today's standards.

He was rushed to see a doctor, but nothing could be done. Being a simple farmhand, John had no money for a glass eye, and was afraid of being the butt of every joke were he to wear an eyepatch. He relayed these fears to his doctor, who had a solution.

""Fortunately for you,"" he says, ""I'm a woodworker in my spare time. I could whittle you a false eye so perfect, your mama couldn't tell the difference! And it won't cost you a dime!""

John was quite excited, but his excitement soon faded. The eye that was whittled for him was hardly even spherical. It was not painted, and had obvious splinters everywhere. Alas, he had no other option, and wore the wooden eye.

For a year, every person who crossed his path would shout ""There goes Ole Woodeye!"" Many a brawls were brawled over the nickname. Whenever Woodeye heard the name, his face grew red and his cheeks got hot. Nothing made him angrier.

One day, Woodeye's only true friend invited him to go dancing.

""Come on,"" he pleaded, ""I can't go alone. You don't even gotta dance. Just go with me.""

Woodeye held fast in his resistance, but was worn down eventually. They arrived at the small get-together late one night, and Woodeye sat in the corner as his friend danced with the prettiest girls there.

Woodeye noticed a girl hiding in the shadows, not dancing or having a good time. He thought it to be a shame, as she appeared rather pretty. He worked himself up, and walked over to ask for a dance. As he got closer, he realized why she was alone. She had an obvious cleft lip, and it put off Ole Woodeye at first. Eventually, though, he figured that she needed company as much as she did, and she was still quite the looker. He approached her and asked quaintly if she would like to dance.

""Oh, would I!"" she exclaimed.

The two builders start to speculate about the occupation of the suit.

Chris: 'I reckon he's an accountant. '

James: ‘No way - he's a stockbroker. '

Chris: ‘He's no stockbroker. A stockbroker wouldn't come in here. '

The argument repeats itself for some time until the volume of beer gets the better of Chris and he makes for the toilet. On entering the toilet, he sees that the suit is standing at a urinal. Curiosity and the several beers get the better of the builder.

Chris: ' 'Scuse me... no offence meant, but me and my mate were wondering what you do for a living.'

Suit: ‘No offence taken. I'm a logical scientist by profession. '

Chris: 'Yeah, so what's that then. '

Suit: 'I'll try to explain by example. Do you have a goldfish at home?'

Chris: 'Er... mmm... well yeah, I do as it happens. '

Suit: 'Well, it's logical to assume that you keep it in a bowl or in a pond. Which is it?'

Chris: 'It's in a pond'

Suit: 'Well then, it's logical to suppose that you have a large garden then?'

Chris: 'As it happens, yes I have got a big garden.'

Suit: 'Well then, it's logical to assume that in this town if you have a large garden then you have a large house?'

Chris: ‘As it happens I've got a five-bedroom house... built it myself.'

Suit: 'well, given that you've built a five-bedroom house it is logical to assume that you haven't built it just for yourself and that you're probably married.'

Chris: 'Yes, I am married. I live with my wife and three children.'

Suit: 'Well then, it's logical to assume that you are sexually active with your wife on a regular basis.'

Chris: 'Yep! Four nights a week. '

Suit: 'Well then, it is logical to suggest that you do not masturbate very often?'

Chris: ‘Me? Never!'

Suit: 'Well, there you are, that's logical science at work.'

Chris: 'How's that then?'

Suit: 'From finding out that you had a goldfish. I've told you about the size of the garden you have, the size of house, your family and your sex life. '

Chris: 'I, see. That's pretty impressive... thanks mate.'

Both leave the toilet and Chris returns to his mate.

James: 'I see the suit was in there. Did you ask him what he does?'

Chris: 'Yep! He's a logical scientist.'

Well, yesterday was my birthday and before leaving the house for work I came in the kitchen to get my coffee. My kids and wife were there, but they just said ''Good morning!''. At first I thought that they are making a ''secret surprise'' for me so I went to my parent's house to ask them about it, if the surprise would really happen they would show a sign. They didn't know about the party as well as they didn't say ''Happy Birthday!'' to me. After I arrived at work I went into my office and on the way there even my colleagues didn't say anything, besides my secretary. She was the only person in that day who wished me a happy birthday. I felt special... So after work we both drove to my house. She went in to the bathroom for a minute leaving me sitting on the couch.

Since a Jewish wife is entitled to sexual pleasure, they decide to consult their Rabbi. 

The Rabbi listens to their story, strokes his beard, and makes the following suggestion:
Hire a strapping young man. 

While the two of you are making love, have the young man wave a towel over you. 

That will help your wife fantasize and should bring on an orgasm.'
They go home and follow the Rabbi's advice. 

They hire a handsome young man and he waves a towel over them as they make love. 
It does not help and the wife is still unsatisfied. 
Perplexed, they go back to the Rabbi. 'Okay,' he says to the husband, 'Try it reversed.
 
Have the young man make love to your wife and you wave the towel over them'. 
Once again, they follow the Rabbi's advice. They go home and hire, the same strapping young man. 

The young man gets into bed with the wife and the husband waves the towel.
 
The young man gets to work with great enthusiasm and soon she has an enormous, room-shaking, ear-splitting screaming orgasm. 
The husband smiles, looks at the young man and says to him triumphantly, 'You see that, you schmuck?

He had a wife and a kid but his life felt meaningless. After months of making more money than most of us will make in a life time he decides it truly just is not fulfilling. He loads up his Beamer and starts to drive. After some time he finds himself in up state New York surrounded by nature. He continues his drive until he happens upon a monastery. Hoping maybe he could find some peace there he stops and gets out of his car. A nearby monk sees him and offers a tour of the monastery. They see monks praying and meditating, monks doing chores, there were even monks brewing beer. They walk through gardens and by the dormitory and finally through the temple itself, which is sprawling and filled with little rooms designed for different aspects of contemplation and the search for enlightenment. As they walk they pass one corridor in particular and the lawyer hears a sound. It's a strange sound, it becons him, he had never heard a sound like this. So, he asks the monk ""What is that noise?"" But the monk only replies ""I can not tell you, you are not a monk"" and they finish the tour. The lawyer decides to head back home and the entire ride he keeps thinking about that sound. Back in NYC he walks into his giant apartment with his lavish things and feels as empty as ever. So he calls his firm and quits, liquidates some assets and gives his wife enough money to live rent free for several years and a kiss and tells her he will return when he gets over this soul crushing problem. So back up to the monastery he drives. They shave his head and begin to incorporate him into the life of monk hood. He awakes every morning before dawn and starts his prayers, eats a small bland breakfast, helps silently with all of the chores and rites that monks have to do. Several weeks pass and one day he finds himself in the temple and he just so happened to pass that very same corridor again. The noise! The sound! How could he have forgotten? So, a little beside himself with joy, he walks down the corridor. At the end is an old wooden door with a nice brass handle. He turns the handle but it catches, locked. So he quickly walks back down the corridor and to the monk that originally showed him around. ""Brother, I want to know what that noise is coming from the corridor but the door is locked!"" He explains anxious to find the noises source. ""Ah, yes, I was wondering when you would remember about that; here is a key."" So the man who used to be a lawyer rushes back to the temple and down the corridor and puts that key in the lock, twists and opens the door. In front of him is another hallway! But the sound is that much louder and even more intriguing! So he walks down the hallway, and it turns and winds several times before he reaches a big metal door. He turns its handle but it won't budge. He tries they key to no avail. So he runs back down the winding hallway and through the corridor and back to the monk. ""There is another door!"" he cries. ""And another key."" responds the monk as he hands him a big silver key. So the new monk with new purpose runs back to the temple and up the corridor and through the turning hallway and slams the big silver key into the big metal door and what lies beyond the door confuses him. A room filled with the noise and pool. Four walls and a pool. As the sound emminates around him he notices that the far wall, the one opposite of the door, doesn't actually continue all the way down the depth of the pool. So, without hesitation he dives and and arcs under the wall. He comes up and climbs onto a ledge and sees a giant golden door. He giggles the handle to make sure it's locked before he dives back in and swims under the wall and climbs back up and runs through the metal door and through the twisting hallway and out of the corridor and back to the monk. Without a word the monk hands him a small golden key. So he turns and runs through the corridor, through the hallway, into the water, under the wall, up to the ledge.  And the sound is immense now, it's practically shaking his eardrums. What could it be!? He puts the small key into the hole and gently turns the knob. The door opens effortlessly. A light bathes the mans face and he sees it! He sees what's making that sound, the glorious sound that will surely allieveate his pains. ",¡WANRNING LONG! The Monk Joke.,1

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:
First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.
The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.
But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.
Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",I hate my job...,20

She then asked the students if the jar was full? 

They agreed that it was. 

So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. 

She shook the jar lightly. 

The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the rocks. 

She then asked the students again if the jar was full. 

They again agreed it was.

The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. 

Of course, the sand filled up everything else. 

Now, said the professor, I want you to recognize that this is your life. 

The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your health, your children - things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. 

The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your car. 

The sand is everything else. 

The small stuff. 

If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks. 

The same goes for your life. 

If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you.

Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.

 Play with your children. 

Take time to get medical check-ups. 

Take your partner out dancing. 

There will always be time to go to work, clean the house, give a dinner party and fix the disposal. 

Take care of the rocks first - the things that really matter. 

Set your priorities. 

The rest is just sand.

But then... 

A student then took the jar which the other students and the professor agreed was full, and proceeded to pour in a glass of beer. 

Of course the beer filled the remaining spaces within the jar making the jar truly full. 

The moral of this tale is that no matter how full your life is, there is always room for BEER.",A philosophy professor stood before her class and had some items in front of her...,162

Well there I was making out with a girl I used to have a crush on, and I reached down to stroke her legs and thighs, and for some reason they were really hairy.

post,54znyn,2qh72,jokes,false,1475110157,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/54znyn/the_story_of_strongman_dria/,self.jokes,,"In Iraq there was a man named Dria who lived in a small village. Dria was special, because he was as strong as 10 men combined. However, as a way to level the playing field, Dria wasn't very smart. He's like a little kid who doesn't realize his own power. One day Dria's grandmother becomes very ill, and there's nothing in the world Dria loves more than his gram-gram, so he vows to save his grandma no matter the cost. But because he doesn't realize how special he is, he can't think of any ways to earn enough money to save his grandmother. As he's walking around town trying to find money, a shady looking dude comes out of an alley way and waves Dria over.
""I've heard things about you. I have a group of friends that could use your help. Care to join? We'll pay you."" 
Dria jumps at the chance, but little does he realize he has just joined a local terrorist cell attempting to make a name for themselves. He heads to their hideout, and after a couple days Dria conducts his first raid. He performs amazing feats of strength, flipping cars and tearing doors off of their hinges. He manages to squeeze every dime out of the people of the village. A new recruit was mesmerized by what Dria did, and after the raid went and talked to him. 
""Wow! Your strength is amazing! But why are you helping us when you could be doing good for others?"" 
""My gram-gram is sick and the guys here said they'd pay me if I helped them."" 
""Oh ok. How much have they paid you?"" 
""Well, nothing so far, but I'll get it soon!"" 
The recruit was heartbroken by the story, but didn't want to ruin everything for the men he now calls his brothers, so he says nothing. More raids are conducted, and with each one the recruit's heart sinks a little more, until he just can't take it. 
""Dria, I have something to tell you. You've been conned. You aren't going to see even a little bit of the money."" 
Dria, absolutely furious that he'd been duped, leaves the hideout, and runs to the hills. Upon hearing the news, the leaders of the terrorist cell aren't worried. 
""We are rich! We don't need a strongman, we can conduct the raids ourselves!"" 
However, when the terrorists tried again, they failed miserably. They couldn't take any money from the villagers that they had previously robbed. The group eventually broke up because they no longer had the funds to attack people. And thus, all of the members of the terrorist cell learned a very valuable lesson that day: that the might of conned Dria was the powerhouse of the cell.",The story of Strongman Dria,265
