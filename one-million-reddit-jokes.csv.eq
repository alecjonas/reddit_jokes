If the person were to hear a croak, they’d have to determine if it were real or fake. If they thought a fake frog croak was real, they lost. If they found the real frog croak, they won.

Billy was playing with Joe and it was Billy’s turn to find the croaks. Billy first passed by his son’s school and heard a croak. Knowing it was fake, he moved on.

He then passed by the lake and heard a croak, but again, he knew it was fake and moved on.

After that, believe it or not, but a meteor fell from the sky, right in front of his house. Thankfully, nobody got hurt, so he went and investigated. He heard a croak from the crater, and this time he was sure it was real. He went into the crater, dig through the commet, and lo and behold, a frog was trapped in there.

Joe was amazed that he was able to distinguish between the fake croaks and the real one, so he asked Billy,

“How did you know that one was real?”

“Easy” Billy replies. “The real croak is always in the commets”",Two Friends Were Playing A Game,5

&amp;#x200B;

'But the bad news is that I will have to castrate you.'

&amp;#x200B;

After a moment's shock, the mas asks, 'Wha... Why would I need to be castrated??'

&amp;#x200B;

'Let me explain. It's as follows: your testicles are.. ehm... quite large, in relation with your penis, which puts some annoying pressure on your spine, which is what's causing your headaches. If your testicles were to be removed, however, then so would the pressure on your spine and therefore your headaches as well.'

I'll get you a size 40 dress shirt, and with it a size 42 vest and a size 42 tuxedo jacket as well.' Looking at the man a little more, he continues, 'Looking at your legs I'm guessing trousers with length size 34 and width 32.'

&amp;#x200B;

'That's incredible', says the man, 'That's all my sizes!'

&amp;#x200B;

'I've done this for over three years now, It's a walk in the park, sir. Now, I would suggest also buying some fresh underwear. Size 32 if I'm not mistaken.'

&amp;#x200B;

'Oh no!' says the man, 'I've always had size 30 underwear!'

&amp;#x200B;

'I would argue that size 30 is a bit too tight for you, sir. Size 32 is just perfect I reckon.

Just a quick fun fact, when I was in Second Grade, aged 8/9(F),My teacher would read us a few jokes the last few minutes of the day, and this was one of the Jokes she had read. For some reason, little Me thought it was the funniest joke ever and I told everyone I spoke to that day. I embodied the joke, attitude, neck movements and snapping my fingers when I said the Punch-line . Well at the time I lived in Asbury Park, NJ and there was a radio show called KTU 103.5 that my mom put on every morning and they had a contest every morning where two kids would call in, say their best jokes, and whoever won, won tickets to an N’Sync concert. When my mom heard the Joke, she made me say it the next morning on the radio. When I called in and told the Joke, the people on the radio were CRACKING UP and I WON !!! My mom and neighbor were jumping up and down screaming, and 8year old me didnt understand the situation yet so I was clueless to what exactly that meant but I was an N’Sync fan so when it did I couldn’t be more excited . Needless to say, now at 25 years old it’s one of my fondest memories!

the brim with £10 bills. He guesses there must be at least ten thousand dollars in it.
He approaches the bartender and asks, ""What's with the money in the jar?""

""Well..., you pay £10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar
and the keys to a brand new Lexus.""

The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks,
""What are the three tests?""

""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules.""

So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender £10
which he stuffs into the jar.

""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do:

First - You have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less,
and you can't make a face while doing it.""

""Second - There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth.
You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.""

""Third - There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex.
You have to take care of that problem.""

The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my £10 -- but I'm not an idiot! I won't do it!

""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is.""

""Where's the damn tequila?!""

Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole.
Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a
terrible fight -then, nothing but silence!

""Your Holiness"", said one of his Cardinals, ""Mr Netanyahu wants to challenge you to a game of golf to show the friendship and ecumenical spirit shared by the Jewish and Catholic faiths."" 

The Pope thought this was a good idea but he had never held a golf club in his hands. ""Don't we have a Cardinal to represent me?"" he asked. 

""None who plays very well,"" a Cardinal replied. ""But, there's a man named Jack Nicklaus, an American golfer who is a devout Catholic. We can offer to make him a Cardinal. Then ask him to play Mr. Netanyahu as your personal representative. In addition, to showing our spirit of cooperation, we'll also win the match."" 

Everyone agreed it was a good idea. The call was made and of course, Nicklaus was honored and agreed to play. 

The day after the match, Nicklaus reported to the Vatican to inform the Pope of the result. ""I have some good news and some bad news, your Holiness, "" said Nicklaus. 

""Tell me the good news first, Cardinal Nicklaus,"" said the Pope. 

""Well, your Holiness, I don't like to brag, but even though I've played some pretty terrific rounds of golf in my life, this was the best I have ever played, by far. I must have been inspired from above. My drives were long and true, my irons were accurate and purposeful, and my putting was perfect. With all due respect, my play was truly miraculous."" 

""There's bad news?"" asked the Pope. 

""Yes, I lost by three strokes to Rabbi Tiger Woods.""",The Pope plays golf,4

&amp;#x200B;

To conduct this study, he brought in a sample of forty men. ""Gentlemen,"" he said, ""those of you who know you have a tendency to get heated over a political debate, please step aside to the right. Otherwise, remain here."" 17 men stepped aside and he beckoned them into a room.

&amp;#x200B;

The room full of the unprovoked men was decorated in coloured leather chairs, with a television, some flower vases, a few clay pots, some coffee mugs, a stove with utensils, and a mini fridge stacked with beer bottles and cartons of eggs.

&amp;#x200B;

The room full of the men having a heated argument was decorated with the same items in the exact position, with the exception of the fridge having eggs, and the flower vase.

&amp;#x200B;

20 minutes in, the psychologist observes clay pot debris flying around in the room full of angry men as they throw the pots on the floor. Exactly 4 minutes later, he observes the coffee mugs being flung from one end of the room to another. On the other hand, the atmosphere in the other room with calm men was, needless to say, much better: a bit of discussion here and there, but no appreciable conflict, let alone any aggressive behaviour. The fragile objects remained in their places. Coffee was drank and tasty eggs were eaten voraciously.

&amp;#x200B;

3 minutes later, beer bottles are being broken in the room with angry men and the psychologist orders a recess. The calm men walk out, carrying on with their discussions and enjoying the newfound camaraderie. The angry men, however, have to be held back from each other as they are mostly still highly agitated and angry.

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime, the psychologist enters the angry men's room and places 3 flower vases, and 5 cartons of a dozen eggs in the mini fridge. He walks back out to the group of angry men, still fuming and hurling insults at each other. ""Gentlemen, please,"" he urges. ""You will soon be re-entering the room. I have refilled the mini fridge with refreshments. I hope you come to a resolve and settle your differences."" Both groups of men walk back into their respective rooms, and as expected, the angry men resume their fighting and hurling of the new flower vases and whatever might have remained of clay pots and coffee mugs.

&amp;#x200B;

6 minutes later, one of the subjects opens the mini fridge and brings out the eggs. Being a classic ""stage booing"" instrument, the eggs are hurled across the room in an attempt to stain each other and further this conflict. However, the eggs turn out to be fake and are designed as mini pinatas - some spill out confetti, others a chocolate bar, others a little joke, and some are fake rubber eggs that just bounce off the walls and men, causing the men to eventually erupt in laughter.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the experiment, all the men walk out of their rooms. The once angry men are now laughing and even get along with the calm men. One of the previously angry men walks over to the psychologist,

""Hey Doc,"" he says, ""that was pretty cool back there. Things got even more heated when we threw vases and mugs around, but once we got to those eggs with fake fillings, it really helped dissolve the tension! The eggs with confetti and chocolate 'yolks' were in the angry men's room!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Exactly,"" said the psychologist. ""The real yolks are always in the calm men's.""",The Egg Experiment,0

“I am the Lord thy God” the old man man says. “I have come down from Heaven because you have lived a good Catholic life, and I would like to reward you by giving you anything you wish.”

The Catholic, taken aback, gets down on his knees and clasps his hands. “Lord,” he says, “I wish for a bridge to be built between New York and Ireland, so I can visit my dear cousins and go to the pub whenever I please.”

The Lord thinks for a second and says “my dear child, your wish is very selfish and materialistic. It would take all the resources in the world and I urge you to think of something more thoughtful.”

The Catholic thinks long and hard for a few minutes, then says: “Lord, I would like to understand my wife. I would like to know what she thinks, why she acts the way she does and how to make her happy.”

My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend? She was a dream! There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. 

One day her little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me."" I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, ""We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family"".

Immediately annoyed, the giant turns to face him and pulls back his huge foot. Knowing what's coming, the Rabbi collapses in a ball of regret, closes his eyes and waits for the impact.

But it doesn't come. He opens his eyes and the giant is turning away. ""Giant,"" he calls, ""why have you spared me the kick?""

And the giant replies, ""Silly Rabbi. Kicks are for Trids.""","A rabbi, seeking knowledge, is wandering the world...",4

*Man:* I used a condom so that my semen won't go into my wife's ovaries. But my wife always pokes the condom packet with pins as she wants to own a football team.

  
*Man:* I've tried to take her birth control pill without saying what the pill is for. But she's always one step above me and pretend to take the pill and later throws it away.

  
**Doctor:** I will be honest with you, your problem is quite serious.  
*Man:* Please doctor, you need to save me. I am only 2 players away to make a team.

  
**Doctor:** (after having a long thought to himself) I have a solution for you. But you need to wait for it for about 10 minutes. Will you able to do that?  
*Man:* Of course, doc.

  
\*10 minutes later. The doctor handed  him a box and a letter.

  
**Doctor:** DO NOT OPEN the letter or the box here. Go home and before you make love with your wife, use this.  
*Man:* Thank you doctor.

  
\*Upon arrival home, the man saw her wife in an exotic costume. He understood the hint and quickly went to the washroom to freshen up. In the washroom, he remembered his doctor's advice. He opened the box up and found a costume in there. Without giving a second though, he wore it and put the letter in his drawer and went to make love with his wife. A month later, he came to his home finding his wife furious as she had her menstruation which means she's not pregnant. He thought to himself that why did this happen but unable to find any answer. Suddenly he remembered about his doctor's letter. He quickly went to his room, opened his drawer and tear up the envelope to read the letter.  


The letter was like this,  
""Your wife will always miss her chance to create a football team as long as you wear the costume because a Stormtrooper will always miss his shot.""

Most people don't know that in 1912, Hellmann's mayonnaise was manufactured in England. In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to have been the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico. But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was lost forever.

The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day.

The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course, as Sinko de Mayo.",Mexicans and mayonnaise,74

Technically, you could have something which is better than super great called perfect. Something can't be beyond perfect, that would be conceptually invalid. Well, just in case I'm wrong, I'll state it as the final possibility - beyond perfect.

Okay while we are on the topic technically we should also add a category for anything worse than completely terrible as well, in the rare case that such a thing could exist.

Yes, as a final point, something could choose to not be on this spectrum as well, but that is the end of it. Unless a thing chooses to deny the existence of this spectrum all together.

However what the trout fails to realize is behind a tree just on the shore, sits a bear. The bear says to himself ""Now, if that fly drops 6 inches, and that trout takes that fly, I'll have myself a nice trout lunch!"" However, the bear doesn't see that behind another tree just near him sits a hunter, having a sandwich. This hunter sits thinking ""Now, if that fly drops 6 inches, and that trout takes that fly, and that bear moves to take that trout I'll shoot that bear and have food for weeks!"" However unbeknownst to that hunter just a foot behind him sits a tiny mouse, and that mouse says to himself ""If that fly drops 6 inches, and that trout takes that fly, and that bear goes for that trout, and that hunter reaches for his gun, I'll have a sandwich and that'll feed me for a month!"" Unfortunately for that mouse, on a tree branch just above him sits a cat. And that cat says to herself ""If that fly drops 6 inches, and that trout takes that fly, and that bear goes for that trout, and that hunter goes for his gun, and that mouse goes for that sandwich, I'll have a nice afternoon snack!"" 
As luck would have it on that day on the lake in the woods, that fly drops 6 inches. So that trout takes the fly, and the bear plunges for the trout, and the hunter reaches for his gun, and the mouse goes for his sandwich. However! As the cat prepares to pounce the mouse sees her out of the corner of his eye and he darts away, causing that cat to miss and fall in the lake!

The Cat’s Diary

**Day 983 of My Captivity**

   My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets. Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength.

   The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet. Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates my capabilities. However, they merely made condescending comments about what a “good little hunter” I am. Bastards!

   There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of “allergies.” I must learn what this means, and how to use it to my advantage.

   Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow, but at the top of the stairs.

   I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches. The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released, and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously retarded. The bird must be an informant. I observe him communicate with the guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my every move. My captors have arranged protective custody for him in an elevated cell, so he is safe. For now ...",Diary of a cat....,9

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the ...bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.
The Agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike""",Crows aren’t so smart after all,317

The flight attendant nods and heads back to prepare the drink and the blonde says ""Thank you very much, but why did you call me Nan?""

The man says, ""Oh, I'm sorry.  I saw that on your shirt and thought it was your name."" 

She giggles and says, ""Oh!, No, that's not my name.  That's the convention I'm headed to."" 

The man says, ""Oh, my apologies, I just assumed.  If I may ask, what is the convention?"" 

The blond giggles again and says ""the National Association of Nymphomaniacs.""

The man almost spits out his drink ""Oh, wow, I had no idea that was a thing.  That's fascinating. What sorts of things do you do at these conventions."" 

The blonde smiles at him coyly and says ""Mostly we talk about what men are the best to have sex with.""

The man asks ""That's very interesting. Out of curiosity, what men *are* the best to have sex with?""

She responds, ""Well, last year, it was a tie - between Jewish men and Native American Men. By the way, my name is Paulette, and yours?""

The chief once again gathered his people. ""The winter outlook is for even colder conditions. We need to collect more wood."" And so the tribe did.

A month passes. The chief calls for yet another update. The weatherman says, ""Yeah, you know it's starting to look really cold now, probably in the top ten of the coldest winters."" And so the chief orders everyone to increase their efforts in gathering wood.

Another month goes by. The chief decides to make one last call to the Weather Service to get the latest forecast. The meteorologist on the phone says, ""It is now looking like the most bitter, coldest winter on record!""

My mom also gets really upset every time she sees them. I can’t tell if she’s crying because she’s upset that I permanently scarred my body, or if they’re tears of joy because she can die knowing that she, in fact, didn’t raise no bitch.

post,bk7sdb,2qh72,jokes,false,1556885744,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bk7sdb/dave_and_his_rolls_royce/,self.jokes,,"When Dave was a kid, he saw a parade with some fancy big-shots in fancy big-shot cars. One of the cars was a Rolls Royce, and Dave loved it. So from then on, every year on his birthday, Dave would ask for a Rolls Royce. His family wasn't rich, and Dave was only still a kid, so obviously he never got it. At a certain point in his youth, Dave realised what he was asking for and how funny the repetitive question must have become to his family, but out of tradition and to honour the now family-wide inside joke, he kept asking for the car every birthday.   


As the years flew by, and Dave got older, he started a family of his own, and there as well, would ask for the Rolls Royce every year, since his wife understood the joke and his family would still laugh at the story. When Dave got his career going, he realised that his dream car wasnt that much of a reach anymore, so he started saving. Every time however, he got close to having the money, something in his life would happen that set his saving plan back to zero. His kids needed college tuition, and a bit later a house. His own house would need some major maintenance, or some illness in his family would make that he kept setting the dream aside for bigger things in life. Eventually, Dave got to his retirement without ever having been able to buy the Rolls Royce of his childhood dreams.   


Then when he retired, his boss gave him a golden handshake, a big sum of money as thanks for his years of good service. It was so much money that Dave and his wife could sell their house and buy a nice little villa in rural France or Italy and live out their days in perfect harmony. His wife however, realising she had everything she ever wanted and was perfectly satisfied with what she and Dave had together, told Dave that this was perhaps a sign for him to buy his dream car. Dave, happy as a child with such a loving wife, immediately got out and bought his big fat juicy Rolls Royce.   


Within a week, he got a heart attack and died. Poor Dave. His wife, deeply saddened by her loss, decided that Dave should be buried with his Rolls Royce in the grave, since he spent his entire life dreaming about the car, and now, finally having it, died within a week. Thus proceeds, Dave is buried in his Rolls Royce, and his soul rests in peace. What his family didn't realise, is that Dave is hereby put in the queue for heaven inside his Rolls Royce! Dave drives up to heaven, and sees an enormous line of people waiting to get in. As their families never buried them inside their vehicles, they are all on foot, and Dave is able to drive by easily, he thinks. When he tries to, an angel descends upon him and tells him, 'this is heaven, and everybody patiently awaits their turn'. A bit disappointed, Dave joins the line and waits.   


After a few days of waiting, Dave grows tired of the constant slow pace of the queue, so he tries to find the vehicle queue to be able to pass the walking line. As he moves his big fat Rolls Royce past the first pedestrians, instantly an angel descends again and tells him, 'This is heaven Dave, you must wait for your turn to enter'. Again Dave, now a bit frustrated, joins the back of the line, but now tries to honk his horn and push through. A few people let him pass, but the angel isn't tricked and descends for a third time, telling Dave to wait patiently. Halfway through the angels warning, a loud revving engine starts to roar in the distance.   


As the angel tries to finish its sentence, a big Harley Davidson bike makes its way past the queue, with lots of loud noises and bangs of the engine. A man with a leather jacket, long hair and a big beard looks down on all the people he passes, occasionally nodding but mostly staring blankly at the masses. As he passes Dave and his Rolls Royce, he lazily waves his hand in recognition, and drives all the way up to the gate. As the man is entering Heaven, Dave, now furious, turns to the angel and starts yelling for answers. The angel immediately tells him 'I'm very sorry Dave, I can't help you get through faster'. Dave, still angry, asks 'But why does he get to pass?' and the angel responds 'well, he is the boss's son after all..'.",Dave and his Rolls Royce,2

It's his senior year and he feels that he should go to prom. So he musters up the courage and asks one of his friends. She says yes. Now he has to prepare for the dance.

The next day, he goes to buy his tickets, and there is a huge line. So he waits, and waits, and waits, then he finally gets the tickets.

The next day, he goes with his date to go get a dress. When they get to the store, there is a huge line going out the door. So the wait, they wait, and they wait. Finally, they get to the front and buy a dress.

After this, they go to men's warehouse to get him a suit for the dance, and there is a huge line going out the door. So they wait, wait, and wait. Finally, they get in and buy a nice suit.

The next day, he remembers that he needs to order a corsage. So he goes to the local store and there is a huge line. So he waits, waits, and waits until he gets his order in.

Now it's the day before prom and he wakes up and realizes that he forgot to order a limo, so he calls up the limo rental place. All the lines are busy so he decides to go into the place. When he gets there, he sees the line stretching out the door and around the corner. So he waits, and waits, and waits, until finally, he was lucky enough to get the very last limo.

So now it's the night of the dance and when they get to the prom, the school is doing mandatory drug testing, so there is a huge line getting into the prom. So the wait, wait, and wait. Finally, they get to the front and they both pass their drug tests.

Now the dance was going pretty good for about a half an hour, until he really, really had to go to the bathroom. So he takes off to go, and he sees this huge line going out of the bathroom. He waits, waits, and waits until he finally takes care of his business.

When he comes out of the bathroom, he notices that a crowd has formed around his date. She had just randomly passed out. Someone says to him, ""hey, you're her date, go get her some punch.""

Principal: “What is 3 x 3?”

Jimmy: “9.”

Principal: “6 x 6?”

Jimmy: “36.”

And so it went on like this, the principal asked him every question a fourth grader should know. Finally, after about an hour, he told the teacher “I see no reason why Jimmy can’t go to the fourth grade, he answered all of my questions right.”

The teacher asked if she could ask him some questions. The principal and Jimmy agree.

Teacher: “What does a cow have 4 of that I only have 2 of?”

Jimmy: “Legs”

Teacher: “What do you have in your pants that I don’t have?”

The principal gasps but before he can stop him from answerin gJimmy says, “Pockets.”

&amp;#x200B;

Chan and Leu were famous poets in the village of Laolam.

One day there were Bards battle Chan and Leu participated, Chan and Leu were opponents.

&amp;#x200B;

Chan sang :

&amp;#x200B;

*""I went to the store,* 

*bought a lemon Juicy*

*so I fucked your mother's pussy""*

&amp;#x200B;

Now the rules of the poetry competition were ""NO ABUSE"", hence Leu protested, ""this is an abuse"". They went to the mod. Mod said, since it rhymes it is allowed.

&amp;#x200B;

Leu was furious so they went back and it was Leu's turn. 

&amp;#x200B;

Leu sang:

&amp;#x200B;

*""I went to the fruitstand*

*bought a melon juicy*

*so I ate your mother's ass.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Chan jumped out and protested ""this is abusive."" Both went to the Mod again. Mod asked them to repeat. So  Chan recited again. 

&amp;#x200B;

*""&lt;blah blah&gt;.. juicy* 

*&lt;blah blah&gt;... ass""* 

&amp;#x200B;

Mod stopped him and concluded, ""this is abusive"" and proceeds to disqualify him. Leu, interrupted, and explains that at least let him finish his poem. They agreed. So Leu sings:

&amp;#x200B;

*""I went to the fruitstand*

*bought a melon juicy*

*so I ate your mother's ass.*

*and fucked the Mod's mother's pussy""*",Poetry Competition,1

When he told his parents this they decided it would be a great chance to teach him responsibility and give him a chance to earn his own spending money. So they bought him a small colony of bees and the tools he would need to take care of them and harvest the honey. As the years went on the boy grew his small colony of bees into a large colony and was so good with the bees at this point he no longer needed to wear most of his protective gear. Many times you could see the young man with his bees and it seemed like they were playing together, he would even put pollen on his hands to see how many bees he could hold at once. As the years went on the boy grew into a man eventually fell in love with the woman of his dreams. Although he was madly in love with his wife he always made time for his first love, the bees, and would still see how many bees he could hold at a time as it reminded him of his childhood. After a few years of marriage, the two had their own beautiful baby. As the child grew the father wanted to teach them about the bees that he loved so much and all of the amazing things that they have brought him. As the child grew older they resented the bees feeling as if the bees were taking some of their father away and they became extremely jealous. So one day when the child’s dad was out playing with the bees the child threw a stone at the bees and riled them up. The bees began swarming and trying to protect the colony, the child managed to get away with just a few stings but the father who loved the bees so dearly was not so lucky. After the bees finally calmed down the father was transported to the E.R. and although they managed to save his life he lost all vision. The man was furious with the child and took his anger out on both his wife and kid. He could no longer do what he loves and it ate away at him each and every day. As time went on the wife could no longer put up with her angry and depressed husband, so she left, taking their child with her. After years of suffering alone, he finally realised that the true beauty of life is in the eyes of the bee holder.",Let me know what you think of my 2nd attempt!,5

There's only one group that he can't figure out. It's made up of a cheerleader, a goth girl, and a thot.

He finds a group he gets along with pretty well and asks one of his new classmates about them.

The friend says, ""Yea, I heard that if you bring in a riddle that the cheerleader can't solve, she'll sleep with you. And if you bring in a jar filled with beans or something like that, and give it to the goth, if she gets the count of whatever is in there wrong she'll sleep with you. If you bring in a paragraph and the thot can't pronounce one of the words in it, she'll sleep with you.

The teen is eager to test this, and goes home to find a riddle.

He comes back the next day and finds the cheerleader. He gives her the riddle. ""I have no wings, yet I fly. I have no eyes, yet I cry. What am I?"" 

After thinking for a while, the cheerleader guesses, ""Is it a water balloon?""

The teen tells her, ""No it, was a cloud."" The cheerleader then invites him over that night where they have the best sex of the teen's young sex life.

The next day, eager to do it again, brings in a jar filled with pennies. He finds the goth and tries to give her the jar.

The goth looks at him confused for a second, before explaining, ""No, you must have heard wrong, I'm the one who does passage readings.""

The teen takes back his jar, embarrassed. As he walks away, the Goth girl calls out to him:

""Just remember, when giving us stuff, it's the thot that counts.""",A teen moves to a new school,18

One day, Larry walked past a TV store. On the screen of the fattest flat-screen TV, a national news-broadcast was running a story about an object from outer space on a collision course with Earth. 

People started to gather around the television, as broadcast from around the object emerged on the screen. It seemed to be an object made primarily of ice, moving at a very fast pace. Naturally, people got a bit scared of the thought of the object causing damage as it hit Earth.

As a little bit of time went by, the small group of people started to get more and more anxious about the impending collision, as pictures of the object descending into the atmosphere appeared on the screen. Larry, however, stepped away from the group after assessing the situation and took a deep sigh of relief.

After a few minutes of waiting, the object reached such a high temperature due to the speed it was moving at, that it harmlessly melted. It happened so quickly, and the group felt relieved that it hadn't even burned or showed signs of smoke on the way down. 

Larry had calmly been standing next to the group, while they were panicking, and when a man asked him why he wasn't freaking out, he chuckled to himself and answered: ""The real smoke is always in the comets""",Saw a good one earlier and got inspired to do something similar,3

The old guy says “well, we’d love to have you son, but you need a skill to be in the circus, you need to be able to perform something special, unusual or scary”.
     
Wee Jimmy says, “just let me in the ring Mr, I will show ya special”
     
The night of the circus, Wee Jimmy is the last act. He comes in dragging a huge anvil into the spotlight, then he brings out a large heavy looking sledgehammer. He asks the audience for a volunteer. A large german bodybuilder named Hans puts his hands up and says “ya”.
   
“I am going to put my on head here” says wee Jimmy pointing at the anvil and I want you to hit me with this sledgehammer as hard as you can.  The big german looks confused and a little nervous but he agrees. There is a drumroll and the crowd goes silent.
     
What happens next is a scene of extreme bloody violence. The audience screams, people faint, there is blood and brains and skull everywhere. Its pandemonium. The Ringmaster runs into the the ring. “Oh my god, call an ambulance”.
    
Remarkably, wee Jimmy somehow survives. After extensive trauma and reconstructive based surgery involving many side by side operations, his condition is moved to stable after just sixteen months. The Ringmaster, still stricken with guilt makes his daily visit to the hospital.
     
“Oh my poor lad, I shouldn’t have let you go in that ring, you were too young, what was I thinking”
   
Wee Jimmy starts to twitch. His fingers start to move. The ringmaster hears him groan. He shouts for all the doctors and nurses. “Quick, come through, he is about to speak”.
    
They all crowd round the bed as Wee Jimmy starts to move his lips, everyone is silent and focused, amazed that the wee fella is finally conscious and just then he opens his mouth to speak..
