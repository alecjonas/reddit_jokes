What we’ve decided to do is to let each of you choose two points on your body. 

You will be given two pounds sterling for each inch of distance between those parts.

General: “Very good son, that’s 70 inches which comes to 140 pounds”

Soldier 2: “The tip of the finger on one outstretched hand to the tip of the other, sir!”

General: “Even better son, that’s 72 inches which comes to 144 pounds”

Soldier 3: “The palm of me hand to the tip of me left pinky, sahr!”

General: “That’s a strange but fair request, son!

As more scientists came to the mountain, they brought with them foreign animals, such as Thegre the Tiger, Thor the Boar, and Seagull the Eagle. Other wildlife flourished, but the fish could not survive, so the locals started calling the mountain ""Ichthyologist Ending"" or ""Ich End"" to remember the fish that used to be there.

One day, Martha Dupp sees on the internet a popular trend called ""Tea Climbs"", where people climb mountains and drink tea. She decides to climb up Ich End for a tea party at the top with the animals. Bill Dupp thinks it's a great idea and wholeheartedly agrees. The two soon begin to pack for a trip.

As they climb, they are introduced to various animals they have never seen before. Amazed at the wildlife, they set up their picnic and start drinking tea when a huge tiger comes up. Bill and Martha Dupp begin panicking and run away, but the tiger catches up to Bill Dupp. It starts mauling him and takes a bite.

Exhausted of hope, he walks the narrow sidewalk down the side of the roaring highway toward the Zhivopisny bridge, the tallest in Moscow. Cars honk as they fly by. They hope to startle him, but he doesn't flinch. He trudges on, up the summit of the bridge ... and soon he is completely alone. The noise of the traffic has faded into the roar of the Moskva river below. He feels colder and lonelier than ever. He grabs the railing and shakily positions himself on the narrow concrete ledge.

""WAIT!"" A woman's voice cuts through the frosty air. He turns around and is startled to see the street lamp illuminating a young girl, an angelic girl, with pale skin and silky, golden hair twirling around her face like a halo. For an instant his soul is warm again. ""Were you going to jump?"" She asks, softly, with no judgement in her voice. He nods, balefully, filled with shame, but also with the joy of finally having found another soul to confess his loneliness.

The girl hands him a burlap sack filled with kittens. ""Be a dear and take these with you.""",A man in Moscow decides to take his own life.,25

So they enter heaven, and sure enough, there are ducks all over the place.  It is almost impossible not to step on a duck, and although they try their best to avoid them, the first woman accidentally steps on one.  

Along comes St. Peter with the ugliest man she ever saw. St. Peter chains them together and says, 'Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly man!'   
 
The next day, the second woman steps accidentally on a duck and along comes St. Peter, who doesn't miss a thing. With him is another extremely ugly man. He chains them together with the same admonishment as for the first woman.

The third woman has observed all this and,  not wanting to be chained for all eternity to an ugly man, is very, VERY careful where she steps.

She manages to go months without stepping on any ducks, but one day St. Peter comes up to her with the most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on ..... very tall, long eyelashes, muscular.   
 
St. Peter chains them together without saying a word.

The happy woman says, 'I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all of eternity?' 

The guy says, 'I don't know about you, but I stepped on a duck.",Three women die together in an accident and go to heaven,2356

""See, let's make a bet. This drink has special powers. I bet that when I drink it I can jump out of the window, fall down, stop right above the ground, fly back up and sit down again right next to you.""

Guy 2 says okay and prepares his phone to film a cool suicide video.

Guy 1 drinks his vodka, runs towards the window and jumps out. And just like he said he falls down, stops above the ground, flys back up and sits back onto his chair.

Guy 2 is totally puzzled and can't believe his eyes: ""What.... how....Oh my god can I do that too?""

Guy 1 orders another Vodka fly: ""Here, drink it and jump out. You'll be perfectly fine.""

Guy 2 drinks the vodka, runs towards the window, jumps out and after a few seconds of free fall he smashes into the ground and dies.

Guy 1 starts laughing like a maniac: ""Omg that was awesome, hahaha. What an idiot. Jimmy, get me another beer.""

Jimmy the barkeeper get's him his beer and says: ""You know, when you're drunk you are a real asshole Superman.""

Then, for my 21st birthday, I asked for a pencil case. Not a tractor themed pencil case, just a pencil case. So there I was, walking down the street, pencil case in hand, when I saw a burning building. I ran up to it, and the firemen were trying their best to put out the fire, but they couldn't.

 So I ran inside, and just inhaled. All of the smoke went into my lungs, and then I came out of the building. The fireman asked 'How did you do that??'

The couple had married as childhood sweethearts and had moved back to their old neighborhood after they retired. Holding hands, they walked back to their old school. It was not locked, so they entered, and found the old desk they’d shared, where Jerry had carved I love you, Sally.

 On their way back home, a bag of money fell out of an armored car, practically landing at their feet. Sally quickly picked it up and, not sure what to do with it, they took it home. There, she counted the money – fifty thousand dollars!

 Jerry said, We’ve got to give it back.

 Sally said, Finders keepers. She put the money back in the bag and hid it in their attic.

 The next day, two police officers were canvassing the neighborhood looking for the money, and knocked on their door. Pardon me, did either of you find a bag that fell out of an armored car yesterday?

 Sally said, No.
 Jerry said, She¹s lying. She hid it up in the attic.

 Sally said, Don’t believe him, he¹s getting senile

 The agents turned to Jerry and began to question him.

Two young businessmen in Florida were sitting down for a break in their soon-to-be new store in the shopping mall. As yet, the store's merchandise wasn't in -- only a few shelves and display racks set up.

One said to the other, ""I'll bet that any minute now some senior is going to walk by, put his face to the window, and ask what we're selling.""

 

Sure enough, just a moment later, a curious senior gentleman walked up to the window, looked around intensely and rapped on the glass, then in a loud voice asked, ""What are you selling here?""

 

One of the men replied sarcastically, ""We're selling ass-holes.""

His wife left him, took the kids and due to all the stress and pressure in his personal life, his work performance took a dive and he was fired. Without a job, he lost his home, his possessions and whatever was left of his dignity and hope. He decided to end his miserable life. 

Suicide was the only thing he had left.

That evening he began walking through town toward the highest bridge to jump from when he came upon a little pet shop. He looked through the big glass window and saw a litter of cute little puppies. For the first time in what seemed like forever, he felt a spark of happiness shine inside is poor soul.

The man walked inside and the shop keeper greeted him. ""What can I do for you today?"" ""Well,"" the man said, ""I'm severely depressed and I want to end my life. I was about to commit suicide when I saw those puppies in the window and I thought maybe having something to take care of would give me purpose in my life."" The shop keeper agreed, ""We have many adorable puppies to choose from, what breed would you like?"" The man thought about his options for a moment and said ""Well, now I'm not so sure. I no longer have income, or a home, so perhaps a dog is too much of a responsibility right now. What else do you have?""

""Hmm."" thought the shop keeper. ""How about a cat? You don't have to walk them, and you can also keep a cat outdoors. How about that?"" ""That is true, but a cat still needs food and water, and to be shown some level of affection. I don't think I can do all of that, I'm still suicidal after all! What if I still kill myself! The poor cat, left all alone.""

""This is hopeless"" the man said. ""Never mind, I think I'm going to the bridge now. I'm pretty sure I want to just die."" and the man began walking out the door.

""Wait!"" shouted the shop keeper, ""How about this? A little turtle. Hardly any care needed."" The man, already teetering on live vs. death, can't make up his mind about this either. ""I don't know. What do I really want, even? To live? To die? I don't know.""

""Okay, I have the perfect pet. A single bee. You don't have to do anything. It takes care of itself.""

The man took notice of this idea and thought about it for a minute.

""Interesting."" he said. ""A single bee. I think I can handle that.""

The shop keeper agreed and thought it was perfect and he began ringing up the sale of a single bee.

""Buuuut..."" the man interjected, ""What if the bee gets lonely? Everyone needs someone. Just like I need my wife, and my kids...oh lord. My family. My god. I've lost them all. A single bee? How pathetic! I really have nothing left to live for. Maybe I really do want to die!""

""Wait! How about this! Get TWO bees! It's perfect!"" the shop keeper exclaimed.

The man, with a great decision on his mind, began weighing his options out loud; ""Two bees? Is that what I want? Or just one bee? Do I really want to live? Or do I want to die? What should I do?""

The shop keeper, totally fed up with this guy and just wanting the sale yells; 

""JESUS CHRIST MAN, TWO BEE OR NOT TWO BEE, THAT'S THE QUESTION!""

Sub-joke:
I made this up at the bar last night and my wife hated it and now thinks less of me.

I have nothing but sympathy for him and suggest that the three of us should go down to the town hall and simply request a legal name change. We all head down to the town hall and arrive at the front desk where a secretary is sitting, we go up and ask for a name change form and she happily gives it to us. As he's filling out the form Ving breaks down in tears, he says his father would disapprove of Ving changing his name to Lee because Ving is a name that has been in their family for generations. Ling and I want to show nothing but support for Ving so we go back to the front desk with the half filled out form and we try to give it back. The secretary immediately declines the form and states that there is a fee to cancel a name change form. Neither Ving or I have money on us to cover the cancellation cost so Ling reaches into her purse and pulls out the required amount. Just as she's about the hand the money over to the secretary Ling and Ving's father bursts through the door and yells: ""DON'T, STOP! Be Lee Ving! Hold on to that fee Ling!""",Ling and Ving...,13

The doctors said he would never live, but somehow, he did. He had  a rough childhood, but he learned to get around, rolling where he needed to, putting up with the teasing and looks. He just tried to fit in as best he could.

By the time he's in high school, everyone knows him, and just calls him ""Head"". He still has a little trouble fitting in, but everyone likes him. He goes to the school Halloween party as a soccer ball, everyone loves it.

So one day, he's rolling his way to class, and sees  a poster for prom coming up. There's a girl in his next class, Jessica, who he would desperately love to ask out for prom, but without a body, he can't dance. He's torn up about it for a week, and finally decides to just do it, and ask her.

""Oh, hey Jessica!""

""Hey, Head!""

""So, I was wondering if uh, you'd like to go to prom with me next week""

""Oh, uh...""

(Head doesn't know that Jessica was already going to prom with some other guy, but Jessica is too nice to say no, so she comes up with a better answer;)

""Sure, Head, I'll go to prom with you on *one* condition; You have to turn yourself into a 10lb tomato.""

Head is just crushed. If he only knew how to make himself into a 10lb tomato, he'd go to prom with the girl of his dreams. He spends all week thinking about what to do, and then he remembers his soccer ball costume. Two days before prom, he paints himself bright red and dyes his hair green.

The next day of school, everyone is looking at the disembodied head painted like a tomato a little weirder than usual. Jessica comes up to him and asks ""Oh my God! Head! What did you do??""

""Well, Jessica, I turned myself into a 10lb tomato just like you asked! So, we're still on for prom, right?""

Jessica realized how serious he is, and still doesn't want to say no.

""Oh Head, I meant a *real* tomato, silly!""

Head is even more crushed than before. Prom is the next night, and he needs to become a *real* tomato somehow. So that night, he eats all the tomatoes in the house, and goes to sleep with the tomato plants in his mom's garden. He prays until he falls asleep, ""Oh god, oh god oh god, won't you make me a *real* tomato?""

The next morning he wakes up, and lo and behold, he's a real tomato! He skips school that day, too excited, and gets himself all ready for prom that night. A few hours before the dance, he rolls himself over to Jessica's house, and tried to knock on the door. Jessica comes out, and looks at the massive tomato kinda funny.

""Hey Jessica! I turned myself into a real tomato just like you asked! We're still on for prom, right?""

Jessica's date pulls up at that very second, and she realizes there's no good way out of it. So she looks at Head, and she looks at her date, and all around her to see if anyone else is watching.

And then she squishes Head, scraps him into the bushes, and goes to have a very nice Prom with her date.

^^^^^.

The moral of the story: *Quit while you're a head*",So there's a guy born without a body...,528

During WW2, three generals were arguing over who had the bravest soldiers.

The British general called one of his men over.
“Private! See that nazi tank in the minefield there? Go destroy it.”
“Yes, Sir!” The soldier replied and started running.
He ran across the unmarked minefield until within range of the tank with his anti-tank weapon, took aim and fired, destroying the tank all the while under heavy fire from the enemy trenches.
“See, British soldiers are the bravest.”

“That’s nothing” said the Russian General
“Comrade! See that enemy soldier manning that machine gun there? Run across the mines into the trenches and kill him with a knife.”
“Da, Comrade General!”
The russian soldier bravely charges across the minefield under heavy fire, jumped into the trenches fought his way through many enemy soldier then being shot many times from the machine gun nest before reaching that soldier and slicing his throat after a bloody brawl.
“Nobody more brave than Russian soldier.”

The American general, unimpressed, said “Let me show you all what real courage is.”
He calls one of his men over.
“Private! See that enemy command post over there? I want you to run naked across the minefields, fight your way through the trenches, go to the command post and kill the commanding officer bare handed!”
Without hesitation, the American soldier flips him the bird and says:
“Go fuck yourself, General.”

He called his wife for assistance, and after hours of trying they became worried and decided to go to the hospital.

As they were ready to go out the door, their daughter came home with her date. After being informed of the problem, their daughter’s date said he could get the peanut out.

The young man told the father to sit down, then proceeded to shove two fingers up the father’s nose and told him to blowhard. When the father blew, the peanut flew out.

The mother and daughter jumped and yelled for joy. The young man insisted that it was nothing and the daughter brought the young man out to the kitchen for something to eat.

Once he was gone the mother turned to the father and said, “That’s so wonderful! Isn’t he smart? What do you think he’s going to be when he grows older?”

Three more times he gets a pair of glasses prescribed and they're doing nothing, so he hopelessly ventures into the forest outside his city and finds a witch doctor.

He told the witch doctor of his situation and the scrawny individual bobbed his head in understanding, then held up a finger and went into another room. When he came back, he took two packets and squirted ketchup into the man's face. 

To his surprise, he wiped the ketchup away from his eyes and hollered, ""I can see!""

The witch doctor bobbed his head in another nod and said, ""Heinzsight is 20/20.""",A man with vision problems...,13

post,6gotp7,2qh72,jokes,false,1497226323,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6gotp7/the_girlfriend_joke/,self.jokes,,"So I recently moved into a new neighborhood and it's a pretty nice area. After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself. 

Being the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?"" 

And keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel. 

So I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, ""Uh... No thanks, I'm good."" 

""Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.""

So a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, ""Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.""

So I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, ""OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.""

So I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.

A couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?"" Luckily, she says, ""Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't miss it.""

So I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled ""Video Games."" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, ""Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?"" and she responds with, ""No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it."" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.

So I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.

So a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me."" 

I tell her, ""Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great."" She says, ""Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow

So next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again."" 

""Wait, what? Why not? What happened?""

""Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.""

""I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person""

""She told me, and I quote, that she is going to fucking murder me.""

""I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.""

I go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.

So day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.

Then I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, ""She's dead, you're next."" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.

Now I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE. 

And it raises the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?",The Girlfriend joke.,15

Since his remaining hearing was sufficient, he remained in the Army. Many years later he eventually rose to the rank of Major General. 

He was, however, very sensitive about his appearance. One day the General was interviewing three servicemen who were candidates for his headquarters staff.     

The first was a Squadron Leader pilot from Air Force , and it was a great interview. At the end of the interview the General asked him, 'Do you notice anything different about me?'    The young officer answered, 'Why, yes, Sir, I couldn't help but notice that you have no ears.'  The general was displeased with his lack of tact and threw him out.    

The second interview was with a Naval Lieutenant Commander, and he was even better. The General then asked him the same question, 'Do you notice anything different about me?' He replied sheepishly, 'Well, sir, you have no ears.' The General threw him out also.    

The third interview was with an Infantryman and a commando qualified Major.

The General liked this guy, and went ahead with the same question, 'Do you notice anything different about me?' To his surprise the Major said, 'Yes, sir, you wear contact lenses.'    

The General was very impressed and thought, 'What an incredibly observant officer, and he didn't mention my ears.'

He asked, 'Major, how do you know I wear contacts?' 'Well, sir,' the officer replied, 'It's pretty hard to wear glasses with no f******g ears.'",A young Army officer was severely wounded in the head by a grenade,3

The temperature is a perfect 72 degrees. He says to himself, ""THIS is the perfect day"". He pauses for a moment and considers calling in sick to his church, skipping his worship services, and driving several towns over to play a round of golf on this perfect day. After considering it for a moment he decides to do it. He calls in sick, skips his worship services, abandons his congregation, and drives off to the nearby golf course several towns over. 

Meanwhile in heaven St Peter is looking down in sadness and disgust. He turns to God who is focused on other matters elsewhere in the world. ""My father, look at this. A man of your holy word has decided to abandon his congregation on a Sunday. He has chosen to lie to them and play golf instead of fulfilling his duties. What can be done?""

God turns to St Peter, looks down at the minister is is getting ready to tee off, then simply points at the minister. Puzzled, St Peter turns his attention back to earth and the minister. 

The minister approaches the first hole. It's a long par 3. He places the ball on the tee, takes a deep breath, takes a few practices swings, and swings and drives the ball down the fairway. The ball soars farther than any he has ever hit and it goes right in the hole! The minister is ecstatic. He has never hit a hole-in-one before. And it happened on the perfect day. He is overcome with joy. 

Back in heaven St Peter is stunned. He turns to God and asks, ""I thought you were going to do something? Instead this man just got a hole-in-one!"" God sighs and says, ""I did do something. Who is he going to tell?""",A minister awakens to a beautiful Sunday morning,113

The family members sat silent as they absorbed the news. After a great length of time, someone asked, 'Well, how much does a brain cost?' 

The Doctor quickly responded, '$25,000 for a male brain, and $3,000 for a female brain.' 

The moment turned awkward. Men in the room tried not to smile, avoiding eye contact with the women, but some actually smirked. A man, unable to control his curiosity, blurted out the question everyone wanted to ask, 'Why is the male brain so much more?' 

The doctor smiled at the childish innocence and said to the entire group, 'It's just standard pricing procedure. We have to mark down the price of the female brains, because they've actually been used.'

Next they surveyed the lush championship golf course behind their home, where they were entitled to play everyday.

post,6gka9y,2qh72,jokes,false,1497167485,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6gka9y/high_noon/,self.jokes,,"An old west dime novel writer is out looking for a good story when he wanders into a saloon. He sees a group of rough rider lookin' scoundrels playing poker and he musters up enough courage to sit down with 'em (thinkin' he might get a story out if he was lucky). ""Mind if I play?""

The others look up with a scowl that would curdle milk, but one looks at the clock and shakes his head. He points out the time to the others and they gather up their chips and go. ""Play alone, we're a-leavin'. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""

The writer is confused, but smells a story brewing; a strong one at that. He hoofs it up to the bar, passing most other patrons on their way out, and slaps a whole dollar bill on the table, ""Barkeep, give me a beer and a story, and you can keep the change.""

After taking a quick glance at the clock, the bartender shakes his head, pours the beer, and pushes the bill back to the reporter. ""The drink is on the house, but I suggest you drink it quick and leave. Wild Bill is coming to town."" Without another word the 'tender puts his last glass away and walks right out the swinging doors, leaving the reporter in an empty bar.

Now fear in his gut tears at him as he hears the emptiness in that bar. This emptiness seems to seep in as he realizes that he's about to be the last man in this town, alone with only the sound of that ticking clock to keep him company. Still, a story of this caliber must be worth something; so he waits...

Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, Bong&lt;CRACK!&gt;- Just as the clock strikes the first chime of twelve, a sound like thunder splitting a mountain is heard outside. The reporter runs to the doors to see what it is. In the distance and closing fast is a tornado coming right for the bar. The reporter hits the ground and watches as the tornado comes up to the bar and stops.

The wind settles and there is a giant of a man riding a grizzly bear. He steps off the bear, and instead of hitching it, he punches the great beast right in the face &lt;WHAM!&gt;, knocking it cold on the ground.

The reporter is so scared he runs back into the bar and dives behind the counter, sure that this is the last of his days. &lt;KaPLOW!&gt; the giant kicks in the saloon doors, and they turn to splinters that imbed themselves into the walls and break bottles and glasses that they touch.

The man walks up to the bar, breaking every floor board with each thundering step. He looks down at the reporter and slams his fist on the bar, cracking it down the middle, ""GIMME A DRINK!""

The reporter comes up, shakily holding out two bottles of whisky; which the giant snatches up, chews the glass tops off of, and drinks down as fast as the amber liquid can spill from the bottles. He throws both bottles in the air, whips out his six-shooter and fires off a round. The single bullet rips through both bottles showering the reporter with shards that rain down.

Regretting his curiosity and repenting of his life, the reporter stands on weakened legs and whimpers out, ""W-w-w-would y-you like a-another drink?""

The man turns to him, fire in his eyes, then glances at the clock... ""Nah, I gotta go. Wild Bill's comin' to town.""

He speaks with the madame at the front desk and he says, ""It's been years since I've had sex, and I've never been to a place like this before. What can I get for twenty bucks?"" 

""Hmmm..."" says the mistress, ""twenty won't get you much in most places, but I suppose I can let you have the surprise room, just this once."" 

""What's the surprise room?"" asked the man.

She smiled back at him, ""Well mister, I can tell you can I? It wouldn't be a surprise. It's something a little different each time."" 

He agreed and she showed him to a room down the hall. He walked in to a room with mirrors everywhere. Mirrors on the walls, the floor,  the ceiling, even on the back of the door. In the center of the room was a large cushioned box, covered in red velvet.

He walked over and opened the box, only to find a chicken. At this point, he was still quite horny, and it had been a while... So he figures 'What the Hell"" and makes love to the chicken.

On the way out he thanks the mistress who asks him, ""How was it?"" He says, ""It wasn't bad, but definitely different. I'll be back next week with more money.""

A week later the man returns with $40 and once again asks, ""What can I get for forty bucks?"" 

She smiles at him, ""Well, do you like to watch?""

""Oh hell yes. I love to watch!"" He blurts out. 

""Great, you can have the voyeur room."" she beams, and off she leads him down another hall to a door.

The British general called one of his men over.

“Private! See that nazi tank in the minefield there? Go destroy it.”

“Yes, Sir!” The soldier replied and started running.

He ran across the unmarked minefield until within range of the tank with his anti-tank weapon, took aim and fired, destroying the tank all the while under heavy fire from the enemy trenches.

“See, British soldiers are the bravest.”

“That’s nothing” said the Russian General

“Comrade! See that enemy soldier manning that machine gun there? Run across the mines into the trenches and kill him with a knife.”

“Da, Comrade General!”

The russian soldier bravely charges across the minefield under heavy fire, jumped into the trenches fought his way through many enemy soldier then being shot many times from the machine gun nest before reaching that soldier and slicing his throat after a bloody brawl.

“Nobody more brave than Russian soldier.”


The American general, unimpressed said “Let me show you all what real courage is.”

He calls one of his men over.

“Private! See that enemy command post over there? I want you to run naked across the minefields, fight your way through the trenches, go to the command post and kill the commanding officer bare handed!”

Without hesitation, the American soldier flips him the bird and says

“Go fuck yourself, General.”

“See! Now that takes some real balls!”

I went downstairs for breakfast in the hopes that my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy Birthday!"" and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday"".

I thought.. Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids.. they will remember.

My kids came bouncing down the stairs and didn't say one word. So when i left for the office I was feeling quite low and somewhat despondent.

As I walked in to my office, my secretary Jane said, ""Good morning Boss, and by the way, Happy Birthday!""

I felt a little better that at least somebody remembered. I worked until one o'clock when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know Boss, It's such a beautiful day outside and it's your birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.""

I said, ""Thanks Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day, let's go!"" 

We went to lunch but not where we usually go. She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table.

We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously. 

On the way back to the office Jane asked, ""You know Boss, it's such a beautiful day today, we don't have to go straight back to the office do we?""

I responded, ""I guess not, what do you have in mind?""

She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""

Aftet arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said,

""Boss, if you don't mind I'm going to step into my bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""

""Okay"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.

Followed by my wife, my kids and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy Birthday!""

And I just sat there..

On the couch..

Sobbing..

Naked.. 

and erect.",Happy Birthday!,28

After trying numerous ideas to increase profits, Vadim, the older brother, came up with a plan.

""Why don't we just put a blow up doll in the bed under the covers?""

Igor, his younger brother, replied ""That's crazy"".

""No, no, trust me. These customers are always piss drunk anyway. They won't even notice. We have nothing to lose.""

They bought the blowup doll and set it up in a dark room upstairs. They sent the first customer up. 20 minutes later the customer came down, paid his tab and left.

The brothers were surprised it worked. A few more customers came and went and paid their tab without a word. 

The brothers were celebrating and drinking having solved their financial woes when a customer came down frantic.

""Oh my god, oh my god"" the customer cried.

""What happened sir?""

""I don't know, everything was going great. But when I bit her tits she farted and jumped out the window""
