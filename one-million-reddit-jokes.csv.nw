So he was talking to everyone who showed up, trying to find out who was deserved to enter the pearly gates. 

The first man came up. He says:

&gt;Well, I got off work early today, so I thought I'd go home and surprise my wife. When I got to my apartment, the door was locked. That was kind of odd, but whatever. I went in and my wife was sitting in the bedroom, face flushed, hair a mess, breathing heavily, and wearing lingerie. So I start looking for the guy. I searched every nook and cranny in that house and didn't see him anywhere. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone's fingers as they dangled from my 5th floor balcony. Naturally, I started stomping on his hands and trying to pry his fingers loose, but the fucker wouldn't fall. So I did the next best thing I could think of and grabbed the refrigerator and threw it on him. But I fell down too, so here I am. 

St Peter takes pity on the poor guy and lets him in. 

Then, the next guy walks up. St Peter gives him the spiel about having to explain how he died and this guy says:

&gt;Well, I was having a great day. I woke up early, ate healthy, started really committing to my diet. I was determined that today was the first day of the rest of my life. And it was so beautiful out today that I decided to work out on the balcony of my 6th floor apartment. But as I was exercising, I fell down. I just managed to grab onto the balcony beneath me and nothing but my fingertips were holding me up. I was scared and praying that I would somehow get out if this! Then, I thought my prayers were answered! A man walked out and before I could even ask for help, he started stomping on my fingers! I was fighting with everything in me to just hold on, and after a minute, he walked away. I was just starting to ask god for help again when this asshole threw a refrigerator on me! So here I am. 

St Peter kind of chuckled, but felt horrible for this poor guy, so he let him in. 

The third guy walks up and gets the spiel about heaven being full. 

He looks right at St Peter and says:

&gt;So there I was, butt naked in the refrigerator... ",St Peter was standing at the gates of heaven.,0

Suddenly a phone rings, it's the American and he takes the call by putting his watch up to his face. When he's done, he proudly shows off his latest purchase, believing it to be the best in technology.

Then, another phone rings, this time the Japanese man. He pushes the palm of his hand and puts his thumb to his ear and small finger to his mouth and has a full conversation. When finished, he shows the other two gentlemen his technology implants he's received for making calls. 

Suddenly the Irish man's phone rings, however he's embarrassed as it is a fairly simple device. He suddenly jumps up and races to the toilet, much to the amusement of the other two guests.  
When he returns from the toilet, he has a long line of toilet paper dragging behind him from his arse. 

His two counterparts, a little bemused by what they are seeing, ask the Irish man if he's ok. 
The Irishman replied - 'Ah yeah, I'm grand. Just had to receive a fax'. ","An American, Japanese and Irish businessmen are having a business lunch....",9

The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse. 

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken. 

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow. 

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""","A horse is sitting at home, watching MTV...",256

""No.""

""No.""

""Did you have sex?""

""No.""

The tall Texan saw on Putin's desk 3 different color telephones, a red one a blue one and a white one.  The Texan questions Putin about each phone. Putin replies the red phone is to call America in a crisis the blue phone is to call Russian Congress in a crisis in the white phone is to call God in heaven. The Texan is amazed and asks Putin if he can call God. Putin's  answer is, of course it will cost you 25 million ruples."" The Texan asks why it is so expensive. It's because you're calling god in heaven. So the Texan pays and makes his phone call to g- d. 

The next day the Texas billionaire is in the White House with President Trump after a tour of Washington DC. In the Oval Office he sees three phones, a red phone, a blue phone and a white phone. The Texan then asked the president what are these phones for. The president answers, the red one calls Putin in Russia in the event of a crisis, The blue phone calls congress, in the event of a crisis  and the white phone calls God in heaven. The Texan asks ""can I call g-d? President Trump ""says yes for 25 million dollars."" The Texan complains that it is very expensive as he also paid 25 million rubles for the same call in Russia. The president answers him, ""Well you are calling God in heaven."" So the Texan pays the price makes the phone call.

 The next day the Texas billionaire is in Israel with Benjamin Netanyahu.  After touring the Sinai, Mossad and Yad Vashem, they go to the prime minister's office where upon the Texan sees 3 phones a red phone, a blue phone and then a white phone.

The Texan asked to call G-d on the white phone.  Netanyahu  says ""'sure  go right ahead.""  The Texan asks how much it cost and the answer is... ""it's free."" The Texan says in Russia it cost 25 million ruples and in America it cost $25 million. So the Texan asks why here in Israel is it free?

They wake up hours late, their car neatly parked on the side of the road. Strangely, they were outside of the tunnel. The men decide to continue home and discuss it the following morning.

The next morning their drive goes without interruption. However, on the way home they travel under the tunnel and all black out again. Late at night they wake up outside the tunnel, their heads pounding but strangely their wrists hurting severely.

They decide enough is enough, they’ll go to a doctor to figure out this strange occurrence. The next morning, they all call in sick and visit the doctor. While in the office they each get a series of tests, they are analyzed by psychiatrists who ask them questions about the strange occurrence during their carpools. The blacking out once they start to travel through the tunnel and the waking up on the side of the road. The strange chronic arm pain. Finally, after hours of testing the results are in.

Wife Wendy drove him into the spare bedroom with her nocturnal noises. 'he wakes up all the time' she explained.

John Bradford, a Dublin University student, was on the side of the road hitchhiking on a very dark night and in the midst of a big storm. 

The night was rolling on and no car went by. 

The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him. 

Suddenly, he saw a car slowly coming towards him and stopped. 

John, desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, got into the car and closed the door... only to realise there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn't on. 

The car started moving slowly. 

John looked at the road ahead and saw a curve approaching. 
Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. Then, just before the car hit the curve, a hand appeared out of no where through the window and turned the wheel. John, paralysed with terror, watched as the hand came through the window, but never touched or harmed him. 

Shortly thereafter John saw the lights of a pub appear down the road, so, gathering strength; he jumped out of the car and ran to it. 

Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and started telling everybody about the horrible experience he had just had. 

A silence enveloped the pub when everybody realised he was crying and....wasn't drunk. 

Suddenly, the door opened, and two other people walked in from the dark and stormy night. 

They, like John, were also soaked and out of breath. Looking around, and seeing John Bradford sobbing at the bar, one said to the other.... ..........

Life with you is unbearable. I called you at work just to see if you wanted to have lunch ( you know, maybe try to reconnect) and your boss told me that you had quit your job today and that was the last straw. 

Last week you came home and didn't even notice that I had a new haircut, cooked your favorite meal and even wore a brand-new pair of silk boxers to bed. 

You came home and ate in two minutes and went straight to sleep after watching TV. You don't tell me you love me anymore; you don't want to be intimate or anything. Either you're cheating on me or you don't love me anymore. 

Whatever the case, I'm gone. 
Your Ex-husband 

P. S.: Don't try to find me. Your sister and I are moving to West Virginia, if that's a problem, TOUGH! 

DEAR EX-Husband: 

Nothing has made my day better than receiving your letter. 

It's true that you and I have been married for seven years, although a good man is a far cry from what you've been. I watch TV so much to try to drown out your constant whining and griping. Too bad it doesn't work. 

I did notice when you got a haircut last week; the first that came to mind was ""You look just like a girl!"" but my mother raised me not to say anything if you can't say anything nice. 

And when you cooked my favorite meal you obviously got me confused with MY SISTER, because I stopped eating pork seven years ago. 

I turned away from you when you had those new silk boxers on because the price tag was still on them. I hoped it was a coincidence that my sister had borrowed $50 from me that morning and your silk shorts cost $49. 99. 

After all of this, I still loved you and felt that we could work it out, so when I discovered that I had hit the lotto for $10, 000, 000, I quit my job and bought us two tickets to Switzerland, but when I got home you were gone. 

Everything happens for a reason, I guess. I hope you have the fulfilling life you always wanted. My lawyer said, with your letter that you wrote, you won't get a dime from me. So, enjoy your new life! 

P. S.: I don't know if I ever told you this, but Carla, my sister, was born CARL. I hope that's not a problem.",DEAR WIFE I'm writing this letter to you to tell you that I'm leaving you.,3

He wandered over to take a closer look, then smiled to himself, nodded, and entered the shop.

He walked up to the counter and said to the man serving there, ""Is that record in the window really a copy of Wasp Noises of the World?""

""It most certainly is,"" said the shopkeeper.

""Excellent,"" said the man from the street. ""I have searched for that record for a great many years. You see, I am the world's leading expert on wasps. I have written books on their habits, diets, stripe patterns and social structures, but what truly fascinates me is the noises they make. That record in the window is famous in the world of wasp study as the most accurate documentation of wasp noises in the world, and I haven't managed to acquire a copy until now.""

""Well, this is your lucky day,"" the shopkeeper said. ""I'll have it out of the window and bagged up for you right away.""

""Hold on now,"" said the world expert on wasps. ""It's a very old record, it may have distorted or been damaged, in which case it would be no use to me. I see you have a gramophone back there. Would you mind playing me a sample so I can be sure it's in good working order?""

The shopkeeper, grumbling to himself about how picky this customer was, set up the gramophone, retrieved Wasp Noises of the World from the window display, and placed the needle on the record, which began to play.

ZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzZZZzzzZzZZZzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZ

The world expert on wasps lifted the needle off the record with a confused look on his face. ""Now, this is most unusual,"" he said. ""I am the world's foremost expert on wasps, and yet this wasp noise is entirely unfamiliar to me. Can you play me another, in case this part of the record is damaged?""

The shopkeeper moved the needle on a bit, and placed it back on the record.

ZzZzZzZzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzZ

The world expert on wasps lifted thee needle again, looking extremely perplexed. ""Something very strange is going on here,"" he muttered. ""I am the world expert on wasps. No-one alive knows more about wasps than I do. And yet, once again, I do not recognize this wasp noise at all. Can you play me one more, to be certain?""

Again, thee shopkeeper mover the needle on, and again, the record played.

zzzZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZzZzZzzZZzzZZZZzz

The world expert on wasps snatched the needle off the record, with a look of borderline panic on his face. ""Something is definitely wrong with this record!"" he exclaimed. ""I am the greatest expert on wasps alive, nay, that has ever lived. No part of the life of the wasp is unknown to me. And yet, three times, this copy of Wasp Noises of the World has produced a wasp noise entirely alien to me. It cannot be that there are species of wasp whose noises have been recorded that I am not aware of. I would have been informed, consulted by the discoverers. Surely this record must be damaged. Would you inspect it for any signs?""

The shopkeeper, feeling distinctly put out by now, lifted up the record and examined it closely, at which point a knowing smile spread across his face.

""What is it?"" asked the world expert on wasps. ""Is the record damaged?""

""No,"" said the shopkeeper. ""Nothing like that.""

""Then what can possibly be going on?"" asked the world expert on wasps. ""I am acquainted with the noises of every species of wasp on the planet, and yet I don't recognize any of the ones you have played to me.""

The brunette arrives at the man’s ranch, inspects the bull, and decides she does want to buy it. The man tells her that he can sell it for $599, no less.

The barman looks at him and says,
""Hang on! You're a duck.""
""I see your eyes are working,"" replies the duck.
""And you can talk!""
Exclaims the barman.
""I see your ears are working, too,"" 
Says the duck.
""Now if you don't mind, can I have my beer and my sandwich please?""
""Certainly, sorry about that,"" says the barman as he pulls the duck's pint.
""It's just we don't get many ducks in this pub.. What are you doing round this way?""
""I'm working on the building site across the road,"" Explains the duck.
""I'm a plasterer.""
The flabbergasted barman cannot believe the duck and wants to learn more, but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it.
So, the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his sandwich, bids the barman good day and leaves.
The same thing happens for two weeks.

Then one day the circus comes to town.
The ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the barman says to him
""You're with the circus, aren't you? Well, I know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. He talks, drinks beer, eats sandwiches, reads the newspaper and everything!""
""Sounds marvellous, “says the ringmaster, handing over his business card.
""Get him to give me a call.""

So the next day when the duck comes into the pub the barman says,
""Hey Mr. Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money.""
""I'm always looking for the next job,""
Says the duck.
""Where is it?""
""At the circus,""

""With all the animals who live in cages, and performers who live in caravans?"" says the duck.

However, little did the school know, a student who had been bullied planned to exact his revenge on his tormenters.  He planted a bomb that would go off after the party had started. It was fool proof. He planned to detonate it remotely. He would never be caught.

Soon, the party had started, Jimmy began greeting the guests. Once about  half the crowd was in, the bomber pressed down on the detonate and ran away as fast as he could.

""Aloha! Snackbar?"" Moments later the school blew up.

""Father,"" he said, ""I am here about the open position, it had always been my dream job to ring the bell in this church"".

The priest figures he will let the man audition, so they walk to the top of the steeple where the large bell resides. Te priest tells the man to go ahead and ring the bell, not sure how he will be able to pull the cord without any arms.

The man takes a few steps back, then runs and jumps face first at the bell. The bell lets out an amazing ring. Unfortunately, the man, disoriented, tumbled down the staircase, breaking his neck and dying instantly.

The police arrive to investigate the man's death. The priest asks one of the policemen ""Do you know this man?"" The police officer responds ""No, Father, but his face rings a bell."" ",Bell Ringer Wanted,20

He says, ""For my first wish, I wish to have 100 billion dollars in my bank account. With that much wealth, I can live my entire life in luxury.""

""Done, the money is in your bank account now"" the genie replies, ""However, your ex-wife is now 200 billion dollars richer.""

Frustrated, the man thinks for a while then says, ""I wish to be the best golfer in the world. I love golfing, but I've never been all that great and this will provide me with joy for years.""

The genie responds, ""I can only partially grant that wish. You are technically the second best golfer in the world, since your ex-wife is now twice as good as you are.""

The man is very upset with how he has used his first two wishes at this point. Having these things is great, but knowing that someone he hates as much as his ex-wife is benefiting even more than he is ruins the joy of it all. He takes a good long time to think of his last wish, and finally comes up with a perfect one.

With a huge grin on his face he turns to the genie and says, ""With my third and final wish, I wish for you to beat me half to death.""",Man find's a genie,25

""What is the difference?"" asks the father. ''Sure, I'll go.''

The next day, the boy comes home from school ""Dad, have you gone by the school?"" He asks.

""Not yet.""

""Well when you do, come and see the gym teacher also.""

""Why?"" asks the father.

The boy explains, ""Well, we had a gym class today, and he asked me to raise my left arm, I did. Then my right arm, I also raised it. Then he asked me to lift my right leg, so I did. 'Now,' he says, 'lift your left leg,' so I asked 'What, am I suppose to stand on my dick!?'""

""Exactly,"" says the father. ""Alright, I'll come.""

""No, not yet.""

He searched high and low for the identity of the masked dolphin. He traveled the world, asking dolphin Gurus and dolphin historians. He searched for ten years before he found his first clue.

In a shallow pool at the top of a tall mountain he found a dolphin deep in meditation. 

""Wisest of dolphins! I seek your dolphin wisdom! Where is the masked dolphin that murdered my family?""

""What you seek is in the asking well. Go to the asking well, ask your question, and you will find your answer. You only get the one question so make sure it's good."" the mysterious dolphin responded, mysteriously.

He left on a new quest, looking for the asking well. He found many wells that were, well, wrong. There was a well of knowledge that was wrong. There was a well of power that was wrong. The fountain of youth wasn't even a well so he was pissed off when he found that too.

Finally, another decade later, he found the Well of Asking. 

Inside the Well of Asking he found not a dolphin but a porpoise. He was quite a dolphin expert at this point so he instantly recognized that it wasn't a dolphin.

""Porpoise of the well, where is the dolphin that killed my family?""

""If and only if you defeat me in armed combat will I reveal the answer to the question you ask.""

So they dueled with swords. The porpoise's footwork was exceptional but the man had been wandering the world for two decades and there wasn't much to do when you're walking for two decades but practice your vengeancing. 

He skewered the porpoise after a long and bloody fight and it fell back into the Well. He asked it again:

""Where is the dolphin that killed my family?""

The porpoise, with its dying breath, responded. 

""You're asking the wrong question. It wasn't a dolphin that killed your family. Maybe if you had phrased your question better you would have gotten a better answer you idiot.""

The porpoise expired without answering the second question the man thought up much later. It would have been a much better question to ask. He never found his vengeance but did later remarry, gaining several stepchildren that called him by his first name.

post,6eqifv,2qh72,jokes,false,1496357863,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6eqifv/three_men_arrive_in_heaven/,self.jokes,,"Three men arrive in heaven at the same time and St. Peter comes out to greet them.

""Sorry about this guys"" St Peter says, ""God didn't realise how many people would get into heaven, so we have a new policy. You now have to tell me the story of how you died, and if i think it's sad or interesting enough, I'll let you in.""

He walks up to the first man who is a nerdy, bookish sort with a bad business suit and says, ""Tell me your story""

""Okay"" says the man, ""I thought I had a wonderful life. I had a beautiful wife and we had a lovely place on the 34th floor of an apartment building. I came home from work early today, and I saw my beautiful wife sleeping in bed naked with another man's clothes on the floor. So of course I started looking for the bastard who slept with my wife.""

""Like I said, I lived in an apartment. There weren't that many places to hide, but I couldn't find him anywhere. Just when I was about to go confront my wife, I see him. The bastard was hiding outside the window, holding onto the window sill. I go up to him and I started stomping on his hands over and over again but he wouldn't let go. I finally kicked him in the face and he fell. Unfortunately he landed on a bush and he bounced to safety. In my anger, I grabbed my refrigerator and I threw it out after him. However, the cord from the refrigerator wrapped around my leg and pulled me to my death."" 

St Peter nods and says , ""You're story is acceptable, welcome to heaven"" He goes to the second man, a brawny working man type, and says, ""Whats your story?""

""I'm a window washer."" Says the man, ""I've been a window washer for over 20 years. Well today, I'm washing the 35th floor of an apartment complex when my scaffolding breaks. I thought I was going to die, but I manage to catch myself on the windowsill of the story below. Then all of a sudden this maniac comes out and starts mashing my fingers. I try my best to hold on, but he kicks me in the face and I fall. Once again, I thought I was going to die, but I land on this hedge and bounce away no worse for the wear. I look up and BOOM. Dead. Last thing I saw was a refrigerator."" 

St Peter holds back a chuckle then lets him into heaven. He goes to the third man, a ridiculously handsome fellow with sandy blonds hair, and asks, ""What's your story?""

""Alright."" Says the man, ""Picture this, You just finished banging some dudes wife. He comes home. You hide in the refrigerator.""",Three men arrive in heaven..,26

Judge: ""You are accused of beating your wife to death. If you want to expect 
any mercy, you'll have to give us a damn good reason.""

Man: ""She was so stupid, I just had to kill her.""

Judge: ""That is even worse. If you don't want to be declared guilty on the spot, you better give us a plausible reason.""

Man: Well it happened like this. We live in this apartment complex and the 
property manager lives in the first floor with his family. The kids all have a 
growth deficiency.

So one day, my wife comes up and says: Those little kids, they look like pyrenees.

So I say: You mean pygmy.

""No"", says my wife. Pygmy is what you have under your skin, it causes freckles.

""That's pigment"", I say.

So she says ""No, pigment is what the ancient Romans were writing on.""

I sigh and say: ""No, that's parchment!"".

""No"", says she, ""parchment is an unfinished sentence"".

""Your honor, you can imagine, I swallowed the 'fragment', I got back to my armchair 
and my newspaper. But then suddenly she's back with a book, and she says:

""Honey, check out this weird sentence, it says: 'The sun roof of the purse was 
the teacher of pimp fifteen"".

I take the book and say, ""but honey, this is in French. It says 'La Marquise 
de Pompadour est la Maitresse de Lois XV.' It means 'The marquise of Pompadour 
was the lover of Louis the 15th'""

""No!"", says my wife, ""you have to translate it literally:""

La Marquise - the sunroof. Pompadour - the purse. La Maitresse - the teacher,
Louis XV - pimp 15. I should know, I got a legionnaire for my french lessons.

I say: ""You mean a lector"".

""No"", says my wife, ""Lector was an ancient Greek hero.""

I say: ""That was Hector, and he was a Trojan.""

""Nope"", says she, ""Hector is a measure of area.""

""That'd be hectare""

Lawyer: ""I have lost my sense of taste.""

Chinese: ""Nurse, bring medicine from box No. 22 and put 3 drops in patient's mouth.""

Lawyer: ""Ugh. this is kerosene.""

Chinese: ""Congrats, your sense of taste is restored. Give me $20.""

Lawyer: ""I have lost my memory. I cannot remember anything.""

Chinese: ""Nurse, bring medicine from box no. 22 and put 3 drops in his mouth.""

Lawyer (annoyed): ""This is kerosene. You gave this to me last time for restoring my taste.""

Chinese: ""Congrats. You got your memory back. Give me $20.""

The fuming lawyer pays him, and then comes back a week later determined to get back $100.

Lawyer: ""My eyesight has become very weak I can't see at all.""

Chinese: ""Well, I don't have any medicine for that, so take this $100.""

He then instructed one of the wives of the men to be blindfolded and she should recognize her husband after examining the penis of the men standing in the line..

If she points to a wrong man,then she and her husband will be executed.

The huntsman is taken aback, but eventually decides the latter. He spends a few weeks in the hospital, but swears revenge.

When he's healed, he goes back into the forest and sure enough, he sees the black bear. He takes aim, and kills him. Whilst celebrating, he gets another tap on the shoulder.

The digruntled huntsman reluctantly decides on the latter yet again, and spends some months in the hospital. Again, he swears revenge.

When he has recovered, he goes back into the woods. He sees the polar bear and takes aim. He kills the polar bear. 

Sure enough, he feels another tap on his shoulder.
