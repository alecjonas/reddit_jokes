I was home schooled because we live in the west and my father wanted me in an environment that was free from anything Haram. I couldn't associate with Hindus or Christians, anyone who ate unclean animals, or any girl. As a teenage guy going through puberty this was naturally a living nightmare. After years of begging from me and pressure from his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anything Haram. Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Hindu friends in a week, and within the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too hipster punk for me, listing to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Hindus and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to whip it out for dad. It might be insane, but i actually am ok with dicks out for haram bae.

I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realise you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'
    The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know the defence attorney?'
    She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'

The doctor goes next, ""Well being a waiter seems an easy job, just taking orders for people all day. I'd like to do that."" BAM! The doctor is transported to a busy restaurant. After dealing with unruly customers for an hour, he finally loses his patience when a customer complains about his food. He drops his plates and storms out of the restaurant.

The janitor then takes his turn, ""Well I'd love to be an artist."" BAM! He was transported to the kindergarten where he made a sculpture out of the various broken stationary. He then walked over to the busy restaurant and did the same with the broken plates. An arts dealer saw his work, came over and gave him £1 million for both sculptures. The genie was flabbergasted, ""Wow,"" he said, ""Where did you learn to do that?""

""Well,"" the janitor said, ""I have an art degree.""","A scientist, a doctor and a janitor discover an old lamp...",19

Upon examination, the zoo veterinarian determined the problem: she was in heat. What to do? There was no male of this species available.  

While reflecting on their problem, the zoo administrators noticed Mike, an employee responsible for cleaning the animals' cages. Now Mike, it was rumored, possessed ample ability to satisfy any female, and he wasn't very bright. So the zoo administrators thought they might have a solution. Perhaps they could entice Mike to satisfy the female gorilla.  

 So he was approached with a proposition: would he be willing to screw the gorilla-for five hundred bucks? Mike replied that he might be interested, but would have to think the matter over. The following day, Mike announced that he would accept their offer, but only under three conditions:   
""First,"" he said, ""I don't want to have to kiss her,"" and   

""Second, I want nothing to do with any offspring that may result from this union."" The zoo administration quickly acceded to these conditions, but what could be the third?

Curious, the bartender pulls out his phone and browses /r/jokes for a few minutes.

""Heard it."", interrupts the redditor. ""It's reposted every month.""

post,4zuww2,2qh72,jokes,false,1472314859,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4zuww2/the_shrunken_head/,self.jokes,,"A man walks into a sex shop and tells the owner, ""Hey, my wife hasn't had sex with me in forever. I'm looking for something exciting to get her back in the mood.""

The shop owner thinks for a minute and says, ""I have something for you. It's a shrunken head made by an African witch doctor. What you do is you hold it in your hand, and when your wife is sleeping you whisper what you want in her ear, and the next day she'll give it to you.""

That sounded good, so the man bought the shrunken head, and that night after she fell asleep he whispered the words ""Hot, passionate sex,"" into her ear. The next day went by normally, but that evening when he started to kiss her she went along, and they wound up having the best sex since their wedding night.

She fell asleep before he did, and he figured that the head worked so well that he'd see what else he could get her to do. He grabbed it again and whispered into her ear.

""A blowjob.""

Sure enough, the next night before the went to bed, they started fooling around again, and without him even asking she undid his belt, dropped his pants, and gave him an amazing blowjob. After she went to sleep again, he picked up the head, and decided to try for something that she had never let him do before.

""Anal.""

Just as before, they started fooling around before they went to bed, and when he rolled her over and starting fucking her in the ass she didn't complain. That night, feeling that he'd gotten a pretty good deal, he went to sleep without whispering anything into her ear.

The next day he found himself going to an expensive jewelry store to buy a necklace for his wife. After all, she deserved it, didn't she? The night ended without anything happening, though, so he went looking for his shrunken head, but couldn't find it. He had to go to sleep without it, and after work the next day he thought to himself that he should get his wife a new car. He brought it home and she was thrilled, but again when he tried to get passionate with her that night she said she had a headache. He looked for the shrunken head again, but it was nowhere to be found.

The husband started to get suspicious, so he tried to stay awake as long as he could while pretending to sleep. She was too patient, though, so he quietly up his phone to record while he was sleeping, worried about what she would make buy next, because between the necklace and the car he was already broke.

Sure enough, he fell asleep, and the next moment he frantically listened to the recording, trying to figure out how he was going to pay for whatever she wanted. He got to the part where he heard her whispering something, and turned volume way up so that he could hear it.

I posted an ad in a local Facebook group selling some of our old biological samples in the Group's surplus sale. The ad reads as follows.

I have the heart of a small boy... $20 Grand Rapids, MI (49504)

In a jar....on my table. LOTS of biological samples including a heart, spiders, tapeworms, and an octopus. Excellent for a young person who wants to grow up to be a vet/biologist, or for scaring the living hell out of your soon to be ex wife. The Geek Group's Nerd Surplus Sale is being hosted at 902 Leonard NW, 49504, doors open at Noon.

And I posted a pic with it. The pic is of the preserved heart floating in a jar.

Of course, this is the internet, and, well....half of the people who come across it will have below average intellect. And I got this comment.

""Valerie C. First or all why do you have this I'm sure its illegal for you to have him an remains in your home""

Well......now this is just too much fun......

So, I replied, with this.....

Valerie, I’m glad you asked. It’s time I told the story.

Many years ago, my parents were quite poor. My dad owned a root vegetable farm growing potatoes, beets, turnips, rutabaga and such. My mom worked at the nursing home in town. We lived outside of Coopersville, a little farming town west of here in the nothing between Grand Rapids and Grand Haven. They had nothing, and their life was not an easy one.

As the leaves fell and they brought in the harvest of ‘74 my mom found out she was pregnant, with twins. If you’ve ever worked around nurses, well, this is like Christmas on a daily basis. They have baby rabies and go nuts over such things. Presents, a shower, it’s a whole thing. And TWINS no less, oh my god. My dad and his best friend build an addition on to the house, and builds a nursery with his own tools and his own hands.

On a beautiful spring morning, Saturday, May-31-1975 Peg (my mother) gives birth to a pair of healthy boys. 10 fingers, 10 toes, and the only way to tell them apart is one never shuts up, and one never makes a sound. They name the loudmouth Christopher (hi there), and the quiet one Peter.

We grew up typical american farm kids. Running in the fields, playing in the mud, poor but happy. My parents made sure we were fed and clothed and we were never want for anything. A simple life in a quiet town in a world before the internet. Summers on our bikes, and winters trudging the snow. We lived the kind of life where our idea of high entertainment was jumping out of the barn loft into the haystacks. Through all of it, we were inseparable. We did everything together.

Through all of it, Peter never really said a word. He wasn’t mute, he COULD talk, he just chose not to, especially around people. I was gregarious, a natural performer and always the center of attention. I’ve been the king of any room I walked into since I was a teenager. Peter, was always there, but always in my shadow. He seldom made a sound, and he spoke so rarely that I could count his vocabulary on my fingers. We called him “My quiet half”.

Still, this was our “normal”, and none of us really thought anything of it. We were 80’s kids, and medicine by today's standards was stone knives and bearskins.

In the late summer of 1991 we were helping with the harvest. To grow up on a farm is to be born into a life of strong muscles and an appreciation for hard work. We were harvesting Turnips, which are very dense and a full hopper weighs over 20 tons. Because of this they lurch and jump and twitch their way across the field. You’ve seen these being pulled behind tractors, they look like an upside down pyramid with a wheel on the side and a little hatch, and have an open top piled high with corn or whatever. We had 5 of them in a line behind an old International Harvester hydrostatic drive tractor.

I was driving the tractor across 60th from the West paddock (where we kept the cows) into the east field where we made the turn to go back to the drop pit to load the big truck that would haul all the turnips off to the broker that we sold them to. Pete was riding the pin and would release the load at the right time, one hopper after another, as we passed over the big grate. We’d done it a hundred times. It’s not the safest way to do it, but it’s what everyone does, because it’s hours faster than doing it “by the book”.

As we came over the ditch next to the corner of 60th and Garfield, the trailer jumped and Pete got knocked off. Five trailers, each in turn, brought their wheels across his abdomen and legs. He was shredded from the waist down. If he ever made a sound, I never heard it over the roar of the tractor. I didn’t even known he’d fallen off until I got to the barn and he wasn’t there.

I jumped out of the tractor and ran down the road, I saw him a quarter mile before I got to him, and that was the hardest run I’ve made in my life. From the waist up he looked totally fine, and below…..he looked like he’d sat on a grenade.

It took half an hour for the ambulance to get all the way out there, but it didn’t matter. There was no way he could survive that. He never cried, or screamed or anything. He simply whispered one word.

“Sorry”

September 26th, 1991 was when half of me died, my brother, my Twin. My quiet half, silenced forever.

In the process of cleaning him off the road, hauling him to the hospital, and all of the circus that goes with that, one of the Dr’s noticed that his heart was unusual. The left Atrium and Ventricle were about 3 times the size of the right. The right half of his heart was perfectly normal. The left had formed so large as to displace his lungs and his vocal cords. It was then that we learned that talking for Pete wasn’t just difficult, it was incredibly painful. We never knew. It was a simple birth defect, and today it would be easily treated, even without surgery. But back then, for simple farm folk, we never thought a thing of it. Think about it, do you know how big your heart is?

Hold your fists together. It’s about that big. Behind your sternum, and just a little to your left.

Pete, through a miracle of mortuary science, had a totally normal funeral with a half-open casket. Most of the people who came had no idea that there wasn't really anything under the closed half, but I had to take a peek after. I lifted the lid and, while I don’t know what the hell I expected to see, I wasn’t prepared for what I found. He was completely dressed, but the pants stopped just under his butt (about 2 inches past where you could see with the top half open). With only the top door open he looked totally normal. But open the lower half, and his pants were rolled up into little bundles and tucked neatly under him, where his legs would have started. Where his legs should have been, were just a series of jars. They had to bury as much of him as they could find, but they couldn’t put him back together, or didn’t take the time. It wasn’t as if he was going to get sewn back together be heal up or something. So most of his organs and such were in jars, sitting where his legs would have been. It wasn’t gross or anything, just simple glass jars with things floating in them.

I don’t know why I did it. But I had the whole place to myself, and I reached in, and picked up the jar holding his heart. I quietly closed the lid, said goodbye to my brother, and took it home with me.

I hid it, on the shelf in my closet, for years.

My mom came across it once, I told her it was from school for a science project and she said “Iew, gross” and went on with her day. Nothing was ever said about it after that, just another in the massive collection of weird things that was my room as a teenager.

As I write this, it’s 2016, and I have years on my back forty-one. Pete’s heart has been with me through my first love, college, and building a wild dream into a global empire. My quiet half. It’s time to let him go and make his own impact on the world.

Pete can live on, far longer than I will really, his giant heart will pass from student to student. Biological samples like this tend to never be actually opened. They are studied through the glass, and spend decades sitting on a shelf. Properly preserved his heart will remain intact for a hundred years after mine is turned back into fertile soil.

And that is the story of how I came to have the heart of a small boy, in a jar, on a table.

Or it could be that it’s a sheep’s heart that I got from a high school years ago with all the rest of those biological samples and we’re simply selling them to make space for new demonstrations and gear. It could be that I just made all of this up because it’s a nice quiet morning and perhaps I just like to mess with people that get all indignant on the internet.

And you believed it.

What….did you just fall off the fucking Turnip truck or something?

Saddam Hussein himself is there, and explains to them that they're at a secret location the allies don't know about so there's no chance of a rescue but they're only 50 miles from the Kuwait border. He says they're welcome to use any of the vehicles &amp; equipment on the base to escape to Kuwait, and if they make it to the border they're free to go as his men will not shoot over it. The catch is, they get a 5 minute head start before the full might of the Iraqi army starts hunting them.

So the Englishman says ""I'll take that turbocharged jeep"", the Iraqis turn their backs while the Englishman jumps in the jeep &amp; speeds off towards the border. 5 minutes later Saddam sends an attack helicopter which easily catches him up &amp; blows him to bits.

The Scotsman then thinks for a moment and says ""I'll use that helicopter"" so the Iraqis turn their backs as he jumps in the attack helicopter that got the Englishman &amp; speeds off towards the border. 5 minutes later they launch a surface to air missile that blows the Scotsman out of the sky.

Smugly, the Iraqis turn to the Irishman and say ""Well? What do you want?"" To which the Irishman replies ""I'll have a duck and 4 springs, please."" The Iraqis are puzzled, but they round up the stuff, give it to the Irishman and turn their backs. 5 minutes later there's no sign of him at all. Saddam launches everything to hunt him, to no avail. They find him sitting on the other side of the border, having apparently been there for quite some time. ""How the hell did you do that?"" asks Saddam, both bewildered &amp; impressed by the speed of his journey, to which the Irishman replies; ""Foursprung duck technique"".","An Englishman, an Irishman &amp; a Scotsman get captured by Iraqis during the first gulf war...",6

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.

The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant.",If this doesn't bring a tear to your eyes you must have a heart made of stone.,126

post,4zsxz9,2qh72,jokes,false,1472276639,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4zsxz9/oc_an_old_blacksmith_was_working_in_his_shop/,self.jokes,,"when there was a terrible accident. The fire in his forge had gone out of control and set fire to the shop. The blacksmith nearly lost his life. He was bedridden for many months and relied on the help of his children and grandchildren to feed him, bathe him, and take care of all of his needs. Eventually he was able to get back on his feet, though his outlook on life had turned quite grim. He was now able to take care of himself, but he had lost much of his strength and dexterity from the injuries he sustained and he was unable to practice his trade. He fell into a deep depression and he spent most of his days sitting at home in front of the fireplace gazing into the flames, longing for the days when his strong hands could grasp a hammer and strike a hot piece of iron, slowly forging it into a beautiful piece of work. 

One evening when the old man was sitting in front of the fire, he heard a knock at the door. It was his granddaughter, whom he hadn't seen in many months. She had overheard her father talking to her mother about how her grandfather was slowly slipping away into depression and hopelessness and she wanted to help. To the old man's surprise, she had brought him a puppy. ""I thought that since you're always here all by yourself that you might want someone you keep you company,"" the granddaughter said. The old man's eyes welled up with tears and the little puppy instantly jumped into his arms and began licking the tears from his face. The old man and his granddaughter spent the next several hours sitting on the floor of his house watching the puppy chase around a rubber ball, bouncing, jumping, panting, and licking. In that short time, the old man had made complete turnaround from being sad, lonely, and hopeless, to smiling from ear to ear, full of joy with his new-found companion. As the hours grew late and the puppy grew tired, the granddaughter said ""Well Opa, I'm glad you like your puppy, but it's late and I should be heading home. By the way, what are you going to call him?"" ""Life,"" said the old man, ""because he has given me a new meaning and joy to mine."" The granddaughter kissed her grandfather on the cheek, wished him goodnight, and she left. 
  
Many years passed and all the while, the old man and his little dog were inseparable. Everywhere the old man went, Life was always with him whether it was the post office, the grocery store, and even when the old man went to the barber shop, the little dog would sit patiently until the last hair on the old man’s head had been cut . The granddaughter would often come to visit to see how her grandfather and the dog were doing, and she was always glad to see that her grandfather was still happy. But at night, the old man would still sit in front of the fireplace with Life on his lap, gazing into the fireplace as flames cast dancing shadows across the room and he fell asleep to thoughts of his old smithing days. 
  
One morning as the old man was getting the morning newspaper from the front porch, Life sprinted past him through the front door because he had spotted a squirrel across the street. Before the little dog could catch up with his prey, a speeding car struck the poor animal. The car came to a screeching halt and the old man hobbled as quickly as his old legs could carry them to his precious companion who lay whimpering on the side of the road. The little dog was alive but badly injured. The man who was driving the car got out to apologize to the old man, but his regrets went unnoticed by the weeping old man who only wanted to tend to his injured dog. Life’s two hind legs appeared limp and broken and the dog panted and whimpered as the old man carried him back into the house. The old man knew that his dog’s injuries required medical attention but because he was out of work, he wasn’t able to afford a veterinarian. Determined, the old man did the only thing he knew how to do. He found some of his old blacksmithing tools and scrap metal from his garage and proceeded to start a fire in his fireplace. His hands lacked the strength and precision they once had but eventually, he was able to forge a crude set of brackets that would hold the dog’s legs in place as his injuries healed. The old man tended to dog’s every need until eventually, Life was able to stand up on his own and soon enough, the dog could walk, and after a few more weeks, he could even manage a awkward, limping run. Unfortunately, the old blacksmith’s craftsmanship was lacking due to his own previous injuries and the braces that he had forged would often break when the dog ran too quickly, so the old man found himself back at the fireplace with his tools forging replacement parts for his little dog’s leg braces. It was tiresome, difficult work with his old frail hands, but he was determined to give his dog the best life that he could, so he kept at it. 
  
One day, as the old man was forging a new set of parts for his dog’s leg braces, an ember jumped from the fireplace, catching the carpet on fire. The old man couldn’t get to the kitchen quickly enough to get a pail of water to put the fire out and tragically, the old blacksmith and his dog both perished as the house was engulfed in flames. 
  
The next day, the granddaughter and her father came to where the old blacksmith’s house once stood and they began to search through the ashes and rubble for anything they could salvage as a keepsake of their lost loved one. “You know,” said the girl to her father, “I’m really happy that grandpa’s last years were as joyful as they were. Even though he was really sad that he couldn’t make a living as a blacksmith anymore, he really did seem happy after I brought him that puppy.” “Yes dear,” said the father. The daughter continued, “But isn’t it sad how his house was burnt down when he was making one of those leg braces for his dog?” The father looked down and picked up a small piece of metal from the ashes and said “That’s one of Life’s little iron knees.”

Hi Bob, This is Alan next door.
I have a confession to make. I've been riddled with guilt these past few months and have been trying to pluck up the courage to tell you to your face, but I am at least now telling you in text as I can't live with myself a moment longer without you knowing.
The truth is I have been sharing your wife, day and night when you're not around. In fact, probably more than you. I haven't been getting it at home recently, but that's no excuse, I know.
The temptation was just too much. I can no longer live with the guilt and I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies and forgive me. It won't happen again.
Please suggest a fee for usage, and I'll pay you.
Regards, Alan.

THE ACTIONS
Bob, feeling insulted and betrayed, grabbed his gun, and shot his neighbor dead. He returned home where he poured himself a stiff drink and sat down on the sofa. He took out his phone where he saw he has a subsequent message from his neighbor:

THE SECOND MESSAGE
Hi Bob, This is Alan next door again. Sorry about the typo on my last text.
I expect you figured it out anyway, &amp; that you noticed that darned Auto-correct changed 'Wi-Fi' To 'Wife'. Technology hey?
Regards, Alan.

One of their stops was Cuernavaca, where they were staying in a luxurious hotel. As they were checking in at the front desk, the manager notices the happy couple and approaches to congratulate them.

""Mr. and Mrs. Huerta! Congratulations! Thank you for picking us for your stay in Cuernavaca!"" shaking the man's hand. ""I must warn you though, Juan Rayo is in town.""

The couple exchanged confused glances. ""Juan Rayo? Who's that?"" 

""Well... He is famous for being the fastest man in Mexico. And unfortunately he has a taste for recently married women. There have been numerous reports of rape around town. We've been trying to catch him, but he's very elusive.""

The couple were shocked. ""Well, we certainly can't stay here! But it's too late to drive. We will leave tomorrow morning at first light.""

The couple retire to their suite, which has a gorgeous view of the town below, but the couple are too worried about Juan Rayo to enjoy themselves. In fact, they've decided to be safe and have the husband put his finger inside his wife at all times so no one else can get in. 

As the night progresses, the couple start to relax a little and even watch a movie. Eventually, they notice an open window and decide to close it. They move towards it, his finger still up her hoohaa, but when they get there, they can't close it. It's stuck. 

He pulls out of her, uses his weight against the window frame, and manages to close it. He reaches back and goes back to plugging the whole. 

""Get your finger out of my ass!""

Seeing that this gorillas massive quivering member was within arm's reach, one of the men dares his boyfriend to touch it. Reluctant, he soon accepts the challenge and begins to slowly reach his arm in the cage. The gorillas eyes are locked onto his hand as it inches closer and closer and, as soon as the tip of his forefinger grazed the shaft, the gorilla, without any chance for the man to react, snatches the man by the arm, bends the bar of the cage, and violently rapes him for a whole hour. 


The man awoke from his coma a week later in the hospital, and after hearing the good news, his boyfriend plans a visit with him the following day. 


Upon entering the room, he sees his post-rape boyfriend laying on the bed with bandages around his waist, and showing obvious signs of pain and discomfort.


""Omg honey, are you OK? Are you still hurt from the gorilla?"" he asked with a teardrop in his eye.

1.  The newest lumberjack in the camp cooks all the meals, until a newer lumberjack shows up and becomes the cook unless..
2.  If a lumberjack complains about any of the cooking, then they become the new cook.

So a rookie shows up, and is pretty disappointed in these rules.  He joined up to cut down trees and work outdoors, not slave away in the kitchens!  So one day he goes out into the woods, and finds the biggest, stinkiest, squishiest moose turd he can find, bakes it into a pie crust, and serves it to the camp for dessert.  

The biggest, oldest lumberjack there goes up for his desert first, cuts a tremendous piece of the pie, takes a huge bite, and roars ""Ah, that there's Moose Turd Pie!"" before quickly adding ""and damn is it good!""

Come that evening he is laying in bed with his wife, it has been a pretty long time since they have had sex, the spirit is willing but his flesh has grown weak. As he lays there in the dark, he begins to think about his day and soon he is struck with the similarity between himself and the old bulls.

Wouldn't you know it, the old mans body begins to respond and he is elated, he hasn't been this hard since his early 30s. It is amazing!

The sounds he creates are incredible and irreplaceable.
  Tragically, one day the legendary bell ringer dies, and the entire village is at a loss. The head monk of the bell tower decides that the only way to replace the legendary bell ringer is to hold bell ringing trials the day following the bell ringer's death. Every single person queues up at the bottom of the bell tower and rings the bell, but not one of them is able to recreate the beautiful sounds that the legendary bell ringer created.
At the end of the day, after everyone has had their trials, the head monk is at a loss. 
  'The legendary bell ringer will never be replaced,' he says, as he hangs his head in shame, whilst sat at the foot of the tower. He had just about given up all hope when there is a tug on his trouser leg. He looks down to see a poor, clearly homeless, man chewing and tugging his trouser leg. The man has no arms, and only had one leg, and lays beraggled on the floor. 
   'What do you want?' the head asks.
   'I'm here for the bell ringing trials!' the man proclaims. At this point the head monk figures that he may as well give the man a go, even though he had never seen or heard of him before, let alone the fact that he is missing some of his limbs.
  The head monk orders the man to be carried to the top of the bell tower, as he is unable to pull the rope to ring the bell at the tower's base. The man stands up and hops to the edge of the bell tower. He proceeds to launch himself towards the bell, headbutting it as he passes, and safely landing on the opposing platform.
  A magical noise echoes throughout the village, one better than ever heard before. The head monk, clearly surprised, gathers all of the village people to show off the village's new, if strange, bell ringer. He requests all to surround the tower, and hundreds of people fill the streets that evening to hear the new sounds.
  The homeless man is once again carried up the tower, and stands on the edge of the bell tower. Again, he launches himself towards the bell, but he misjudges the leap, and subsequently falls to his death in front of the entire village.
  A number of people proceed to cry out and surround the body, before the local enforcement remove the body and take the head monk into detention for questioning. They sit him down to interview him, to make sure that there is no foul play at hand. The interview begins and the head monk is calm, although distraught.
  'So, to begin... did you know this man? His name? Where he may be from?' the interviewer asks.
  
  The head monk looks puzzled, 'No... no I'm afraid I don't know him...but his face rings a bell...'.","There's an ancient monk village based around a huge bell tower that makes incredible , beautiful sounds.",3

grandma a question if they aren’t
prepared for the answer.
In a trial, a Southern small-town
prosecuting attorney called his first
witness, a grandmotherly, elderly
woman to the stand. He approached her and asked, ‘Mrs. Jones, do you know me?’ She responded, ‘Why, yes, I do
know you, Mr. Williams. I’ve known you
since you were a boy, and frankly,
you’ve been a big disappointment to me.
You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you
manipulate people and talk about them
behind their backs. You think you’re a
big shot when you haven’t the brains to
realize you’ll never amount to anything
more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I
know you.’
The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing
what else to do, he pointed across the
room and asked, ‘Mrs. Jones, do you
know the defense attorney?’
She again replied, ‘Why yes, I do. I’ve
known Mr. Bradley since he was a
youngster, too. He’s lazy, bigoted, and he
has a drinking problem. He can’t build a
normal relationship with anyone, and
his law practice is one of the worst in
the entire state. Not to mention he
cheated on his wife with three different
women. One of them was your wife.
Yes, I know him.’
The defense attorney nearly died.
The judge asked both counselors to
approach the bench and, in a very quiet
voice, said,
‘If either of you idiots asks her if she
knows me, I’ll send you both to the

A husband whose wife is notorious for cheating on him while he is away on business is at his wits end with the whole thing.

He loves his wife dearly, and explained to her that this cannot continue. He has a long trip coming up soon and knows that she is going to cheat on him if he doesn't do something. So he has decided to purchase her a female masterbatory aid to stop her cheating ways.

After explaining all of this to his wife, she tells him that she is extremely excited at the idea and urges him to go and pick out something for her.

As he is scanning the dildo wall of his local porn store he shakes his head and clearly not finding anything he thinks she would like, he turns to leave.

However, the Jamaican man behind the counter stops him.

""Oy! Come down o'r here boy. Me thinks I be havin sum tin you want.""

The Husband, caught off guard walks over to the counter as the fellow places a simple wooden box on the counter and flops it open. 

Inside is a rather plain average sized dildo. The husbands face contorts with disbelief and meets the Jamaican mans gaze. 

""What's so special about this one? That one on the wall over there is 24 inches."" He explains, gesturing behind him.

The shop keep smiles and speaks in a low tone. 

""Dis, be da Voodoo dick mon. You tell de dick what to do. And it do it.""

The husband lets out a laugh. ""Yeah, sure it does."" He shakes his head and turns to leave.

""Stop!"" The Jamaican says. ""I be showing you! Voodoo dick! Fuck the doll!"" The shop keep points at one of the several full sized sex dolls propped up against one wall.

To the husbands amazement, the dildo leaps out of the box, floats over to the doll and begins fucking it.

The husbands jaw drops open as he can't believe what he is seeing. ""I'll take it!"" He exclaims and quickly pulls out his credit card ""How much?""

After a few minutes of negotiation the man pays. The Shop keeper leans in close as he hands him his receipt.

""One mor ting mon. You haf to be tellin the Voodoo Dick 'back in your box' or it not be stopping. The man nods.

""Voodoo Dick! Back in your box!"" He says, and the dildo stops fucking the doll, floats over and lands in its box. The man is over joyed. 

Back at his house the husband explains his shopping experience with his wife who nods and smiles eagerly during the entire exchange. He tells her everything except how to ""turn it off"", then rushed out of the house to catch his flight.

A few days later the wife, feeling extremely frisky. Starts thinking of all of the men should can call over to quench her appetite when she remembers the Voodoo Dick. 

So figuring she has nothing to loose, she gets undressed, grabs the box with the dildo in it, opens it and says; ""Voodoo Dick! Fuck my pussy."" 

The dildo leaps to obey. 

After throughly enjoying herself, the wife decides she has had enough and reaches down to stop the dildo from continuing, yet it does not cease. 

She begins to panic. Try as she might, she simply cannot get the thing to stop pounding her. Having no other options, she dons a heavy trench coat and rushed out to her car, with the intention of driving to the hospital.

On the way, Voodoo Dick is still going at it. Causing the wife to swerve occasionally whenever another orgasm  strikes her. 

Seeing the erratic driving a cop flips on his lights and chased the wife down. Pulling her over the cop asks what's going on? The wife, still being drilled by Voodoo Dick tries to explain the whole thing.

The cop shakes his head and says; ""Yeah right. Voodoo Dick my ass!""
