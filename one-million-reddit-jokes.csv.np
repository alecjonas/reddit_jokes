The captain says, ""There are other men aboard and they have the same concerns as you, lad. I too find it hard to be away from me wife. There hasn't been a women aboard in years, but we have found a solution to this problem. Follow me.""

So the sailor follows the captain to the hold, and the captain leads the sailor to an inconspicuous barrel with a hole thats just the right size and just about the right hight. The captain says, ""well, Lad, here tis our solution, just stick it in ye hole and have away.""

The sailor looks incredulously at the captain. ""Are you serious?!? A hole in a barrel?!?"" ""Just try it"" and the captain walks away. 

The sailor thinks that there could be no harm in trying and undoes his pants.

Fifteen minutes later the sailor climbs on deck with a huge smile.

Really only had two defining characteristics about her though, her love of lemon-lime sodas and her innate marksmanship. She was a damn good crackshot. Her dad was a bit of a gun nut. Owned lots of rifles including a classic, old-time sniper from back in the WWII era. Beautiful old thing. She learned to fire it at age 12, could hit targets at 100 meters by age 15. She ended up entering some sharpshooting competition around the area. This one competition was particularly important to her because it was sponsored by a soda company. The prize was a year’s supply of any soda the winner wanted. Of course, my friend entered for that delicious lemon-lime goodness. So she hefted her trusty old sniper over to the field. There were 16 contestants so the competition was a single-elimination bracket. The rules were simple. Stand behind the line, aim and fire. If you hit it, the target got pushed back a few meters. If you miss and the other guy hits it, you’re out. Well my friend easily blew most of the competitors out of the water. Punks couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn. She completely cleared out her side of the bracket with almost no competition. It came down to the final round. She was up against Jackson. At 6 foot 6, this guy was an intimidating foe. Even with those catcher’s glove-sized hands he still wielded his rifle with the grace of a ballerina. Completely wiped out his side of the bracket. It was getting tense. He fired off first. 50 meters. Easy. Her next. 50 meters. Easy. And then him. 100 meters. Easy. Her. 100 meters. Easy. 150. Harder. 200. Harder. 300. Barely made it. But it came down to the wire. Two bottles, 400 meters down the field. Jackson stepped up first, sweat dripping down his face. He fired. BANG. CRACK. The bullet nicked the side, shattering the target. But you could see the Jackson’s nervousness. It was clear that he would not be able to hit the next target. It was up to Sierra now. She was sweating buckets. It all came down to this. If she could tap that glass even slightly, she’d be looking at a year’s supply of her favorite soft drink. She lined up her shot. Stared down the sights. The audience looked on in anticipation. Her lemon-lime drinks were on the line. This was all she needed. BANG. . . . Nothing. Her soda was gone. Sierra missed.",A girl and her sniper rifle,0

He asks the girl with his elaborate crafty ""promposal"" (can you believe that's even a made up word?) and she says yes, so he goes to start getting ready for prom. He goes to a nice tux rental place to get fitted for a tux. He goes to pay for his rental, and there's this ridiculously long line. So he waits and waits and eventually gets to pay and leave with his tux. Then he goes to the florist to buy the girl a corsage. He picks one out, gets up front to pay and there's this massively long line. So, as you might guess, he waits and waits and waits before he eventually gets to pay and take the corsage. Next he goes to the local limo service to work out which limo he wants, and finally picks out a really nice limo to rent for the night. He gets directed to the service desk to confirm his reservation where this line is just bigly long. So he waits and waits and waits and waits before finally getting up front to arrange the details. Finally, it's the night of the big dance, and he and his date are having the time of their lives at Prom. Taking a break from dancing, the girl turns to him and asks if he'll go get them some drinks, so he goes over to the punch table and there's no punch line.",It was almost prom season...,5

All of a sudden a bumblebee entered the bedroom window. As the young lady parted her legs the bee entered her vagina.
The woman started screaming, ""Oh my gosh, help me, there's a bee in my vagina!"" The husband immediately took her to the local doctor and explained the situation.
The doctor thought for a moment and said, ""Hmm, tricky situation. But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit."" The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina.
The doctor said, ""OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. 
The husband nodded and gave his approval.
The young lady said, ""Yes, yes, whatever, just get on with it."" 
So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, ""I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper."" 
So the doctor went deeper and deeper... After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed... The young lady began to quiver with excitement. She began to moan and groan aloud... The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself, he then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises.
The husband at this point suddenly became very annoyed and shouted, ""Now wait a minute! What do you think you're doing?""
The doctor, still concentrating, replied, ""Change of plan. I'm gonna drown the bastard!""

The only thing my kinetic energy is missing is U

Hey babe, wanna go and experience some general plane motion? Cuz you'll be experiencing translation and rotation.

Will you be the load on my rigid body

How much Q and A is it gonna take to shear those clothes off

How quickly can we heat up to expand this shaft

What kind of moment do we need to relieve this load

How much torque is it gonna take to bust this nut

I'm gonna bust a nut with all this torque

You need to pin and roll 'er to support this load

I'd distribute this load all over that body

Wanna go get statically indeterminate, I'll wedge this beam between two tight places

Babe if we're gonna shear I'm gonna need P and A

You know how we get torque from power? All we need is friction

You can deform my member with that assial load

I'll dialate you with this bulk modulus

I can only promise one thing. This load will leave you plastically deformed 

Baby Don't put too much [stress] on my shaft

Eigenvalue your subspace 

Eigenspace the complex roots leading to your rooty toot toots 

Eigenvalue that ass

I can promise you this ain't no thin walled hollow shaft

Eigenvalue you as a complex root, cuz you're both real and imaginary

Nail that body between the spacing

One of the kids says ""Let's toss the bricks in the air, and sees whose brick sinks the deepest.""

So, the first kid goes and his brick sinks about one foot deep. The second kid goes and his sinks three feet. The third kid winds up, throws his brick, but it doesn't come down.

...

Okay, here's another joke.

A woman wants to visit her mother and wants to bring her parrot, but she can only afford a ticket on an airline with a strict, ""No smoking, no birds"" policy. So, she thinks she'll be fine if she hides the bird in her jacket.

So, she gets through security and sits down and the plane takes off. The pilot is walking through the aisles saying hello. But, the pilot has a big 'ol cigar in his mouth. He gets to our lady. He asks, ""Are you enjoying your flight?""

And she says, ""Yes, thank you.""

Then, the pilot hears faintly, *""Polly want a cracker.""

""What was that?"" The pilot asked.

""Nothing,"" the lady said. Then, parrot squawked again. The pilot rips open her jacket and grabs the parrot.

""Ma'am, you can't have birds on this plane!"" Then, the woman plucks the cigar out of his mouth.

""You can't have a cigar on the plane!"" The pilot stands there for a second, then throws the parrot out the window. The lady gets so mad, and throws the cigar out the window, too. The woman sits down and the pilot goes back to the cockpit, and takes control again.

All of a sudden, he hears a tapping outside. He looks out, and there's the parrot. But, what does the parrot have in his mouth?

*""A cigar?""*

However, one year, his students are rather uninterested in their arithmetic homework. Since John is a dedicated teacher, he decides to come up with a new way to teach his students. 

He takes some cubical blocks of wood, and writes various simple operations on the faces, such as addition and subtraction, to make a sort of die. He also creates a set of cards with numbers on them. 
Using these two materials, he is able to construct a game for his kids. It is a massive success, and the children instantly become much more interested in their arithmetic homework, so they can become faster at their sums and products and beat their peers at this game. Indeed, some of the worse performers actually ask for additional practice. The idea is so successful that it quickly spreads to the other classrooms and starts getting picked up in nearby schools. At the end of the school year the principal commends John for his work and creativity and awards him the Teacher of the Year.

John is incredibly pleased with himself, and decides to visit a bar to celebrate. He starts up a conversation with the bartender, and as it turns out, the bartender's friend's daughter goes to the school John teaches at, and has gotten much more interested in mathematics with this game. 

John happens to have a new, more advanced prototype die in his pocket, and the bartender asks to see it. He turns it around, and notices that there are indeed some more complex operators on the faces. However, he finds it strange that there should be logarithms on there - after all, these were supposed to be mental calculations, and logarithms were definitely not easy to compute mentally if the
number was not round. Confused, the bartender asks John,

Why the ln face?

The vet tells him that he should try artificial insemination. The farmer doesn’t have the slightest idea what this means but, not wanting to display his ignorance, only asks the vet how he will know when the sheep are pregnant. The vet tells him that they will stop standing around and will lie down and wallow in the grass when they are pregnant.  

The farmer hangs up and gives it some thought. He comes to the conclusion that artificial insemination means he has to impregnate the sheep. So he loads the sheep into his truck, drives them out into the woods, screws them all, brings them back and goes to bed.  

Next morning, he wakes and looks out at the sheep. Seeing that they are all still standing around, he deduces that the first try didn’t take and loads them in the truck again. He drives them out to the woods, screws each sheep twice for good measure, brings them back and goes to bed.   
Next morning, he wakes to find the sheep still just standing around. One more try, he tells himself, and proceeds to load them up and drive them out to the woods. He spends all day sheep screwing, and upon returning home falls exhausted into bed.  
The next morning he cannot even raise himself from the bed to look at the sheep. He asks his wife to look out and tell him if the sheep are lying in the grass.   
“No,” she says, “they’re all in the truck and one of them is beeping the horn.”

He says- ""Your father sent me up to fuck both of you.

Mick shouts downstairs ""Bob... both of them?""  
Bob shouts back ""Of course!! Whats the point of fucking one!?""

As Mick covered one of the daughter's mouth, the other one screamed loud enough so Mick could hear.  
""What the hell is going on?"" Bob screamed back.  
Bob tried to get up to see what the issue was, but then fell as his leg was still broken. ""Shit, I've fallen and I can't get up. Can one of you come down here?""  
As Mick had his way with the daughters, Bob was determined to do something but he didn't know what was going on. He kept calling and asking what was going on, but he could only hear some noises. Due to his lifelong friendship with Mick, he had no clue that he was the instigator in this dispute. So he assumed it was some other issue, but kept calling. After he heard a loud slam, he thought to himself ""Shit, I've got do something."" He quietly picked up the phone and dialed 911.   
""911, what is your emergency?"" The operator asked.  
""I'm not sure what is going on, I think there is some sort of domestic dispute going on upstairs between my daughters. My legs are broken and although my friend Mick is up there, undoubtedly caught in the crossfire I don't think he can solve the issue.""  
""No problem, We'll send a couple of officers your way."" the operator replied.  
As Bob remained motionless below, he kept calling, trying to get his daughters or Mick to reply. But there were no responses.  
Once the police arrived, they barged through the door. Two of them stayed behind to help Bob off the floor while the rest rushed up the stairs. They were shocked to see what was going on.  
The two girls were sitting on the floor, in a trance. As soon as the cops burst through the door, Mick held his hands up and snapped his fingers. The girls immediately clapped their hands until they saw the police officers. ""What are the cops doing here?"" they asked.  
""Not sure,"" replied Mick, feeling wary as he was in an uncomfortable position with the cops pointing guns at him.  
""Put those down!"" demanded one of the daughters. The cops looked at each other and obliged.  
""Is this man trying to hurt you?"" an officer asked one of the daughters.  
""Of course not!"" she responded. ""He was playing a practical joke on us like he always does. He made some joke and then after we figured out his meaning, we let him hypnotize us. He totally mindfucked both of us!""

Bill: "" You know what guys, I gotta be frank with you, Julie and I actually broke-up about a month ago, and I've been on the dating seen for about a week, and honestly I've had some bad experiences already"".

Jim: ""Hey they can't be as bad as Brad's experience with that Chinese chick, remember how crazy she was Braddy boy?""

Bill: ""Why what happened there?""

Brad: ""Oh I remember, how could I forget that, I promised I'd never tell that story again,.......but what the hell I haven't seen you booze bags in a while"".

"" Alright, so as Jim mentioned, I once dated a Chinese girl, and after about a month of dinners, movies the whole nine yards, we planned on having sex at her place, which I had never been to before. That's when I found out that she's a huge Bruce Lee fan. I have admittedly seen many of his films like 20 years ago, but this was a whole new level of fandom. There were posters on the walls from various films, action figures on shelves and she even served some awesome cheese dip she had made on a Bruce Lee platter with matching plates"".

Bill: ""So far so good"".

Brad: ""Well, things got kinky real fast"".

""She says, 'since we're both nervous about our first time, why don't we make it fun'""  

""I say, 'sure what did you have in mind?'""

""She says, 'wait here!'""

""So the next thing I know this Chinese chick runs out of the room and into the closet. Some rustling ensues and she emerges wearing this skimpy outfit"".

""So I'm like, 'that's cute, what is that you're wearing?'""

""She's like, 'I'm a dragon, and you - she hands a white wifebeater to me- are Bruce Lee. I want you to enact the Bruce Lee films with me'"".

Jim: ""So did you show her the power of ninja Brad?""

Brad: ""Ya, but that's where shit hit the proverbial fan""

""We started off with 'Enter the Dragon', if you know what I mean, then she showed me 'The Fury of the Dragon', which was pretty rough, so I put in 'Fist of Fury' which she didn't like and it finished with 'In the Face of Demolition' if you catch my drift"".

Bill: ""Geez, you really weren't kidding, that's some grade A shit"".

Brad: ""Well it doesn't end there Billy""

""We parted ways pretty much right after that. I tried calling and trying to at least end things on a positive, but she was having none of it. I finally recieved a knock at the door about three months later""

""She's standing there and says, 'Now I have 'The Kid''.

""I'm like, 'Oh good cause I love that movie and I have a movie I wanted to give you too! So I go grab the movie""

""She says, 'No I have kid now, and rubs her belly'""

Bill: ""Holy shit! What the hell did you do?""

Brad: ""Well I thrust the movie I was holding into her chest and said, 'Well now you have 'The Orphan'"".

Shlomo: Oh yeah. I was getting quite aroused. She finally removed her lingerie off completely and threw it at me while standing there completely naked. That’s when I climaxed, I just couldn’t hold it.

Haim: Whow, your wife must have a smoking body!

Shlomo: Nah, it wasn’t her body.

Haim: Well, I guess her dancing is super sexy!

Shlomo: Nah, wasn’t that either.

The cathedral HR department put out a posting to get a replacement for him, but due to the eerie nature of the bell tower, they only got one response - Quasimodo's brother. They called him in for an interview.

The first thing the bell tower manager noticed was that the applicant had no arms.  He said ""What makes you think you can be a bell ringer with no arms?"".  

Quasimodo's brother replied ""Just give me a chance to show you what I can do.""  So they went up to the bell tower and Quasimodo's brother ran across the tower and rammed his face into the bells, bouncing from one to another to make them peal like they had never before.

The manager gave him the job right on the spot not just because of the way the bells rang but because this also filled one of the federally mandated hiring quota slots.

After several weeks of glorious carillons, things seemed to be going well.  Until one night when it started raining....

The poor man ran across the bell tower as usual, but slipped in a puddle and fell down to his death.  People all ran out and gathered around the body and tried to figure out who he was.   The mayor looked closely at him and said ""I can't remember what his name is, but his face rings a bell.""

And the bell tower manager said ""I don't know his name either, but he's a dead-ringer for his brother.""",Quasimodo passed away,16

""Well let's go next Friday then!""

""Aye, and that's where the problem lies. Like I said, it was all you can drink, so I had my fill and my memory is pretty fuzzy. All I can remember about the place is it had big purple double doors in the front and a golden toilet in the restroom.""

""A golden toilet?""

""Aye, a golden toilet. Even in my blacked out state I can remember thinking how strange it was for the toilet to be painted gold.""

The pair decide they are going to find this bar with the $2 drinks, gorgeous gals, big purple doors, and a golden toilet. The next Friday they head out and catch a cab. They explain to the cab driver what they are looking for and he says it doesn't sound familiar, but if it's in this city he will find it.

So, after driving all over town without much luck they finally pull up to this little dive bar and lo and behold it has over-sized double doors painted a bright purple. The guy gets excited and tells his buddy, ""I think this is it!""

The bar hasn't opened up yet for the night, but they notice the bartender bringing out a bag of trash to the dumpster, so they go over to ask him about it.

""Hey, does this place have golden toilets?""

The bartender is confused. ""What?!?""

""Does this place have golden toilets? I was in the best bar of my life last week and the only thing I can remember is it has purple doors like this one and a golden toilet in the men's room.""

The bartender thinks for a minute, seems to realize what is going on, then opens up the door to bar and yells, ""Hey Sam, I think I found the guy that took a dump in your tuba last week!""",The Bar with the Golden Toilet,357

Well, happy was a strong word. Most would call him content. He made a good living, had good friends, and loved his community. But something was missing. The horse wanted more. He wanted to pursue his dream in music and start a band. So he began playing solos on his guitar in local bars. One day, a sheep came up to him after one of his performances and began talking to him about his interests in music. The horse was impressed, and asked him to play the tuba with him. So they began playing together. Soon, they met the cow, pig, and chicken, who quickly joined the band. The cow played the piano, the pig played the accordion, and the chicken sang.

Everyday, they performed and their crowd gradually grew. One day, after an amazing performance, a representative of a record label came up to them. He offered to give them a job and said they would go on tour as an opening act. They were shocked, but excited.

So they went on tour. Crowds loved them, and they often overshadowed the main act. On apps like Spotify and Apple Music, their songs were blowing up. And their fame only grew. Over this time, the horse, sheep, cow, pig, and chicken had become great friends, but, as many band members do, they began to fight. One day, they were offered another chance for a tour. They had done many of these, but were told this one would be the biggest. Everyone in the band except the horse wanted to go. He was too tired. Tired of working constantly. Tired of fighting. So he refused to join them. They all begged him to go on that trip, telling him it would be an amazing experience. But he wouldn't. So off they went to the first stop of the tour in the band's big private jet without him.

The next morning, the horse picked up the newspaper and read that days headline: ""Animal Band Killed In Tragic Plane Crash."" The horse didn't believe it. He couldn't. Thoughts rushed through his head. He could have been there. He should have died. Why should he live when they die? Did he even want to live? All his friends were dead. This went on for hours, until the horse couldn't take it anymore. He opened up his drawer, took out several bottles of pills, and choked everything down. Then he walked into a bar, ready to drown his sorrow in liquor. Suddenly, looking at the horse, the bartender says to him, ""Why the long face?""

As they rode towards Buckingham Palace, each looking to their side and waving to thousands of cheering Britons lining the streets, all was going well. This was indeed a glorious display of pageantry and dignity.

Suddenly the scene was shattered when the right rear horse let rip the most horrendous, earth-shattering, cheek-flapping, eyes-smarting blast of flatulence, and the coach immediately filled with noxious fumes.

Uncomfortable, but maintaining control, the two dignitaries did their best to ignore the whole incident, but then the Queen decided that was a most ridiculous manner with which to handle a most embarrassing situation. She turned to Mr. Putin and explained, ""President Putin, please accept my regrets. I’m sure you
understand that there are some things even a Queen

After what seems like miles, he finally reaches a booming chicken farm, with stock running around as far as the eye can see.  As the man gawks, a farmer walks up, introduces himself, and says ""Boy, how much do you know about chicken farming?""  The man replies, ""Well, nothing!  Can you teach me how you became so successful?"".  The farmer agrees.

The farmer walks up to a chicken coop, reaches in, and pulls out a chicken, then quickly stuffs it under the man's left arm.  ""Now, son, this is a pullet.  Don't let her go and she'll run off!""  

The man, clearly confused, says ""...a pullet?  No, I'm interested in raising chickens!""  

The farmer laughs, ""No, son, that's another word for a young hen.  She'll be layin' them there eggs.  You're learnin', so hang on because we're not done yet.""

The farmer sneaks up and grabs a rooster and quickly jams it under the man's right arm.  He says, ""Now, hang on to your cock or he'll run off too!""

The man gives a puzzled look to the farmer, just as he roars into laughter again.  ""Son, that's a rooster.  A rooster will breed with the hen, the hen will lay eggs, and you'll have more chickens!""  The man nods excitedly.

It's getting late, and now the man has to walk all the way back home with his two newfound friends under his arm.  He starts walking when the farmer says ""Aaaw shoot, I can't let you walk all that way!  Here, take my ass.""

The man waits for the explanation.

""My donkey, you pervert!"" the farmer laughs.  ""Jump on his back and he'll walk for days!  If he ever stops though, just give him a little scratch behind the ear and he'll get going again.  Best of luck pardner, and don't let those chickens escape on you!""

The man hops on the donkey and rides back towards town.  Just as he gets to the middle of town, the donkey stops.  He can't scratch with his left hand because he's holding the hen.  He can't scratch with his right hand because he's holding the rooster.  Visibly frustrated, the man tries desperately to get the donkey to move without drawing attention to his inexperience.

Finally, a beautiful woman walks up to him and says kindly, ""Sir, do you need some help?  You've been there for a few minutes.""  The man, clearly frustrated huffs and puffs.  Finally, he replies.

*""Ma'am, can you hold my cock and pullet while I scratch my ass?""*",A guy moves out of the city to become a chicken farmer.,6

post,6izz8u,2qh72,jokes,false,1498207414,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6izz8u/a_wish_gone_awry/,self.jokes,,"An Aussie trucker walks into an outback cafe with a full-grown emu behind him. 

The waitress asks them for their orders. 

The trucker says, 'A hamburger, chips and a coke,' and turns to the emu, 'What's yours?' 
'Sounds great, I'll have the same,' says the emu. 

A short time later the waitress returns with the order 'That will be $9.40 please,' and he reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change and pays. 

The next day, the man and the emu come again and he says, 'A hamburger, chips and a coke.' 
The emu says, ' Sounds great, I'll have the same.' 

Again the trucker reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. 

This becomes routine until the two enter again. 'The usual?' asks the waitress. 

'No, it's Friday night, so I'll have a steak, baked potato and a salad,' says the man..
'Same for me,' says the emu. 

Shortly the waitress brings the order and says, 'That will be $32.62.' 

Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. 

The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer. 'Excuse me mate, how do you manage to always pull the exact change from your pocket every time?' 

'Well, love' says the trucker, 'a few years ago, I was cleaning out the back shed, and found an old lamp. When I cleaned it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. 

My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.' 

'That's brilliant!' says the waitress. 'Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want, for as long as you live!' 

'That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there.' says the man.

Still curious the waitress asks, 'What's with the bloody emu?' 

The trucker pauses, sighs, and answers, 'My second wish was for a tall bird with a big arse and long legs who agrees with everything I say.",A wish gone awry,84

Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.

About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.

The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.

The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".

""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist.

""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.""

The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""

The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""

The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""

The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?""

The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minute of brushing each, then we decide.""

""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.
Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.""

The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.

It's unbelievable.

The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.

The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.""

The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.""",There are two identical twin brothers that live together.,224

post,6iwzbl,2qh72,jokes,false,1498169879,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/6iwzbl/green_ping_pong_ball/,self.jokes,,"These was once a girl, Sara, whos third birthday was coming up, and as this was the first time she was old enough to really understand what was happening, her parents asked her what she wanted.
  ""I want a green ping pong ball!"" Sara answered immediately and without a hint of uncertainty. The parents found this a bit peculiar but figured they might as well get one, in addition to other, more traditional presents.
  When the day came Sara was overjoyed with her green ping pong ball and only paid attention to the other presents at the insistence of her mother and father, and with obvious lack of interest at that. This trend continued the next birthday, and the one after that, and whenever anyone asked her about it she'd just give you a mysterious smile and say something along the lines of ""One day I'll tell you"".
  One year her parents tried to give Sara something else and she absolutely lost it! She spent two days locked in her room untill someone went and got her the mysteriously desired green ping pong ball, at which point she immediately cheered up and came out of her room.
  Thus her life continued; She started school, got good grades and soon enough grew in to a young woman who started to notice, and partake, in the joys of male companionship. Yet still, every year, without exception, all she wished for her birthday was that selfsame green ping pong ball. She started studying at university, where she met a man, David, who seemed good at first, but after some time together, revealed himself to be a possesive, jealous and sometimes voilent person.
  After university, while working her first real job, the sudden death of Saras mother prompted her to leave David, sell most of what she owned and spend the next few years traveling. While she was away, her family back home would set aside a green ping pong ball every year on her birthday, awaiting her return. It was during her travels that she met the man she would eventually marry, an Englishman named Paul.
  The first of Saras birthdays her and Paul spent together, on a white sand beach in Bali, he presented her with a green painted ping pong ball. He had stolen from the rec room of the hostel they were staying in and spray painted it himself. 
  Eventually, Sara and her English husband returned home and not long after, their first child was born. They had three more over the years and anyone would say that, together, they had a full, if sligtly ordinary, life together, with her children and husband giving her a green ping pong ball every year on the morning of her birthday. The kids would ask Sara about it, for the first few years, but one can only hear ""One day"" so many times before one catches on. Sara, now a middle aged woman, and Paul grew old together and saw their kids go off and start their own lives, and eventually, the first of many grandchildren was born.
  Paul died a few years after his seventieth birthday due to a drawn out battle with cancer and it nearly broke Saras will to live, had it not been for that first birthday after his death, when she heard a ring on the door, and found that he had arranged to have a green ping pong ball delivered to her every year on her birthday, along with a note of encouragement and love, but Sara was old, and it was not long before she too was in a hospital bed, requiring assistance with even the most basic of tasks. 
  On her seventyseventh birthday, the whole family had come to the hospital, four children and ten grandkids, one of whom walked up to his wrikly old grandmother and gave her the box that had come in the mail that morning. Sara was too weak to open it and one of her children had to help her. She took out the green ping pong ball, looked at it and smiled.
  ""Why do you always want a green ping pong ball, Granny?"" The youngest grandchild asked. The others in the room chuckled and shook their head at the child, for he was young and didn't yet know the futility of the question. This time, however, the old woman didn't give her usual response right away. She looked around her, all her loved ones gathered, a gentle breeze coming in through the open window and she found herself looking back at her long life; Not without hardship, but well lived, and full of love, and as a tear of joy and nostalgia rolled down her cheek, catching the afternoon sunlight, she thought ""It is time.""
  ""Well dear, the reason I always want a green ping pong ball is"" and then she died.

tl;dr: Tough shit.",Green ping pong ball.,19

Now these were no ordinary barnyard animals - for they were bestowed the miracle of Disney animal anthropomorphism - subsequently, the farmer was very happy to have these animals in his posession and the people who came afar to see them made him a very wealthy man.

One day, the farmer's child leaves his guitar outside as his mother calls him for dinner. Curiously, the gang of animals approaches the instrument. The pig picks it up and strums tentatively trying to mimic what he saw the boy doing. He finds that he is a natural and when the farmer hears - he instantly sees the business potential. 

So the very next day, the farmer buys a drum-set, bass and another guitar and hands one to each of the animals. The horse himself took a liking to guitar whilst the sheep took the drums, leaving the cow on bass guitar. By sheer narrative convenience, all the animals showed prodigious skill at their respective instruments and became proficient players very quickly. The horse, with his gravelly melancholic voice assumed the role of vocalist.

Their first gig was a roaring success and set them on the road for superstardom. It turned out that the saturated music market had a niche for a band of rock playing animals. Within weeks, they had released their first album and planned on doing a world tour. Tickets at every destination sell out almost instantly.

The first half of their tour was uneventful, however, the horse - not used to the pressures of being a celebrity- began to use alcohol as escapism. He told himself he was in control but the other bandmembers noticed his problem and grew increasingly worried for the horse. 

One fateful night, the tourbus loses control on the tarmac and slips off the road into a sharp valley - everybody is killed but the horse. He stumbles out of the wreckage and begins searching for his friends and every corpse he stumbles across breaks him even more.

The funeral was a dull affair and despite their stardom, few people turned up. The horse wept bitterly for his friends who he thought deserved a better farewell. Turning and leaving the procession, he wanders aimlessly into the city. 

Day quickly turns into night and a storm approaches. The horse hears the thunder in the distance, but he keeps walking like a man without cause. As the first drop begin to fall, the horse spies the neon lights of a bar which promise a warm refuge away from the rain and more importantly, his grief.

So, the horse walks into the bar and the bartender asks, ""Why the long face?""",Once upon a time...,250

St. Peter returns to the gate, and asks the first person in line how they died.

""I was certain my wife was cheating on me, so I came home from work early. She was obviously nervous when I arrived, so I searched the house, but to no avail. I heard a noise, and saw the man trying to escape off of my balcony! 

""I was so angry that I ran outside and pushed him off the balcony. I was certain he had died from the fall ( I live on the ninth floor) but he had survived! In my rage, i ran inside, picked up my refrigerator, and threw it on the man below, and killed him. I then had a heart attack and died.""

St. Peter had to let him through. What an interesting death! Then he asks the next person how he died.

""Well,"" he said, ""I live on the tenth floor of my building. I was on my porch, and it collapsed! Luckily the balcony below held, but as soon as i gained my senses, a man ran onto the balcony and pushed me off!

So I hid her in my attic.  

The priest replied: “That was a wonderful thing you did, and you have no need to confess that. 

“There is more to tell, Father.  She started to repay me with sexual favors.   This happened several times a week, and sometimes twice on Sundays.”

The priest said, “That was a long time ago and by doing what you did, you placed the two of you in great danger; but two people under those circumstances can easily succumb to the weakness of the flesh. 

However, if you are truly sorry for your actions, you are indeed forgiven.”

Next to the poodle is a pile of old bones and, in a moment of desperation, digs it's little furry head in the bones and starts gnawing on them. As the lion is about to pounce, the poodle picks it's head up and sighs, "" That was the best fucking lion I have ever tasted, I wonder if there are any others nearby."" Hearing this, the lion immediately retreats into the trees, scared for it's life. 

Witnessing this whole situation, a monkey sitting in the trees is howling with laughter. 

""What are you laughing about, stupid primate?"" the lion inquires.

""That little poodle tricked you, it didn't eat a fucking lion you fool!"" 
Hearing this, the lion roars, ""No one tricks me and gets away with it, hop on my back and let me show you what happens to something when they trick me.""

So the money climbs down and onto the lion's back and they run towards the poodle.

  This wood worked perfectly and it was better than the actual type. So he got extremely famous and everyone wanted to know how his newspaper looked so good. He told everyone he wouldn't tell until he was on his death bed. 
  He never went back to type even with the fame and used the old beech letters his entire career. Over time the old wood got even more rotten but the newspaper managed to never loose its quality.

Not wanting to be a jerk he says, ""You want to go out there and show them how it's really done?"" 

Smiling she agrees and they have a great time. 

After a while both of his friends took off with both of hers. Back at the table, he asks her if she's got a ride home.

She tells him, ""no but I can call someone to pick me up.""

Trying to be nice he tells her ""nonsense I'll give you a ride!""

On the ride they're laughing and getting along well and she tells him, ""I'm really enjoying spending time with you and am not ready for the night to end yet, why don't you pull over at that park and we can talk.""

They pull over and are talking for a while, when she finally kisses him.

""I'm sorry,"" she blushes, ""you're just so nice and I like you.""

""it's perfectly fine."" he smiles.

""Would you like to make love to me?"" she asks. He agrees and they start going at it, but with her  legs it's hard to do in the truck.

She thinks and says, ""My arms are pretty strong, why don't you take me to the Monkey bars, I can hang and we can do it that way.""

The following night the rabbit returns and again asks for a pint of beer and a ham and cheese toastie. The barman, now intrigued by the rabbit and the extra drinkers in the pub (because word gets round) gives the rabbit the pint and the toastie. The rabbit consumes them and leaves.

The next night, the pub is packed, in walks the rabbit and says, 'A pint of beer and a ham and cheese toastie, please barman.' The crowd is hushed as the barman gives the rabbit his pint and toastie and then burst into applause as the rabbit wolfs them down.

The next night there is standing room only in the pub, coaches have been laid on for the crowds of patrons attending, the barman is making more money in one week than he did all last year. In walks the rabbit and says, 'A pint of beer and a ham and cheese toastie, please barman' smiling and accepting the tributes of the masses. 

The barman says, 'I'm sorry rabbit, old mate, old mucker but we are right out of them ham and cheese toasties' . 

The rabbit looks aghast, the crowd has quietened to almost a whisper, when the barman clears his throat nervously and says, 'We do have a very nice Cheese and Onion Toastie.' 

The rabbit looks him in the eye and says, 'Are you sure I will like it?' 

The masses bated breath is ear shatteringly silent. The barman, with a roguish smile says, 'Do you think that I would let down one of my best friends, I know you'll love it.

'Ok, 'says the rabbit, 'I'll have a pint of beer and a cheese and onion toastie'. The pub erupts with glee as the rabbit quaffs the beer and guzzles the toastie, he then waves to the crowd and leaves....

NEVER TO RETURN

One year later in the now impoverished public house, the barman (who has only served 4 drinks tonight, 3 of which were his) calls time. When he is cleaning down the now empty bar, he sees a small white form, floating above the bar. The barman says, 'Who are you?' 

To which he is answered, 'I am the ghost of the rabbit that used to frequent your public house.' 

The barman says, 'I remember you, you made me famous, you would come in every night and have a pint of beer and a ham and cheese toastie, masses came to see you and this place was famous.'

The rabbit says, 'Yes I know.' 

The barman said, 'I remember, on your last night we didn't have any ham and cheese toasties, you had a cheese and onion one instead.'

The rabbit said, 'Yes, you promised me that I would love it' .

He looks into a garden and sees a man in a suit crying and looking at the pool.

The man in suit fills his pockets with rocks and suddenly jumps into the pool still crying. The homeless man wasted no time in jumping in to drag the other man out of the water.

After the suited man took a moment to process what was happening (and what he was doing) he started to thank the homeless man profusely and asked if there was any way he could repay the homeless man for his kindness.

""What was I thinking!"" the man in suit said, ""Please good sir, if there I must repay you for what you have done for me, money is no option have anything you want."" ""I don't need money."" the homeless man replied. ""I would like a job if there is anyway you can arrange that.

The Suited man was taken aback by the request but complied saying that the homeless man can work on one of the commercial cruise ships his company owns.

A few weeks later the captain of said ship was inspecting his new subordinate and was disgusted... ""We can't have a homeless man running around on this ship, it will put off the guests... you can be a janitor if you promise to only leave your employee cabin to work at night when the guests are asleep.""

The homeless man was not phased by the comments of the captain and got to work as a night janitor on the ship.

One night the homeless man finished early and decided to swim in the pool whilst no one was around.

Unfortunately the first hand came on deck just as the homeless man began to dive into the pool however instead of being outraged he was amazed at the perfect dive the homeless man pulled off.

The first mate insisted he do it again for the captain and after being shown the skill of this homeless man the captain was amazed. He insisted that the homeless man put on diving shows for the customers.

Weeks later the homeless man was about to attempt the tallest dive possible for his newly gained fans. The diving board was set up specially and it extended impossibly high into the sky.

The man began climbing and climbing. Hours passed before he reached the top of the board. He looked below and was unphased, with a couple of stretches he dove aiming for the pool below. Down, down and down he went picking up speed until he hit terminal velocity on his dive. he hit the water and sliced right through it to the bottom of the pool.

He didn't stop though, smashing through the bottom of the pool and through each of the 30 decks below until he broke right through to the open ocean.

Commotion broke out on the ship ""MAN OVERBOARD"" People were shouting and shuffling to through life preservers to the homeless man.

He caught a preserver and was hoisted up onto the ship again.

""Remarkable!"" the captain said now inspecting the man, ""Smashed all the way through the ship and not a scratch on you... how is such a thing possible!""

The second officer who accepted was a little smarter and asked to be measured from the tip of his outstretched hands to his toes. He walked out with $96,000.

The third one was a grisly old Chief who, when asked where he would like to be measured replied, ""from the tip of my weenie to my testicles.""

""Your mother is always alone after your pops died, would you want your children to treat you the same way?""

He eventually gives in ""Allright allright, ill ask her"", and goes on to call his mother.

""Mom, Sarah and I are going to the beach with the kids, you should come with us.""

""Me? to the beach? I cant go the beach, I don't have a bathing suit.""

""Well go get a bathing suit then.""

""At my age? I've only got a few years left till I'm dead, it would be a waste to buy a new bathing suit now.""

""Mom! just go buy a bathing suit, I don't have time for this right now.""

""Allright allright! I'll get a bathing suit, such a temper young man, you are just like your father.""

The old woman goes to a sporting goods store to buy a new bathing suit but all the bathing suits are very expensive in her opinion. She looks and looks for the least expensive bathing suit and finally she finds a discount bin with bathing suits for only 5$ each.
""Do you have one of these in my size?"" she asks a nearby female employee.

""Well yes probably but.. these are g-strings, they are very revealing.""

The old woman grabs one of the suits and notices that the bottoms have a lace-thin string. She holds it up in amazement.

""People wear these?""

""Well yes.. a lot people do. Personally I would not wear one of these, but I'm very self conscious."" The young female replies.

""I can see why they are cheap, there is hardly any fabric! O, well. I will only be on this earth for a few more years. This will do for a few years, ill take one.""

The old woman goes home, changes into her new bathing suit and gets on the bus to meet her son and his family on the beach. As she rides the bus she notices people giving her strange looks. It crosses her mind that perhaps she should have spent money on a proper bathing suit. But then again, the lady at the store said a lot of people wear these, why cant she?

As she arrives at the beach she notices even more strange looks. She see's her son and his family who are already set up at the beach. She starts walking towards them and as they notice her walking they all look up wide eyed. Her son turns away and covers his eyes.

""Mom!, What are you wearing!? What on earth are you wearing!?"" He exclaims.

""What is the matter with you, cant I wear a modern bathing suit? The girl at the store said a lot of people wear these. You are such a chauvinist! Just like your father!""

The old woman is a little surprised that her son would be so distraught about the bathing suit and in an attempt to further explain she also adds:

""Besides.. these were the only ones on sale at the store!""

As her son stands grunting, her 12 year old granddaughter runs up and whispers loudly at the old woman.

""Grandma! The string is supposed to go in the back!""",A young jewish man was going to the beach with his wife and kids.,4

As they are heading to the blackjack table they see a large crowd around a roulette table, the gambler asks a crowd member what's going on and they explain that black has been hit 24 times in a row, the gambler quickly scrambles to the front and makes a huge bet on red, telling his friends that red is ""due"". The mathematician explains the roulette table doesn't have memory and that past results don't effect future ones, not only that, 24 of the same colour in a row is only a 1 in 30 million chance which seems unlikely but when one thinks about how many games of roulette around the world are played on a regular basis it's very likely to occur somewhere.

Sure enough, the result is black again and the gambler breaks down into tears, as he was already broke to begin with. His friend the engineer pats him on the shoulder and passes him enough chips to double what he just lost and explains he just won way more from a big bet on black.

The mathematician asks why on earth would he bet on roulette when the house has a large advantage.

Suddenly, their plane developed engine problems and they were forced to make a crash landing. After the crash, they gathered all the supplies they could carry and set off through the jungle towards the last town they flew over.

When the men reached the town, it was nearly dark out. They instantly realized something was wrong. There were no modern buildings or vehicles. The only light came from scattered torches and fires. The most disturbing thing about the town was the lack of people... 

Until they noticed the heads decorating the huts. On every hut hung 4-5 severed heads, faces contorted in eternal agony. Only then did the men realize they'd stumbled into a town of cannibals.

They began discussing what they should do, when out of the bushes sprang the cannibals. Dozens of savages, each with strange weapons and gruesome masks.!The men were terrified!

Once the men were bound, they were brought before the Chief of the Cannibals. The Chief, who spoke passable English, informed the men of their fate:

""For violating our sacred mother jungle and trespassing in our village, you should be killed instantly! But we aren't mindless savages, as the outside world would have you believe. You will be given a choice: You can face our most feared warrior one-on-one... If you defeat him, you will be taken back to civilization. The second choice is to be killed in the manner of the others!""

The Chief waved a hand in the direction of the decapitated heads...

The first man stepped forward and said, ""I will fight!""  Immediately, the cannibals started chanting... ""Oogah Boogah! Oogah Boogah!""

A giant cannibal emerged from the largest hut in the village. The savage, whose name was Oogah Boogah, stood over 9 feet tall and was 453lbs. of pure muscle. With fire in his eyes, he stomped over to the first man and began beating.

The fight lasted less than 5 minutes. It ended with Oogah Boogah, who was quite aroused by the violence, having his way with the first man until he died. The second man was horrified!

After the cheering died down, the Chief turned to the second man and asked for his choice.  Without any delay, the man responded, ""Death! I choose death!"" The Chief smiled broadly and held out his arms.

The cannibals began chanting, ""Death by Oogah Boogah! Death by Oogah Boogah!""

The teacher was clearly annoyed by the cheeky reply and decided to make sure to do everything in his power to fail the student in his exams.
 
In the oral exam, he gave the student the hardest questions, but the student had incredible answers for everything. Therefore, hoping he could still fail his victim, the teacher asked him a trickier question:
 
“You're walking on a road and you find two bags. One contains gold, the other cleverness. Which bag do you choose?”
 
“The gold.” 
 
“I don't agree. I would choose cleverness, because that's more important than money.”
 
“Everyone would choose what they don't have” says the student.
 
The teacher turns red, and he is so outraged he writes ""ass"" on the student's paper. The student leaves without looking at the paper. However, he returns shortly, gives back his paper and says:
 
“Excuse me sir, you did sign my paper, but you forgot to give my grade!”

However in doing so, the motorbike crashed into a ditch on the side of the road and Mick was flung off the back of the bike and head first into a nearby tree. 

Adam was shaken up by the crash but quickly came to his senses and attended his mate Mick, who was lying unconscious under the tree.

Adam (panicked voice): ""umm..yeah..I was just in an accident...ahhhhh..my friend Mick flew of the back of my bike..ahh and he hit a tree...his head..his head is barely attached to his neck..please help!""

Adam: ""Umm..yeah yeah..I can do that..""

And he hangs up the phone. 

Adam looks towards Mick and repeats what the Operator said to him. ""Okay, just stay calm and support Mick's head, just support his head""

As I sat out and dried, I watched deer come and drink from the stream. The wildflowers were filled with butterflies and hawks floated all day overhead.

I cut the ropes off, gently lifted her off the tracks, and I had Sex with her in every imaginable way all afternoon. Finally, when I was so tired I could barely move, I came back to camp.” “Wow!!” the first guy exclaimed, “Your day was MUCH better than mine.

Providing you do that, you'll be fine.""

The jockey thinks the trainer is mad but promises to shout the command. The race begins and they approach the first hurdle. The jockey ignores the trainer's ridiculous advice and the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.

They carry on and approach the second hurdle. The jockey, somewhat embarrassed, whispers ""Aleeee ooop"" in the horse's ear. The same thing happens - the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.

At the third hurdle, the jockey thinks, ""It's no good, I'll have to do it,"" and yells, ""ALLLEEE OOOP!"" really loudly. Sure enough, the horse sails over the jump with no problems. This continues for the rest of the race, but due to the earlier problems the horse only finishes third.

The trainer is fuming and asks the jockey what went wrong. The jockey replies, ""Nothing is wrong with me - it's this bloody horse. What is he - deaf or something?""

The trainer replies, ""Deaf? Deaf?! He's not deaf. He's blind!""",[Long] The Jockey and the Horse,9

She left a note for her milkman to leave 25 gallons of milk.

When the milkman read the note, he felt there must be a mistake. He thought she probably meant 2.5 gallons.

So he knocked on the door to clarify the point.

The blonde came to the door and the milkman said, ""I found your
note asking me to leave 25 gallons of milk.

Did you mean 2.5 gallons?""

The blonde said,
""No, I want 25 gallons. I'm going to fill my bathtub up with milk and take a milk bath so I can look young and beautiful again.""

The milkman asked, ""Do you want it pasteurized?""


Wait for it
The blonde said,

""No, just up to my tits ...

I can splash it on my eyes if I need to!""",Milk Bath,7

""Little boy, what's wrong?"" the man asks

But the little boy can't even respond, and cries out even louder. 


Walking closer, the man asks again, ""little boy, what's wrong?!""


Summoning all of his strength and courage, the boy lifts his quivering finger and points towards the edge of the clearing. 


The man walks over to find a sudden dropoff of about 100 feet, and at the bottom, two bodies. 

""Oh no. Little boy, were those your parents?""


The little boy, sobbing even louder, nods.
