St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.

The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.

'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'

'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'

St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.

There, in the corner, there’s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.

So the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”

And the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”

So the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.

So the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”

And the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

So the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”

And the guy’s, like, “World peace.”

So the bartender is understandably ashamed.

And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.

And the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”

And the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”

But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”

And the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”

And the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”

And the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”

So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.

And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”

And the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”

And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”

And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”

And then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”

And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!

And the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”

And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”

And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”

And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”

And the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.

And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.

And the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”

And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”

And the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”

And he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.

And suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.

And the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”

And the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”

And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”

And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.

So the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.

So the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”

And the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.

And the guy’s, like, “Well done.”

And then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.”

And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.

And the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”

And the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.”",Have you heard the one about the 12 inch pianist?,17

She loved them but unfortunately, they had always had a very embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her. Then one day she met a man and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry she thought to herself, He is such a sweet and gentle man, he would never go for this carrying on. So she made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans.

Some months later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way, she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home. So, she stopped at the diner and before she knew it, she had consumed three large orders baked beans. All the way home she putt-putted, and upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it.

Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly, “Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight.” He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table. She seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from his wife, the telephone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned. He then went to answer the telephone. The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted her weight to one leg and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of pulpwood mill. She took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then, she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cooked cabbage.

Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the telephone farewells signaled the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with her napkin placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself.

She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned, apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked, and she assured him that she had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold only for her to find her family and friends sitting around the table to wish her and her husband a happy anniversary.",the lady who loved baked beans,586

St. Peter checks his book, ""Hmm I can't see you being listed here among the approved clientele, I better check with the boss"" And then dials in number 1 on the big phone. 

""Hey Boss, the pope is here and wants to enter, do you know anything about that?"" 

""I'm a bit busy right now on this really ambitious project, can't you figure this out with someone else?"" **click**

""*Hmm, I better call Jesus then*"" St. Peter thinks and dials in number 2.

""I've told you a million times I don't want to get disturbed this early in the morning!!"" **SLAM**

St. Peter is getting a bit flustered now, and as a last resort he decides to call the Holy Ghost, and dials in number 3.

The moving walkway motor jammed, so he unjams it. People can get from place to place more easily.

The TV was grainy and unclear, so he fixes the connection to the Satellite dish and now they get hundreds of high def channels.

One day, God decides to look down on Hell to see how his grand design is working out and notices that everyone is happy and enjoying umbrella drinks. He asks the Devil what's going on?

The Devil replies, ""things are great down here since you sent us that engineer.""

""What?? An engineer? I didn't send you one of those, that must have been a mistake. Send him back up right this minute.""
The Devil responds, ""no, he's really made Hell nice.""
God demands, ""if you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue!""
The Devil laughs, ""who has all the lawyers?""

She told John that the chief will tell them to grab three fruits of the same kind, and when he says so, John must grab the smallest fruits he could find.

On the next day, the chief demands Ben, John, and Jerry to bring fruits in an hour. While looking for the smallest fruits possible, John finds a handful of cherries, and picks three. When John arrived he saw Ben with three apples. Jerry was yet to be seen.

Now the chief said, ""Pull down your pants and do not make a single sound when I shove these fruits up your butt. If you make no sound, I'll set you free."" Obviously, Ben screamed in pain after the first apple, and is sent to wait next to a fireplace. John makes no sound at all during the test, yet when the chief shoved the 3rd cherry, John bursts into laughter, and is sent next to the fireplace Ben, surprised that he laughed, asked John why.

A poor old lady was sitting alone, except for her cat, in her tiny house, in front of a small fire. Suddenly, there was a flash of light, and the old woman's good fairy appeared in the room.
The old woman was astonished, but the fairy reassured her: ""Don't be afraid! I am your good fairy. You are very poor, and all alone at Christmas, so I have come to grant you three wishes, to cheer you up.""
The old woman was about to speak, but the fairy held up her hand. ""Wait!"" she said. ""Before you make a wish, think carefully! You will get exactly what you wish for, and no wish can be undone!""
So the old woman sat silently, staring at the fire and thinking. Eventually, she spoke: ""First"", she said, ""I want to be very, very wealthy.""
Poof! Immediately, the tiny house was packed with pots full of gold coins, and sacks of bank-notes. There was more money than anyone could spend in an entire lifetime.
The old woman looked around and smiled. She thought some more, and spoke again: ""Next"", she said, ""I want to be young and beautiful again, like I was when I was 18.""
Poof! The old woman disappeared. In her place sat a beautiful young woman, with smooth, white skin and long, golden hair. The woman looked at her hands and arms, felt her hair, and smiled.
""Third"", she said to the fairy, ""I want you to change my cat into a handsome young prince, who will love me and take care of me all my life!""
Poof! The fairy disappeared, and the cat leapt up from his place by the fire as a handsome young prince. He reached out to the woman, pulled her to her feet, embraced her, and kissed her passionately. Then he gazed into her eyes and said: ""Hah! Now you're really going to be sorry that you took me to the vet!""",Merry Christmas,0

He was hoping he could get a special rooster - one that would service all of his many hens. 

When he told this to the market vendor, the vendor replied, ""I have just the rooster for you. 

Henry here is the horniest rooster you will ever see!"" 

So the farmer took Henry back to the farm. 

Before setting him loose in the hen house though, he gave Henry a little pep talk. 

""Henry"", he said, ""I'm counting on you to do your stuff."" 

And without a word, Henry then strutted into the hen house. 

Henry was as fast as he was furious, mounting each hen like a thunderbolt. 

There was much squawking and many feathers flying, till Henry had finished having his way with each hen. 

But Henry didn't stop there, he went in to the barn and mounted all the horses, one by one and still at the same frantic pace.

Then he went to the pig house where he did the same. 

The farmer, watching all of this with disbelief, cried out, ""Stop, Henry, you'll kill yourself."" 

But Henry continued, seeking out each farm animal in the same manner. 

Well, the next morning, the farmer looked out and saw Henry lying there on his lawn.

His legs were up in the air, his eyes rolled back, and his long tongue hanging out.

A buzzard was already circling above Henry. 

The farmer walked up to Henry saying, ""Oh you poor thing, look what you did, you've gone and killed yourself. I warned you big buddy."" 

""Shhhhh,"" Henry whispered, ""The buzzard is getting closer.""

As his final wish, he asks them to seek an old friend of his, who is now a judge in the big city. 

""He is a fair man. Ask him to help you sort this out"" says the farmer, just before passing away.

Next week, three brothers get on their way down to the big city. As they climb down the mountain, a shepherd interrupts their journey:

""Good day folks. I seem to have lost a calf from my herd. Have you seen it, by chance?""

The eldest son asks: ""Was its left eye blind?""

""Yes!"", the shepherd beams. 

The middle brother asks, ""Was its right leg hurt?"" 

""Yes, it was!"", says the shepherd, eagerly waiting for them to point the way.

The youngest brother raises his arm: ""Was it this high?""

""That's the one!"" says the shepherd.

""We haven't seen your calf"" says the eldest brother.

Infuriated, the shepherd accuses them of stealing his calf.

""Well"", says the youngest brother, ""Why don't you come along with us? We just happen to be on our ways to see a judge. He could help us resolve this"" The shepherd agrees and tags long with them. 

The judge welcomes them all in his home and says he's sorry about his old friend's death. 

Before they can talk about their father's final request, the shepherd insists that they tell him where his calf his and quickly tells the judge what happened. The judge asks the brothers how they know what they know.

The eldest son says, ""Too easy, sir. I saw bushes on either sides of the road. Only the ones on the right side were eaten.""

The middle brother chimes in, ""And I've noticed the tracks on the ground. One in every four was different than the others.""

The youngest brother says, ""I saw dungs on our way here. Based on the color and the frequency, I surmised its age and size, by and large.""

The shepherd listens to them in awe and quickly leaves the judge's home after apologizing to them several times.

The judge, also impressed, hesitates about meddling with the affairs of such brilliant young men. Do they even need his help? 

He decides that he should know them better. So he asks them to stay for dinner. Wayworn brothers gratefully accept.

During the dinner, the judge excuses himself from the table and leaves the room. He begins to eavsdrop to their conversations outside the door.

""This lamb is delicious"", says the eldest brother. ""Too bad it was nursed by a dog."" Others nod in agreement.

""The wine tastes alright"" says the middle brother. ""Too bad it's coming from a graveyard."" Others nod in agreement.

""The judge seems like a nice guy"" says the youngest brother. ""Too bad he is such a fag"" Again, others nod in agreement.

The judge can't believe what he just heard. He immediately calls the butcher's and asks about the lamb. The butcher confirms that the lamb was nursed by a dog after its mother died.

In utter disbelief, he calls the wine shop this time. The wine seller almost ashamedly admits that there are several graves where his supplier grows the grapes.

The judge, a happily married man with two kids, takes a deep long breath and calls his mother this time. ""Mom, do you remember... anything unusual, you know, about my early years?""

The old woman, with a trembling voice, begins to tell how he was kidnapped and raped when he was just 5.

The judge hangs up the phone and enters back in the room. He tells them what happened and demands to know how the hell they knew all that.

""How else?"", says the eldest brother, ""Lambs don't usually have so much fat on their legs. It was obviously nursed by a different species.""

""How else"", says the younger brother. ""The wine tastes strong and almost rusty. You can't find any other place around here with such soil"", he explains.

""How else"", says the youngest brother. ""You have a fucking poster of Justin Bieber on the wall!""","This is a long one, brace yourselves...",30

""We can't stand the sight of each other any longer,"" the old dad explained. ""We're sick of each other, and I'm sick of talking about this, so you call your sister in Hong Kong and tell her!"".
Frantic, the son calls his sister, who explodes on the phone.
""Like heck they're getting divorced,"" she shouts, ""I'll take care of this.""
She calls her elderly father immediately, and screams at him, ""You are not getting divorced. Don't do a single thing until I get there. I'm calling my brother back, and we'll both be there tomorrow. Until then, don't do a thing, you hear me?"" she yelled as she hung up the phone.

I'm not much of a joke person. I never know any, and I don't even really enjoy them. Sorry.

But I have this (Welsh) friend see, who loves them - and it's become tradition that in between beers, he tells joke after joke while giving me a hard time about not knowing any. We don't meet often, what with living countries apart, but meeting time is approaching rapidly... and hopefully, that's where you come in.

He's Welsh, and mildly annoyed at sheep jokes - just like I'm mildly annoyed at the quantity of jokes.
So, this year (or well, technically next year) I'd like to give him some tit-for-tat.
If I could counter any joke he tells me with a sheep-joke; I get to win.

The first and foremost thing to take into account to properly begin the proof is the number of children Santa Claus must visit each Christmas. There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist (except maybe in Japan) and other non-Christian religions, this reduces his customer base by 85%, or 378 million (according to the Population Reference Bureau). At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, presuming there is at least one good child in each, that comes to 108 million homes.


Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the Earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 household visits per second.


This is to say that for each house, Santa has a bit more than 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and arrive at the next house.


Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the Earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are now talking about 0.78 miles between households – a total trip of 75.5 million miles (not counting bathroom stops or breaks). This means Santa’s sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, or 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run 15 miles an hour at best.


The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element to our calculations. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a two pound Lego set (medium sized), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons (not counting Santa himself, who is, by reputation, rather plump). On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that a “flying” reindeer could pull ten times this amount, the job couldn’t be done with eight or even nine of them: Santa would need 360,000 reindeer. This increases the payload, not counting the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch).


600,000 tons travelling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance. This would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would each absorb 14.3 quintillion (14,300,000,000,000,000,000) joules of energy per second. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second. This would be right about the same time Santa reached the fifth house on his trip.


Not that that matters, though, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to acceleration forces of 17,500 g’s. A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo.


Therefore: If Santa ever did exist, he’s dead now.

As a German tourist, who doesn't travel much, I was amazed that you could see so many celebrities there. I didn't want to be annyoing and didn't bother them and I was distracted that every courner I turned I saw another one.
Well anyway, so I was going to one of those barber shops in a side street and who did I meet there? Just one of my favourite actors of all time - Brendan Fraser. I was a bit distraught seeing him with deep eye bags and red eyes and discolored, straw-like hair, but hey I thought, I saw enough pictures of celbrities without makeup, maybe he had a rough night, probably busy with work.
Brendan mumbled something to the barber. The barber, a souther european looking fella with a big black mustache just shook his head. He replied to Brendan: ""Come back when you have some money"". Brendan moaned depressingly and got louder: ""How do you think, sir, I am going to get money, if my bitch of my wife JUST takes it from me?"" The barber replied: ""Surely, you still can get an acting role, right? With that Brendan screamed on the top of his lungs, flung up from the chair. He took the scissors away from the barber, pushed him back and in a type of demonic rage just started to cut at his hair.
He absolutely fucked his own shit up, screaming and crying like a child throwing a fit. Suddenly he screamed in pain as he accidently deeply cut into his skin. Blood and tears drippling down his face.
The barber threw him out, Brendan collapsed into a puddle.

He quickly noticed that at the edge of the bar, near the beer taps, there was a jar full of fifty and one-hundred dollar bills. One day after work, the fella finally asked the bartender why there was a jar of money sitting on the bar. The bartender told him that it was for an extremely tough challenge and that if the fella were to complete the challenge, he would win all of the money in the jar. ""Buy in is one-hundred dollars,"" the bartender explained. Drunk, the fella decided to buy-in and asked the bartender what the challenge was. ""See my security guard outside?"" said the bartender, pointing to an extremely large, well-built, machine of a man. ""You need to knock him out. After that, go out the back of the bar. My dog has an abscess tooth and I just can't afford to get it pulled for him. You need to pull it."" The fella began to wonder if he could do all of this. ""Finally,"" the bartender concluded, ""you need to go to the second floor of this bar where I live. My grandmother is living with me and she is very, very old. I want you to go an have sex with her. I mean really give it to her. It's been a while and I want her to go out happy."" The fella was taken aback but having already bought in, decided to follow through...

""Bouncer,"" said the fella, pointing to the front door. The fella stumbled to the door slamming it behind him. A loud racket occurred. The door opened and the fella, drunk, bloody and bruised, came back inside, the bouncer's head on the ground just in view through the door. 
""Dog,"" the fella announced, shuffling to the back door of the bar. After a few minutes, the dog began howling. Shortly after, the howling subsided and the fella walked back into the bar. ""O-urrp-kay,"" the fella belched, ""now where is the grandma with the abscess tooth?",How to win the entire jar of money.,2

My sister and I were recently headed out to the grocery store, and since our state has a bag tax, we were carrying bags with us.  On the way to the store, we passed by an American Apparel. There were signs plastered all over the wall about mannequin sales, as the store was closing and had gotten rid of all of its clothing, left with only mannequins to sell.  We were passing by, and my sister just looked at me and said, ""We should totally buy a mannequin.""

I'm like, ""No, I'm not wasting my money on a mannequin, and I don't want to carry a mannequin home.""

She responded with, ""Well, we don't have to buy a whole mannequin, we could just buy a leg or something.""

I said, ""What would you do with a mannequin leg?""

""Serve dinner on it!""

We look at each other, and go into the store searching for the cheapest mannequin part available.

I paid ten bucks.  She walked out with a mannequin butt.

We're walking down the street, in the middle of downtown trying not to attract attention, but my sister was only able to hold the butt between the legs and she was just getting awkward stares.  So, she tried to fit the butt into her bag, but it's kind of difficult with her hands full.  She asked me to help, and I held the bag open for her as she shoved the butt in it.

She paused, looked up at me and said,
