The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

He comes across a fish monger who has a large and glorious looking fish for sale. He asks the fish monger ""My child, is this a high quality fish? I would like to buy it for dinner"".

The fish monger says ""Of course! It's the best sonuvabitch I ever caught!""  He hesitates and back tracks after seeing the priest's reaction to profanity and quickly lies.  ""No offense meant, Father.  That's just the type of fish it is.  It's a Sonuvabitch.""
The priest falls for the lie and buys the fish.  He takes it back to the parish and tells the alter boy to ""Clean and prepare the Sonuvabitch, then give him to the nun to cook for the Pope.""

The alter boy is shocked that the priest would swear, so the priest explains it was the type of fish and the alter boy understands and goes on his way.

After the fish is cleaned and prepared, the alter boy takes the fish to the Nun and says ""The Father asks for you to cook this Sonuvabitch tonight for the Pope."" The nun smacks him with a ruler and tells him to do a Hail Mary, but then the alter boy explains that he was told that's what the fish was called.  The nun apologizes for the smack and takes the fish to cook it into the best meal she's ever made.

So the Pope arrives around 6pm and dinner is at 7.  The priest, alter boy, and nun are extremely excited to meet the Pope and tell them how they made the meal he seems to really be enjoying.  At the end of the dinner, they approach him.

The Pope says ""I adored the meal, the fish was an utter delight.  Thank you for all of your efforts.""

The priest ""You're welcome, your Holiness.  I bought the Sonuvabitch.""

The Bartender sees such a vivid depth
of despair and ennui in the Horse's eyes,
like the Horse has stared into the abyss
and found the infinite void of nothingness so deep
that the Horse could no longer believe
that he himself nor anyone nor anything else existed.
To say something exists requires knowledge of self,
which requires knowledge of existence of the self, 
an obviously impossible leap of logic,
absurd to even attempt to conceive or contemplate.
The Bartender,
in that single instant within the Horse's mind,
became the nothingness the Horse perceived, 
and thus was rendered speechless.
If neither the Horse,
nor the Bartender,
nor the bar itself can be said to exist,
then why should he ask,
how could he ask,
""why the long face?""
The question can have no meaning,
and that which has no meaning cannot be stated.
The Bartender, dumbstruck, not by realization of mortality
but by fundamental doubt that he was ever alive,
gazes into the endless depth of the Horse's eyes,
and asks him, ""Sir, I beg you say, do I exist?""
The Horse replies,

I could sink into the ground out of shame and she clearly saw I was embarrassed and tried to ease me down with the kind words ""Hey, don't worry about it, you can't help it. It is only nature.""

Two good friends, an elephant and a mouse, were walking through the jungles of Africa. Both minding their own business going down the path.

The elephant trips and falls into a huge hole and starts screaming, ""Save me, save me!""

The mouse says, ""Wtf do you expect me... Wait, wait... I got an idea."" 

The mouse runs home, goes into his garage and gets out his Mercedes Benz. He then drives to the hardware store, buys some rope and puts the rope in the back of Mercedes Benz. 

The mouse drives back to the hole shouts down to the elephant, ""Listen, I'm gonna tie this end of the rope to the back of my Mercedes Benz, and you tie the other end to your snout. So that way when we pull out, you'll be saved.""

The plan worked.

A couple of days later, the elephant and the mouse were walking through the jungles of Africa again. Still minding their own business going down the path.

This time, the mouse trips and falls into the same hole and screams, ""Save me, save me!"" 

The elephant whips out his dick, drops it in the hole and tells the mouse, ""Run up my dick, and you'll be saved."" ...and of course the plan worked.

...and do you know what the moral of this story is?

If you got a big dick, you don't need a Mercedes Benz.

""Hello, how are you? My name's John."" The woman blinked and replied,

""And my name is Alice. As you can probably tell, I can't move much. I'm a quadrapelgic.""

The man, not thinking any less of her because of her condition, continued conversing with her and found out that they had quite a bit in common and that they had amazing chemistry. The man was extremely shy however, and though he was very attracted to her and wanted to ask her on a date, he couldn't bring himself to. So he just stuck to dropping many subtle, and a few obvious hints.

The woman was very much into the man also, and easily picked up on the hints he was dropping. After a while, she began to wonder if the man would ever work up the courage to say how he truly felt rather than keep dropping hints. Very curious and slightly impatient, she finally asked him.

""Do you find me attractive? Am I interesting and beautiful to you?"" The man stammered for a few moments and then cleared his throat.

""Yes, yes I do.""

Smiling, the woman asked, ""Why didn't you say so earlier instead of dropping all those hints?"" Embarassed, the man simply replied:

""I was waiting for you to make the first move.""

It was so bad that he never was deathly afraid of being alone with a girl.  Finally he found a nice girl that he was going to get married to.  He tells his friend his predicament, and his friend says that since he's been married a few years, they'll do a dual ceremony, where the shy guy will get married and the other guy is going to renew his vows.  They also get hotel rooms right next to each other.  The friend says if the shy guy needs any ""help"" during the wedding night to just knock on the wall.

Finally the wedding day comes.  Each couple goes to their hotel rooms.  The shy guy is in the hotel room with his new bride.  She goes to the bathroom to slip into something more comfortable.  Then he goes to the bathroom to get ready.  During this time, the bride gets a feeling that she has to go to the bathroom to do her business.  She doesn't want to go back into the bathroom and ruin the moment after she's already ""dressed"" for the night.  So she finds a small box in the room and does her business there.  She goes to slide it under the bed but accidentally slides it too far since she slides it right as the shy guy is coming out of the bathroom.  It goes under the bed and slides out the other side.  They turn the lights off and are about to head into bed.  He walks to the other side to get to his side of the bed, but in the darkness he accidentally steps in the box.  He screams out, ""This box is full of shit!""  The friend in the other hotel room then starts hitting the wall and screams back ""Turn her over...Turn her over!""",This guy had crippling anxiety.,1

post,4w7i6s,2qh72,jokes,false,1470353591,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4w7i6s/use_your_lifeline/,self.jokes,,"A contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? had reached the final plateau. And as she suspected it would be, the million-dollar question was no pushover. It was, ""Which of the following species of birds does not build its own nest, but instead lays its eggs in the nests of other birds? Is it A) the condor; B) the buzzard; C) the cuckoo; or D) the vulture?"" 

She did not know the answer. And she was doubly on the spot because she had used up her 50/50 Lifeline and her Audience Poll Lifeline. All that remained was her Phone-a-Friend Lifeline, and the woman had hoped against hope that she would not have to use it. Mainly because the only friend that she knew would be home happened to be a blonde. 

But the contestant had no alternative. She called her friend and gave her the question and the four choices. The blonde responded unhesitatingly: ""That's easy. The answer is 'C' -- the cuckoo.""

The contestant had to make a decision and make it fast. She considered employing a reverse strategy and giving Regis any answer except the one that her friend had given her. And considering that her friend was a blonde, that would seem to be the logical thing to do. 

On the other hand, the blonde had responded with such confidence, such certitude, that the contestant could not help but be persuaded. 

Time was up. ""I need an answer,"" said Regis. 

Crossing her fingers, the contestant said, ""C) the cuckoo."" 

""Is that your final answer?"" asked Regis. 

""Yes, that is my final answer,"" she said, breaking into a sweat. 

After the usual foot-dragging delay Regis said, ""I regret to inform you that that answer is ... absolutely correct. You are now a millionaire!"" 

Three days later, the contestant hosted a party for her family and friends, including the blonde who had helped her win the million dollars. 

""Jenny, I just do not know how to thank you,"" said the contestant. ""Because of your knowing the answer to that final question, I am now a millionaire. And do you want to know something? It was the assuredness with which you answered the question that convinced me to go with your choice."" 

""You're welcome!"" the blonde said. 

""By the way,"" the winner said, not being able to contain the question anymore. ""How did you happen to know the right answer?"" 

""Oh, come on,"" said the blonde. ""Everybody knows that cuckoos don't build nests. They live in clocks.""

Well, one Thursday, she’s playing a great game and she has an incredible hand when she notices the time. “Oh, no! I have to go fix my husband his dinner! He’s going to be so angry if it’s not ready on time.” And she dashes out of her friend’s house, her great hand forgotten on the table.
When she gets home, she realizes she has very little time--not enough time to go to the supermarket--and all she has in the cupboard is a wilted lettuce leaf, an egg, and a can of cat food. In a panic, she opens the can of cat food, stirs in the egg, and garnishes it with the lettuce leaf just as her husband is pulling up. She watches in horror as he sits down to his dinner, and then she realizes he is loving it!

“Mmmm, darling, this is the best dinner you have made for me in forty years of marriage. You can make this for me any old day, mmmmm!” And that night they had sex for the first time in months and it was great!

Needless to say, every Thursday from then on, she made this dinner for her husband. She tells her bridge cronies about it and they are all horrified.

“You’re going to kill him,” they say, or, “He’s just yanking your chain,” but she continued to make him his cat food dinner and then, afterwards, they would bonk like fiends.

Two months later, her husband died and all the bridge women the Thursday after the funeral attacked our new widow for being so callous. “You killed him!

“We told you that feeding him that cat food every week would do him in! How can you just sit there so calmly and play bridge knowing you murdered your husband?”

The wife stoically replied, “I didn’t kill him. He fell off the mantle when he was licking his balls.” ",A woman has her bridge club every Thursday night...,1

post,4w5o5x,2qh72,jokes,false,1470331500,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4w5o5x/the_monastery/,self.jokes,,"An old monk is recounting his life to his nieces and nephews who lived in a small, rural town. The area around was hilly, and at the bottom of a nearby valley, there was a large, ornate monastery.

""Uncle, why did you become a monk?"" the youngest asked

""One day, I was riding my bicycle home from school, and passed through the valley. I picked up too much speed, and lost control  just outside of the monastery. I broke my arm, the bone protruding through the skin. I began to cry, and a monk emerged from the monastery to bring me inside.

'I want to go to the hospital' I said

The monk replied 'There is no need. It is getting dark and we are trained in the secret healing arts of our order. We will send word to your parents and you will stay the night with us.'

During that night, I awoke to a strange, ethereal sound coming from somewhere in the monastery. I thought it was a dream, and went back to sleep. In the morning, my arm was completely healed. I asked the monk from the night before what made the sound. The monk responded:

'I cannot tell you, you are not a monk.'

Years later, just after high school, I was riding a motorcycle down the same valley. A passing car came too close and clipped me, sending me flying into the ditch. I passed out from the pain of my injuries, I couldn't breathe and thought I was going to die. As my vision faded, I saw a monk running towards me.

I woke up that night, sore, but alive - to the same sound as before. Naturally, I picked myself up - it seemed impossible but I grew stronger and more resilient every time I heard that sound. The sound grew slightly louder, and I followed it to an old door in the basement of the monastery. I pressed my ear against it. The sound was coming from within, but still distant even though I seemed so close.

'You need a key'

I jumped. I asked the monk who had appeared behind me, again, what was making the sound. He simply replied:

'I cannot tell you, you are not a monk'

I simply had to find out. I asked how to become a monk. I was told it meant I could not marry, or have children, and it would take years of study, some in silence, and I would live a pious life in peace if I were to become part of their order. I agreed. I spent years in silence, years copying texts, making wine. I paid my dues. I spent half my life learning to become part of the Order. One day they said I was ready. I was taken to the door and given a ring of keys.

The simple iron key fit into the lock on the wooden door. Behind the door was a path, leading down into the earth, like a tunnel. it was made of stone. As I made my way down the path, the sound became louder, and the air got warmer. I came to an iron door with a silver lock. The next tunnel was a steeper descent, and made entirely of iron. I came to another door, this time silver, with a gold lock. I used the golden key, and found a small opening just enough to crouch and crawl on my hands and knees. This tunnel was made of what I thought was silver. I did not need a torch, as light seemed to emanate from the air itself, now almost hot, humid. The sound was loud, I felt I was inside some intricate machine, but with a smell like fresh earth and blood. I got to a small door, made of gold, with a lock made of bone. I used a key made of what I could only assume was bone, and opened it.

beyond that final door I entered a massive, subterranean chamber, walls encrusted with all manner of crystals. The floor was earth, but littered with various bones. Some looked human. In the middle of the chamber, propped up on a platform made of all manner of skulls, was the source of the sound.""

There was a long pause before the youngest asked

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk",Great one I've seen these days ago,0

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe. 

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",I hate my job...,7

Tom accepts. He walks up to the front window of the restaurant, snorts, and shoots the largest, stickiest, brownest ball of mucus onto the window. Of course, everyone in the restaurant pushes their plate away. One even throws up! 

Bob hands Tom his $2. However, he says to Tom, ""I bet I could get the $2 back from you.""

The next morning he walked outside and found only an empty hole. He noticed footsteps leading from the hole to the house next door, which was owned by a deaf-mute. On the same street lived a professor who understood sign language and was a friend of the deaf man. Grabbing his pistol, the enraged man went to awaken the professor and dragged him to the deaf man's house. He screamed at the professor: 
""You tell this guy that if he doesn't give me back my money I'll kill him!"" 
The professor conveyed the message to his friend, and his friend replied in sign language: ""I hid it in my backyard, underneath the cherry tree.""

The professor turned to the man with the gun and said: ""He's not going to tell you. He said he'd rather die first.""

As they talked, her robe slipped open, and it was obvious that she had nothing else on. The poor kid broke into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact. After a few minutes, she placed her hand on his arm and said, ""Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming.""
He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely. Now nude, she purred at him, ""What would you say is my best feature?"" Flustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, ""It's got to be your ears!""
Astounded, and a little hurt she asked, ""My ears? Look at these breasts; they are full and 100% natural! I work out every day! My butt is firm and solid! Look at my skin - no blemishes anywhere! How can you think that the best part of my body is my ears?""

They go out into the wilderness and they walk all day, until finally near sunset, they see a large hotel surrounded by nothingness. This is a really big hotel, but it can only fit 500 people, so the more senior nuns got to go inside and sleep the hotel and half of the nuns had to stay outside and sleep on the ground. So they stay the night and in the morning, the nuns come out of the hotel and they find all of their sisters outside had been slaughtered in the night.
Of Course they’re really frightened, but the leader of the nuns, Mother Josephine, insisted that they continue on the pilgrimage. And in the distance, one of the nuns spots a small figure riding away in the direction they must go. So the remaining 500 nuns march away into the wilderness, and they walk all day and near sunset, they find themselves in front of a large mansion, but it’s only big enough to fit 250 people, so again half the nuns have to stay inside. They see no other option for miles around, so reluctantly they chose the most senior nuns to stay in the house while the others stay outside. The next morning, like the one before, the nuns come out to find all of their fellow sisters outside have been killed in the night.
One of the sharper nuns look off into the distance and sees the same figure, and can make out the figure was on top of some sort of pack animal, and again, the figure was going in the same direction as they were going. Some of the nuns wanted to go back, but Mother Josephine said, this is a test of god’s faith in us, we must continue our trek. SO they set off once again into the wilderness, and after a weary day of travel, they manage to find a really large house, big enough to be chosen sat and prayed for the ones outside, and they were very sad to see them left outside in the darkness. But once again, whey they woke up in the morning, they walked outside to find all of their sister dead.
Some of the sisters look off into the distance and they can distinctly see a tall black rider on the back of what appeared to be a camel, going off towards the horizon, closer this time but still far away. They wearily continued their trek through the wasteland and near sunset they find themselves in front of a large cottage, roomy enough for 50 people to stay inside, while the other nuns did what they can to make themselves safe. They dug a ditch around where they were sleeping and filled it with sharpened spikes, and they set up a few nuns as watchers in the night, but all was to no avail for dawn the sun was up, another 50 nuns lay dead outside.
The remaining nuns prayed and buried their dead, and this time they can clearly see a man riding a camel, going off into the distance, with a white turban and a dark blue tunic. They had come too far to give up now, so once again, they set off through the barren wastes to continue their holy mission. Near sundown, they happen upon a large hut, with barely enough room inside to squeeze 25 people into, and this time only the leaders of their order, the ones who had preached and gathered up disciples for years were chosen to sleep inside, while the remaining nuns set up fires and torches to ward off any attack. The nuns inside were very sad to see them at their work for they knew that they were in great danger, and indeed whey dawn broke, those outside were once again found dead.
Shaken, but still faithful, the nuns continue on their journey, and the mysterious figure was even closer than before. They can see him not a mile away, riding away on a camel in the same direction that they were going. When it was nearing dusk, they found an abandoned shack that could only fit 10 people inside. The order’s 10 most faithful nuns were chosen to sleep inside, while the others stood vigil throughout the night, praying god to help them in their time of need, but all they did was for naught for when the sun rose in the east, all those who were outside had met their end.
The remaining 10 nuns were all very old, having been preaching and helping the unfortunate for many, many years, so they made their way more slowly through the desolate land. Throughout the day, they could see the man on the camel, his dark black hair, his billowing robes, the bags on the back of his camel. He was but half a mile in front of them, and always heading in the same direction as they were. Soon, the shadows began to lengthen and just before night fell, they found themselves in front of this tiny lean-to that could just barely fit 5 people inside. They picked the 5 most respected nuns out of them all, most of them founders of their order, the original good souls who had helped so many people. They tearfully said goodbye to one another as the 5 who were not so lucky made a camp for the night. And in the morning, there were 5 fresh corpses to bury.
They continued, their grief was heavy, but their faith kept them strong. The mysterious figure was just a quarter mile away, his long hair blowing in the breeze. They could see the tassels at the end of his saddle, his shiny boots, and his flowing robes that were so light they could have only been made of silk. Together, they marched though the parched landscape, and at night, they found basically a rock with a hole in it large enough for 3 nuns to crawl into. The 5 set down together and decided that Mother Catherine, their eldest, Mother Abigail, their wisest, and Mother Josephine, their leader, was to remain inside. The other 2 bid their farewell and went unafraid into the darkness, strong in their faith. And when dawn broke, they were found dead.
The remaining three nuns, each helping each other, supporting one another, made their way across the ruined countryside. The figure was within hailing distance now, and no matter how they called, he never turned around or made any movement as if he heard anything. But still they continued, though the sun was hot and the going hard. Before long, the sun had almost set and they found themselves in front of a wooden bathroom stall, big enough for barely one non to squeeze into for the night. Mother Catherine said to Mother Josephine, long have I lived in the world, and I have tended many a man who was sick and dying, so I have no fear of death. Please, let me stay outside. Mother Abigail said, long have I pondered over the books in the Monastery, and I know the lord will have mercy on my soul if I die. You are our leader, and you deserve this chance to complete our great task, let me stay outside. So reluctantly, Mother Josephine went inside to spend the night, and in the morning, her two oldest and dearest friends were dead.
And then she turned her head and the mysterious figure was right there, and she yelled at him, STOP! And he did. Mother Josephine then asked him. Are you the one who’s been killing all the nuns?
And he said No.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:

""Guys, I think I fucked up.""",3 guys find a lamp,53

bottom of the Pacific and the concrete and steel it would take!

It will nearly exhaust several natural resources. I can do it, but it is
hard for me to justify your desire for worldly things. Take a little more

that I and all men could understand women; I want to know how she feels
inside, what she's thinking when she gives me the silent treatment, why she
cries, what she means when she says nothing's wrong, why she snaps and
complains when I try to help, and how I can make a woman truly happy.'

After dinner, Little Zachary  sat down to talk with his parents. They wanted to know what made him change so much.

We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.


But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.",Leaked copy of Milania Trump's next public speech...,0

[To the tune of ""American Pie""]


A long, long, time ago
I can still remember when I dialed up their help desk lines.
And I knew if I had the chance
They could make my modem dance
with chats and GIFs and silly pick-up lines.


But Help Desk phone calls made me shiver
with every busy they'd deliver.
Bad news on the front page
A 19-hour outrage.


I can't remember if I cried
when I realized that Steve Case had lied.
But something touched me deep inside
The day the service died.


So bye bye to Amer'ca Online
Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.
And good old geeks are cheering users offline
Saying this'll be the day that they die.
This'll be the day that they die.


Did you write the book of TOS
Will you send your password to PWD-BOSS
If an IM tells you so.
And will you believe the Motley Fool
When he tells you that the service rules
And can you teach me how to Web real slow?
Well I know you sold the service short
Cause I saw your quarterly report.


Steve Case sold off his stock
It fell just like a rock.


It was a crazy, costly high-tech play
As they slashed away at what subscribers pay
And half their users went away
the day the service died.


So bye bye to Amer'ca Online

Well for two days we've been on our own
And dial-ins click on a rolling phone
But that's not how it used to be


When the mogul came to Virginia court
With an OS icon and a browser port
And a desktop that looked like Apple III.


And while Jim Clark was looking down
The mogul stole his thorny crown


The browser war was turned.
Mozilla...was spurned.


And while Steve left users out to bond
With hosts unable to respond
6 million newbies all were conned
the day the service died.

Da Chronic ducked their software guards
And stole a million credit cards
To use accounts he'd gotten free


And so Steve Case went to the FBI
and he told Boardwatch a little lie
That hackers wanted child pornography
But while Steve Case was looking down
The hackers pulled his e-mail down


They put it on the net.
He can't be trusted yet!


And while user cynicism climbs
At sign-on ads and welcome rhymes
They scan their e-mail for ""Good Times""
the day the service died.

Helter-skelter billing needs a melter
The lawyers filed a class-action shelter


Eight million in lawyer's fees.


But it looks like some attorney jibe
an hour if they resubscribe.
To a service marketed for free


Well I KNOW you're raking in the bucks
Cause I'm reading alt.aol-sucks.


""Until we bless the suit
The settlement is moot.""


""If AOL treats you like the Borg
Then visit aolsucks.org
Before some router pulls the cord...""

Bill Razzouk, the head-to-be
sold off his home in Tennessee
And headed for a 4-month end.


Was he sad or just incensed
when Case offered him his thirty cents.
Billing is the devil's only friend.


But as I read him on the page
My hands were clenched in fists of rage.


No ""Welcome"" born in hell
could ring that chatroom bell.


And as chat freaks cried into the night
CompuServe read their last rites.
I saw Earthlink laughing with delight
the day the service died.

I met a girl in Lobby 9
And I asked her if she'd stay on-line.
But she just frowned and looked away.


And I went back to the Member Lounge
To see what loyalty I could scrounge
But Room Host said the members went away...


And on the net the modems scream
At faster speeds and data streams.


And not a tear was spoken.
The hourly fees were broken.


And the three men that I hated most
Ted, and Steve, and Razzouk's ghost
They couldn't dial up the host
The day the service died. ","America Offline [To the tune of ""American Pie""]",2

I then withdrew the cork from the third bottle and poured the whiskey down the sink which I drank.


I pulled the cork from the fourth bottle down the sink and poured the bottle down the glass, which I drank.


I pulled the bottle from the cork of the next and drank one sink out of it, and threw the rest down the glass.


I pulled the sink out of the next glass and poured the cork down the bottle.


Then, I corked the sink with the glass, bottled the drink and drank the pour.


When I had everything emptied, I steadied the house with one hand, counted the glasses, corks, bottles, and sinks with the other, which were twenty-nine, and as the houses came by I counted them again, and finally I had
all the houses in one bottle, which I drank.

""Oh, we could never do that! Wed be too embarrassed!"", responded Mary. ""But after you go, will you please tell me how it went?""

Several weeks passed, and the two friends met for lunch again. ""So how did the sex therapy work out, Linda?"", Mary asked. 

""Things couldnt be better!"", Linda exclaimed. ""We began with a physical exam, and afterward the doctor said he was certain he could help us. He told us to stop at the grocery store on the way home and buy a bunch of grapes and a dozen donuts. He told us to sit on the floor nude, and toss the grapes and donuts at each other. Every grape that went into my vagina, John had to get it out with his tongue. Every donut that I ringed his penis with, I had to eat. Our sex life is wonderful, in fact its better than its ever been!""

With that endorsement Mary talked her husband into an appointment with the same sex therapist. After the physical exams were completed the doctor called Mary and Tom into his office.

On the big day they felt ready. The Japanese won by a mile. The American team was discouraged by the loss and corporate management decided that the reason for the crushing defeat had to be found, so a consulting firm was hired to investigate the problem and recommend corrective action.

The consultant's finding: The Japanese team had eight people rowing and one person steering; the American team had one person rowing and eight people steering.

After a year of study and millions spent analyzing the problem, the consultant firm concluded that the American team had too many people steering and not enough rowing.

As race day neared again the following year, the American team's management structure was completely reorganized.

The new structure: four steering managers, three area steering managers, and a new performance review system for the person rowing the boat to provide a work incentive.

The next year, the Japanese won by two miles. Humiliated, the American corporation laid off the rower for poor performance and gave the managers a bonus for discovering the problem.

EDIT: They outsourced the rowing to China and gave the money they saved to the Clinton Campaign.

The Chief nodded in agreement.

Then the chief leaned back and slowly moved his hand across his chest. By this point, the government official had already realized that this was not Indian Chief Two Beagles at all but American actor and philanthropist Mark Ruffalo, from the critically- acclaimed 2010 dramatic comedy ""The Kids Are All Right.""
