There was only one problem: the captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the magician did every trick. Once he understood, he started shouting in the middle of the show.

""Look, it's not the same hat!"" or ""Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table!"" or ""Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?""

The magician was furious but couldn't do anything. It was, after all, the captain's parrot.

Then one stormy night on the Pacific, the ship unfortunately sank, drowning almost all who were on board. The magician luckily found himself on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea with, and as fate would have it, with the parrot.
They stared at each other with hatred but did not utter a word. This went on for a day... Two days... And then three days.
Finally on the fourth day, the parrot could not hold back any longer and said...

""Okay, I give up. Where's the ship?""

Alan who lived in the north of England, decided to go golfing in Scotland with his buddy, Chris.
So they loaded up Alan's minivan and headed north. 
After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard.
So they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night.
'I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,' she explained, 'and I'm afraid the neighbours will talk if I let you stay in my house.'
'Don't worry,' Alan said. 'We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.'
The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night.
Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of golf.
But about nine months later, Alan got an unexpected letter from an attorney.
It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the golf weekend.
He dropped in on his friend Chris and asked, ""Chris, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our golf holiday in Scotland about 9 months ago ?""
'Yes, I do,' said Chris.
'Did you, er, happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit ?'
'Well, um, yes!,' Chris said, a little embarrassed about being found out, 'I have to admit that I did.'
'And did you happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name ?'
Chris's face turned beet red and he said, 'Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did.' 'Why do you ask ?'
'She just died and left me everything.!!'

And you thought the ending would be different, didn't you ?...

You know you smiled.!!. Now keep that smile for the rest of the day!

The pastor tells them that part of the part of the process involves them undergoing a trial of chastity, and as such that they must refrain from sex for two full weeks. The group goes their separate ways, to return two weeks later.

The pastor welcomes them all back, then turns to each couple individually. To the elderly couple he asks, ""Were you two able to abstain for two weeks?""

The old man replies with a chuckle, ""We certainly were, it wasn't much trouble at all, especially since neither of us can stay awake long after dinner anyway.""

""Fantastic,"" sats the pastor. ""You two are now welcome as new members of our congregation."" He then turns to the middle-aged couple. ""Were you two able to abstain for two weeks as well?""

The husband grins a little sheepishly, though he nods ""I'll admit it was hard, and I had to spend the second week sleeping on the couch, but yes, we did manage it.""

""Wonderful, I'm proud of you both."" Says the pastor,""You are most welcome as members of our congregation."" Then he turns finally to the newlyweds, ""Well, how bout it, you two? Were you able to abstain for two weeks?""

They look at each other embarrassed, then the young man shakes his head with remorse, ""I'm sorry, Pastor, but we just couldn't do it. We made it four days, but on the fifth day I saw my wife reaching up to get a new lightbulb off the shelf. When she dropped it and bent over to pick it up off the ground... Well, the sight was just too much for me, and we had each other right there on the floor.""

The pastor lowers his head in disappointment, saying, ""Well, I understand, but I am afraid that you are not welcome in our congregation now.""

The husband grins and says, ""Oh, that's okay. We're not welcome at the hardware store now either.""",Joining the Congregation,9

Since there were many monkeys in the forest, the villagers caught them and sold them to the man.
As the supply of monkeys diminished, the villagers’ efforts slowed, so the man offered them $20 each.
They renewed their efforts but the supply of monkeys diminished further, so he increased his price to $25.
Soon no one could even find a monkey in the forest.
The man increased his price to $50, but announced, “Since I must go to the city on business, I authorize my assistant to buy monkeys on my behalf.”

The telephone repairman proceeded to the scene, curious to see this psychic dog or senile lady. He climbed a telephone pole, hooked in his test set, and dialed the subscriber's house.

The phone didn't ring right away, but then the dog moaned and the telephone began to ring. Climbing down from the pole, the telephone repairman found:

1. The dog was tied to the telephone system's ground wire with a steel chain and collar.

2. The wire connection to the ground rod was loose.

3. The dog was receiving 90 volts of signaling current when the number was called.

4. After a couple of jolts, the dog would start moaning and then urinate.

5. The wet ground would complete the circuit, thus causing the phone to ring.

I wanted to pass it on in case you haven't heard about it. 

A 'heads up' for those men who may be regular customers at Lowe's, Home Depot, Costco, or even Wal-Mart. This one Caught me totally by surprise. Over the last month, I became a victim of a clever scam while out shopping. Simply going out to get supplies has turned out to be quite traumatic. Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't happen to you or your friends. 

Here's how the scam works; Two nice looking, college-age girls will come over to your car or truck as you are packing your purchases into your vehicle. They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. (It's impossible not to look). When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say 'No' but instead, ask for a ride to McDonald's. Ok, this is when it really gets scary.

You agree and they climb into the vehicle. On the way, they start undressing. Then one of them starts crawling all over you, while the other one steals your wallet.

I had my wallet stolen MAY 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, again on the 17th, 20th, 24th, and the 29th. Also JUNE 1st, 4th, 8th, twice on the 16th &amp;17th, and very likely it will happen again this upcoming weekend.

So tell your friends to be careful. What a horrible way to take advantage of us older men. Warn your friends to be vigilant.

P.S. Wal-Mart has wallets on sale for $2.99 each. I found even cheaper ones for $.99 at the Dollar Store. Also, you never get to eat at McDonald's. I've already lost 11 pounds just running back and forth from Lowe's to Home Depot to Wal-Mart. 

So please, send this on to all the retired men that you know and warn them to be on the lookout for this scam. (The best times are just before lunch and around 4:30 in the afternoon).",New Scam on Senior Men,89

Off we went to our local bar only two blocks from the house.  
I got her a Guinness. She didn't like it, so I drank it.  
Then I got her a Killian's she didn't like that either, so I drank it.  
Finally, I thought she might like some Harp Lager? She didn't. I drank it.  
I thought maybe she'd like whiskey better than beer so we tried a Jameson's; nope!  
In desperation, I had her try that 25 year old Glenfiddich. The bar's finest scotch. She wouldn't even smell it. What could I do but drink it!  
By the time I realized she just didn't like to drink, I was so shit-faced I could hardly push her stroller back home!!!

With nothing to lose and always wanting to see Italy, she accepted.

That night, the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a small but comfortable compartment in the ship's hold.

""What are you doing here?"" asked the captain.
""I have an arrangement with a sailor,"" she replied. ""He brings me food and I get a free trip to Italy.""

Then her conscience got the best of her, and she added, ""Plus, he's screwing me.""

What is politics?

Father answers:

It’s very simple! You see, I bring in the money, so I’m big business . Your mother spends the money, so she’s the government.

Your grandfather sees to it that everything is managed in an orderly way. So he’s the law.

Our maid is the working class.

Everything revolves around your interests, so you’re the people. Your little baby brother represents the future.

The boy has to think it over. That night he hears his little brother crying due to a dirty diaper. He doesn’t know what to do, so he goes to the bedroom of his parents. There his mother is sound asleep. He goes to the bedroom of the maid, but his father is there fucking the maid — and oddly enough his grandfather is watching through the window.

Nobody notices the boy and he returns to his bed.

The next day his father asks him:

So, can you now explain to me what politics is?

The boy says:

Yes, it’s all become clear to me!

Big business screws over the working class while the law watches and the government sleeps. The people are ignored and the future lies in shit.

Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first time.  

The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms.  He tells the pharmacist it's his first time and the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour.  He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex.  At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack.  The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be really going for it....it being his first time and all.  That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents' house and meets his girlfriend at the door.

'Oh,' she said 'I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!'  The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head.

A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head
down. 10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. 
Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, 'I had no idea you were this religious.' 

The boy turns, and whispers back, 'I had no idea your father was a
pharmacist.'

He asks the shop owner about it, and the owner says ""Ah, that's the Wikibird. Not only can it talk, but it knows a lot of useful information. You can ask it anything you want and it will respond.""

The man decides to test out the Wikibird. ""What's the capital of Australia?"" The bird replies ""SQUAWK! Canberra."" 

The man continues, ""Who played Colonel Jessup in *A Few Good Men?*"" 

""SQUAWK! Jack Nicholson.""

The man is really impressed, so he decides to buy the bird and bring it home. He immediately shows it off to his wife, and she puts it to the test.

""Okay, bird, what's the FDA recommend internal temperature for cooking pork?""

""SQUAWK! 145° F.""

The couple tests out their bird for a while, and can't stump it. They decide to throw a party, and have all their guests all the bird questions. The party guests get very creative, too. 

""Hey parrot, what's the ending soliloquy from *A Midsummer Night's Dream*?""

""SQUAWK! If we shadows have offended, think but this and all is mended, that you have but slumbered here, while these visions did appear, and this weak and idle theme, no more yielding than a dream. Gentles, do not reprehend, if you pardon, we will mend, as I am an honest Puck, if we have unearned luck, now to 'scape the serpent's tongue, we will make amends 'ere long, else the Puck a liar call, so good night unto you all.

""Alright, Polly, What's the first sentence of the US Declaration of Independence?""

""SQUAWK!

""Wikibird, how does the John Mulaney 'best meal I ever ate' routine go?""

...and the bird is silent! Not a peep. They try asking again, ""Wikibird, how does the John Mulaney 'best meal I ever ate' routine go?""

Still no response.

Confounded and annoyed, the man turns to the pet shop to complain about the bird's silence. The pet shop owner is also confused about why the bird wouldn't answer. Thinking on his toes, he decides to ask the bird itself why it kept mum.

""Hey, Wikibird. Why didn't you do the John Mulaney bit?""

Harvey and Brett don't appreciate the ""prank"" as much as Kevin does so they call their buddy Jeremy Piven to pick them up. The three head to an open-bathrobe party at Ben Affleck's house

Meanwhile, Kevin is stuck in the ""bar"" but Peyton Manning is too old for him. So he orders a time machine from France, expedited shipping courtesy of Roman Polanski. The time machine arrives and he sets the year to 1991 and initializes the warp, but it malfunctions and Kevin Spacey finds himself in Dustin Hoffman's trailer on the set of Hook. Hoffman is reading his lines in the nude while hair and make-up try not to notice the fact he is furiously masturbating while doing so. Kevin Spacey leaves before things get sticky, and wanders out onto the set. He finds Bryan Singer and Jared Fogle hiding in the bushes eating Subway sandwiches. They are looking over a stolen copy of the script, excited about the fact there are so many child actors playing the lost boys in the film.

Steven Spielberg and Robin Williams show up on set and hear rustling in the bushes. To their horror they find Jared, Kevin and Bryan jerking each other off.. Their arms interlinked in the shape of a pentagram. All three men ejaculate onto the script before Steven and Robin can stop them, and the script bursts into flames while the three morph into giant demons. The pedophile demons begin to destroy the set looking for the lost boys while Robin does some quick thinking.. He gets an idea.. He drags Steven to his trailer... The two consume all of Robin Williams' supply of cocaine in 10 seconds. They actually do so much blow, that they can literally fucking fly.

They battle the three horny horned perverts from hell, Shadow of the Colossus style while the sky turns red and the earth begins to split open. The apocalypse has come. Robin Williams flys his sword right up Jared Fogle's ass and knocks him down the crevice, back to hell. Bryan Singer is no match for the coked out duo and his dick is sliced off by Steven Spielberg in a glorious cinematic ""schiiiiing."" But Spacey is the final boss. They hack away at his junk to no avail.. It has metamorphasised into an Academy Award!

They finally hack it off.. Best supporting actor for Ususal Suspects my ass! But he.. He sprouts another one. Even bigger and shinier! For Best Actor this time.. For 1999's American Beauty! FUCK 

""We can't.. fight him... He's from the future! We don't ...have any academy awards yet!"" Steve Spielberg and Robin shout at each other

The struggle continues until something remarkable happens. Dustin Hoffman's trailer explodes as he grows to 100 feet tall. His giant golden balls clanging together. TWO BEST ACTOR AWARDS! Kramer vs Kramer and Rain man! Oh fuck!!!

He's locked and loaded and been thinking about interns all day, and now he's taking aim at Spacey. ""Whomst interrupted my fap?"" he bellows

""Let's get the fuck out of here!"" Spielberg shouts as he and Robin Willaims fly away. Dustin then unloads a sperm-tsunami that drowns Kevin Spacey, destroying the earth and all of humanity.

But lo and behold, Kevin pulled another Keyser Soze on us, as he floats through the cosmos as celestial pedo-dust.

Extraterrestrial beings pick up the Kevdust via their tractor beam and run him through their materialization lab. They construct a holochemographic version of Kevin Spacey and bring him to their supreme leaders.

""So uhm, do you mind explaining what the fuck happened to earth?"" they ask him.

Kevin Spacey takes a long deep, breath.

The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him. Suddenly a car slowly came towards him and stopped. Desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, he got into the car and closed the door.. only to realize that there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn't on.

The car started moving slowly. He looked at the road ahead and saw a bend approaching. Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. Then, just before the car hit the bend, a hand appeared out of nowhere through the window and turned the wheel. Paralyzed with terror, he watched as the hand came through the window, but never touched or harmed him.

Shortly thereafter he saw the lights from a pub appearing down the road, so, gathering strength, he jumped out of the car and ran towards it. Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and started telling everybody about the horrible experience he just had. 

A silence enveloped the pub when everybody realized he was crying and.... wasn't drunk. 

Suddenly the door opened, and two other people walked in from the dark and stormy night. They were also soaked and out of breath like him. They looked around, and after seeing him sobbing at the bar, one of them said to the other...

After him the co-pilot, who is also blind, boards the plane, greets the passangers, greets the flight crew, enters the cockpit and positions himself infront of the controls.

The pilots taxi the plane towards the runway. They reach the runway. Air control give them permission for take-off. 

The passangers at this point are bewildered by the capabilities of the blind pilots, but everybody has remained silent.

The plane starts accelerating. Everyone is holding tight as nobody has traveled with blind pilots.

Going through a quarter of the runway. The atmosphere is extremely nervous. The flight attendants are looking at eachother with mixed emotions. 

Halfway through the runway, the passangers are feeling very unsettling. One of the flight attendants faints as the plane is building up speed.

Just passing three quarters of the runway and all wheels are still touching the hot asphalt underneath. People start panicking but somehow everybody has remained silent.

Nearing the end of the runway passangers start screaming in fear for their lives. At that moment the pilots pull the nose of the plane up and take off.

The co-pilot says calmly to the pilot:
""One day they are gonna board the mute ones, and we are gonna be screwed.""

They agree, and begin the trial.

The brunette goes first. She manages to stifle her laughs until the fourth step, until she loses it, so God sends her to Hell.

The redhead goes after. She can't even make it through one joke without laughing, so God, disappointingly, sends her to Hell.

Finally, the blonde goes. Somehow, she doesn't laugh at all at the jokes, managing to take every step easily.

She had noticed the man walking around the neighborhood and people dropping stuff into his bucket, she wondered what was going on. She thought maybe it was money for donations, or maybe cans for recycling. Eventually she grew tired of wondering and asked her next door neighbor who that man was and what the people were dropping in his bucket. The neighbor replied “Well that’s The Victor and...” “Woah woah woah, THE Victor?” Questions the woman.  “Yeah that was his high school nick name, he was the quarterback on he team and when he played his team was always the victor.” The woman now understood who he was but still needed to know what ended up in his bucket.

 “To The Victor goes the spoiled.”

-Excuse me, but it looks that both the pilot and the co-pilot are blind, is this a joke? How are they able to pilot? 
To which she answered
-I’m sorry sir, but they are the best and most experienced duo in this Airline and we never had a single problem with them
Then the guy felt a bit relieved but was still nervous and so were the rest of the passengers 
The plane started and went to the runway. The plane started to take speed and it was taking very long to take off. All the passengers started to get very nervous, and the plane kept getting speed and wasn’t taking off, when the plane was almost crashing into the end of the runway everyone panicked and started to scream completely desperate and then the plane finally took off on the last second...
Everyone breathed in relief and felt guilty for doubting the experienced pilot 
After the plane was flying the co-pilot said to the pilot:

When he arrives, he asks his lord if the summons has anything to do with the absence of the workers in the field, and his lord replies that yes, the serfs have begun a revolt, demanding to be paid a wage rather than keeping part of the food they grow.

The knight, scratching his chin for a moment, looks to his lord and frowns.

""I would guess you have called me to put down this revolt, and make sure the fields do not rot at harvest, and I will gladly do so for you are my liege, and have my fealty.""

The knight, given leave by the lord, then prepares his horse and armor, making sure of every strap and buckle, every plate and link, finally mounting his horse, his seven feet of height all the more imposing atop his charger.

Riding into the village near the castle, the knight is quite sure he will be ambushed, but has no worry, trusting his horse and armor to protect him from the knives and farming implements of the peasants...

Sure enough, as he enters the town square, he is set upon from all sides by farmers wielding all sorts of makeshift weapons!  Pitchforks, shovels, picks, and even hoes wave at him, as he slashes them away with his sword, and his horse scatters the mob with its hooves...

Then suddenly, Richard feels his horse rear up and fall backwards, making him tumble from the saddle!  As he climbs upright, he sees a strong peasant with a threshing flail had pushed his horse clean over.  With the rest of the peasants scattered,  Richard closes with the final combatant, whose flail swings in great arcs, striking the knight on his head and body over and over.

Unfortunately for the peasant, Richard, being doughty and strong, and using his great size to absorb the blows, pushes through and with a mighty punch, fells his opponent and rides back to the castle to tell his lord the news of victory.

And friends, the moral of the story is, Sir Banks, in 1008, was simply too big to flail.",1008 AD - A tall knight is summoned by his lord...,6
