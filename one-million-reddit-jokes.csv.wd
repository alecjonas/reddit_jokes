The strippers would at least triple the alcohol sales and get a ""party atmosphere"" going in the cabin. And, of course, every businessman in this country would start flying again, hoping to see naked women.


Because of the tips, female flight attendants wouldn't need a salary, thus saving even more money. Muslims would be afraid to get on the planes for fear of seeing naked women.
 
Hijackings would come to a screeching halt, and the airline industry would see record revenues.  The economy will boom with the extra spending! This is definitely a win- win situation if we handle it right -- a golden opportunity to turn a liability into an asset.
Why didn't Bush or Obama think of this?

I wanted to pass it on in case you haven't heard about it. A 'heads up' for those men who may be regular customers at Lowe's, Home Depot, Costco, or even Wal-Mart. This one caught me totally by surprise. Over the last month I became a victim of a clever scam while out shopping. Simply going out to get supplies has turned out to be quite traumatic. Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't happen to you or your friends. 

 Here's how the scam works; Two nice looking, college-age girls will come over to your car or truck as you are packing your purchases into your vehicle. They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. (It's impossible not to look). When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say 'No' but instead ask for a ride to McDonald's. 

 You agree and they climb into the vehicle. On the way, they start undressing. Then one of them starts crawling all over you, while the other one steals your wallet. 

 I had my wallet stolen Aug. 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, again on the 17th, 20th, 24th, and the 29th. Also Sept. 1st, 4th, 8th, twice on the 16th &amp;17th, and very likely again this upcoming weekend. 

 So tell your friends to be careful. What a horrible way to take advantage of us older men. Warn your friends to be vigilant. 

 Wal-Mart has wallets on sale for $2.99 each. I found even cheaper ones for $.99 at the Dollar Store and bought them out in three of their stores. 

 Also, you never get to eat at McDonald's. I've already lost 11 pounds just running back and forth from Lowe's, to Home Depot, to Wal-Mart.

 encountered a spotted owl that attacked her. 

 In her haste to escape, the woman slid down the tree to the ground and got many 
 splinters in her crotch. In considerable pain, she hurried to a local ER to see a doctor. She told him she was an environmentalist, a Democrat, an anti-hunter and how she came to get all the splinters. The doctor listened to her story with great patience, and then told her to go wait in the examining room and he would see if he could help her. She sat and waited three hours before the doctor reappeared. 

 The angry woman demanded, ""What took you so long?"" He smiled and then told her, ""Well, I had to get permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management before I could remove old-growth timber from a ""recreational area"" so close to a waste treatment facility.

After a home run was hit, the doctor yelled, ""Cheer Nuts"". They all brokeout into applause and cheered.
When the umpire made a particularly bad call against the star of the home team, the Doctor yelled, ""Booooo Nuts!!!"" and they all started booing.
Thinking things were going very well. The doctor decided to go get a beer and a hot dog, leaving his assistant in charge.
When he returned, there was a riot in progress. Finding his assistant, the doctor asked,"" What in the world happened? ""
The assistant replied, ""Well, everything was going just fine till a vendor passed by and yelled PEANUTS!""",The Old Ball Game,148

'There's something wrong with my dick', he replied.

The receptionist became irritated and said, 'You shouldn't come into a crowded waiting room and say things like that.'

'Why not, you asked me what was wrong and I told you,' he said.

The Receptionist replied; 'Now you've caused some embarrassment in this room full of people. You should have said there is something wrong with your ear or something, and discussed the problem further with the Doctor in private.'

The man replied, 'You shouldn't ask people questions in a roomful of strangers if the answer could embarrass anyone.

The man then decided to walk out, waited several minutes, and then re-entered.

The Receptionist smiled smugly and asked, 'Yes??'

'There's something wrong with my ear,' he stated.

In Albuquerque, New Mexico, a chemistry teacher named Rick was sad and poor since he discovered that he had prostrate cancer and decided that he needed to make some money. He decided to enter the illegal Pixar business. 

After going to his great-great-grandpa's house and finding a box full of Pixar movies, Rick made a huge fortune selling them in the black market.

Eventually, he enlisted a former student of his, Jessie Purpleguy. This guy had a bunch of connections and all that, and the two made an even larger fortune selling Pixar movies.

They then got caught up with an insane Pixar dealer named Taco Salamander, who beat one of his workers to death for no reason. Taco was shot in the face by Rick's CIA cousin Honk. 

They then got caught up with Goose Fling, a Chilean man that owned a grilled chicken restaurant. Goose was also an undercover Pixar film kingpin, and he amassed an even larger fortune for Rick and Jessie.

Eventually, Rick blew Goose's face off by attaching a bomb to some old guy in a wheelchair. 

Finally, Rick killed Michael, Goose's old assistant, and then had nine guys killed in prison by some neo-Nazi guys.

When the Nazis killed his brother-in-law Honk and took his money, he got revenge by creating a remote-controlled machine gun and shooting them all.

In the end, Rick decided to start his Pixar business all over again. All he had now was a stack consisting of three Pixar movies. He sighed and went to work selling them.

Eventually, he fell in love with one of the movies. He refused to sell this movie to anyone, even though it was worth a lot. When someone asked to purchase that movie, he said:

Researchers for the Swansea Authority found over 200 dead crows near M4 recently, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu. A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.

However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.

An Ornithological Behaviorist was called to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.

The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.

The scientific conclusion was that while all the lookout crows could say ""Cah"", none could say ""Lorry.""

Little Johnny solemnly replies, ""No.""

So his grandfather goes, ""Well then you're not old enough to have a beer.""

After another little while, little Johnny reaches into his bag and pulls out a little baggie of delicious looking chocolate chip cookies, and starts eating them.

Before they are all gone his grandfather asks, ""Hey can I have one of those cookies?  They sure look good!""

So naturally, little Johnny replies with his own question, ""Can you touch your dick to your asshole?""

The grandfather proudly replies, ""I MOST CERTAINLY CAN!""

So little Johnny then replies, ""Well then go fuck yourself!  These are my cookies!""",Little Johnny and his Grandfather,3

He goes to the limo rental place, but there is a HUGE limo lime. He sighs once again and goes to the back of the line.

The next day, he takes his girlfriend to the prom, which is taking place in the high school's gymnasium, and has an excellent time.

The young man replied,
Well your Honor, it was like this: When the lady got on the bus, I couldn't help but notice her condition. She sat down under a sign that said, ""The Double Mint Twins are coming"" and I grinned. Then she moved and sat under a sign that said, ""Logan's Liniment will reduce the swelling"", and I had to smile.

He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, grey beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?""

""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.""

""Ok,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house.

Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy.

He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.""

""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.""

In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder.

As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.""

When they reach the age of 12, the shorter boy is astonished to see that his brother is almost four inches taller than he is, even though they're twins!

So the shorter boy confronts his twin brother, asking, ""How is it that we're twins, yet you're so much taller than I am?  Is it something you're eating, or an exercise you're doing, or what??""  The taller boy replies, ""Well, I have a secret way of increasing my height.""  ""I thought so,"" said the shorter twin.  ""What is this secret of yours?""  The taller boy says, ""Well, every night before going to bed I grease up my legs so they're nice and slippery, and then I sleep with my legs hanging over the end of the bed.  Gravity pulls down on my legs, and since they are so slippery they ever-so-gradually stretch down toward the floor.""

So the shorter twin does exactly what his brother told him, and does it faithfully every night.  Yet when they reached the age of 14, he is dumbfounded by the fact that his twin brother is now a whopping six inches taller than he is!  So he confronts him again and says, ""You're still shooting up like a weed, and I'm not catching up to you at all, yet I have been doing exactly what you said...what gives??""  The taller twin says, ""Tell me...what have you been using to grease your legs up?""  The shorter twin says, ""Well, I've been using Crisco...it's the only thing I could find.""

She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand.. 

Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. 

She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk.

He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.

For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well 

Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, ""You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels."" The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. 

One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. 

Two o'clock and no hired hand.

Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. 

She quietly called him over to her.. 

""Unbutton my blouse and take it off,"" she said. 

Trembling, he did as she directed. ""Now take off my boots."" 

He did as she asked, ever so slowly. ""Now take off my socks."" 
He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. 

""Now take off my skirt."" 

He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. 

""Now take off my bra.."" Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor. 

Then she looked at him and said, ""If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.""

He’s exhausted his food and water supplies and is starving. When he thinks he just can’t go on, he finds himself surrounded by a tribe of cannibals, all with huge loin-cloths that can’t hide their even huge dicks. The man is taken to the village, given food and water, and is then brought before the chieftain. The chief, who has the largest dick in the village, says to him: “Right, white man. We are going to give you a choice. You can either be roasted and eaten alive or experience Unga Bunga.”

The man, obviously not stupid, first asks what Unga Bunga is. “It consists of being fucked in the ass by all members of the tribe, white man,” the chief replies with a huge grin.

After thinking it over, the man decides to go for the butt-fuck. So he kneels down and all the men line up behind him and fuck him till he’s screaming with pain. After a couple of hours the torture stops and the man is free to go. Bleeding from his ass he crawls off into the rainforest. A couple of days later he’s lost. No food, no water. His ass has healed by now, but what good will that do him?

At night he’s discovered by another tribe, who take him to their village. Again he is given the choice between death and Unga Bunga. And again, after much consideration, he chooses Unga Bunga. All night long the cannibals have their way with him and in the morning he’s free to go. The next day the man – lost, starving and about to die is AGAIN taken capture, this time by a tribe with dicks that touch the ground. AGAIN he’s given the choice: death or Unga Bunga. Deciding he’s had enough and won’t be raped again, the man says to the chief: “Go ahead. Burn me, eat me. I’m ready to die.” The chief, much impressed by the man’s bravery, replies: “All right, white man. But first…..

Finally, the lion had an idea. ""I know a really exciting game that the humans play called football. I've seen it on T.V.""

He proceeded to describe it to the rest of the animals and they all got excited about it so they decided to play. They went out to the field and chose up teams and were ready to begin.

The lion's team received. They were able to get two first downs and then had to punt. The mule punted and the rhino was back deep for the kick.

He caught the ball, lowered his head and charged. First, he crushed a roadrunner, then two rabbits. He gored a wildebeast, knocked over two cows, and broke through to daylight, scoring six. Unfortunately, they lacked a placekicker, and the score remained 6 - 0.


Late in the first half the lion's team scored a touchdown and the mule kicked the extra point. The lion's team led at halftime 7 - 6. In the locker room, the lion gave a peptalk. ""Look you guys. We can win this game. We've got the lead and they only have one real threat. We've got to keep the ball away from the rhino, he's a killer. Mule, when you kick off be sure to keep it away from the rhino.""

The second half began.

Just as the mule was about to kick off, the rhino's team changed formation and the ball went directly to the rhino. Once again, the rhino lowered his head and was off running. First, he stomped two gazelles. He skewered a zebra, and bulldozed an elephant out of the way. It looked like he was home free. Suddenly at the twenty yard line, he dropped over dead.

There were no other animals in sight anywhere near him. The lion went over to see what had happened.

Right next to the dead rhino he saw a small centipede.
""Did you do this?"" he asked the centipede.

""Yeah, I did."" the centipede replied.

 We were chatting about our relationships and decided to amaze our men by greeting them at the door wearing a black bra, stiletto heels and a mask over our eyes. We agreed to meet in a few days to exchange notes. 

 Here's how it all went..... 

 My Engaged Friend: 
 The other night when my boyfriend came over he found me with a black leather bodice, tall stilettos and a mask. He saw me and said, 'You are the woman of my dreams. I love you.' Then we made passionate love all night long. 

 The Mistress: 
 Me too! The other night I met my lover at his office and I was wearing a raincoat, under it only the black bra, heels and mask over my eyes. When I opened the raincoat he didn't say a word, but he started to tremble and we had wild sex all night. 

 Then I Had To Share My Story: 
 When my husband came home I was wearing the black bra, black stockings, stilettos and a mask over my eyes. When he came in the door and saw me he said....

Now the Dougs, who were as eccentric as they were superstitious, each brought along to the auction identical live pygmy bunnies in their pockets (in lieu of lucky rabbit's feet). When the two Dougs got to the auction they would be recognized by the auctioneer almost immediately, for not only were they strikingly identical, but more importantly the auctioneer knew them both to be incredibly big spenders so long as they had their lucky rabbits in their pockets, and therefore every effort was made to accommodate the twins as soon as they walked in the door. If the rabbits should get loose (which happened more often than not) the auction would immediately be halted until the correct rabbit was returned to the correct owner's pocket. That particular night when the Dougs arrived Demi Moore was holding a charity auction, so when the auctioneer saw the Dougs, bunnies in pocket, he knew it would be a huge success. No less than a minute after one of the Dougs made his first bid both rabbits, having been stuffed into the respective farmers' hot pockets all day, simultaneously jumped out and began skittering free all around the auction house. The regular patrons scrambled about to help find the rabbits, for they too understood that the auction could not continue until the correct rabbit was returned to the correct Doug. Even Demi Moore herself got on her hands and knees searching for them; and just as quickly as she began, she stood up holding one of the tiny rabbits, the likelihood of this bizarre situation having been explained to her beforehand. Still sweating and disheveled from the effort, she asked, ""Which Doug does this rabbit belong to?"" and before anyone could answer, the auctioneer (having immediately recognized this particular leporidae) exclaimed, ""it's the hare of the Doug that bid, Demi!""",A Tale of Two Dougs.,0

Meaning to find the location of the captives' comrades, the captors tie up the Spaniard and drag him to their interrogation chamber, and demand that he give up his fellow soldiers.  

The Spaniard, betraying a longstanding military tradition of bravery and courage, gives up his friends almost immediately.  Shamed, he is returned to his cell and the Frenchman is tied up and brought in.  

The Frenchman, shirking an untrue and unfair modern stereotype, endures a full hour of ruthless torture, completely bound and powerless to resist.  History would not condemn the fact that he relented after lasting so long.  The captors release him, binding the Italian and taking him off on the way out.  

With this Italian, captors can't find a method of physical brutality strong enough for him to utter even a peep.  After four grueling hours, even the captors are tired, and return the Italian's broken but barely living body to his cell, loosening his restraints and tossing him naked onto the floor.

Realizing what he's said, he walks away from the counter in shame and explains what happened to the other priests. 

After a long laugh, the middle-aged priest offers to buy the tickets, seeing as the young priest couldn't muster up the courage to go back. The middle-age priest also notices the woman's large rack, and proceeds with the transaction. ""Hello ma'am!

The professor, booms into the mic, ""Would you rather I condemned half the patients to their deaths?"" to which the medical student replied, ""Which half?""

Or something like that. I tried Googling this but couldn't find a version of it. I was hoping that some of you could either find this joke (is it a joke?) or craft it a bit for a good telling.

Not sure if this is the right place, way of posting this but I thought I'd give it a try.","Looking for a specific joke about research, control subjects, etc.",1

Everyone's passwords were purged and new ones needed to be implemented. As a bonus to help employees with the grumbling there was an award for the strongest password that was used without problem since the last audit. The Auditor looked at the list and was surprised to find one of their more infamous employees (among those in the I.T. department) had succeeded in having and successfully using the strongest password among all in the company. Even stronger then those in the I.T. department. In fact, even the Auditor's own password (which was thought to be very secure) apparently paled in strength compared to the Blonde's according to the log. The Auditor had to know why. After all, this was in fact the same blonde that microwaved a frozen laptop, tried to make a cordless mouse with the use of scissors, and submitted a repair ticket over the lack of an ""any key"" on the standard issue keyboard. The auditor approached the blondes workstation. 

*Auditor*: Alright, I have to know, what is your old password? Since you had to change it, it is alright.

The blonde thinks for a moment

*Blonde*: PlutoAlvinScroogeSimbaWall-eOliverRapunzelDumboOklahomaCity

*Auditor*:The first part makes sense, in a way, good way to remember, I guess, but why Oklahoma City?

The blonde, eyes rolling, puts down the white out and sighs.

""That's interesting, never heard of anything like that before. Do you think you could do it for me?"" says the doctor.

The guy says, ""Sure."" And sure enough, the doctor hears ""HONDA"". 

After several attempts to figure out what's wrong with this guy, the doctor runs out of ideas. He sends him to all sorts of stomach 
specialists and none of them can figure out why this guy's farts say ""HONDA."" It is a completely out-of-this-world medical condition. 

Finally, as a last resort, the doctors think they should send the man to a dentist. After explaining the problem to the dentist, the dentist opened up the guy's mouth and examined it. 

The dentist says, ""A-haa! I have solved the problem!"" 

The patient says, ""What is it? What is it? Please tell me doc""

The dentist replies, ""Well, sir, you have an abscessed tooth."" 

The guy says, ""Yeah? So? What does that have to do with my farts?"" 

""Cant you see?"" the dentist replies. ""Abscess Makes The Fart Go 
HONDA.""

The other day I went up to a local Christian bookstore and saw a ""honk if you love Jesus"" bumper sticker. I was feeling particularly sassy that day because I had just come from a thrilling choir performance, followed by a thunderous prayer meeting, so I bought the sticker and put it on my bumper.

Boy, I'm glad I did! What an uplifting experience that followed! I was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord and how good He is... and I didn't notice that the light had changed. It is a good thing someone else loves Jesus because if he hadn't honked, I'd never have noticed! I found that LOTS of people love Jesus!

Why, while I was sitting there, the guy behind started honking like crazy, and then he leaned out of his window and screamed, ""For the love of GOD! GO! GO! Jesus Christ, GO!"" What an exuberant cheerleader he was for Jesus!

Everyone started honking! I just leaned out of my window and started waving and smiling at all these loving people. I even honked my horn a few times to share in the celebration. There must have been a man from Florida back there because I
heard him yelling something about a ""sunny beach""...

I saw another guy waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. Then I asked my teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant, he said that it was probably a Hawaiian good luck sign or something. Well, I've never met anyone from Hawaii, so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back. My grandson burst out laughing... why, even he was enjoying this religious experience!

A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me. I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I attended, but this is when I noticed the light had changed. So, I waved to all my sisters and brothers grinning, and drove on through the intersection.

I noticed I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again. I felt kind of sad that I had to leave them after all the love we had shared, so I slowed the car down, leaned out of the window and gave them all the Hawaiian good  luck sign one last time as I drove away.

Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks!

If you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a package, because you're sure not picking anything up.


Rule Two:

You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.


Rule Three:

I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I propose his compromise: You may come to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will not object. However, in order to ensure that your clothes do not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter, I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in place to your waist.


Rule Four:

I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing a ""barrier method"" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate, when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.


Rule Five:

It is usually understood that in order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is ""early.""


Rule Six:

I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make you cry.


Rule Seven:

As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process that can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something useful, like changing the oil in my car?


Rule Eight:

The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns within eyesight. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka - zipped up to her throat. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which features chain saws are okay. Hockey games are okay. Old folks homes are better.

Rule Nine:

Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a potbellied, balding, middle-aged, dimwitted has-been. But on issues relating to my daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless god of your universe. If I ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a shovel, and five acres behind the house. Do not trifle with me.

Rule Ten:

Be afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice paddy near Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the voices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveway you should exit your car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter home safely and early, then return to your car - there is no need for you to come inside. The camouflaged face at the window is mine.",Ten Simple Rules for Dating My Daughter,1
